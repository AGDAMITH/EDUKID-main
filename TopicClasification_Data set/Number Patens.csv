Number Partens,KSrnZMAfwTM,So let's say I have tables where
,,I can fit one person at either of the short ends of the table. So I could fit one person there. I could fit one person there. You could view this as we're
,,looking from above the table here. So we could put one
,,person at either of the short ends of the table. And then on these longer
,,"ends right over here, we can fit two people. We can fit two people"
,,"at the longer end. So when you have one table,"
,,"you could fit one, two, three, four, five, six people. You could fit six people. Now let's think"
,,about what happens as we add tables end to end
,,to this table right over here. So let's imagine now two tables. So here we have
,,"one table, and it's going to touch ends with"
,,this table right over here. And because it touches
,,ends right over here-- we're making it one
,,big continuous table-- you can't fit
,,someone here anymore. So now how many
,,"people can we fit? Let's see. We can fit one, two,"
,,"three, four, five. And then on this table,"
,,"which is identical, you could fit six,"
,,"seven, eight, nine. And then you could"
,,put one person at the end right over here. So when you have two
,,"tables end to end, you can fit a"
,,total of 10 people. Let's keep going and see if we
,,can think of a pattern here. So let's put three
,,"tables here-- so one table, two tables,"
,,"and three tables. So just as before, we"
,,"could put one at each end. So that's two people. Then we have 3, 4, 5, 6,"
,,"7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 folks-- 14 folks. So what does it look"
,,like is happening here. Well if you just
,,"look at the numbers, we went from 6 to 10 to 14. It looks like we're adding four"
,,people every time we actually add a table. Now does that
,,actually makes sense? So let's think about
,,this first situation. Let's imagine these
,,"are real people, and I'll make this person"
,,in blue right over here. If you were to bring
,,"over this new table, if you bring over table"
,,two-- so this is table one-- this blue person has to move. And so where could they move? Let's say that
,,they always insist on sitting at the
,,end of a table. So the blue person moves to
,,the new end of the table. They move right over here. So how many new people could
,,move to this combined table now that you brought
,,this second table in? Well the new people I will
,,do in this purple color. The new people are
,,that person-- let me do it in a more unique
,,"color-- this person, this person, this"
,,"person, and this person. So you were able to add four"
,,new people with the new table. One way to think about
,,it is a new table is going to have
,,one usable end here. That usable end is going to
,,be taken by the person who was already at the usable end
,,of when you had less tables. And so the real addition
,,is the two sides here. So you're adding four people
,,"every time you add a table. So it makes complete sense. So based on this, you"
,,"could think about, without even having to draw"
,,"these diagrams, how many people you would be able to fit"
,,"if you had four or five or six or however many tables. So you could imagine,"
,,"if you have four tables, we just have to"
,,"add four, and you should be able to sit 18 people. If you have five"
,,"tables, you should be able to fit 22 people"
,,and on and on and on.

Number Partens,flXVRy1hjf4,hello grade 8 children today I am here to teach you mathematics relevant to your textbook so what's the first unit in your textbook that's called number patterns so 
,,this is an interesting topic and we'll create number patterns using numbers so let's take 1 2 3 what are those those are digits so here we call these are counting numbers as well counting numbers so one two three like that we can't write all numbers so that's why we put three dots after this so if any pattern if you can't write 
,,it all you have to put three dots we can create different number patterns from these counting numbers so let's take different patterns check the first one one three 
,,five seven nine what are those we call these are odd numbers numbers less than ten only if you take odd numbers you have to write down 11 13 like that but this is the number set less than check so that's why here we put curly brackets and write down 1 1 3 5 7 9 so here you can't see 3 dots this is not continuing now we can find 
,,a next term by adding 2 to the previous so here how do you get 3 from 1 we can add 2 3 plus 2 you get 5 5 + 2 7 7 + 2 9 so since the exact number of terms in this number pattern can be specified therefore it is a finite number time so here certain numbers are there so remember this term finite number pad tick the same thing 1 3 
,,5 7 9 odd numbers less than 10 in this number pattern what's the first term the first number in the number pattern we call the first term so in this one what's the first term second term is 3 third term five fourth term seven and fifth term is now let's take these numbers 2 4 6 8 10 12 what are those those are even numbers so we can divide these numbers by 2 the remainder is 0 so here you see two three dots that means this number pattern continues what you call that that's called in finite 
,,number pattern so what's the first term in this sequence or number buggy that's 2 the second term is 4 36 4 8 and the fifth term so you know how to identify terms in the number pad and what are the two words you learn finite number pattern L in finite number pattern let's take this one 5 8 11 14 17 so when you take two numbers next to each other what do you call that consecutive term so here 5 & 8 are consecutive terms when you take 8 and 11 those are also consecutive terms so you can take 
,,any 2 you can take any two terms next to each other those are called consecutive terms so 14 and 17 also consecutive terms so we'll take that one and see the pattern how you get a it from five we need to add three 8 plus 3 you get 11 11 plus 3 14 14 plus 370 so how can we find out this number so you can take any two terms consecutive terms in the number pattern if you take this is the next term and the one before that that's called previous term we can take the difference so how do you get 
,,this number 11 minus 8 or 8 minus 5 so what you call that number common difference so you are learning another term that's common difference how you get the common difference you need two consecutive terms and take the difference when you are taking the difference don't subtract 5 minus 8 that's wrong so next term minus the previous term so we'll do that so you can either take 8 minus 5 Oh 11 minus 8 you are getting same answer or 14 minus 11 or 17-14 so that's how we find out the common difference let's take this one find the common difference of the following number pattern's now you know we can take the difference between two consecutive terms so you can take any two numbers so I'll take these two then what's the difference 16 minus 12 you get this one what's the common difference these two 36 minus 30 that's six when you take these two twenty minus ten that's ten look at this question write down the first five terms of the following number patterns you have given the first term and the common differences you can start from the first seven common difference is three means you need to add three to the previous term 7 + 3 10 10 plus 3 13 13 plus 3 16 16 plus 3 19 one two three four five and you can put three dots to show that it is continuing next one first term is 14 then common difference is plus four means adding four to the previous one four plus 14 plus 480 18 plus four 22 22 plus four 26 26 plus four 30 next one first term six and common difference six so that means multiples of six so starting from 6 6 plus 6 12 12 plus 6 18 18 plus 6 24 24 plus 6/13 this one first term is 12 and the common difference is eight at eight to that 12 plus 8 20 20 plus eight twenty eight twenty eight plus eight 36 36 Plus eight forty four one two three four five can put three dots after that look at this one right down the next two terms of the following sequences so you need to identify the pattern 712 so what's the common difference 12 minus 7 adding fine so that means in this number pattern the common difference is +5 so that means add 5 to that 27 plus 5 32 32 + 5 30 silver this one identify the common difference first you get server last 7 so what you do 41 is the last term so you add 7 to that you get 48 48 plus 750 this one what's the common difference how do you get 12 from 9 adding 3 let me you can start from here 21 plus three twenty four twenty four plus three twenty seven this Molly plus five 16 plus five you get 20 bar then you can 
,,start from here 36 plus five 41 41 plus five 46 this one have you get thirty from twenty four adding six to that so that means 48 plus 6 54 54 plus six that's 60 this one following number pattern is created multiplied the previous term by 2 now this is multiplication 2 times 2 you get 4 4 times 2 8 8 times 2 16 16 times 2 32 so 
,,this is the number pattern so I can write this one starting from 2 4 8 16 32 now look at this 1 2 4 8 10 20 a different number pattern following number pattern is created first added to and then multiplied by 2 so added to 2 plus 2 you get 4 times 2 8 then adding 2 8 plus 2 10 10 times 2 20 so this is also another number pattern so 2 4 8 10 20 now look at these so first 3 terms are the same but fourth term and fifth term those are different so from these two patterns we observed even though the first 3 terms are the same can create different number patterns so same for three terms but you can create different number pants now look at this one added 3 to the previous term 3 plus 3 you get 6 6 plus 3 9 9 plus 3 12 12 plus 3 15 so here what are the numbers three six nine twelve fifteen now first three terms are the same 369 but this is 18 and 21 so how can you create that pattern first multiplied by two and then added three multiplied by two you get six then added 3 6 plus 3 9 then multiplied by 2 again 9 times 2 18 18 plus 3 21 so this one is 3 6 9 18 21 so first three terms are the same but you can create different number patterns fill in the blanks to generate different number patterns so what can we do hi plus 5 10 10 plus 5 15 that means adding 5 15 20 25 30 look at this one you can do another partner we can do multiply by 2 and add 5 5 times 2 10 10 plus 5 15 and what's the next number 15 times 2 30 30 plus 5 35 35 times 2 you get 70 this one 7 14 21 multiples of server so that means adding 7 to that so 21 plus seven twenty eight twenty eight plus seven 35 35 plus 7 42 now create another number pattern different one see first three terms try to create another one this one I can do multiply by 2 and then add 7 multiplied by 2 first and then at 7 so multiply by 221 times 242 add seven more T naught now again x - 2 times 9 18 so 2 times 9 18 2 times 4 8 + 1 98 now we'll discuss what is general term of the number pattern take this number pattern two four six eight ten twelve means even numbers so you want to write down the general term of the multiples of two now we'll try to do that so term number term and pattern okay what's the first term in this sequence or number pattern that's how can I write down two I can write 1 times 2 or 2 times 1 second term second term is 4 
,,try to write down number 4 - x - third term 6 what's the pattern I can write this one as 2 times 3/4 1 8 2 times 4 now see your pattern 10th term I need no tense term so 10th term is what 2 times 10 by looking at the pattern we can get 2 times 10 because first term is 2 times 1 second term is 2 times 2 so temp term 2 times 10 that's 20 then what about nth term n means any term I can write 2 times N or when you write without this multiplication I can write - so what's the enter to win we call this as general term so nth term is the general term of the number pattern so what you can write for multiples of Oh general term is 2 what are the numbers for n you have to start from one n equals 1 first term in equals 2 second term so likewise when you substitute in values we can find out any term so you need general term to find out the terms now what are these numbers 3 6 9 12 15 18 multiples of 3 write down the general term of the multiples of 3 so we'll try to do the same thing like before first term first term is 3 what's the pattern I can write 3 times second term is 6 3 times 2 this number and this one is the same third one 9 3 times 3/4 1 
,,12 3 times 4 then what about temperature I can write 3 times 10 that becomes 30 and what about the general term nth term three times in oh I can write down three so 
,,what's the general term of multiples of 3 is 3 and so I can write down this one as 3 n so we found out the general pattern for multiples of 2 that's 2 it general term for multiples of 3 that's 3 n now this one feel the table below by observing the previous pattern multiples of 2 2 multiples of three general term is 3/8 can you identify then what about multiples of four that's foreign so you saw the patent two three four what about multiples are fired five multiples of 7 this is 7 in multiples of chain chain in and multiples of 11 obviously that's a lemon now the reverse process finding terms using general term if you know the general term how can we find out these terms so in this example first three terms first three terms means N equals one N equals two and in equals three so what you do take the general term substitute one for first term that's three to get the second term you substitute n equal to 3 times 2 6 when N equals 3 you get the third term so that's what about tenth term general term is trillion so tenth term is 3 times 10 that's previous question which tell me 60 now the end term is given 60 and you are asked to find out what's the end value so what you do we equate general term is trillion and that's equal to 60 then how you solve this you can divide this by 3 to get in so 60 divided by 3 what you get n equals 60 divided by 3 you get 20 so 20th term is 60 or in other words we can say 20 multiple of 3 is 60 now the general term is given as 5 in you are asked to find out for three terms 11th term and which term is 75 so what you do for the first three you substitute N equals 1 you get the first term N equals 2 
,,you get the second term M equals 3 you get the good so 5 10 15 are the first three terms and then 11th term next one you are asked to find out the 11th term so how we find out the LMR term substitute 11 so 5 times 11 you get 55 so 11th term is 55 this one the third part which term is 75 means nth term is given 75 so you equate in term is 5 in general term that's equal to 75 so how you find out n divided by 5 75 divided by 5 you get 15 so 15 multiple of 5 is 75 this one you have given the general term is 11 find the 10th term so how you find out the 10th term substitute 10 for and 10th term is equal to 11 times 10 hundred 10 next 120th term so what you 
,,do substitute N equals 20 general term is 11 and that's given and you asked to find out the 20th term substitute in s 20 multiplied by 2 you get 22 put 1 0 220 this 
,,one the third part which term is 121 now the reverse process you'd have given the in term you also find out the in value and the fourth part also same way you asked 
,,to find out which term is 77 so we'll do that substitute then to get n you divide by 11 get 11 for it so 11th term is 121 what about 77 when you divide by 11 you get in ass so so seventh term is 77 fill in the blanks now you have given different number patterns and you asked to write down the first term and the change Roger so observe the first one four eight twelve sixteen multiples of four that means addition multiples are four that means adding four what's the first term for what's the general term for em then 9 18 27 36 multiples of 9 starting from 9 9 18 27 36 so what's the general term 9 in 1 2 3 4 this is also number pattern but you're adding 1 
,,to that so what's the general term starting from 1 we can write 1 in 8 16 24 those are multiples of 8 starting from 8 so the general term is a 10 identify this multiples of 12 starting from 12 you can write 12 in 1 3 5 7 9 11 find the general term for odd numbers what are even numbers 2 4 6 8 so we found out the general pattern 
,,for even numbers multiples of 2 what's that that's 2 in now we'll try to find out the general term for odd numbers what's the first term if it's even numbers what's 
,,the first term but in our pattern the first term is 1 so what can you see you have to subtract 1 to get this one second term even numbers when you consider the second term is 4 but in this one that's 3 how you get 3 from 4 4 minus 1 third term for the even pattern six this one five you can subtract and get five one from the term fourth term is eight for even numbers in this one seven 8 minus 1 is 7 tenth term you get 2 times 10 20 odd numbers what's the 10th term one less than that so we observed a pattern one less than that so I can write 20 minus 1 that's 19 xx - 2 times 20 that's 40 but we know that's this is 1 less than that this is 39 so what's the general term we found out general term for even numbers that's 2 in so what's the pattern 2 n minus 1 so we can straightaway find out the general term for odd numbers that's 2 n minus 1 we can get odd numbers by subtracting 1 from all even numbers so remember now what's the general term for odd numbers 2 n minus 1 using that now we'll try to find our 23rd odd number to do that you need to know the general term so what's the general term for numbers 2 n minus 1 if you want twenty third term you substitute N equals 23 so 2 times 23 minus 1 so what's that you get 46 minus 1 forty hi 45th so what it means here 23rd odd number is 45 find the 36th odd number so what's the general term for numbers to win - what if you want 36 substitute 36 for in 2 times 6 12 1 remaining 2 times 3 6 + 1 7 72 minus 1 you get 71 36th odd number is 71 find the 18th odd number so what's the general term 2 n minus 1 18 term you substitute 18 for 2 times 8 16 1 remaining so 36 minus 1 you get 35 18th odd number is 35 which odd number 33 now the reverse process we know the general term is 2n minus 1 for numbers so we can substitute to win minus 1 is equal to 33 now 
,,is that linear equation simple algebraic equation you know already how to solve that so what you do you can get rid of this minus 1 by you can get rid of this minus 
,,one by adding 133 plus one so what you get here 34 is equal to two it to get em you can divide this by two so when you do that you can get n m equals 2 times 1 2 4 14 that's 7 so 17th odd number is 33 which odd number is 81 now you need to get the general term so what's general term general term is 2 n minus 1 now that's equal to 81 now solve that equation Advan first to get rid of this minus 1 you get 82 is equal to 2 in then you need to divide this by 2 to get n N equals 41 so 41 or term 
,,is 81 which odd term is 17 same thing take the general term equal to 70 get rid of this minus 1 that means adding 1 you get 18 is equal to 2 in then divide by 2 what you get you get 9/9 odd number is 17 now you need to know what R square are numbers so look at this diagram starting from 1 then 2 rows and 2 columns you can create a square so two times two that's four then three rows and three columns you can create the next square number four rows and four columns you can get their next one 
,,now we'll try to find out the general term for square numbers here is the pattern of circles forming squares which lengths and widths are the same what's the first term that's one second term for we'll try to write down the pattern first term I can write one times one second terms I can write 2 times two third term nine that's three times three if it's eight eighth term I can write by looking at this pattern eight times eight what's that 69 tell nine times nine that's 81 then what about enter this should be n times in so n times n you can write down as in squared so what's the general term for square numbers you can take as in squared now using the general term of the square number can you find the tenth square number so what's the generator in squared 10th term means we substitute check ten square are same as ten times ten you get hundred so tenth square number is 100 this one find the 12 square how you do take the general term n squared and it's not stood 12 12 times 12 that's unread 44 so 12 square number is 144 find the 15 square number write down the general term substitute 15 15 times 15 is 225 so 15 square number is 225 now we'll 
,,take triangular numbers look at the picture for starting from 1 you need 3 circles to create the next triangle what about the other one you need 6 circles to create 
,,the next triangular number next 1/4 110 to create the fourth triangular number so what's the first term first term is 1 second term is 3 third term 6 fourth term 10 
,,what about fifth term can you see the pattern right like this this is one how can you get three I can write 1 plus 2 6 1 plus 2 Plus 3 you get 6 10 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus 4 then what about fifth number 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus 4 plus 5 sum of numbers up to 5 so what's the number that means adding 5 to the previous term 10 plus five you get 15 as a fifth term of the triangular numbers now we can find out this one using a method now we'll take this one if you want adding one up to four when you take first and the last you can get one plus four you can get five to plus three you can get high so when you pair up the numbers like this you can get five in two methods either 2 plus 3 or 1 plus 4 so we can easily find out this as 5 is the number when you add you are getting 2 times of that so 5 times 2 that's 10 so this is the 
,,fourth triangular number so if you want fourth you add 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus 4 how we get the number this is the easiest way to do pair up the numbers like this and then see how many times you are getting the number so in the number is 5 and 2 times you are getting that's 10 we'll take another one if you want 8 triangular number 
,,you have to add 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus like that up to 8 when you pair up like this 1 plus h you get 9 2 plus 7 9 3 plus 6 9 4 + 5 9 how many times you are getting nine one two three four four times you're getting nine so what's the number 36 so eight triangular number is 36 now 10th triangular number what you do 1 plus 2 plus up 
,,to 10 so when you pair up how many sets you can get think about a pattern now previous one we got 4 into 9 is equal to 36 4 is yeah how many digits are there eight 8/2 so we can think about this is 8 divided by 2 you get 4 what about 9 9 you are getting think about first and last 1 plus 8 you did not so we'll try to use that pattern in the next one what's the total 1 plus 10 you are getting 11 2 plus 9 also 11 so how many Elevens you can you will get we can see 10 numbers that they are 10 divided by 2 5 times you are getting 11 so 5 times 11 oh I can write 5 as 10 divided by 2 and how you get 11 first and the last one 1 plus J now can you see the pattern 11 is obtained by adding the first term and the last term the following are 5 such terms so how you create that 10 divided by 2 now what is 10 number of terms and this is the first term and this is the last / - I can rewrite this as this 10 times 10 plus 1 is 11 over 2 so what's the formula you can find the number of terms multiplied by first and the last term addition divided by two so we'll try to apply this formula to find out any triangular number take this one one two eight eight triangular number what's the pattern again we found from the previous one number of terms into first Plus last divided by 2 number of terms 8 divided by 2 and x first 
,,and last one plus 8 again i can write 8 times 9/2 so when you simplify what you get 2 times 1/2 times 4 36 1 2 20 mins xx triangular number so I can write 20 divided by 2 here x 1 plus 20 this is same as 20 into 21 divided by 2 when you simplify you get 210 this one 50th triangular number 50 numbers are they are and divided by 2 1 plus 50 50 times 51 divided by 2 you get 25 times 50 baht so multiplication 25 times 51 means first multiply by 20 and then 5 2 times 1 is 2 and 2 times 5 ten high times 1/5 and 5 times 5 25 so when you add it you get thousand 275 now you need to find out the generator so what's the pattern if there are n digits in the next number is one more than that n plus 1 if the previous number is in you're adding 1 to that n plus 1 divided by 2 so what's the general term for the triangular number 
,,n times n plus 1 divided by 2 here you don't need to write down multiplication side brackets also ok but if you think that this is not talking you can write as in times n plus 1 divided by 2 so we'll try to find out any triangular number using the chain rule to find the 10th triangular number so what's the general term for triangular numbers in times in plus 1/2 now if you want 10th one you substitute 10 10 is n 10 plus 1 over 2 so 10 times 11 over 2 that becomes 50 so general term is n into n plus 1 over 2 for triangular numbers find the 20th triangular number so general term ending to n plus 1/2 so you need xx that means in equals 20 so 20 into 20 plus 125 so you get 10 times 21 210 find the fortieth triangular number you need the general term n into n plus 1 divided by 2 when this is 40 so 14 241 over 2 divided by 2 you get 20 that means multiply by 2 and put a 0 2 times 1 to 2 times 4 8 44th triangular number same as before to take the general term and substitute 44 now substitute 44 44 into 45 44 + 1 then x 22 so 45 x 22 you get 900 plus 45 945 so 945 is the 44th triangular number find xxx triangular number general term so the triangular numbers are n into n plus 1 divided by 2 so if this is xxx triangular number substitute N equals 30 fifteen times 31 so 31 into 15 10 and 5 multiply by 1 and then multiply by 5 add it together you get 465 is the 30th triangular number find the hundredths triangular number general term is n into n plus 1 divided by 2 in this hundred substitute hundred here you get 50 times hundred one so put 0 and x 5050 is the hundredth triangular number 1 + 2 + 3 up to 15 from this sequence which triangular number do you get we observe the pattern 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 fourth triangular number 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 v triangular number so if this is up to 15 this is 15th triangular number up to 28 adding 1 + 2 + 3 up to 20 so what is the triangular number that's xx from this sequence which triangular number one up to 27 so that's 27th triangular this one up to 19 so this is 19th triangular find the sixteenth triangular number if the fifteenth triangular number is 120 so we know the pattern fourth triangular number 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus 4 then to get the fifth one you have to add 5 to that now 16 1 you need so fifteenth one is 120 so how do you get the 16th one 
,,"from 15th one you need to add which number either 15 or 16 you have to add 16 to that so 120 plus 16 you get 136 this one find the 21st triangular number if the 20th one is given 210 you are asked to find out 21st one so which number you need to add 210 plus 21 so that's one here 3 2 231 find the 10th triangular number the 9th triangular number is 55 it's a similar way ninth one is 55 and you are asked to find out the tenth one so how do you do ad turn to that get 65 find the 80th triangular number if the 79th one is given as 3,240 have you get that adding 80 to that so at eighty three thousand three hundred twenty that's the 80th triangular number now we'll try to find out pattern in between square our numbers and the triangular numbers so what are these 1 3 6 10 15 21 are triangular numbers let's take 1 + 3 is 4 so 4 is the square number that's the second square number and here 3 plus 6 you get 9 that's the third square number what about this one 6 + 10 you get 16 so what's that that's the fourth square number I can write this one is 2 squared second square number third square number 3 squared 16 is 4 square number now try to identify "
,,a pattern what's one that's the first triangular number so if I put a symbol like this is first triangle enough 3 is the second triangular number so when you add these two you are getting second square number I put a square to represent the word square what about this one second triangular number and this is third triangular number you are getting third square number find out a relationship this is third triangular number this is fourth triangular number you are getting fourth square number have you seen the pattern 3 4 3 + 1 4 2 + 1 3 1 + 2 2 2 consecutive triangular numbers when you add you get this square number so last square number if this is 4 this is fourth square number if this is 3 this is third square number and this this is 2 this is second square number so what's the pattern when you take any triangular number twenty first triangular number plus twenty second triangular number what you get we get 20 second square number now we'll use that pattern to identify this 
,,one fifth triangular number and sixth triangular number what you get what's the pattern you get sixth square number so you can write what's this number here six square then what about tenth one and eleventh triangle you are getting xi square number you can write 10 1 plus xi 1 you get xi square Arnim 21st and the 22nd but you get 21st triangular number and 22nd triangular number you get 22nd square number 20 or we can write in numbers 22nd square 33rd triangular number and 34th triangular number you are getting 34th square you can do this is 33 33rd triangular number and 34th triangular number you are getting thirty fourth square no so that's the relationship between triangular numbers and the square numbers now we will look at example number 1 in your textbook write the terms of each of the following number patterns the number pattern of the prime numbers between 1 and 17 written in ascending order so what are prime numbers only divisible by 1 and itself what's the lowest prime number 2 so you can write down to then what's the next prime number 3 5 7 11 13 14 15 16 then 17 but can we write down 17 it says in between in between means between means 1 and 17 not included so you can't write 17 there so ascending order means lowest to highest second one the number pattern of the odd number starting from one written in ascending order just the odd numbers 1 3 5 7 11 13 all numbers so what we do we have to put three dots to represent this is continuing third one the 
,,number pattern starting from 1 and followed by the terms two and one written alternatively so as to when one separately starting from one and followed by the terms so starting from one followed by the terms two and one written alternately 2 1 2 look again 1 2 so that's another number pad so we can put three dots to represent this is continuing exercise 1.1 fill in the blanks in the number pattern 1 3 5 7 9 what's the first term 1 second term is 3/4 - 1 2 3 4 that's seven in the number pattern 4 8 12 16 20 multiples of 4 the first term is 4 second term that's 8 and the third term is 12 question number two write the terms of each of the following number 
,,patterns the number pattern of the even numbers between one and nine written in ascending order so what's the first number even numbers 2 4 6 8 10 10 you can write because this is in between these 1 & 9 so this is in ascending order so that's up to this point next one the number pattern of the multiples of 6 from 6 to 36 written in ascending order so multiples of 6 to 36 means you can write 36 as well 6 times 2 12 6 times 3 18 24 6 times 5 30 6 times 6 36 the number pattern of the even numbers greater than 7 written in ascending order greater than 7 means above 7 so what's the lowest even number 8 starting from 8 you can write 8 10 12 like that so this is continuing with 3 dots the number pattern of the prime number starting from 2 written in ascending order so starting from 2 what are the prime numbers 2 3 5 7 like that this is not ending in finite number pattern so you can put three dots question number three copy the below given statements in your exercise book and mark the correct statements with a correct or incorrect symbol we'll take the first one the terms of a number patent have to be in ascending order tick ten eight six like that that's not in ascending order that's descending order that's also a number pattern so the first one is wrong because no need to be always in ascending order second one the terms of a number patent have to be different from each other no because five five five this is also number pattern so no need to be different to each other so here this is also wrong third one if the tenth term of two number patterns are different then the two number patterns are different to each other so think about you have two number sets number patterns tenth term here you got five hundred something here the tenth term is two hundred so different so different means the two 
,,number patterns are different so it says if the tenth term of two number patterns are different then the two number patterns are different so that's true example number one consider number pattern of the multiples of two starting from two written in ascending order so when you write down the number pattern this is two four six eight like that multiples of to find 11th term so what's the general term we know multiples of two the general term is two ends then using the general term you can answer these questions eleventh term so have you find out the 11th term substitute 11 for you get 2200 third term 2 times 103 you get 206 then the last part find which term is hot so 128 of this number pattern that means we know the general term is to win that's given as 728 so how we find out in divide this by to say 128 divided 
,,by 2 2 times 3 6 6 4 12 and 4 for 8 360 fourth term that's multiple of 2 is 728 example number 2 the general term of the number pattern of the multiples of 3 starting from 3 and written in ascending order is 3 so already given so we can write down 3 6 9 12 like that so nth term is given or the general term is 3 in first part find the 13th term so I will find out the 13th term substitute 13 in 9 so 39 then part to find which term is 87 so 87 is equal to three yen so how do you find out n divided by three so in so I'll rewrite this in other way rock three and means eighty-seven divided by 3 you get in eighty seven divided by three twenty ninth term is 87 in other words twenty nine multiple of three is 87 example number three in the number pattern of the multiples of four starting from four and written in ascending order with general term for so general term is given for then what's the chapter tenth term means and B equals can write substitute and nickel step four times 10 that means what part two what is the 11th term so 11th term just substitute in equals 11 four times 11 you get 44 which term is hundred so this is continuation so this is about multiples of four four which term is 100 so in this one in term is given for n means given 100 divided by four to get and when you divide by 4 you get 25 so 
,,25 fifth multiples of 4 is 100 is 43 a term of this number pattern what are the reasons for your answer okay we'll check whether 43 in this number pattern for N equals 43 you divide by four what happens you get ten yeah one and here nothing and three remaining out of four you're getting a fraction for n what is n means number of terms can you get a fraction for a number of terms you can't get a fraction so that's why so 43 is not in the number pattern so here we can write in either fraction there are 4 43 is not in this exercise 1.2 copy the table given below and complete it number pattern first term and the generator so what's the first term here hi these are multiples of 5 so what's the general term 5 in multiples of 2 that's 2 with multiples of 3 3 multiple of ten that's ten named this is 10 20 multiples of 10 
,,starting from 10 you can write 10 in 8 16 24 32 multiples of 8 starting from a twister this is 8 n these are multiples of 7 starting from 7 7 and what about this one multiples of 12 starting from 12 that's 12 in and 1 2 3 4 multiples of once so starting from 1 this is 1 in oh you can write without one just in question number to 
,,write the number pattern of the multiples of 5 between three and thirty-three written in ascending order so starting from three to 33 in between so what's the first 
,,multiple of five five five times to 10 five times three 15 20 25 30 35 but you can't write 35 this should be in between 3 and 33 so up to this point so this is a finite number partner question number three in the number pattern 11 22 33 of the multiples of 11 starting from 11 and written in descending order what is the general term we already know the general term is 11 and what is the 9th term you substitute in equals nice 11 times 9 that's 99 which term is 121 now we know the general term 11 M equals 120 1 when you divide by 11 you get N equals 11 11th multiple of 11 is 125 fourth one in the number pattern 9 18 27 36 of the multiples of 9 starting from 9 and written in ascending order what is the general term now you already know multiples of 9 the general term is 9 end what is the element job substitute in equals 1199 third part which term is 217 e now we know the general term is 9 in equate to 270 so when you divide by 9 what you get xxx term is 270 question number five in the number pattern with general term hundred in so you have given general term as hundred what is the eleventh term so 11th term means you're substituting in equals eleven hundred times you never you get 1100 part two which term is 500 that means 100 N equals 500 when you divide by hundred you get fifth term is 500 question number six what is the smallest multiple of three larger than 100 which term is it in the number pattern of the multiples of three starting from three okay so larger than 100 101 check whether it's divisible divided by 3 3 times 3 9 4 11 you can't you can't divide by 3 102 3 times 3 9 12 12 is divisible by 3 so what's the lowest number multiple of 3 after 100 that's 102 which term is it in the number pattern of the multiples of 3 starting from 3 so 3 6 9 like that they are asking which term is 102 so that means we know these are multiples of 3 what's the general term 3 n so we can equate 3n equals 102 so what's a divided by 3 you get 34 so 34 multiple of 3 is hundred - question number 7 what's the nth term that's basically general term of the pattern of the even numbers greater than 1 but less than 200 greater than 
,,1 what's the lowest multiple of 2 that's 2 for each like that what's the largest number less than 200 you can't write 200 so one before that 198 this is in ascending order smallest to largest the smallest value of n is 1 we know n V equals 1 you get the first what is its largest value that means you are that means you need to find the value of n 498 so we can write 2 N equals hundred ninety-eight divided by 2 so that means 99th term is 198 question number eight it has been estimated that in a country having a population of 2 million people the population will increase by 2 million every 25 years estimate the population of the country in 200 years so first thing we need to find out how many years are there how many steps are there for 200 years so every 25 years it's increasing so find out how many times it's changing 200 divided by 25 is 8 so that means 8 times it's changing so starting from 2 million so I'll write millions here so starting from 2 after first 25 years this becomes 4 million adding 2 million every 25 years so they're asking if this is 200 years not the population if this is 200 years that means if this is 200 years that means 8 times this is increasing so that means 8 turn 8 term of this sequence so after 50 years this becomes 6 million so this is the sequence we know these are multiples of 2 so what's the general term that's 2 when so you need 8 term what's the eighth term 2 times 8 that's 16 so these are in millions so we can write 16 million 
,,people after 200 years example number four in the pattern of the odd numbers starting from one what is the general term so one three five seven what are those odd numbers we found out even numbers the pattern is 2n odd numbers you can get it from subtracting one from even numbers so what's the general term of odd numbers - in - 
,,we'll do the second part part 2 what is the 72nd term so we know the general term is 2 n minus 1 so 70 second term is n V equals 72 so substitute you get 2 times 72 
,,minus 1/2 times 2 for 2 times 7 14 minus 1 you get 143 so 70 second term is 143 third part which term is 51 this is about odd number so general term is 2 n minus 1 that's equal to 55 add 1 to get rid of this one and then you get 2n equals 52 divided by 2 you get 2 times 2 4 4 12 that's six twenty sixth term is 51 exercise 1.3 in the pattern of the odd numbers starting from one and written in ascending order what is the twelfth term so what are the numbers 1 3 5 those are the odd numbers what's the general term for numbers we know that general term is 2 and minus 1 you can use that general term you are asked to find out 12th term 12 term means you substitute 12 in and you get 23 for that and what's the fifteenth term 15 term you substitute N equals 15 30 minus 1 you get 29 part 3 which term is 89 is all about odd numbers so we can write down n star is 89 add 1 you get 90 equals to n divided by 2 you get 90 divided by 2 45 part 4 which term is the greatest odd number less than 
,,100 what's the odd number greatest or number 99 so 99 is the largest or number less than 100 question number 2 find the value of the sum of the 34th term of the pattern of the even number starting from two and the 34th term of the pattern of the odd number starting from what so there are two patterns here what's the first pattern even numbers so starting from two so two four six like that so you are taking thirty fourth term of the even number and the thirty fourth term of them odd numbers 
,,what are numbers one for what are numbers one three five seven so they asking thirty fourth after odd number as well and first you need to find out thirty fourth term separately I'll take the total because you need the sum okay so we know the general term of the even numbers is to it then which term you need thirty fourth term N equals 34 you get sixty eight in this sequence odd numbers what's the general term one less they're even numbers to win minus one so what's thirty fourth term of that two times 34 minus 1 you get 67 now they asking what's the sum of these two values so 68 plus sixty seven hundred thirty-five exercise 1.4 what is the 10th term of the square number pattern starting from 1 and written in ascending order can you remember the general term of a square number general term of square numbers N squared now they asking temperature so starting from here you have to always look at the starting point so 1/4 like that so when you take the square numbers 1 squared 2 
,,squared 4 3 squared 9 so what's the 10th term 10th term you substitute 10 10 squared means 10 times 10 hundred question number two what is the tenth term of the triangular number pattern starting from one and written in ascending order so what are triangular numbers 1 plus 2 3 3 plus 3 6 6 plus 4 10 10 plus 5 15 and what's the general term of triangular numbers we found that general term for triangular numbers are in n plus 1 over 2 now we need till term 10th triangular number substitute 10 for n 10 times 10 plus 1 divided by 2 or you can write 10 times 11 divided by 2 2 times 5 11 times 5 is 55 question number 3 a certain number greater than 1 less than 50 which is a term of the square number pattern starting from 1 so 1 2 squared is 4 so like wise this is less than 50 and written this is in green and written in 
,,ascending order is also a term of the triangular number pattern starting from 1 and written in ascending order so in triangular numbers 1 1 plus 2 3 3 plus 3 6 like 
,,that 10 15 these are triangular numbers so one term is in both number partners what is this term so they are asking what is this term we know what's the general term of square numbers we know that's N squared what's the general term of triangular number in n plus 1 divided by 2 if one number in both number patterns these two are equal so we can take N squared is equal to in n plus 1 over 2 now what can I do I can multiply both sides by 2 to get cancel out I get 2 N squared is equal to expand brackets you get N squared n into n n squared n into 1 that's plus N when you take this term to this side 2 N squared minus n square what you get these are like terms I can ride to n square minus N squared is equal to n so N squared is equal to n so I can divide this by n you get N equals 1 so only number belongs to both is N 
,,equals 1 so we can write N equals 1 is there term belongs to both of these number factors square number as well as a triangular number question number 3 a certain number greater than 1 and less than 50 which is a term of the square number pattern starting from 1 L written in ascending order is also a term of the triangular number pattern starting from 1 and written in ascending order so we'll take square numbers first starting from 1 for 2 squared 9 16 4 squared 5 squared 25 6 squared 36 7 
,,squared 49 because up to 49 because this is less than 50 if you take triangular numbers when you take triangular numbers starting from 1 1 plus 2 3 3 plus 3 you get 
,,6 6 plus 4 10 10 plus 55 15 15 plus 6 21:21 plus seven twenty eight twenty eight plus eight 36 36 Plus 9 45 and 45 plus ten 55 you can't write 55 because this is less than 50 so these are the square numbers and these are the triangular numbers and they asking one number is there in both sequence greater than one so don't consider one day are other than one there's another number which numbers in both sequence 36 so 36 is the term in both number patterns which square number is it one two three four five six six square number which triangular number is it one two three four five six seven eight eight triangular question number four the sum of the fourteenth and fifteen terms of the triangular number pattern starting from one is a square number show that this statement is true and find which term it is of the square 
,,number pad fourteen and fifteen triangular numbers and this is the sum can you remember the pattern we observed first triangular number and the second triangular number is equal to the second square number if you take eight one and ninth number of the triangular numbers the sum is equal to the ninth square number now they're asking fourteenth triangular number and the fifteenth triangular number is which one fifteen square number so when you take this one this is the square number you get 15 square number so is this statement correct the sum of two triangular numbers these are consecutive two triangular numbers that's equal to a square number so the statement is true can dried statement is true and find the term it is of the square number pattern find which term so which term is that fifteen square question number five write the total number of triangles in each figure in order and see whether you can identify the pattern the pattern of the total number of triangles in the figures in the the given order is identical to the pattern of triangular numbers starting from one L written in ascending order find the total number of triangles in the eighth figure that is drawn according to this pattern so we need to find out how many triangles are there first diagram how many triangles are there just one triangle this one one two and we can take the bigger one that's three this one one two three four five six what about this one first we'll count small numbers small triangles one two three four if you take two at a time one two three so 4 plus 3 7 and then 7 8 9 and the bigger one that's 10 so these are the number of triangles inside these diagrams the pattern of the total number of triangles in the figure in the given order is identical to the pattern of the triangular number starting from 1 and written in ascending order so we found out these are triangular numbers find the total number of triangles in the eighth figure so we'll see what's the total number of triangles so we can find out that term we already know in into n plus 1/2 if you want the a trigger so that means eighth term in equals 8 8 times 8 + 1 9 divided by 2 2 times 1/2 times 4 that means 36 so you can write there are 36 triangles in the eighth trigger question number 6 sigh uni buys a till and start saving money by putting 1 rupee into it on the first day so 1 so 1 rupee first day on the second day she puts 2 rupees so second day she puts 2 rupees means the total is 2 plus 
,,1 333 rupees so increasing 3 plus 3 6 and so how much money is in the till by the end of the tenth day now what's this button these are triangular numbers 1 3 6 next day 4 rupees 6 plus 4 10 so these are triangular numbers you can apply the general term so what's the general term of triangular numbers and mean 2n plus 1 divided 
,,by 2 now they ask what's the value and of 10th day so 10th term turn into 11 divided by 2 divided by 2 you get 55 that means 55 rupees in the 1030 so siren approached 55 rupees in the tank miscellaneous exercise in the pattern of the odd number starting from 1 commencing from the first term if the first two terms then the first 
,,three terms then the first four terms are added and continued accordingly a special type of numbers is obtained what is the special name given to these numbers find 
,,the number that is obtained if 15 of these terms are added in order to in order starting from the first term so read it carefully in the pattern of the odd number starting from 1 1 3 5 like that 7 commencing from the first term if the first two terms first is 1 first 2 terms what's the addition of first 2 terms you get for first 3 terms five five plus three eight eight plus one nice first four terms nine plus seven 16 what you get what are these numbers these are square numbers so what is the special name for this these are square numbers find the number that is obtained if 15 of these terms I added that means you're asking to find out the fifteenth - 
,,so 15th term you can use the general term so general term of the square numbers is equal to N squared the fifteenth term is 15 squared that means 15 times 15 220 question number two milk things brought to a shop to be sold were arranged on a rack in the following manner ten teens on the lowest shelf and every other shelf having 
,,one chin less than the number on the shelf below one ting on the top most shop so one next one adding so two three like that what's the lowest one that's ten things 
,,so this is like a triangle okay be right this way first shelf one second shelf two teens third shelf three teens like that last shelf the bottom shelf that's ten find a number of milk tins that were brought to the shop so that means adding all these numbers so what's the sum you can add 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus 4 plus 5 plus 6 plus 
,,seven plus eight plus nine plus ten can you remember what's the pattern there this is like one to ten addition that means this is like tenth trying unit number finding tenth triangular number so without adding up to ten you can just do this is tenth triangular number what's the generator general term of the triangular number is 
,,n into n plus one Oh - it's a substitute ten ten into eleven divided by 2 you get fifty five tins are there by two all the milk tins on the four topmost shelves were sold within two weeks find the number of milk tins that were sold so first four means 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus 4 that means fourth triangular number will substitute to 
,,the formula in equals 4 4 times 5 divided by 2 you get 10 so this is the number of teens sold within two weeks so what's the so they're asking the number of milk teens that were sold so number number of teens sold is question number three what is the sum of the integers from 1 to 31 - like that they are asking what's the sum of 
,,all digits up to 30 so we know 1 + 2 + 3 up to 30 is the 30th triangular number general term of the triangular number is n into n plus 1 divided by 2 now substitute 
,,30 there what you get divided by 2 you get 15 times 31 multiply 30 1 times 15 multiply 10 and 5 you get 5 times 1 5 5 times 3 15 465 so sum of all digits 1 - 30 is 465 so we covered all theory related to number patterns let's your first unit we'll see what we did so we did an expression in in obtain for the intern how to find out the general term and then we did always in should be a positive whole number starting from 1 you can't get fraction 4 in then the next one general term of multiples of 2 you got to win general term of odd numbers subtract 1 from that that's 2n minus 1 general term of square numbers that's N squared finally we did general term 
,,of triangular numbers that's n into n plus 1 over 2 and also we observed another thing when you add two consecutive triangular numbers you will get a square number if it's first one and second one addition of triangular numbers you get second square number eight one and ninth one triangular numbers you get nine square not so remember all these and practice with all exercises and examples when you practice you can master in number patterns
,,
Number Partens,8OcQPkfC74c,in this lesson we are simply going to extend patterns okay so the first thing that I just want to clear up with you as you must remember that they are always two ways that you can find your and your numbers in a sequence the first one is your term to term relationship okay which means you are going to try to link the first term 
,,to the second term and the second to the third and the third to the fourth so we get a check it is the relationship between the terms that's your first option your next option is your position two term relationship okay which means you are going to try to connect the position of the term like this is 1st 2nd 3rd 4th position of 
,,the term to the value of the term like for instance in this first sequence or this first pattern the fourth term is minus 7 so the value of the fourth term would be 
,,minus 7 but when you simply ask to extend the pattern it's much easier for you to try to see if there's not a relationship between the terms ok it's much quicker okay but if you if you see that you're running against a wall you and you can't find the term determine relationship you're going to consider a position to term relationship alright let's have a look at the first one now the first thing that I always do is I check if the numbers in the pattern is getting smaller or if they are getting bigger which means if it's an increasing function getting bigger or a decreasing function now if you look at this first guy if we put put these numbers on a number line okay they should tune it's like that zero that will be your minus 1 that would be a minus 4 and that would be a minus 7 then you can clearly see that this sequence is a decreasing sequence okay your values are getting smaller and smaller now in a case like that you can consider your relationship from the one term to the 
,,next term to be either a minus or a division these are all operations that would make your values smaller or maybe a root okay so let's have a look now the first thing we will do is let's look from leads to how we would move from 2 to minus 1 okay now from to 2-1 we will subtract three how did I get that so quickly okay so what 
,,I do is I take my second term let me just rewrite them yeah I take my second term and I say turn to a minus term one what is that I go minus one minus two that gives me a minus three let me check for the next one and so on minus four minus minus one so I'm gonna take term 3 minus 2 2 which is minus 4 minus minus 1 remember that 
,,minus and minus will give you a plus so you'll have minus 4 plus 1 which will give you minus 3 again and you'll see the same a class through the next one minus 7 minus minus 4 will also give me minus 3 so here I'm sitting with a common difference of minus 3 we call that a common difference and we can say our common difference is a minus 3 which means that in order to extend our pattern we simply have 2 minus 3 every time we actually saying we're adding a minus 3 every time so what we'll do 
,,is to move on from minus 7 I'll go minus 7 minus 3 and again minus 3 to get to the next term and again minus 3 to get to the next term okay let's see what that will 
,,be minus 7 minus 3 will give me a minus 10 minus 10 minus 3 will give me minus 13 and minus 13 minus 3 will give me minus 16 and those are my next three terms I used the term to term relationship which means I checked how are the terms related to each other right let's look at the next guy they gave us five fifteen forty five 135 is we can clearly see here now all positive numbers so we can clearly see this increasing sequence which means the numbers are getting bigger and bigger so I'm gonna definitely consider addition multiplication and maybe squaring or cubing or something like that in order to make the numbers bigger and bigger so let's have a look how they are relighted 15 and I've got a 45 I'm just gonna work with the first three you actually only need the first three terms let's see if the if they've added something five plus what gives me 15 that's a ten but 15 plus ten again will give me 25 now there's definitely not a difference of ten okay but literally if they didn't maybe so that's not gonna work let's check if they're in maybe multiply about something so let's see five multiplied by what will give me 15 you can also work the opposite way and say 15 divided by five what is that that gives me three let me look at the next guy as well 45 divided by 15 again what is that that is three as 
,,well so what they've done is they've multiplied by three to go from the first to the second term they've actually multiplied by three and to move from the second to 
,,the third term they've also multiplied by three now this value here we call a common ratio it's called a ratio because we're dividing to get to that term the same as the previous one can you remember we subtracted to get to it so that's why it was called a difference so my common ratio which also mikuma or is equal to three year so this differently a term to term relationship year so we can simply go on with that sequence let's move on from 135 and what we going to do is we're going to multiply by three to get the next term and then we're going to again multiply by three to get the next term and we're going to multiply by three to get the next term and these numbers are gonna get a lot 135 multiplied by 3 that will give me 405 multiplied by 3 again will give me 1215 I think and if I take that one again and I multiply that by 3 I should get three thousand six hundred and forty five and that will be my last three terms huge terms our tiffni suggests use your calculator take them okay let's have a look at the last guy okay they gave us here a 1 a 4 and 9 and a 16 ok increasing sequence again so I'm going to check firstly for term to term relationship have they added something from to move from the one to the other or have them maybe multiply it by something to move from the the one term to the next term okay right I'm gonna check first for common difference which means that they add something let me see 4 minus 1 will give me 3 let's check 9 minus 4 gives me 5 and no this is definitely no common difference okay let's check for a common ratio let's check 4 divided by 1 will give me 4 9 divided by 4 is definitely not gonna give me 4 so this is also not a common ratio so my term to term has not been too successful okay I'm gonna try position to turn just check the handwriting cars it's getting worse and worse position to term okay so let's find our positions here let's check this was the first term this is the second term this is the third term and this is a fourth term now you're going to check is there any connection between 1 & 1 2 & 4 3 & 9 & 4 & 16 yes I think that's quite clear I can see that 1 squared 1 squared will give me 1 2 squared will give me 4 3 squared will give me 9 4 squared will give me 16 so what they're doing is they're taking the position of the term and 
,,they squaring it so actually if you would look at the formula of this yeah it will be in squared you take the position every time and you square it okay great so if 
,,they want to you see they've given us 1 4 9 16 so they want the first term now I want that guy so we're gonna take 5 squared for the next term which is 25 six squared for the next term which is 36 and seven squared for the next term which is 49 great that's the rest of our sequence

Number Partens,l-6uEtTBH7g, What I want to in this video is get some practice figuring
,,"out patterns and numbers. In particular, patterns that take us from one number to a next number in a sequence. So over here, in this magenta color, I go from 4 to 25 to 46 to 67. So what's the pattern here? How did I get from 4 to 25 and can I get the same way from 25 to 46 and 46 to 67, and I could just"
,,keep going on and on and on? Well there's a couple of
,,"ways to think about it. When I see 4 and 25, let's see, 25 isn't an obvious multiple of 4. Another way to go from"
,,"4 to 25, I could add 21. Let's see, if I add 21, 4 plus 21 is 25. If I were to go from 25 to 46, well I could just add 21 again. It looks like to go from"
,,"one number to the next I'm just adding. I wrote 12 by accident, 21. I'm just adding 21 over and over again. That's going to be 46 plus 21 is 67. And if I were to keep going, if I add 21 I'm going to get to 89. If I add 21 to that I'm going to get 110, and I could keep going"
,,and going and going. I could just keep adding
,,"21 over and over again. The pattern here is I'm adding 21. Now what about over here, in green? When I look at it at first,"
,,"it's tempting to say, 3 plus 3 is 6. But then I'm not adding 3 anymore to get from 6 to 12, I'm adding 6. And then to get from 12 to 24, I'm not adding 6 anymore, I "
,,"added 12. So every time I'm adding twice as much. But maybe an easier pattern might be, another way to go from 3 to 6, isn't to add 3, but to multiply it by 2. So I "
,,"multiply by 2 to go from 3 to 6, and if I multiply by 2"
,,"again, I go from 6 to 12. 6 times 2 is 12. If I multiply by 2 again, I'll go to 24. 2 times 12 is 24 and I could"
,,"keep going on and on and on. 2 times 24 is 48, 96, I"
,,"could go on and on and on. The pattern here, it's"
,,"not adding a fixed amount, it's multiplying each"
,,"number by a certain amount, by 2 in this case, to get the next number. So 3 times 2 is 6, 6 times"
,,"2 is 12, 12 times 2 is 24. Alright, now let's look at this last one. The first two terms here"
,,"are the same, 3 and 6. The first two numbers here. I could say, maybe this is times 2, but then to go from 6 to 9,"
,,"I'm not multiplying by 2. But maybe I am just adding 3 here. So 3 to 6, I just added 3. Then 6 to 9, I add 3 again, and then 9 to 12, I add 3 again. So this one actually does look like I'm just adding 3 every time. The whole point here is to see,"
,,"is there something I can do, can I do the same something"
,,over and over again to get from one number to the next number in a sequence like this? What you want to make sure
,,is even if you think you know how to go from the first
,,"number to the second number, you've got to make sure"
,,that that same way works to go from the second
,,"number to the third number, and the third number to the fourth number. But here we figured it out. In this first set of numbers,"
,,we just add 21 every time. This one we multiply by 2 every time. This one we add 3 every time.

Number Partens,mFftY8Y_pyY,I want to make little townhouse
,,shapes with toothpicks. So this would be
,,my first townhouse. I've used 3 toothpicks
,,"so far-- 4, 5, and 6. So that is my first townhouse. Now, let me make a little table"
,,here keeping track of things. So I'll do that in white. So here's my table to
,,"keep track of things. So this is the number of houses,"
,,and then this is the toothpicks that I'm using to
,,"make that house. So this first house here,"
,,"took me 6 toothpicks-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Now let's make our second house. And these are going"
,,to be townhouses. They're going to
,,share common walls. So I'm going to
,,"add 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 toothpicks for my second house. Now, why did I only"
,,"have to add 5 and not 6? Well, they shared"
,,a common wall here so I didn't have to add
,,another toothpick here for this left-hand side wall. So starting with
,,"the first house, I really just had"
,,to add 5 toothpicks. I had to add 5 toothpicks to get
,,"to now 11 total toothpicks if I want two houses. I think you see the trend here. What about 3 of these? Well, this is going"
,,"to be another 5-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 toothpicks. So we're going to add"
,,5 again and get to 16. Let's do 4 just
,,"for good measure. So the fourth one, we're"
,,"going to add another 5-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So the fourth one, we're going"
,,"to add another 5 gets us to 21. Now, I want to think about,"
,,"can we, using this pattern, figure out how many"
,,"toothpicks it would take for us to, say, make"
,,"50 of these townhouses or even 500 of these townhouses,"
,,"or even 5,000 of them? Now we just have to"
,,look at this pattern here and see can we come up
,,"with an equation for each of these actual values? So, for example,"
,,"we see a pattern that-- well, we"
,,already recognize that we started
,,"with 6, and we're adding 5 every time"
,,we add a house. So when you add the second
,,"house, you add 5 once. The third house, you start"
,,"with 6, and you add 5 twice. The fourth house, you start with"
,,6 and you add 5 three times. So let's actually
,,write that down. So 21 is equal to-- you start
,,"with 6, you start with this 6 here, and then you add 5"
,,"three times, plus 5 times 3. When you had the 3 houses,"
,,"once again, you started with 6 and you added 5 two times. Let me do that same color. And you added 5 two times. Plus 5 times 2. When you had 2 houses,"
,,you started with 6 again. This is equal to 6 and you
,,"added 5 once, so plus 5 times 1. And then when you had"
,,1 house-- and it'll fit the same pattern--
,,"you started with 6, and how many times"
,,"did you add 5? Well, you didn't add 5. You could say that you"
,,added 5 zero times. So you might see a
,,"little pattern here. However many houses you needed,"
,,you take one less than that and multiply it by
,,"5, add that to 6, and you get the"
,,"number of toothpicks. And actually, let"
,,me rewrite this. So I could rewrite this as
,,6 plus 5 times 4 minus 1. I could write this as 6
,,plus 5 times 3 minus 1. You could write this as
,,6 plus 5 times 2 minus 1. You could rewrite this as
,,6 plus 5 times 1 minus 1. And maybe that makes a
,,pattern a little bit clearer. This 4 is right over here. This 3 is right over here. This 2 is right over here. And then this 1 is
,,"right over here. So now, I think we"
,,are ready to think about what would happen if
,,we wanted to make 50 houses. So let's try to do that. Let me do that in orange. This right over here
,,is our 50th house. So this is the shared
,,left wall it has. This is the 50th
,,house right over here. So how many total
,,toothpicks for 50 houses? So if we have 50
,,"houses, well, we can use the pattern"
,,that we came up with. It's going to be equal
,,"to, starting with our 6, the first house requires 6. And then we're going to add"
,,"5 for each incremental house, so plus 5 for each"
,,incremental house. And how many incremental
,,"houses are there going to be? Well, there are going to be"
,,"50 minus 1 incremental houses. Why minus 1? Well, you already built"
,,one of them with the 6. Then for every extra
,,one-- so there's going to be 49 extra
,,houses-- you're going to add 5
,,toothpicks apiece. So this is going to be
,,equal to 6 plus 5 times 49. And that is 245. So 6 plus 245 is
,,equal to 251 sticks. And what's really neat
,,about this pattern we just came up with is you
,,could use it to figure out how many sticks you
,,would need for a million of these little
,,toothpick townhouses.

Number Partens,Zj-a_9cd5jc,The question we're given asks
,,"us, how many students attended Einstein School in 2006? And in this little table, they"
,,"tell us how many attended in 2001, 150 students, and in 2002,"
,,"225, 2003, we had 300 students, but they don't"
,,tell us 2006. So what I think they want us
,,to do is to see the pattern and how many students the
,,"population of students grew by every year, and just assume that"
,,that pattern continues through 2006. So we need to figure out what
,,"the pattern is from one year to the next, and then we're"
,,"going to figure out 2004, 2005, and then 2006. So the assumption that we're"
,,"making in this problem, and I think that the problem wants us"
,,"to make, is that whatever the pattern of growth was in"
,,"these three years, that they continue all the way to 2006. So let's see what's"
,,"happening here. When we go the first year, what"
,,happens to our student population? We go from 150 to
,,225 students. And the easiest pattern to think
,,"about is, well just how much are we increasing"
,,by every year? So how much do we have to
,,"go to from 150 to 225? We increased. Well, if you increase by 50,"
,,"you get to 200, so we increased another 25. So we increased by"
,,75 students. And then they go from
,,"225 to 300, how many did we increase by? Looks like 75 again. 75 plus 225 is 300. So it looks like we increased"
,,by another 75. So the pattern here is that each
,,"year, 75 more students attend the Einstein School. So let's just continue"
,,that pattern. So let's add another 75. Let's add another 75
,,"to the 300 in 2003, and we'll get 375. In 2004, if we assume the"
,,"pattern continues, let's add another 75. And then what will"
,,that give us? That'll give us 450 students
,,"in 2005, if we assume the pattern continues. And we're almost there. Let's add a final"
,,"75, 75 plus 450. If you add 50, you get"
,,"to 500, so it's another 25, so it's 525. So that would be the answer to"
,,"our question, if we assume the pattern continued, that 525"
,,students attended Einstein School in 2006.

Number Partens,pXo0bG4iAyg,In this video I want to
,,introduce you to the idea of a geometric sequence. And I have a ton of more
,,"advanced videos on the topic, but it's really a good place to"
,,"start, just to understand what we're talking about"
,,when someone tells you a geometric sequence. Now a good starting point is
,,"just, what is a sequence? And a sequence is, you"
,,"can imagine, just a progression of numbers. So for example, and this isn't"
,,"even a geometric series, if I just said 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. This is a sequence of numbers. It's not a geometric sequence,"
,,but it is a sequence. A geometric sequence is a
,,"special progression, or a special sequence, of numbers,"
,,where each successive number is a fixed multiple of
,,the number before it. Let me explain what
,,I'm saying. So let's say my first number is
,,2 and then I multiply 2 by the number 3. So I multiply it
,,"by 3, I get 6. And then I multiply 6 times the"
,,"number 3, and I get 18. Then I multiply 18 times the"
,,"number 3, and I get 54. And I just keep going"
,,that way. So I just keep multiplying
,,"by the number 3. So I started, if we want to get"
,,"some notation here, this is my first term. We'll call it a1 for"
,,my sequence. And each time I'm multiplying
,,"it by a common number, and that number is often called"
,,"the common ratio. So in this case, a1 is equal to"
,,"2, and my common ratio is equal to 3. So if someone were to tell"
,,"you, hey, you've got a geometric sequence. a1 is equal to 90 and your"
,,common ratio is equal to negative 1/3. That means that the first term
,,of your sequence is 90. The second term is negative
,,"1/3 times 90. Which is what? That's negative 30, right? 1/3 times 90 is 30, and then you"
,,put the negative number. Then the next number is going
,,"to be 1/3 times this. So negative 1/3 times this. 1/3 times 30 is 10. The negatives cancel out,"
,,so you get positive 10. Then the next number is going
,,"to be 10 times negative 1/3, or negative 10/3. And then the next number is"
,,going to be negative 10/3 times negative 1/3 so it's going
,,to be positive 10/3. And you could just keep going
,,on with this sequence. So that's what people talk
,,about when they mean a geometric sequence. I want to make one little
,,distinction here. This always used to confuse me
,,because the terms are used very often in the
,,same context. These are sequences. These are kind of a progression
,,"of numbers. 2, then 6, then 18, 90, then"
,,"negative 30, then 10, then negative 10/3. Then, I'm sorry, this is"
,,"positive 10/9, right? Negative 1/3 times negative"
,,"10/3, negatives cancel out. Right. 10/9. Don't want to make"
,,a mistake here. These are sequences. You might also see the
,,word a series. And you might even see
,,"a geometric series. A series, the most conventional"
,,"use of the word series, means a sum"
,,"of a sequence. So for example, this is"
,,a geometric sequence. A geometric series would be 90
,,"plus negative 30, plus 10, plus negative 10/3, plus 10/9. So a general way to view"
,,it is that a series is the sum of a sequence. I just want to make that clear
,,because that used to confuse me a lot when I first learned
,,"about these things. But anyway, let's go back to"
,,"the notion of a geometric sequence, and actually do a word"
,,problem that deals with one of these. So they're telling us that Anne
,,"goes bungee jumping off of a bridge above water. On the initial jump, the cord"
,,"stretches by 120 feet. So on a1, our initial"
,,"jump, the cord stretches by 120 feet. We could write it this way. We could write, jump, and then"
,,"how much the cord stretches. So on the initial jump,"
,,"on jump one, the cord stretches 120 feet. Then it says, on the next"
,,"bounce, the stretch is 60% of the original jump, and then"
,,each additional bounce stretches the rope 60% of
,,"the previous stretch. So here, the common ratio, where"
,,each successive term in our sequence is going to be
,,60% of the previous term. Or it's going to be 0.6 times
,,"the previous term. So on the second jump, we're"
,,"going to start 60% of that, or 0.6 times 120. Which is equal to what? That's equal to 72. Then on the third jump, we're"
,,"going to stretch 0.6 of 72, or 0.6 times this. So it would be 0.6 times"
,,"0.6 times 120. Notice, over here, so on the"
,,fourth jump we're going to have 0.6 times 0.6 times
,,"0.6 times 120. 60% of this jump, so every"
,,time we're 60% of the previous jump. So if we wanted to make a
,,"general formula for this, just based on the way we've defined"
,,it right here. So the stretch on the nth
,,"jump, what would it be? So let's see, we start at 120"
,,times 0.6 to the what? To the n minus 1. How did I get this? Let me write this a
,,"little bit here. So this is equal to 0.6,"
,,actually let me write the 120 first. This is equal to 120
,,times 0.6 to the n minus 1. How did I get that? Well we're defining the first
,,jump as stretching 120 feet. So when you put n is equal to 1
,,"here, you get 1 minus 1, 0. So you have 0.6 to the"
,,"0th power, and you've just got a 1 here. And that's exactly what happened"
,,"on the first jump. Then on the second jump, you put"
,,"a 2 minus 1, and notice 2 minus 1 is the first"
,,"power, and we have exactly one 0.6 here. So I figured it was n minus 1"
,,"because when n is 2, we have one 0.6, when n is 3, we have"
,,"two 0.6's multiplied by themselves. When n is 4, we have 0.6"
,,"to the third power. So whatever n is, we're taking"
,,"0.6 to the n minus 1 power, and of course we're multiplying"
,,that times 120. Now and the question they also
,,"ask us, what will be the rope stretch on the 12th bounce? And over here I'm going"
,,to use the calculator. and actually let me correct
,,"this a little bit. This isn't incorrect, but"
,,"they're talking about the bounce, and we could call the"
,,"jump the zeroth bounce. Let me change that. This isn't wrong, but I think"
,,this is where they're going with the problem. So you can view the initial
,,"stretch as the zeroth bounce. So instead of labeling it jump,"
,,let me label it bounce. So the initial stretch is the
,,"zeroth bounce, then this would be the first bounce, the second bounce, the third bounce. And then our formula becomes"
,,a lot simpler. Because if you said the stretch
,,"on nth bounce, then the formula just becomes 0.6"
,,"to the n times 120, right? On the zeroth bounce, that was"
,,"our original stretch, you get 0.6 to the 0, that's"
,,"1 times 120. On the first bounce, 0.6 to"
,,"the 1, one 0.6 right here. 0.6 times the previous"
,,"stretch, or the previous bounce. So this has it in terms of"
,,"bounces, which I think is what the questioner wants us to do. So what about the 12th bounce? Using this convention"
,,"right there. So if we do the 12th bounce,"
,,let's just get our calculator out. We're going to have 120 times
,,0.6 to the 12th power. And hopefully we'll get order
,,"of operations right, because exponents take precedence over"
,,"multiplication, so it'll just take the 0.6 to the"
,,12th power only. And so this is equal
,,"to 0.26 feet. So after your 12th bounce,"
,,she's going to be barely moving. She's going to be moving about
,,"3 inches on that 12th bounce. Well, hopefully you found"
,,this helpful. And I apologize for the slight
,,"divergence here, but I actually think on some level"
,,that's instructive. Because you always have to make
,,sure that your n matches well with what your
,,results are. So when I talked about
,,"your first jump, I said, OK this is 1. And then I had 0.6 to"
,,"the zeroth power, so I did n minus 1. But then when I relabeled things"
,,"in terms of bounces, this was the zeroth bounce. This makes sense that this is"
,,"0.6 to the zeroth power. This is the first bounce,"
,,"so this would be 0.6 to the first power. Second bounce, 0.6 to"
,,the second power. It made our equation a
,,"little bit simpler. Anyway, hopefully you found"
,,that Interesting.
,,
Number Partens,zIcxrhyJs6M,What I want to do in this
,,video is familiarize ourselves with a very common
,,class of sequences. And this is
,,arithmetic sequences. And they are usually
,,pretty easy to spot. They are sequences where each
,,term is a fixed number larger than the term before it. So my goal here is to figure
,,out which of these sequences are arithmetic sequences. And then just so that
,,we have some practice with some of the
,,"sequence notation, I want to define them"
,,"either as explicit functions of the term you're looking for,"
,,"the index you're looking at, or as recursive definitions. So first, given that"
,,an arithmetic sequence is one where each successive
,,"term is a fixed amount larger than the previous one, which of"
,,these are arithmetic sequences? Well let's look at this
,,first one right over here. To go from negative 5 to
,,"negative 3, we had to add 2. Then to go from negative 3 to"
,,"negative 1, you have to add 2. Then to go from negative"
,,"1 to 1, you had to add 2. So this is clearly an"
,,arithmetic sequence. We're adding the same
,,amount every time. And there are several ways that
,,we could define the sequence. We could say it's a sub n. And you don't always
,,have to use k. This time I'll use n
,,to denote our index. From n equals 1 to infinity
,,with-- and there's two ways we could define it. We could either
,,"define it explicitly, or we could define"
,,it recursively. So if we wanted to
,,"define it explicitly, we could write a sub n is equal"
,,"to whatever the first term is. In this case, our first"
,,term is negative 5. It's equal to negative
,,5 plus-- we're going to add 2 one less
,,times than the term we're at. So for the second
,,"term, we add 2 once. For the third term,"
,,"we add 2 twice. For the fourth term,"
,,"from our base term, we added 2 three times. So we're going to add 2. We're going to add positive"
,,2 one less than the index that we're looking
,,at-- n minus 1 times. So this is an
,,explicit definition of this arithmetic sequence. If I wanted to write
,,"it recursively, I could say a sub 1 is"
,,"equal to negative 5. And then each successive term,"
,,for a sub 2 and greater-- so I could say a sub n is equal
,,to a sub n minus 1 plus 3. Each term is equal to the
,,"previous term-- oh, not 3-- plus 2. So this is for n is"
,,greater than or equal to 2. So either of these
,,are completely legitimate ways of defining
,,the arithmetic sequence that we have here. We can either define
,,"it explicitly, or we could define"
,,"it recursively. Now let's look at this sequence. Is this one arithmetic? Well, we're going from 100. We add 7. 107 to 114, we're adding 7. 114 to 121, we are adding "
,,7. So this is indeed an
,,arithmetic sequence. So just to be
,,"clear, this is one, and this is one right over here. And we could write that this"
,,"is the sequence a sub n, n going from 1 to infinity"
,,"of-- and we could just say a sub n, if we want"
,,"to define it explicitly, is equal to 100 plus"
,,we're adding 7 every time. And then each term-- the
,,"second term we added 7 once. Third term-- we add 7 twice. So for the nth term, we're"
,,going to add 7 n minus 1 times. So this is an explicit
,,"definition of it, but we could also"
,,"do it recursively. So just to be clear, this is"
,,"one definition where we write it like this, or we"
,,"could write a sub n, from n equals 1 to infinity. And in either case"
,,I should write with. And if I want to
,,"define it recursively, I could say a sub"
,,"1 is equal to 100. And then, for anything larger"
,,"than 1, for any index above 1, a sub n is equal to the"
,,previous term plus 7. And so we're done. This is another
,,"way of defining it. So in general, if you"
,,wanted a generalizable way to spot or define an
,,"arithmetic sequence, you could say an"
,,arithmetic sequence is going to be of the form
,,a sub n-- if we're talking about an infinite one--
,,from n equals 1 to infinity. If you want to
,,"define it explicitly, you could say a sub n is"
,,"equal to some constant, which would essentially"
,,the first term. It would be some
,,constant plus some number that your incrementing--
,,or I guess this could be a negative
,,"number, or decrementing by-- times n minus 1. So this is one way to define"
,,"an arithmetic sequence. In this case, d was 2. In this case, d is 7. That's how much you're"
,,"adding by each time. And in this case, k is negative"
,,"5, and in this case, k is 100. The other way, if you"
,,wanted to the right the recursive way of defining an
,,"arithmetic sequence generally, you could say a sub"
,,"1 is equal to k, and then a sub n is"
,,equal to a sub n minus 1. A given term is equal
,,to the previous term plus d for n greater
,,"than or equal to 2. So once again, this is explicit. This is the recursive"
,,way of defining it. And we would just
,,write with there. Now the last question I have
,,"is is this one right over here an arithmetic sequence? Well, let's check it out. We start at 1. Then we add 2. Then we add 3. So this is an immediate"
,,giveaway that this is not an arithmetic sequence. Now we are adding 4. We're adding a different
,,"amount every time. So this, first of all,"
,,this is not arithmetic. This is not an
,,arithmetic sequence. But how could we define
,,"this, since we're trying to define our sequences? Let's say we wanted to"
,,"define it recursively. So we could say, this is"
,,"equal to a sub n, where n is starting at 1 and"
,,"it's going to infinity, with-- we'll say our base"
,,case-- a sub 1 is equal to 1. And then for n is 2
,,"or greater, a sub n is going to be equal to what? So a sub 2 is the previous"
,,term plus 2. a sub 3 is the previous
,,term plus 3. a sub 4 is the previous term plus 4. So it's going to be the
,,"previous term plus whatever your index is. So this looks close,"
,,but notice here we're changing the amount
,,that we're adding based on what our index is. We're adding the amount of
,,index to the previous term. And so this is for n is
,,greater than or equal to 2. Well for an arithmetic
,,"sequence, we're adding the same"
,,amount regardless of what our index is. Here we're adding
,,the index itself. So this one is not
,,"arithmetic, but it's an interesting"
,,sequence nonetheless.

Number Partens,OlUBFXfLE0c,hey guys today we're going to continue our unit on patterns and equations and today we're talking more specifically on finding the rules for patterns now we have been talking about learning what an equation is and how it's equal on both sides when now we're switching to the patterns side of it and finding the rules now you still will be using equations and in fact you are finding the rule for these patterns which involve an equation solving making finding the equation that is there so if we look at this pattern here for example we can see are this table sorry if we look at this table here we can see that the numbers already in but today we're going to 
,,be looking at tables that have mystery numbers our blanks that we're going to have to fill in now tables are often used as a means of displaying numbers pairs if the number pair faut pairs follow a pattern you can write a rule for the table a a rule is a numerical expression as we said that describes the relationship between each pair of numbers so let's look at this table below here let's look at this table so we're going to find a rule for these two you have the top to bottom generally our rule goes from the top number to the bottom number and it'll be opposite if we go from bottom to top so let's look at the rule here so I can look at these two I can say I'm either from the top one to the bottom one I'm either adding two so I'm adding two or I'm multiplying by three because one times what gives me 3 1 times 3 now usually when you find tables you're going to either add subtract multiply or divide to find your patterns or rules and you have to figure out which one so you have to know all your facts that's why it's important to know all your facts readily so you can do these very quickly and find the rules very quickly so 1 times 1 plus 
,,2 is 3 and 1 times 3 is 3 so now let's see which one of these works let's try a plus 2 plus 2 does that equal 6 no so we know this one cannot be our rule so let's see multiplying by 3 works 2 times 3 2 times 3 equals six so let's try 5 5 times 3 5 times 3 yes 5 times 3 equals 6 is 15 sorry in 6 times 3 6 times 3 is 18 yes that works in 8 times 3 is 24 now it's important that you want to check all of all the numbers that you have all the parts on the table just to make sure your rule is correct because if it's not correct you or if the first one is correct and the second one is correct but the third one is not correct then you could be wrong completely 
,,so you want to make sure that it's all correct so at this one my rule is multiply by 3 so let's go ahead and look at another example where we don't have all the blanks filled in so let's look at this table here so we have this table here and I see have three different missing numbers now oftentimes your table will look something like this you can find your role here and then you have to find in the missing parts here so with this one you can see you have the rule that you have the top one but not the bottom one then you have the bottom the bottom one without the top one and then this one you have two blanks so let's go how I can find each one of these 
,,first step is finding our rule here so these will tell us what our rule will be so since the top one is bigger than the bottom on all of these I know I'm either going to subtract or I'm going to divide so let's look at the first one 4 - what gets me to 4 4 minus 2 and then let's look if I divide 4 divided by what egos 204 also divided by 2 gets me gets me - so let's see which one over here 10 minus 2 does that get me 8 yes so the rule with this one works here and then 8 minus 6 yes that still works so 10 divided by 8 no so we know the vision is not going to be a rule but subtracting subtract by 2 will give me my answer and I check to make sure that it 
,,works with all of the ones I have so I know that this is correct so subtracting by two alright so now now that we know the rule subtract by two we are going to see if we can find out what these would be so 14 minus 2 so 14 minus 2 is going to be 12 and then so with this one this one we have to go backwards now if we're going backwards the top one is going to be bigger correct so instead of subtracting 2 we're going to have to add 2 so like 12 plus 2 is 14 6 plus 2 is 8 so let's try 7 plus 2 would be 9 and so we can check our rule with the top 1 9 minus 2 so it's back and forth there they became they become somewhat of a fact family so that's how it works now if you have two blanks they are going to be you can pretty much put in whatever you want up here so we like 18 and then you just apply the rule 18 minus 2 would be 16 so that's how these work

Number Partens,r614AD021n0,in this video we're going to talk about how to find the next term in a series of numbers so let's say if we have the numbers 2 5 8 11 and 14 what is the next number 
,,in the sequence now what we need to do is we need to look for a pattern what pattern do you see in each of these numbers notice that each number has a common difference of three to go from two to five you need to add three likewise to go from five to eight you need to add three 5 plus 3 is 8 and 8 plus 3 is 11 whenever you have 
,,a sequence that differs by a common number this is an elliptic sequence if you can add or subtract by the same number you have an Arabic sequence so 14 plus 3 will give us the next number 17 17 plus 3 will give us the next number 20 so anytime you have a sequence that differs by repeated addition or subtraction it's an arithmetic sequence now let's work on another example let's say if we have these numbers 5 9 13 17 what's the next number in the sequence find the next three numbers actually feel free to pause the video so notice that 5 differs from 9 by 4 units if we add 4 to 5 it will give us 9 and if we add 4 to 9 it will give us 13 so therefore the 
,,common difference is 4 so to find the next number in the sequence we need to add 4 to 17 17 plus 4 is 21 21 plus 4 is 25 then 25 plus 4 is 29 here's a different example 2721 15 and then 9 find the next three terms in the sequence so what is the common difference if we take the second number and subtract it by the first number we're going to get negative six if we take the third number and subtracted by the second number it will give us the same number negative six so therefore the common difference is negative six so if you add negative six to 27 you're going to get twenty-one and if you add another negative six to 21 it will give you 15 or if you subtract 21 by six to get 15 15 minus 6 is 9 9 minus 6 will give us the next number 3 and then 3 minus 6 will give us negative 3 and then negative 3 minus 6 will give us the last number negative 9 so the common difference is negative sense once you have that and then you could find the next term in the sequence so once again this is another arithmetic sequence or arithmetic sequence is the different problem to try let's say if we have the sequence 3 6 12 and 24 what is the next number in the sequence so first let's see if there's a common difference if we take the second term and subtracted by the first term it will give us a difference of 3 and if we take the third term and subtracted by the second we're going to get a difference of 6 and so that's not going to help us much but let's divide the second term by the first term 6 divided by 3 is 2 and if we take the third term divided by the second we will get 2 so therefore this sequence has a common ratio of 2 notice that to get from 3 to 6 or to go from 3 6 we'll need to multiply by 2 3 times 2 is 6 and if we multiply 6 by 2 that will give us 12 and then if we multiply 12 by 2 it will give us 24 so this is what's known as a geometric sequence because the numbers they differ by multiplication or division as opposed to addition and subtraction so to find 
,,the next number in the sequence we got to multiply 24 by 2 which will give us 48 and then if we want to find the next one it's going to be 48 times 2 which is 96 and so forth here's another similar example let's say if we have the numbers for 12 36 what is the next number in the sequence so let's see if it's an arithmetic sequence or geometric sequence let's see if there's a common difference if we take the second term and subtracted by the first we'll get 8 and if we take the third and subtracted by the second this will give us 24 so therefore we don't have an arithmetic sequence let's test to see if it's a geometric sequence 12 divided by 4 will give us 3 and 36 divided by 12 is 3 so we have a common ratio if we multiply 4 by 3 it will give us 12 and if we multiply 12 by 3 that will give us 36 so to find the next number we got to multiply 36 by 3 and that's going to give us 108 and if you want to find the next two numbers we'll need to continue to multiply by 3 108 times 3 
,,is 3 24 + 3 24 times 3 is 9 72 and so that's it for this example go ahead and find the missing numbers in the sequence so feel free to pause the video to find the answer if we look at the first example one squared is the same as 1 2 squared is 4 3 squared is 9 4 squared or 4 times 4 that's 16 so the next number has to be 5 squared which is 25 and then it's 6 squared which is 36 and 7 squared which is 49 so look out for exponents because sometimes you might have that as a pattern try this one 8:27 64 and then go ahead and find the missing numbers now 8 is the same as 2 to the 3rd 2 times 2 times 2 is 8 27 is 3 to the third fourth to the third or 4 times 4 times 4 that's 64 therefore the next number and the sequence has to be 5 to the third which is 125 and then we have 6 q which is 216 and the next one will be 7 to the third and then so forth find the pattern consider the sequence 4 6 9 13 and 18 so go ahead and find the next numbers well we're not dealing with X 1 is here because 6 13 and 18 those are not perfect squares or perfect cubes so let's see if there's a common difference or a common ratio now if we subtract 6 by 4 that will give us 2 and if we divide 6 by 4 that's 1.5 if we subtract 9 by 6 that will give us 3 and if we divide nine by six that's also 1.5 if we take 13 and subtracted by 9 that's 4 and if we take 13 and divided by 9 it's no longer 1.5 it's actually 1 point 4 4 4 repeating now if we take 18 and subtracted by 13 that gives us 5 and if we take 18 and divided by 13 that's one point three eight four six now notice that with division there is no pattern that we can use here but with subtraction there is a pattern even though we don't have a common difference the difference is increasing by one so to go from 4 to 6 we need to add 2 and to go from 6 to 9 we need to add 3 to go from 9 7 13 we got to add 4 and to go to 13 to 15 we need to add 5 so therefore the next number has to be 18 plus 6 which is 24 and then after that we need 
,,to add 7 24 plus 7 is 31 and then we need to add 8 31 plus 8 is 39 so based on the pattern that we see here that's how we could find the next set of numbers here's another example 7 9 13 1927 using those five numbers find the next three numbers so what is the difference between 7 & 9 if we take 9 and subtracted by 7 we're going 
,,to get a difference of 2 if we take 13 and subtracted by 9 we're going to get a difference of 4 19-13 is going to be a difference of 6 and 27 minus 19 is a difference of eight so therefore in order to find the next number we can follow the sequence here the sequence of addition increases by two so next time we got to add 10 27 plus 10 is 37 and then when to add 12 37 plus 12 is 49 and then we'll add 14 49 plus 14 is 63 and so that's it that's how you could find the next three numbers sometimes you need to see the pattern in a fraction so let's say if we have these four fractions 3 over 4 5 over 7 7 over 10 and 9 over 13 so based on this find the next 3 fractions so how do we do this how would you begin so take a minute and see if you can figure this out now when dealing with fractions personally I find it helpful 
,,to separate the numerator and the denominator if we focus on the top numbers we could see a pattern between 3 5 7 & 9 the common difference between those numbers is 
,,2 3 plus 2 is 5 5 plus 2 is 7 7 plus 2 is 9 so therefore the next 3 top numbers have to be 11 13 and 15 now let's focus on the denominator 4 7 10 13 notice that each of those numbers differ by 3 4 plus 3 is 7 7 plus 3 is 10 10 plus 3 is 13 so 13 plus 3 is 16 and then we have 19 and then 19 plus 3 is 22 and so you want to separate the fractions into the top and the bottom part portion to see it separately and it can help you to figure out the missing terms here's another example eleven over 
,,four 8/9 five over sixteen based on those three numbers find the next two numbers in this sequence so if we focus on the top three numbers eleven eight and five notice that the common difference is negative three if we subtract eleven by three it's going to give us eight 8 minus 3 is 5 so 5 minus 3 is 2 and 2 minus 3 is negative 1 so that's going to satisfy the pattern on top on the bottom what pattern do you see for 9/16 they're all perfect squares 4 is 2 squared 9 is 3 squared 16 is 4 squared so the next numbers have to be 5 squared + 6 squared 5 squared is 25 6 squared is 36 and so the missing numbers are 2 over 25 and negative 1 over 36 so that's it for this video so now hopefully you understand how to find the next term in a sequence just by looking at the patterns by the way for those of you who want to have access to my pre-algebra video playlists take a look at the description section I've left a link there so you can check that out when you get a chance

Number Partens,riXcZT2ICjA,"In this video, I want"
,,"to familiarize you with the idea of a limit, which"
,,is a super important idea. It's really the idea that all
,,of calculus is based upon. But despite being
,,"so super important, it's actually a really, really,"
,,"really, really, really, really simple idea. So let me draw a"
,,"function here, actually, let me define a function here,"
,,"a kind of a simple function. So let's define f of x,"
,,let's say that f of x is going to be x minus
,,"1 over x minus 1. And you might say,"
,,"hey, Sal look, I have the same thing in the"
,,numerator and denominator. If I have something
,,"divided by itself, that would just be equal to 1. Can't I just simplify"
,,"this to f of x equals 1? And I would say, well,"
,,"you're almost true, the difference between"
,,"f of x equals 1 and this thing right over here,"
,,is that this thing can never equal-- this thing is
,,"undefined when x is equal to 1. Because if you set,"
,,let me define it. Let me write it over
,,"here, if you have f of, sorry not f of 0, if you"
,,"have f of 1, what happens. In the numerator,"
,,"we get 1 minus 1, which is, let me just write"
,,"it down, in the numerator, you get 0. And in the denominator, you"
,,"get 1 minus 1, which is also 0. And so anything divided by"
,,"0, including 0 divided by 0, this is undefined. So you can make"
,,the simplification. You can say that this is you the
,,"same thing as f of x is equal to 1, but you would have to add"
,,the constraint that x cannot be equal to 1. Now this and this
,,"are equivalent, both of these are"
,,going to be equal to 1 for all other X's other
,,"than one, but at x equals 1, it becomes undefined. This is undefined and"
,,this one's undefined. So how would I
,,"graph this function. So let me graph it. So that, is my y is"
,,"equal to f of x axis, y is equal to f of x axis,"
,,and then this over here is my x-axis. And then let's say this is
,,the point x is equal to 1. This over here would be
,,"x is equal to negative 1. This is y is equal to 1, right"
,,up there I could do negative 1. but that matter much relative to
,,this function right over here. And let me graph it. So it's essentially for
,,any x other than 1 f of x is going to be equal to 1. So it's going to
,,"be, look like this. It's going to look"
,,"like this, except at 1. At 1 f of x is undefined. So I'm going to put a"
,,"little bit of a gap right over here, the circle to signify"
,,that this function is not defined. We don't know what this
,,function equals at 1. We never defined it. This definition of the
,,"function doesn't tell us what to do with 1. It's literally undefined,"
,,literally undefined when x is equal to 1. So this is the function
,,"right over here. And so once again, if someone"
,,"were to ask you what is f of 1, you go, and let's say that"
,,"even though this was a function definition, you'd go,"
,,"OK x is equal to 1, oh wait there's a gap in"
,,"my function over here. It is undefined. So let me write it again. It's kind of redundant, but I'll"
,,rewrite it f of 1 is undefined. But what if I were
,,"to ask you, what is the function"
,,approaching as x equals 1. And now this is starting to
,,touch on the idea of a limit. So as x gets closer
,,and closer to 1. So as we get closer
,,"and closer x is to 1, what is the"
,,"function approaching. Well, this entire"
,,"time, the function, what's a getting"
,,"closer and closer to. On the left hand side,"
,,"no matter how close you get to 1, as long"
,,"as you're not at 1, you're actually at f"
,,of x is equal to 1. Over here from the right hand
,,"side, you get the same thing. So you could say, and"
,,we'll get more and more familiar with this idea
,,"as we do more examples, that the limit as x and"
,,"L-I-M, short for limit, as x approaches 1 of f of x"
,,"is equal to, as we get closer, we can get unbelievably, we"
,,"can get infinitely close to 1, as long as we're not at 1. And our function is"
,,"going to be equal to 1, it's getting closer and"
,,closer and closer to 1. It's actually at
,,"1 the entire time. So in this case, we"
,,could say the limit as x approaches
,,"1 of f of x is 1. So once again, it has very fancy"
,,"notation, but it's just saying, look what is a"
,,function approaching as x gets closer
,,and closer to 1. Let me do another example where
,,"we're dealing with a curve, just so that you have"
,,the general idea. So let's say that
,,"I have the function f of x, let me just for"
,,"the sake of variety, let me call it g of x. Let's say that we have"
,,"g of x is equal to, I could define it this way, we"
,,"could define it as x squared, when x does not equal, I don't"
,,know when x does not equal 2. And let's say that when x
,,"equals 2 it is equal to 1. So once again, a kind"
,,"of an interesting function that, as you'll"
,,"see, is not fully continuous, it has a discontinuity. Let me graph it. So this is my y"
,,"equals f of x axis, this is my x-axis"
,,"right over here. Let me draw x equals 2, x,"
,,"let's say this is x equals 1, this is x equals 2, this is"
,,"negative 1, this is negative 2. And then let me draw, so"
,,"everywhere except x equals 2, it's equal to x squared. So let me draw it like this. So it's going to be a parabola,"
,,"looks something like this, let me draw a better"
,,version of the parabola. So it'll look
,,something like this. Not the most beautifully
,,drawn parabola in the history of
,,"drawing parabolas, but I think it'll"
,,give you the idea. I think you know what a
,,"parabola looks like, hopefully. It should be symmetric,"
,,"let me redraw it because that's kind of ugly. And that's looking better. OK, all right, there you go. All right, now, this would be"
,,the graph of just x squared. But this can't be. It's not x squared
,,"when x is equal to 2. So once again, when"
,,"x is equal to 2, we should have a little bit"
,,of a discontinuity here. So I'll draw a gap right over
,,"there, because when x equals 2 the function is equal to 1. When x is equal to"
,,"2, so let's say that, and I'm not doing them on the"
,,"same scale, but let's say that. So this, on the graph of f"
,,"of x is equal to x squared, this would be 4, this would"
,,"be 2, this would be 1, this would be 3. So when x is equal to 2,"
,,our function is equal to 1. So this is a bit of
,,"a bizarre function, but we can define it this way. You can define a function"
,,"however you like to define it. And so notice, it's"
,,"just like the graph of f of x is equal to x squared,"
,,"except when you get to 2, it has this gap,"
,,because you don't use the f of x is equal to x
,,squared when x is equal to 2. You use f of x--
,,or I should say g of x-- you use g
,,"of x is equal to 1. Have I been saying f of x? I apologize for that. You use g of x is equal to 1. So then then at 2, just"
,,"at 2, just exactly at 2, it drops down to 1. And then it keeps going"
,,"along the function g of x is equal to, or I"
,,"should say, along the function x squared. So my question to you. So there's a couple"
,,"of things, if I were to just evaluate"
,,"the function g of 2. Well, you'd look"
,,"at this definition, OK, when x equals 2, I use"
,,"this situation right over here. And it tells me, it's"
,,going to be equal to 1. Let me ask a more
,,interesting question. Or perhaps a more
,,interesting question. What is the limit as x
,,"approaches 2 of g of x. Once again, fancy notation,"
,,"but it's asking something pretty, pretty, pretty simple. It's saying as x gets closer and"
,,"closer to 2, as you get closer and closer, and this isn't"
,,"a rigorous definition, we'll do that in future videos. As x gets closer and closer to"
,,"2, what is g of x approaching? So if you get to 1.9, and"
,,"then 1.999, and then 1.999999, and then 1.9999999, what"
,,is g of x approaching. Or if you were to go from
,,the positive direction. If you were to say
,,"2.1, what's g of 2.1, what's g of 2.01, what's g of"
,,"2.001, what is that approaching as we get closer"
,,and closer to it. And you can see it visually
,,just by drawing the graph. As g gets closer
,,"and closer to 2, and if we were to"
,,"follow along the graph, we see that we"
,,are approaching 4. Even though that's not
,,"where the function is, the function drops down to 1. The limit of g of x as x"
,,approaches 2 is equal to 4. And you could even do this
,,"numerically using a calculator, and let me do that, because I"
,,think that will be interesting. So let me get the
,,"calculator out, let me get my trusty TI-85 out. So here is my calculator,"
,,"and you could numerically say, OK, what's it"
,,"going to approach as you approach x equals 2. So let's try 1.94,"
,,"for x is equal to 1.9, you would use this top"
,,"clause right over here. So you'd have 1.9 squared. And so you get 3.61, well what"
,,"if you get even closer to 2, so 1.99, and once again,"
,,"let me square that. Well now I'm at 3.96. What if I do 1.999,"
,,and I square that? I'm going to have 3.996. Notice I'm going
,,"closer, and closer, and closer to our point. And if I did, if I"
,,"got really close, 1.9999999999 squared,"
,,what am I going to get to. It's not actually
,,"going to be exactly 4, this calculator just"
,,"rounded things up, but going to get to a number"
,,"really, really, really, really, really, really, really,"
,,"really, really close to 4. And we can do something from"
,,the positive direction too. And it actually has
,,to be the same number when we approach from the below
,,"what we're trying to approach, and above what we're"
,,trying to approach. So if we try to 2.1

,,"of steps ahead, 2.01, so this is much"
,,"closer to 2 now, squared. Now we are getting"
,,much closer to 4. So the closer we

,,"we're getting to 4. So once again,"
,,that's a numeric way of saying that the

Number Partens,CzFLDtvN_Xk,patterns they are all around us you can see patterns and buildings patterns are used in clothing and design and patterns are everywhere in math just look at the numbers on this ruler the lines on this ruler the lines on the paper you might be wondering what do patterns do well patterns do the same things over and over again patterns repeat now this is super cool every pattern follows a special rule the rule is how the pattern works we'll give you an example look at this pattern it begins with a red rectangle followed by a yellow rectangle next is a red rectangle and another yellow rectangle next is a red rectangle followed by another yellow rectangle it's doing the same thing over and over again so it is definitely a pattern what special rule does this pattern follow well rectangles alternate between red and yellow do you see that the rule tells us how the pattern works in this pattern rectangles alternate between red and yellow so remember every pattern follows a special rule the rule is how the pattern works if you figure out the rule you've cracked the pattern's code even if there is a part of the pattern missing you will be able to find it because you cracked the code here is the pattern we just showed you imagine this spot missing what belongs in this spot well let's think of this pattern's rule rectangles alternate between red and yellow so what color rectangle goes here yeah a red rectangle by figuring out the rule we were able to fill this spot in the pattern all right we have another pattern here instead of shapes we have numbers in this pattern the first thing we need to do is find out what makes this a pattern look at each of the numbers and see if you can see a pattern what rule does this pattern follow do you know yeah you always add one to get the next number every number goes up by one each time that's the pattern great job okay now we are going to play a game called complete the pattern we'll show you a pattern and then you can try to crack the code and complete it here's the first one you'll notice there are a lot of shapes here so we should probably just look at this pattern line by line and see what we discover on this first line we see a green circle a blue square and a green circle it's almost like a blue square sandwich the second line is similar to the first except there are two squares in between the green circles instead of just one hmm this third line is just like the second line except there are three blue squares in between the green circles instead of two notice a pattern so let's complete this pattern how many blue squares are in this fourth line yeah four the fourth line has four blue squares in between the green circles how can we know that well the blue squares increase by one each line the blue squares in between the green circles keep growing by one every line that's how this pattern works great job all right andy really he does this every afternoon it's a pattern for him every afternoon he dances near the woods we are playing complete the pattern andy we don't have time for these super cool dance moves they are pretty cool okay they are oh goodness kevin i know you dance every afternoon as well that's a pattern for you too but kevin we really do have to get back to our game okay come on all right if there are no more interruptions all right let's look at this next pattern oh goodness look at this series of creatures these animals the first is an interesting looking hamster followed by two birds then there's a hamster and then there's a mystery spot that we have to complete and a bird and then the hamster and then two birds that's pretty cool let's complete this pattern just by looking at this pattern what do you think goes in this spot yeah a bird a bird goes here now how do we know that a 
,,bird goes here well to crack the code and figure out the pattern we have to look at the clues we see a hamster first followed by two birds then another hamster and two birds and it goes on and on the rule for this pattern then is that a hamster is followed by two birds and then the pattern repeats patterns repeat and a please okay the kids are learning please all right patterns repeat i was kind of waiting for kevin okay i guess he isn't going to interrupt i'm kind of impressed oh never mind never mind apparently i spoke too soon all right kevin we really do have a final pattern to look at okay i think we're ready here is the final pattern for us to complete is this a pattern with shapes or numbers yeah numbers we need to figure out what the final number is in this pattern look at the different numbers and see what pattern you notice once you figure out what rule these numbers are following you'll be able to figure out this last number what is this missing number in the pattern yep four great job how do we know that this missing number is the number four well what rule did you notice the pattern was following yes subtract one to get the 
,,next number so the first number is nine and the next number is one less than nine eight then you subtract one to get seven you subtract one to get six you subtract one to get five and finally you subtract one from five to get our answer four okay it's official you are awesome at patterns it's true it's true patterns are so much 
,,fun when you see a pattern you can try to figure out what rule it is following patterns are all around us just waiting to be discovered special thanks to our patrons who make videos like this possible if you would like to support us and get cool homeschool pop tattoos click the link below this video or visit homeschoolpop.com as always you are awesome we hope to see you next video okay what's going on with all this dancing this guy's dancing too he's spinning around at the beach in a suit he's gonna get dizzy what's with this this is not going to be a pattern for future videos

Number Partens,49G43UkVvEM,hello grade eight children today I'm here to teach you chapter seven in your textbook that's called factors so in this lesson we'll look at what our highest common factor look at number fifteen and see what are the factors how can you write down fifteen as a product of two numbers I can write 51 times 15 again 3 times 5 or 5 times 3 same thing so these are called these numbers are called factors if a number can be written as a product of two whole numbers numbers are called factors so what 
,,are the factors of number 15 1 3 5 and 15 now we'll take another example 24 what are the factors we can write 1 times 24 2 times you divide by 2 and see what's they 
,,are the factor 24 divided by 2 you get 12 so 2 times 12 3 times 8 4 times 6 again 6 times 4 8 times 3 so these are the numbers we call factors for 24 so what are the factors 1 2 3 4 6 8 12 24 now we'll take another 136 write down all factors of 36 so you can start from 1 1 times 36 divided by 2 you get 82 times 18 36 divided by 
,,3 and C you get 12 divided by 4 that's 9 6 times 6 36 so what are the factors of 36 we can start from 1 2 3 4 6 9 12 18 and 36 so these are the factors of 36 will take 18 18 how can you write 1 times 18 2 times 9 3 times 6 or 6 times 3 9 times 2 again so what are the factors of 18 1 2 3 and then you can write 6 9 18 so factors always 1 and the number itself are factors any number when observing factors when you look at all these numbers 1 and itself yes 1 and 36 4 36 1 and 15 for 15 so you 
,,get always 1 and the number itself are factors always write down all factors of 32 1 times 32 1 times 32 32 you can write 2 times 16 4 times 8 so what are the factors 1 2 4 8 16 32 so 1 and the number self always a factor write down all factors of 21 times 22 times 10 4 times 5 so factors of 21 in 2 4 5 10 20 45 1 times 45 3 times 3 times 1 3 4 15 that's fine divided by 5 that's 9 so what are the factors 1 3 5 9 15 and 40 now we look at what are common factors write down highest common factor HC afreet stands for highest common factor of 6 and 10 so that's what we need to find now when you take 6 what are the factors we know 1 and itself always a factor then you can divide this by 2 so 2 is a factor you can divide this by 3 3 is a factor so 1 2 3 6 factors of 10 1 and itself always a factor you can divide by 2 you can divide by 5 so when you look at these two numbers what are common factors of 6 and 10 1 & 2 so 1 & 2 are common factors highest common factor of 6 and 10 which 
,,one is the highest to so 2 is the highest common factor the largest common factor is called the highest common factor so we select common factors out of that the largest one we call highest common factor find the highest common factor of 12 and 18 so how we write 12 1/2 yes get 6 divided by 3 you get 4 divided by 4 you get 3 and divide by 6 you get 12 and finally 12 is also a factor 81 be visible by 2 divisible by 3 and what else 4 is not there 5 6 and then 18 what are common factors they're common ones 1 2 3 & 6 so out of these what's the highest one six six is the highest common factor so we can write 12 in terms of 6 into 2 18 you can write 6 times 
,,3 so here if you take these two factors highest common factor is in the circle 6 is the highest common factor find the highest common factor of 15 and 20 15 1 not divisible by 2 3 5 and 15 21 - ok then 3 not divisible 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and then finally 20 so what are the common factors there one fine those are the two common factors out of these two you can write down the highest one is fine so if you take 15 I can write 5 times 3 and 5 times 4 so highest common factor is in the circle find highest common factor of 20 and 30 now can you find out at once when you look at 20 and 30 10 times 2 and 10 times 3 so here I can write 10 times 2 and 10 times 3 so what's the highest common factor for 20 and 13 that's 10 fine highest common factor of the tn 45 what do you think 15 times 2 and 15 times 3 so 15 times 2 is 30 15 times 3 is 45 so what do you think the highest one highest one we can take as 15 24 36 60 now you get three numbers and we are asked to find out the highest common factor so 24 36 60 when you look at it we see what is the common factor 12 these are multiples of 12 12 times 2 12 times 3 12 times 5 that's the maximum number common factor we can take so what's the highest one highest one we can take as 12 these 3 45 6 275 so when you look at it carefully we see 15 either common factor and it's the highest one 15 times 3 15 times 4 and 15 times 5 75 so highest common factor we can take as 15 finding highest common factor using prime factors so we did so far 
,,by looking at the numbers we took the highest one now there's a method to find out if you can't see at once you can use prime factor method so we'll take 12 so what 
,,you have to do take separate numbers and see what are the factors you can divide by 2 again you can divide by 2 you can't divide by 3 so what are the factors 2 times 2 times 3:18 what are the factors you can't divide by 2 divided by 3 you get 1 2 times 3 times 3 24 divided by 2 again 2 and again two and finally 3 2 times 2 times 2 times 3 now what we do we take the highest common factor from this this is one common factor and there's another common factors what we do we multiply these two so we can take highest common factor as 2 & 3 that's 6 so we can write 12 as 6 into 2 18s 6 into 3 24 as 6 into 4 so 6 is the highest common factor 4 12 18 and 24 find highest common factor of 15 30 and 45 15 we know 3 times 5 so when you divide 15 you can see this is 3 & 5 here you don't need to multiply by 1 so you can write 3 
,,times 5 30 3 2 5 so 2 3 5 2 3 45 divided by 3 again 3 you get 5 3 3 5 now select the common 1/3 is common and five also common so what's the highest common factor we multiply these children so three only we take once and this is five so 15 so 15 is the highest common factor of 15 30 and 45 finding highest common factor of 12 24 
,,60 so now use prime factors and find out 12 you can write 2 to 24 you can write 2 2 to 3 and 60 you can't divide and see the factors 2 to 3 now select common factors 2 is common another 2 is common and here 3 is also so what's the highest 1 2 times another 2 times so 2 times 2 4 4 times 3 12 so the highest common factor of all these numbers is 12 now look at 22:40 4 60 you look at we see what's the highest common factor but we'll check it 22 2 times 11 11 times 1 so 2 times in our 44 / 222 
,,again we'll get to it 22 divided by 11 1 so 2 times 2 times 11 66 when you divide by 2 you get 33 divided by 3 you get 11 2 3 11 so what's common 2 is common and 11 
,,is a common factor so 2 times 11 is the highest common factor so 22 is the highest common factor five highest common factor of 14 21 and 49 14 divided by 2 + 7 - x 720 bar you can divide by 3 3 times 7 49 is 7 times 7 now what's the highest one 7 is the only common factor and it's the highest one so 7 is the highest one 26:39 65 now you can do it so 26 divided by 2 to get 1313 is a prime number so 2 times 30 39 can divide by 3 and 13 is a prime number so 3 times 30 65 you can divide by 5 and you get 13 so 5 times 30 so what's the common factor highest common factor is 13 so 13 you can write as the highest common factor write down the highest common factor at once now can you see when you look at these 3 we can see 10 10 times 5 10 times 16 times 7 so if you can do that we can easily find out the highest common factor so from all these what's the highest common factor we can write as 10 this one what do you think 35 what's the number high times 7 7 times 7 7 times 10 what's the number 7 7 we can see that the highest one 7 times 5 7 times 7 49 7 times 10 70 so what's the highest one 7 is the highest common factor 30 45 60 what can you say 
,,15 15 times to 15 times 3 15 times 5 so we can write 15 times to 15 times 3 you get 40 for it so here 60 is 15 times 4 so what's the highest common factor highest common factor is 50 look at these numbers 80 100 and hundred and eighty so 10 is okay then look at 810 18 another 2 is common so what's the highest common factor so you get 20 so just check 20 times for 20 times 500 20 times 5 here 20 times 4 what's 20 times here 9 so 20 is the highest common factor so we can take 20 now look at these ones 1845 63 divisible by 3 and you get 9 and 21 again divisible by 3 so these are multiples of 9 so I can write 18s 9 times 2 what's this one 9 times 5 63 is 9 times 7 so what's the highest common factor there 9 is the highest common factor finding highest common factor for algebraic terms now so far we did numbers now these are letters and numbers a mixture we call it algebraic terms now let's take 4x squared how can you write for 2 & 2 2 times 2x squared means X annex so you can first expand it like this and see what are common factors 6 how can you write 2 times 3 and X Y X into y 8 2 times 2 4 4 times 2 8 and x squared means two x's there and Y squared means two wise now take the common ones 1 2 is common what is X 1 X is common there and what about YY is not common because it's not there here so only 2 
,,"well X so 2 and X you can write 2x is the highest common factor right down highest common factor for these are G break terms 8 2 times 2 times 2 is there and B squared means B twice 12 2 times 2 4 4 times 3 12 a squared is a times a and B then 22 then again neither - 2 times 2 4 4 times 5 20 and B now see what are common and from that you can find out the highest 1/2 is , another 2 what is e you can take ears commenter and one B so what are the common factors to 2 e and B so when you multiply 2 times 2 4 so for a B is the highest common factor right down highest common factor for these numbers a B a times B 3 a B means 3 times a times B so a B means 2 "
,,times 2 times a B when you write down factors make sure that you write in prime numbers B is Commerce and is common so what's the highest common factor we can multiply a and B so without this multiplication sign we can write ap another algebraic terms find the highest common factor if you can't get it at once you write like this and find out the prime factors 2 times 2 times 3 is 12 and then P Q squared means cube and cube 8 2 times 2 times 2 P squared means P and P and want you there 40 divided by 2 divide by 2 divide by 2 and then high so 2 times 2 times 2 times 5 so when you select the common ones here to another two and what is here we forgot P and Q squared so we'll take pinion q squared P Q and Q now we'll select the common ones 1p is common 1q common here so that's all so you can write 2 times 2 times P times Q 2 times 2 4 4 P Q is the highest common factor right down highest common factor for these numbers 24 divided by 2 divided by 2 again 2 and then 3 2 times 2 times 2 times 3 and then M N squared one name and two ends 36 divided by 2 2 you get 9 divided by 3 and another 3 so 2 times 2 times 3 and 3 and M square that means 2 m 
,,then one name M squared N squared here 48 48 divided by 2 divided by 2 again so when you divide you get all these numbers then - how many times one two three four two three four and then three M Squared n square so that means - MZ twins now we'll find out the highest one to another to is common what else look at carefully three 
,,is common you take one name and another in so what's the number 2 times 2 4 4 times 3 12 so 12 mm now you can do this so write down the factors first 7 we know it's 
,,a prime number 7 only 7 x 1 x 2 eyes till how can you write as prime numbers 2 times 5 two x's and one why 9 we see 3 times 3 and x and x 4 x squared and y and y 4 y square now take the common ones out when you take numbers nothing common only letters are common 1 X you can take it out and one boy that's all so what's the highest common factor x into y or you can write x y so now the 1 6 you can write 2 x 3 2 x's two ones 12 - x - 4 4 x 3 12 - XS + 1 by 15 3 times 5 2 XS + 2 1 now we see that this X is common another X is cover what else now that Y you can take another one no numbers are common so what's the highest common factor X x + y you can write 
,,x squared Y now we look at how we can write algebraic expressions as a product of its factors so remove highest common factor for this 6 X + 15 Y and write as a product of two factors so we can separate the two terms 6x + 15 1 when you look at 6 X you can write 2x + 3 15 Y you can write 3 a 5 by so that's the common one and it's the highest common law so common factor is 3 and what are the remaining part you get 2 X 5 so we can take this highest common factor out and write down the remaining part so here when you take 3 out from 6 what's remaining 2 X when you multiply what you get 3 times 2 X 6 6 you are getting then when you take 3 from here 15 what's remaining five bye so when you take three out you get five by here so we can write 6x plus 15y as 3 times 2x plus 5y because when you multiply expand you get the same answer 6x 3 times 5 15 what so you get the same answer so when you are taking common factors out what you call that we call we are factorizing what's the reverse order expanding brackets and then factorizing so we are now looking at taking the highest common factor out from the expression look at these 2 5 a and 10 B so how 
,,can you write 5 a I can write 5 times a 10 B 5 times B 5 times to be then how can I write 5 8 and 10 B I can take the highest common factor out and the remaining part I can put inside the brackets a and plus sign this sign comes here so 8 plus 2 B now you can check by multiplying these two 5 times a 5 a 5 times 2b check me so that's correct now see this one you have given two terms 7p + 14 cube so what's common 7 times P I can write 7 times 2 cube I can write for 14 so 7 is the highest one 
,,so I can take 7 out and write the remaining part P plus 2 Q inside brackets so when you multiply you get 7p + 14 this one what do you think six times five six times 
,,two so I can write 6 times 5 m 6 times 2 n that's 12 so 6 you can take it out and the remaining part 5m plus 2n you can write inside so 6 times 5 30 30 M 6 times 2 n 12 15 X + 18 y the plus sign is there so we write plus sign so 15 3 times 5 X 18 y 3 times 6 y know what's the highest common factor 3 take it out and the remaining 5 5 X + 6 Y you can write inside the brackets this one now the sign is negative so we'll put negative 10 yeah this should be negative 20 X you can write 10 with 2 X 10 with 3 B that's 30 B so 10 when you take it out what's remaining 2 X now the sign is minus 3 always this sign comes here as well so 2x minus 3 be multiplied and 
,,see 10 times 2 20 10 times 3 30 and minus sign comes this one for a and 20 B what's common will take 4 4 times a four times five B so four is the highest common factor take it out the remaining part e + 5 b you can write in sat 8m plus 28 what's common look at carefully when you look at carefully sometimes you get it at once for four times - it four times five in four is the highest common factor take it out and write the remaining part inside the bracket so 2m plus five write down as product of factors at once can you take the highest common one out 7 + 35 7 is common so what's the remaining part when you take 7 a is there and then here 35 we have already taken 7 so 5 is remain 5b 8 12 16 what's the common factor for multiples of 4 so 4 is common 2 x 4 times 3 12 so 3y there 4 times 4 16 so for Z third one what's common 6 + 8 4 2 is common no letters common there so only you can take 2 so 2 a squared remain minus sign because this is minus 2 times 3 6 so 3 B squared and here 2 times 4 8 4 C square fourth one nine six three multiples of 3 so it take 3 out 3 plus 2x plus y so here only 3 is calm 12 16 20 what's common for four you can take it out 4 times 3 12 so 3 P 4 times 4 16 so 4 cube + 4 times 5 20 so that's 5 are 40 50 60 you can take turn out when you take 10 for X is there 5y + 10 x 6 16 so - its 22 11:33 definitely we know that's 11 11 times 2 20 to 11 times 1 so you can write a only no need one name - 314 2135 multiples of 7 and take 7 out to where 3 b + 5 2 4 6 2 take 2 out a plus 2b minus 311 2255 again 11 is common x + 2 y minus 5 write down as productive factors no no numbers just the letters so what's common 
,,here a I can write a times X a times y so I can write ax plus ay Y taking the common highest common factor out a and the remaining part inside so a into X plus y so 
,,these two are the product of factors again 2 PQ + 4 P R I can write - P - P times Q to P times here - are you get 4 PR no - P is common highest one so you can take it out and write Q + to work always check whether you are getting the same term - n PQ 2 PQ + 2 P into two are 4 p are these examples how can I write x is common 3 and X I can take so 3 X into X 3 X into 2 y 3 X into 3 Z so what's the highest common factor 3x I can take it out and write x + 2 y + 3 Z look at this one first 7 XY 14 x CI 21 X so what's common 7 X into are 7 X into 2 z 7x - three is 21 X so how can you write down this one I can write take seven X out take seven X out and write 
,,down the remaining part inside y - Z and this one eight twelve sixteen and here P P P P also common so we can take four P out for P times to P you get eight P squared forty-four p x 3q squared twelve P Q squared 4 P times 4 Q 16 B cube so for P is the highest common factor there so remaining part you write inside to p3 q squared + 4 Q write down algebraic expression 5 a plus 10 B as product of two factors so again 5 a I can write 5 times a 10 B I can write phi x 2b so 5 is common that's the highest common factor take it out the remaining part your right inside write our algebraic expression 7 XY 14x e 21 x as product of two factors so 7x is the highest common one check it out so you can write Y there 2 Z 3 so when you take my necks out what's remaining y plus 2z plus 3 so we call these are factors of this expression find factors of these ones ap square 12 P Q squared 8 P squared Q so already give up for P you can take it out so for P means 2 when another P 4 times 3 12 P is already there so Q Square when you take 4 P out this is 2p q 8 P squared Q you'll get now for P is the highest common factor take it out and remaining part 2 V 3 Q squared + 2 PQ you can write inside brackets find factors of these three expressions what's the highest one x squared x squared x squared so definitely x squared is common and 6 9 12 you get 3 so 3 x squared we can take it out if it's 3 x squared this is 2y squared 3x squared take it you get 3 only 3x squared when you take it you 
,,get for y so no need to circle that so 3x squared it's the highest common factor and you can write down the remaining part inside the brackets find tractors at once 
,,so we'll do at once look at the number three six three is common so no letter is common so the remaining part you write insult six and nine three is common so when you take three hours it's to a and three be fifteen and twenty you can take 3 out 5 X + 4 3 times 3 is not common there what's common 15 and 25 is common so when you 
,,take 5 out 3x + 4 1 12 and 15 you can take 3 out for a and 3 times 5 15 so 5 be 20 and 30 I can take 10 out 2x + 3 okay these ones take the factors at once 8 10 12 I can take for ya X also common for X out then - y remaining for X when you take this is 3 z 9 + 53 is common and 1a is common so 3a so 3b 5c 16 and 24 butts comma 8 
,,8 times 2 16 eight times three twenty four eight and twelve here you can take four out to here X is also come on X is also common for is also common so for X you can take it out 2x 3y so you get 12 X Y 30 and 45 what's common 3 you get 15 10 so only 3 & 5 15 you can take it out 2 & 1 X and you take 15 X you get 2 y inside and 15 times 3 45 3 Z so 15 times 3 45 fine factors now three expressions three terms are there at once we see a nice common take it out the remaining part we write inside brackets from these we can see only X is common 1 X 2 y and y square your sign is the same you can't change the side here PQ q RQ is Q is common P plus R plus s here M is common you can write M plus n plus here what you write one name is there when you take em out that means one is there so M times 1 is M so here when you take 
,,"the whole thing out you have to write this is 1 now here also same thing when you take a out this is 1 here 1 plus B plus B Square this one too you can take it out what else p2p that's all so when you take two P out Q minus 2 R and 3's let's comment here and Miss common 3 so 3 M foo and you get 12 here then 5 6 9 12 3 1 P is , so 3 P to Q 3 r & 4 yes what is here only hey so when you take a out this is a plus B plus C this one X is combine and no number is common so only X 2 X 3 y + 5 Z now what happens you can take negative numbers as a common factor so we'll look at this one so this is a negative number so negative 2 way I can write negative 2 times "
,,a so negative 2 times 8 oh I can write negative 8 times 2 you are still getting the - - wait look at this 1 minus 5b I can take minus 5 and B or minus B and 5 - 7 X 
,,- 7 with X or minus X with 7 here minus 15 minus 3 into positive 5 oh I can write 3 with negative 5 minus 12 minus 4 with 3 or 4 plus 4 with minus 3 I can take the minus sign to any of these factors find factors of minus 14 a minus 21 B minus 14 so we'll take minus 7 then what's the other part - a if you take minus 7 out what's 
,,remaining three big now is C minus seven is the common factor so I can take minus seven out and write down the remaining part 2 a + 3 B inside brackets now multiply 
,,and see 7 times 2 away 14 let's - minus and plus that's - you get 21 B fine factors of minus 8x minus 12i so I can take minus 4 if you take minus 4 this is 2x minus 
,,4 times 3y you get minus 12i now we'll take minus 4 out from the two terms that's the highest common factor the remaining part you can write inside so this is plus 3y plus 2x so that's why this plus 3y comes over there now find factors here both negative I can take minus 3 out so when I take minus 3 out this becomes plus a plus 
,,5b 4 minus 4 will take out - well when you take it out you get 2x and 3y from this minus 3 out but you get 3p and 2 K minus 2 and -6 we take minus 2 out e + 3 so multiply and see whether you are getting the same expression all three will take minus 2 out what's happening here you get 5n that's positive because this is negative now here positive is there so this becomes negative because you have already taken a minus sign out so 2 times 4 8 that's four N and minus 2 you have take it out and 
,,then this becomes plus 3 so multiply and see whether you get this sign correctly - - and - you get +8 a will take - 11 out you can take plus 11 also then the sign stays the inside so if you take minus 11 this becomes X plus 6 this becomes plus 2y and here plus becomes minus 3 15 18 3 3 is common so we'll take minus 3 out you get 5p this is minus so this becomes plus 6 q & 3 are so that means plus or minus classes there so that becomes minus because - - you get plus their take - formed E and then this becomes must to be 8 and here plus becomes minus minus - you get plus 4 times 24 36 12 you can take minus 12 out so this becomes 2 p3q and here - because 
,,- 12 and - are you get plus 12 are 16 24 8 I can take minus 8 out this becomes 2 X plus 3 by and minus Z so minus 8n - see you get plus 8 see find factors of following algebraic expressions so you can take either plus or minus will take all common factors that's called highest common factor I can't take two what so what's remaining two this one X is common for so I'll take four X out this becomes 3 2 y 4 times 2 8 XY minus 4 X already taken 10 12 8 I can take 2 and here a 2 way so what's remaining 5 a + 6 b + 4 c all these I can take a out a plus B plus C this one x squared is common take it out 2 plus 3y minus 5z this one p is common and 3 so 3 P 3 P 
,,when you take 3 q is there for R + 3 x - 2 SS you get 6 PS remove common factor at once so now you should be able to take the highest common factor out at once so when you take an expression just try to take all possible factors out so here X take it out what's remaining y + ya when you look at this one is come on take it out so you'll get a plus B minus 8 see what is this one what is common 3x when you take 3x a minus B here 9 + 3 3 comma and take it out you can write 3x + 1 because remember when you take the highest number out always remember this is 1 so 1 X is common take it out remaining parts you can write inside with the correct sign a is common so remaining part a plus B minus C here X is common L - M - what's common there 3 yes 3 is common for p5q and - a / b is common C is common L is common three terms 
,,come ABC when you take ABC one remaining here one be remaining here and one C remaining there X Y you can take it out when you take XY out exist remaining Y is remaining there and XY both remaining yeah so try to take the highest wall out so fine factors means you are taking the highest common factor out 3 take it out you get 4x - 5 14 and 20 1:7 is the highest common factor to M minus 3 9 and 12 3 and here a squared is also common when you take 3 s squared you get 3 minus 4p we are 16 and 
,,24 what's the highest one 8 and X so 2x 8 times 2 16 x squared and here 3y 8 times 3 24 X Y this one 15 and 25 x and y comma 3 what remaining 5 you have already taken so this becomes 4 X 12 and 21 3 x squared is common and 1 Y is common take it out so what's remaining 4 here plus 3 x squared Y we have taken that one out 3 times 
,,4 12 minus 7 x squared you have taken out so One X is remaining and Y squared is there we took one Y out one Y remaining check it again 3 x squared so 3 times 7 21 x squared and X X cube Y and y Y squared now we will look at your review exercise find the highest common factor of each set of numbers given below so how we find out do it separately and find out the highest common factor 12 2 times 2 4 4 times 3 12 2 times three six six times three eighty now take the highest one two and three 
,,so highest common factor is two and three that's six thirty and twenty four two times fifteen fifteen you can write three and five if you can't figure it out you do 
,,separately and find out the factors so here fifteen three times four and twenty four two times twelve twelve means two times two four four times three now what are the common factors two and three so highest common factor is 2 times 3 that's 6 45 and 60 45 60 you can divide by 5 5 times 9 9 you can write 3 and 3 divided by 5 you get 12 12 you can write 2 times 2 4 4 times 3 12 so what's the highest common factor 5 3 that's all 5 times 3 that's 15 6 12 18 when you take that we can't say 6 is the highest common factor but we'll show the workings 2 times 3 2 times 2 4 4 times 3 12 2 times 9 so that 9 is 3 times three two is common and three is common so highest common factor is 2 times 3 that's 6 this one 15 30 and 75 3 times 5 30 3 times 10 so you can write 3 10 you can write 2 and 575 3 you get 3 times 2 6 so 25 25 you can write 5 and 5 what's the highest common factor 3 & 5 you get 50 now take this one 36 24 and 60 you can divide by 2 you get 18 18 also divided by 2 you get 9 9 you can write 3 & 3 24 you can divide by 2 you get 12 12 how you can write 2 times 2 4 4 times 360 divided by 2 you get 30 divided by 2 again 15 3 times and fun know what's common to another two and three common now what's the highest common factor 2 times 2 times 3 4 times 3 12 12 is the highest common factor 6 9 12 6 2 times 3 9 3 times 3 12 3 times 4 so what's common only 1 3 is common you can write highest common factor is 3 15 30 and 45 how can you write 3 times 5 53 times 10 10 you can write 2 times 5 45 3 and 15 there 15 3 times 5 so what's the highest common factor 3 is common and 5 is common 3 times 5 15 he left for 13 and 511 you can write 1 times 11 1 times 13 all these are prime numbers 1 and the number itself are the factors so what's the highest common factor in this case only one example number 1 find the highest common factor of the algebraic terms in each part given below so we can write separate 2 times P times Q for 2 times 2 P Q now take the common 1 highest common factor 2 P Q 2 P Q is the highest common 7mn 14 M and P 28 m and q 7 is 7 times MN 42 times 7 times M and P 28 2 times 14 14 2 times 7 M in Q now what are the common ones 7 M hmm 7 mm so highest common factor is 7 ma exercise 7.1 find the highest common factor of the algebraic terms in each part given below so you write like this and find out them common ones x into y 3 into X into y 2 times 2 into X prime factors here without writing 4 times X right 2 times 2 times X X is common why is not common so that's all so highest common factor is just X this one for C 8 a 4 B 4 how can you write we write in terms of prime numbers 2 times 2 times C 8 2 times 2 times 2 and a 4 again 2 times 2 so you can see 2 & 2 common so that's 4 2 times 2 you get 4 is the highest common back to their 2 X 8 X + 4 X 1 you see 
,,2x is the ice common factor but we'll show 2 times X 2 times 2 times 2 X 2 times 2 times x and y so what's the common 1/2 + 1 X the highest common factor is 2x this 
,,one for P 8 P Q 12 P 2 times 2 4 and SP 2 times 2 times 2 PQ that's 8 PQ 2 times 2 4 4 times 3 12 P Q now we'll take the common ones out to another 2 and P so highest common factor is 2 times 2 times P that's 4 P 8 P Q R 16 QR and 7 mq r 8 2 times 2 times 2 and then P Q R is there 16 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 7 7 times M Q now what R comma Q is common our is common that's all so what's the highest common factor Q this one 4x 6x y 8 q r x 4 x 2 x 2 x x 2 x 3 by x and y 8 2 times 2 times 2 q 
,,r x now take the common ones to another 2 is not common x that's all so highest common factor is 2x so highest one is 2 X 4 X 6 a B X 10 a B X Y now write down all the factors for x 2 x 2 6 2 x 3 a B X 10 2 times 5 a B X Y now see the common factors to X that's up so what's the highest common factor to X this one 6 MN 12 MN y 15 my 6 means 2 times 3 12 2 times 2 4 4 times 3 15 three times now we'll take the common ones 3 & M and means not common so what's the highest common factor 3 example number one write the expression 36 a plus 60 B as a product of factors so that means you can take the highest common factor out so what do you think 36 and 60 B 6 times 6 6 times 10 so another 2 so 12 12 times 3 12 times 5 so that means 12 is their highest one so take it out you get 12 times 3 so 3 a plus 5 if you can't figure 
,,it out you just write down 12 times 3 12 times by me so common one take it out and the remaining part you write inside brackets example number two write the expression as a product of factors so 12 X 25 and 16z 12 4 times 3 24 times 5 16 4 times 4 so 4 is the highest common month so when you take for the remaining part three x 5i + 4 z so i told you if you are not okay write down 4 x 3 3 x 4 x 5 button here 4 x 4z so when you check for out the other parts inside the brackets exercise 7.2 fill in the blanks the expressions are given and you asked to fill in the blanks ok so 3 X means 3 times X 12 millions 3 times 4/3 is comma and take it out what's remaining x + 15 X you can write 5 times 3 X 25 times 4 y so when you take 5 out what's remaining 3 X + 12 a how do you write 12 B 6 times 2 in here this number given now 6 times 3 18 so here 3 comes there so what's the number here this is 18 now look at this one 12 4 times 3x you get 12 X this one 4 x 2 y you get 8y 4 times 5 z is 
,,20 Z when you take 4 out what's remaining 3 x - 2 y + 5 this one you have to check the common fat here 5x is there how will you get 30 from five six times 5x now you can take six out six times for 24 so for y there six times three you get 18 and here we missed one black what's that six times when you take six out what's remaining two a plus three question number two write each of the algebraic expressions given below as product of two factors such that one factor is the highest common factor of the terms of the expression so what's the highest one - you can take it out X plus 3y here four is the highest one so 2x plus 3y this one 3 3 times 5 15 3 times 6 18 9 9 27 9 you can take 9x + 3 y 4 and 24 you can take it out P plus 5 cube 12 and 30 get 6 2p plus 5 cube 20 and 30 we can take ten out to weigh and three be 36 and 54 what's the number 18 if you can't figure out you just do it 36 is 2 times 18 so 18 times 254 when you divide by 2 you get 27 divided by 3 9 again this one so here 3 times 3 times 2 18 18 times 3 so 18 you can take it out so 18 times 2a and 18 times 3 B so here 60 and 90 vc10 is common and another 3 so 30 so you can take 
,,30 out so this is 2p + 3 okay Part B what's common 5 is comma take it out what's remaining 2y and here Phi 3 15 12 3 you can take it out and write down the remaining numbers inside 18:12 6 6 you can take it out 3 - 2 M + M 10 2015 5 only 5 - a 4 B + 3 if you can take the highest one out you again check inside whether you can take another fact out then you can do again 989 I can take nine out C minus 2a plus one because nine is nine times 1/12 618 six you can take to D plus one and three see there three six three three is common X plus 2y minus 1 10 4 2 2 is common 5 m 2 n minus 1 so this is 2 times 1 12 8 4 before you can take it or not and then the remaining part you can write so 1 is there 9 3 6 3 3 plus B plus 2 C here is not common it is not there so 3 only a squared to be a so here a also comes to a B plus 3 
,,B squared for 16 12 for is there a is not comments only 4 a squared minus 4a B minus 3 C example number one write minus 15 as a product of two factors such that minus 3 is a factor so minus fifteen if minus 3 is a I can write minus three times five ah to write ten as product of two factors such that minus 2 is a factor so 10 if 
,,I take minus 2 as a factor what's the remaining 1 minus 5 because - and - you get plus 10 write down each of the algebraic expressions given below as a product of two factors such that one factor is a negative now so we'll take a negative number out - for when you take minus 4 this is plus and this is plus so for my second one we'll take minus 8 out so remaining part this is plus plus is there so this becomes minus 3n minus - you get positive and minus 16 is there an so this becomes plus 2 
,,so minus 8 is the factor we have taken it out exercise 7.3 right - 20 as a product of two factors such that minus 4 is what factor if minus 4 is there what's the other factor 4 times 5 no so the other one is plus 5 or you can write just 5 write 12 as product of two factors such that minus 4 is one factor so if this is 12 if I want to take minus 4 what happens to get Plus this should be minus 3 minus 4 times minus 3 you get plus 12 write each algebraic expression given below as a product of 
,,two factors such that one factor is a negative number so we'll take minus four if you take minus 4 this becomes minus 3x minus minus plus and here you get plus y expand and see whether you get the same expression we take minus 4 out this becomes plus 3 and this becomes minus y minus minus plus take minus 4/3 X plus y here minus 
,,3 we'll take it out a minus minus minus plus 5b and this becomes plus 2c what's the common one minus six out to eight so you get minus 12a this is minus because this is plus three beef and this is minus order check on this is for see what's the common factor there 8 minus 8 very japanese peeny this is minus because this is plus 
,,minus minus plus 5q and here - already taken so this is plus 8 times example number one write the expression as a product of two factors so here expression is 18 X 24 XY + 12 X Z so what are the common factors 18 24 12 you can take 6 + XS comic so 6 6 you can take it out when you take 6 6 this becomes 3 6 times 4 so this is 4y + 12 that's 2 Z multiplied and say 6 times 2 12 exa example number two write the expression as product of factors 15 pink.you 45 P Q R + 60 Cuba 15 Q is common so we 
,,take 15 Q out what's remaining please there 15 times 3 is 45 so 3 you have 15 times 4 is 60 so you can write for example 3 write the expression as a product of factors 306 a B and 12a C 3 e is common that's the highest common factor when you take 3 out this becomes 1 remember that 3 a times 1 is 3 this is 2 B and when you take 3 from 12 that's four C so 6 a b + 12 AC you are getting exercise 7.4 write each algebraic expressions given below as a product of two factors now you can take the highest common factor out and write down the remaining part inside the bracket so if this is P 1 plus Q so X is common Y Z plus P chip 3x is comment here when you take 3x that's 1 plus 2y here 15 and 25 and P you can take it out 3q minus 4r this one for people you can't take it out 1 minus 4 Q and then 3r this one what is common to it 1 minus 4 B and minus 4 sick take 5 X out 1 - 2 y + Z because we have taken 5 X out what's common here 3 a B all 3 are commenting 1 - 3 C right each of the following algebraic expressions as a product of two factors establish the accuracy of your answer by simplifying the product so we have to recheck whether you are getting the answer ok so first take the common one highest one highest common factor you get Z minus 2 P now we will check whether we are getting the same thing when you multiply you get X Y Z when you multiply this 1 you get minus 2 X Y P no check X Y P we are getting the same answer this one when you take four weeks out 3 minus 5 I 
,,now multiply and see whether you are getting the same four times three 12 X 4 times 5 20 that's - 20 X Y check whether you are getting the same thing here is come on check it out B plus C minus T multiply and see whether you are getting the same as a B plus AC minus ad so that's correct what's common P is common take it out 1 plus Q plus Q are multiplied and C P into 1 P P into Q P Q and P Q so that's correct take X out P minus y -1 multiply and check whether it's correct X P minus XY minus X so it's true this one what's common to a B now we can't take B to a we'll check it out then this becomes 3 B 4 B squared + 6 C when you multiply what you get 6 a 
,,be 2 times here - a 8a b squared + 6 x - 12 AC no check it's correct join each algebraic expression in Group A with the algebraic expression in Group B which it is equal to so we can expand brackets and find the answer 2 times X 2 X 4 y and so this is the here when you multiply this one 6a + 4 B where 6a + 4 b + 12 C order is not important so we need to find out your 12 C is there 8 a 4 B so this one 5 times 2 so you need to multiply all okay with the outside number 10 a - 5 10 a - 5 5 times 3 15 B so this is this next one 4 times 3 12x minus 8y + 20 z for Pierre or for AP for BP and for P 2 times 5 10 a 10 a minus 2ac 10 a minus 2ac and for a B this one when you multiply two works minus 3 XY 2 X minus 3 XY and here 3 XY square what about the next one 8 a for a B and minus 4 AC 5 times 3 15 XYZ 15 X Y Z Phi times 
,,5 25 XY + 20 X Z 3 times 4 12 X minus 6 XY + 9 XZ this one - x - 4 4 P squared 4 P squared + 2 QR + 2 PQ R so you get this one so you are getting all the answers there complete the table given below original expression and after factoring the expression so that means you have to expand records 12 a 4 x 2 b 8 B 4 x 3 12 a squared what about this one here other way around you have to factorize what's common 9 a calm and you take 9a out one plus 3z squared plus 2 be remaining here you need to 
,,expand 3 times 2 6 a PE 3 times 3 9 and then you get 9 AR and here you get 18 this is also expanding brackets 2 a squared 2 times 3 6 a B and 2 times 2 4 a squared C here 8 is common take it out and X you can take it out when you take 8 X out y plus 3 P + 8 times 5 is 40 so 40 you get Q is there expand 6a be 8 BC and here what's the number your Phi 2 times 5 minus 10 is see here also expand brackets 6 x PQ so we can write in order 6 PQ x 3 times 3 9 9 x squared and 3 times 6 18 PX when you 
,,multiply this one by six 12 XY squared and then 18 XY + 6 x 4 24 z now factorize this one what's common 3 a is common so when you take 3a out B - to be here so 3 minus here to be and here when you take 3 out for see here you can simplify so same term you can first simplify and write down this 1 s 3 a B minus 2 B - B this is also correct last one what's common for X is common take it out for X you get 2y minus 3 P 4 times 3 12 X P then minus 4 take it out 5 a y so for X and this one you get 
,,20 a X well again fill in the blanks algebraic expression is there one factor and you ask to write down the other factor so 4 is a factor then what's the other one when you take 4 this becomes minus 6 and plus 3 here you can write 3 - X as well or day is not important so you can write 3 minus 6 or so minus 4 when you take it out what's remaining we can take minus 4 then this becomes plus 6 and here minus X minus 3 now to take it out when you take two out this becomes minus three X and minus four Y goes - - is it correct no this is plus 2 this becomes plus if you take minus 2 X out this is plus so 3 you get 3 times - ok then this is minus means this is 
,,- take 2 X out 2 times 4 so 4 1 multiply and say 2 minus 2 and minus 4 plus 8 X for this one take 2 out when you take positive 2 out - II here plus 2 B you get 4 B and when you take - from minus 6 plus 2 it becomes minus 3 C so you get minus 6 C now we'll take - two out so when you take minus 2 out this becomes plus a and here you get minus 2 P minus 2 B and minus 2 you get plus 4b and - is there this becomes plus so when you take minus 2 this is 3 C so minus 2 times 3 C - 6 C now take - 3 
,,B from here so what's the remaining part this becomes positive and this is also positive a plus 3 so multiply and see - 3 B a or 3 a B and minus 9 B here 2x Y comma 
,,then this becomes 1 - two times four four Z because that's - now here you can take whatever the highest common factors what's the highest common factor five Y we can take so we'll take five Y as the highest common factor so what's remaining you get X plus two here Y you have already taken two X and here to pee now again can you 
,,see same jump d15 XY + 10 X Y both are like terms so you can add it here so X + 2 X you get 3x + 2 P now multiply and see 5 times 3 15 X Y so these two 15 XY + 5 I + 2 P you get 10 XP is it correct here this one and this one 10 P Y so that's correct so we covered all theory part related to factors so what's the main topic we did finding highest common factor so take the highest common factor as one factor and the expression which is obtained by dividing each term of the algebraic expression by the highest common factor as the other factor and write the algebraic expression as a product of these two factors so that means when you want to factorize what 
,,you do take the highest common factor and write down the remaining part inside the bracket so practice all the exercises and examples and thorough with finding factors

Number Partens,cLP7INqs3JM,So let's talk a little bit
,,about rational numbers. And the simple way to think
,,about it is any number that can be represented as
,,"the ratio of two integers is a rational number. So for example, any integer"
,,is a rational number. 1 can be represented as 1/1 or
,,"as negative 2 over negative 2 or as 10,000/10,000. In all of these cases, these are"
,,"all different representations of the number 1,"
,,ratio of two integers. And I obviously can
,,have an infinite number of representations
,,"of 1 in this way, the same number over"
,,the same number. The number negative 7 could be
,,"represented as negative 7/1, or 7 over negative 1, or"
,,"negative 14 over positive 2. And I could go on, and"
,,"on, and on, and on. So negative 7 is definitely"
,,a rational number. It can be represented as
,,the ratio of two integers. But what about things
,,"that are not integers? For example, let us imagine--"
,,"oh, I don't know-- 3.75. How can we represent that as"
,,"the ratio of two integers? Well, 3.75, you"
,,"could rewrite that as 375/100, which is the"
,,"same thing as 750/200. Or you could say, hey,"
,,3.75 is the same thing as 3 and 3/4-- so let
,,me write it here-- which is the same
,,"thing as-- that's 15/4. 4 times 3 is 12, plus 3 is"
,,"15, so you could write this. This is the same thing as 15/4. Or we could write this as"
,,negative 30 over negative 8. I just multiplied the
,,"numerator and the denominator here by negative 2. But just to be clear,"
,,this is clearly rational. I'm giving you multiple
,,examples of how this can be represented as
,,"the ratio of two integers. Now, what about"
,,"repeating decimals? Well, let's take"
,,"maybe the most famous of the repeating decimals. Let's say you have 0.333, just"
,,"keeps going on and on forever, which we can denote by"
,,putting that little bar on top of the 3. This is 0.3 repeating. And we've seen--
,,and later we'll show how you can convert
,,any repeating decimal as the ratio of two integers--
,,this is clearly 1/3. Or maybe you've seen things like
,,"0.6 repeating, which is 2/3. And there's many, many,"
,,many other examples of this. And we'll see any
,,"repeating decimal, not just one digit repeating. Even if it has a million"
,,"digits repeating, as long as the pattern"
,,starts to repeat itself over and over and
,,"over again, you can always represent that as"
,,the ratio of two integers. So I know what you're
,,"probably thinking. Hey, Sal, you've"
,,just included a lot. You've included all
,,of the integers. You've included all of finite
,,"non-repeating decimals, and you've also included"
,,repeating decimals. What is left? Are there any numbers
,,that are not rational? And you're probably
,,"guessing that there are, otherwise people"
,,wouldn't have taken the trouble of trying to
,,label these as rational. And it turns out-- as you
,,can imagine-- that actually some of the most famous
,,numbers in all of mathematics are not rational. And we call these numbers
,,irrational numbers. And I've listed there
,,just a few of the most noteworthy examples. Pi-- the ratio of
,,the circumference to the diameter of a circle--
,,is an irrational number. It never terminates. It goes on and on and on
,,"forever, and it never repeats. e, same thing-- never"
,,"terminates, never repeats. It comes out of continuously"
,,compounding interest. It comes out of
,,"complex analysis. e shows up all over the place. Square root of 2,"
,,"irrational number. Phi, the golden ratio,"
,,irrational number. So these things that
,,"really just pop out of nature, many of these"
,,"numbers are irrational. Now, you might say, OK,"
,,are these irrational? These are just these
,,special kind of numbers. But maybe most
,,"numbers are rational, and Sal's just picked out"
,,some special cases here. But the important thing to
,,"realize is they do seem exotic, and they are exotic"
,,in certain ways. But they aren't uncommon. It actually turns out
,,that there is always an irrational number between
,,"any two rational numbers. Well, we could go on and on. There's actually"
,,"an infinite number. But there's at least one,"
,,so that gives you an idea that you can't
,,really say that there are fewer irrational numbers
,,than rational numbers. And in a future
,,"video, we'll prove that you give me two rational"
,,"numbers-- rational 1, rational 2-- there's going to be"
,,"at least one irrational number between those, which"
,,"is a neat result, because irrational"
,,numbers seem to be exotic. Another way to think about it--
,,"I took the square root of 2, but you take the square root"
,,"of any non-perfect square, you're going to end up"
,,with an irrational number. You take the sum
,,of an irrational and a rational number-- and
,,we'll see this later on. We'll prove it to ourselves. The sum of an irrational
,,and a rational is going to be irrational. The product of an
,,"irrational and a rational is going to be irrational. So there's a lot, a lot, a"
,,lot of irrational numbers out there.
,,
Number Partens,5jwXThH6fg4,What I want to do in this
,,"video is introduce you to the idea of Sigma notation,"
,,which will be used extensively through your
,,mathematical career. So let's just say you wanted
,,"to find a sum of some terms, and these terms have a pattern. So let's say you want to"
,,find the sum of the first 10 numbers. So you could say 1
,,"plus 2 plus 3 plus, and you go all the"
,,way to plus 9 plus 10. And I clearly could have even
,,"written this whole thing out, but you can imagine it becomes"
,,a lot harder if you wanted to find the sum of
,,the first 100 numbers. So that would be 1
,,"plus 2 plus 3 plus, and you would go all"
,,"the way to 99 plus 100. So mathematicians said, well,"
,,"let's find some notation, instead of having to do this"
,,dot dot dot thing-- which you will see sometimes
,,done-- so that we can more cleanly express
,,these types of sums. And that's where Sigma
,,"notation comes from. So this sum up here, right"
,,"over here, this first one, it could be"
,,"represented as Sigma. Use a capital Sigma, this"
,,Greek letter right over here. And what you do is
,,you define an index. And you could start your
,,index at some value. So let's say your
,,index starts at 1. I'll just use i for index. So let's say that i starts at
,,"1, and I'm going to go to 10. So i starts at 1,"
,,and it goes to 10. And I'm going to sum up the i's. So how does this translate
,,"into this right over here? Well, what you do is you"
,,start wherever the index is. If the index is at
,,"1, set i equal to 1. Write the 1 down, and then"
,,you increment the index. And so i will then
,,be equal to 2. i is 2. Put the 2 down. And you're summing each
,,of these terms as you go. And you go all the way
,,until i is equal to 10. So given what I just
,,"told you, I encourage you to pause this video and"
,,write the Sigma notation for this sum right over here. Assuming you've
,,"given a go at it, well, this would be the sum. The first term,"
,,"well, it might be easy to just say we'll"
,,start at i equals 1 again. But now we're not going to
,,"stop until i equals 100, and we're going to"
,,sum up all of the i's. Let's do another example. Let's imagine the sum from
,,"i equals 0 to 50 of-- I don't know, let me"
,,"say-- pi i squared. What would this sum look like? And once again, I encourage"
,,"you to pause the video and write it out,"
,,"expand out this sum. Well, let's just"
,,"go step by step. When i equals 0, this will"
,,"be pi times 0 squared. And that's clearly 0,"
,,"but I'll write it out. pi times 0 squared. Then we increase our i. And, well, we make sure"
,,"that we haven't hit this, that our i isn't already"
,,this top boundary right over here
,,or this top value. So now we said i
,,"equals 1, pi times 1 squared-- so plus"
,,"pi times 1 squared. Well, is 1 our top value right"
,,"over here, where we stop? No. So we keep going. So then we go i"
,,"equals 2, pi times 2 squared-- so plus"
,,pi times 2 squared. I think you see
,,the pattern here. And we're just going to
,,"keep going all the way until, at some point-- we're"
,,going to keeping incrementing our i. i is going to be 49. So it's going to be
,,pi times 49 squared. And then finally we increment
,,"i. i equal becomes 50, and so we're going to have"
,,"plus pi times 50 squared. And then we say,"
,,"OK, our i is finally equal to this top boundary,"
,,and now we can stop. And so you can
,,"see this notation, this Sigma notation for this"
,,"sum was a much cleaner way, a much purer way,"
,,of representing this than having to write
,,out the entire sum. But you'll see people switch
,,back and forth between the two.

Number Partens,DaQlieZH1kk,"In this video, we're going"
,,to multiply 36 times 27. So we're multiplying
,,a two-digit number times another two-digit number. And the way that
,,we're going to tackle it is we're going to
,,"first multiply 36 times 7, figure out what that is. Then we're going to"
,,"multiply 36 times 20, figure out what that"
,,"is, and then add those two numbers together. And what I want to do is"
,,"first do this, just show you the process for how to"
,,multiply these two numbers. And then I'm going
,,to do it again where we're going to
,,think a little bit more about what the different
,,numbers represent. So first let's start
,,with the process. So I'm going to multiply
,,36 times 7 or 7 times 36. So I can start in
,,"the ones place. 7 times 6 is 42. Write the 2 down here. And then the 4,"
,,"which represents 40, I can put in the tens place. 7 times 3 is 21, plus 4 is 25. So I could write the"
,,25 right over here. There's no place
,,"to carry this 2, so I just wrote the 2 right"
,,over here in the hundreds place. Now let's move over. So let me clean this up
,,so we don't get confused. So we just figured out
,,what 7 times 36 is. It is 252. Now let's worry about
,,what 36 times 20 is. And so what we're
,,going to do is we're going to throw a
,,"0 right over here, because we're now"
,,going to multiply 36 times something
,,in the tens place. This isn't just a 2. This is a 20. So let's just go with
,,the digits right now and then we'll think about
,,"it in terms of place value the second time around. 2 times 6 is 12. Write the 2 right over here. Carry the 1. 2 times 3 is 6, plus 1 is 7. So we just figured out    "
,,that 36 times 20 is 720. And just think about
,,what would've happened if we didn't put the 0 here. Then we would have figured
,,"out that 36 times 2 is 72, but this 2 isn't just a 2. This is a 20. So 36 times 20 is 720. And now we can add these two"
,,things because 36 times 27 is the same thing as 36
,,times 20 plus 36 times 7. So let's add these
,,two numbers together. 2 plus 0 is 2. 5 plus 2 is 7. 2 plus 7 is 9. And we get 972. Now I'm going to do this
,,"exact same problem again. But this time, I'm"
,,going to really talk about what these
,,"digits represent. Hopefully the first pass,"
,,you kind of saw the process for doing it. Now we're going to think about
,,what these digits actually represent. So we're going to
,,multiply 36 times 7. So 7 times 6 is 42. We would write the 2 in the
,,"ones place, and then the 40 we can write in the tens place. This 4 represents 40. 7 times 30 is 210,"
,,plus 40 is 250. And we already had that 2 in
,,"the ones place, so we get 252. 36 times 7 is 252. Now let's clean this up. Now let's multiply-- 20 times"
,,6 is going to give us 120. So let's write the
,,"20 in the tens place, and then carry the 100, or carry"
,,"the 1, which represents 100. Now, 2 times-- or I"
,,should say 20 times 30 is going to give you
,,"600, plus one more 100 is going to give you 700. So we just figured out"
,,that 36 times 20 is 720. The 7 is in the hundreds
,,"place, 2 in the tens place. And then we can add again. And just like we did the"
,,"last time, we got 972."

Number Partens,ku4KOFQ-bB4,"For as long as human beings have been around we've been counting things, and we've been looking for ways to keep track and represent those things that "
,,"we counted. So, for example if you were an early human and you were trying to keep track of the days since it last rained you might say okay let's see it didn't rain today so one day has gone by, and we now use the word one, but they might have not used it back then. Now another day goes by. Then another day goes by. Then another day goes by. Another day goes by. Another day goes by. Another day goes by, then it rained. And so when his friend comes he says, ""Well, how long has it been since we last rained."" Well you would say, ""Well, this is how many days it's been."" And your friend would say, ""Okay, I think I have a general sense of that."" And at some point they probably realized that it's useful to have names for these. So they would call this one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Obviously every language in "
,,"the world has different names for these. I'm sure there are lost languages that had other names for them. But very quickly you start to realize that this is a pretty bulky way of representing numbers. One it takes a long time to write down. It takes up a lot of space, and then later if someone wants to read the number they have "
,,"to sit here and count. It's hard enough with seven, but you could imagine if there were what we call 27 of it, or 1000 of it. Then it would take up, possibly, a whole page and even when you counted you might make a mistake. And to solve this human beings have invented number systems. And it's something that"
,,"we take for granted. You might say, ""Oh, isn't that just the way you've always counted? But hopefully over the course of this video you'll start to appreciate the beauty of a number system and to realize our number system isn't the only number system that is around. The number system that most of us are familiar with is the base 10 number system. Often called the decimal, the decimal number system. And why 10? Well probably because we have 10 fingers. Or most of us have 10 fingers. So, it was very natural to think in terms of bundles of 10 or to have 10 symbols. So however many bundles you have you can use your fingers and eventually your symbols to think"
,,"about how many there are. And since we needed 10 symbols we came up with zero,"
,,"one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. These 10 digits, these are our 10 symbols that we use in the base 10 system. To just give us a little bit of a "
,,"reminder how we use them imagine the number 231. So, 231. 231. What does this represent? Well, what's neat about number systems is we have place value. This place all the way to the right, this is the ones place. This is the ones place. This literally means one, one. One bundle of one. So, this is one, one right over here. This "
,,"right over here,"
,,"this is in the 10s place. This is in the 10s place. This three here,"
,,"literally means three 10s. So this literally means three 10s. And this two here, this two here is in the 100s place. It's in the 100s place. So, this represent two 100s. You add them together and once again I'm still thinking in base 10, you'd get 231. This is two 100s plus three 10s plus one. In our base 10 system notice every "
,,"time we move to the left we're thinking in bundles of 10 of the space to the right. So, this is the ones place. You multiply by 10, you"
,,"go to the 10s place. You want to go to the next place you multiply by 10 again. You get the 100s place. If you're familiar with exponents, one is the same thing     "
,,as 10 to the zero power. 10 is the same thing as
,,10 to the first power. So this is the 10s place. Three tens. And 100 is the same thing as 10 to the second power. Obviously we could keep going on and on and on and 
,,"on and on. That is the power of the base 10 system. So, you might be curious now. ""Well, what if this wasn't 10 here? What if we did, let's just go as simple as we can. You can almost view this as a base one system. You only have one symbol right over here. But what if we went to something slightly more complex, a base two system. You'd be happy to know that not only can we do this, but the base two system often called the binary system. This is called the decimal system. The base two system often called the binary system is the basis of all modern computing. It's the underlying mathematics and operations that computers perform are based on binary. And in binary you have two symbols. You have zero and you have one. The reason why this is"
,,"useful for computation is because all the hardware that we use to make our modern computers, all of the transistors and the logic gates they either result in        "
,,"an on or an off state. On or an off state. And so what we do is when you use your calculator or whatever you might be operating in base 10, but underlying everything it is doing the operations in binary. But you might say well how do we actually think in terms of binary? Well, we can construct"
,,"similar places here, but instead of them being powers of 10 they're going to be powers of two. So, let's set up some places here. So, all the way on the right two to the zero power is still one. So we can still call that the ones place. Then we can move to the left of that. We can move to the left of that. That would be two to the first power. So we could call that the twos place, and I can even write it out if I want. Twos place instead of the 10s place. Then I could keep going. Instead of this space being the 10 to the second or the 100s place, it will be the two to the second, or the fours place. And I can keep going. I encourage you actually to pause the video and try to build this out for yourself. What would this be? Well this would be two to the third, or the eights place. Notice every time we're doing this we're multiplying by two. Everytime we go to the left, just like we multiplied by 10 here. So notice everywhere you see this 10s we're now dealing with twos. Let's "
,,"keep going. Let's keep going and then we can actually represent this number using binary. So, let's do that. So, this right over here I've already used that color. This right over here, this is two to the fourth. We could call that the 16s place. Then we could have -- I'll reuse some of these colors. This is two to the fifth. We could call this the 32s place. Then we can go two to the sixth. We can call that, multiply by two again, or two to the six is 64. So this is the 64s place. Tells us how many 64s we"
,,"have. Zero or one 64s. We'll see that in a second. Then we can go over here. This would be two to the seventh. That would be the 128s place. And we can obviously keep going on and on and on, but this"
,,"should be enough for me to represent this number. In future videos I will show you how to do that, but let's actually represent the number. It turns out that this number in decimal can be represented as 11100111 in binary. What does this mean? This means you have one 128 plus one 64, plus one 32, plus no 16s, plus no eights, plus one four, plus one two, plus one one. So you can see that these are going to be the same thing. Notice, this is one 128. So it's 128, plus 64, plus 32. We have zero 16s, zero eights. So we're not going to add those. Plus four, one four. Plus one two. Plus one one. And add these together, and once again when we're doing this, when I'm writing it this way I'm kind of using the number system that we're most familiar with. We're most used to"
,,"doing the operations in, but when you do it you will see that this is the exact same number as 231. This is just another representation. One isn't better than the other. The only reason why I converted this is this is what I'm used to thinking in. It's what I'm used to doing operations in. So, hopefully you find"
,,"that pretty interesting. To me, this kind of opened my mind to the power of even our decimal system. In future videos we'll explore other number systems. The most used ones, base 10 is used very heavily, binary and there's also hexadecimal where you don't have two digits or not 10 digits,"
,,but you have 16 digits. And we'll explore those in future videos and how to convert between or rewrite the the different representations
,,and different bases.

Number Partens,HXg_a9oJ5nA,The following graph represents
,,"the first five terms of two given patterns. In the answer box, there"
,,"are different statements about the two patterns. Choose all correct statements. So here, for each point,"
,,"this point right over here, this represents its"
,,horizontal coordinate is the first term of
,,"pattern A, which is 4. And its vertical coordinate"
,,"is the first term in pattern B, which is 1. And then we could do that"
,,"for the other points as well. So actually, let's figure"
,,out what the values are. So we have pattern A and
,,then we have pattern B. So the first term
,,"for pattern A is 4. And when pattern A is 4, the"
,,first term for pattern B is 1. The second term
,,for pattern A is 7. And when pattern A is
,,"7, pattern B is also 7. Third term, pattern A is"
,,"10, and pattern B is 13. And then the fourth"
,,"term, pattern A is 13, and pattern B is 19. And then finally, fifth"
,,"term, pattern A is 16, and pattern B is 25. Now, before even"
,,"looking at these, let's see what we can think"
,,about these patterns here. So it looks like
,,"pattern A starts at 4, and it increases"
,,by 3 every time. To go from one term to the
,,"next, you just have to add 3. Now, what about for pattern B? Well pattern B starts at"
,,"1, and every term here it looks like you're adding 6. So when pattern A"
,,increases by 3 and we're moving in the horizontal
,,direction based on the fact that pattern A is represented
,,"on the horizontal axis, we're going to move up"
,,"6 in the vertical axis, and we see that here. Pattern A increases by 3"
,,from one term to the next. And when that increased
,,"by 3, pattern B increased by 6 from"
,,one term to the next. And we see that it
,,"keeps doing that. Now, let's think about"
,,what we have over here to see which of these statements
,,actually apply to this. For every term in pattern
,,"A, multiply the term by 2 and then subtract 7 to get the"
,,corresponding term from pattern B. So let's see
,,"if that holds up. So according to this,"
,,"if this was true, I should be able to take"
,,"this, multiply it by 2 and subtract 7 and get that. So let's see. Is 1 equal to 2 times 8 minus 7? Sorry, 2 times 4 minus 7. So 2 times this number,"
,,"2 times 4 minus 7. Well, 8 minus 7 is equal to 1. Is this right over here equal"
,,"to 2 times this 7 minus 7? Well, yeah, it's equal to 7. Is 13 equal to 2"
,,"times 10 minus 7? Well, yeah, 20 minus 7 is 13. Is 19 equal to 2"
,,times 13 minus 7? 26 minus 7 is 19. Is 25 equal to 2
,,"times 16 minus 7? Well, 32 minus 7 is 25. So this first"
,,"statement checks out. For the corresponding term,"
,,the value of pattern B is two times the value
,,of pattern A minus 7. Now let's look at
,,the second one. The terms of
,,pattern B are always greater than or equal to
,,"their corresponding terms from pattern A. Well,"
,,"no, that's not right. It's true for a"
,,"couple of scenarios. Here for the third,"
,,"fourth, and fifth term, or actually for the second,"
,,"third, fourth, and fifth terms, pattern B is equal to or"
,,greater than pattern A. But for the first
,,"term, it's not true. Pattern A is greater,"
,,so this is not right. To get from each
,,"point to the next, you need to move 3 units to"
,,"the right and 6 units up. Well, that's exactly"
,,what we talked about. From one term to
,,"the next, pattern A, along our horizontal"
,,"axis, we increased by 3, while pattern B, which is"
,,"plotted on our vertical axis, by 6. So you move 3 to"
,,the right and 6 up. So that is right. The second terms of
,,"both patterns are 7. Well, yeah, we see"
,,"that right over here. The second terms are 7. We have 7 here, and"
,,we have 7 there. And so that is right as well. So the only one that doesn't
,,apply is this second one. This is not right.
,,
Number Partens,ClYdw4d4OmA,In this video we're going
,,to talk a little bit about order of operations. And I want you to pay close
,,attention because really everything else that you're
,,going to do in mathematics is going to be based on you
,,having a solid grounding in order of operations. So what do we even mean when
,,we say order of operations? So let me give you an example. The whole point is so that we
,,have one way to interpret a mathematical statement. So let's say I have the
,,mathematical statement 7 plus 3 times 5. Now if we didn't all agree on
,,"order of operations, there would be two ways of"
,,interpreting this statement. You could just read it left to
,,"right, so you could say well, let me just take 7 plus 3, you"
,,"could say 7 plus 3 and then multiply that times 5. And 7 plus 3 is 10, and then"
,,"you multiply that by 5. 10 times 5, it"
,,would get you 50. So that's one way you would
,,interpret it if we didn't agree on an order of operations. Maybe it's a natural way. You just go left to right. Another way you could interpret
,,"it you say, I like to do multiplication before"
,,I do addition. So you might interpret it as --
,,I'll try to color code it -- 7 plus -- and you do
,,"the 3 times 5 first. 7 plus 3 times 5, which would"
,,"be 7 plus 3 times 5 is 15, and 7 plus 15 is 22. So notice, we interpreted"
,,this statement in two different ways. This was just straight left
,,to right doing addition then the multiplication. This way we did the
,,"multiplication first then the addition, we got two different"
,,"answers, and that's just not cool in mathematics. If this was part of some effort"
,,to send something to the moon because two people interpreted
,,it a different way or another one computer interpreted one
,,"way and another computer interpreted it another way, the"
,,satellite might go to mars. So this is just completely
,,"unacceptable, and that's why we have to have an agreed"
,,upon order of operations. An agreed upon way to
,,interpret this statement. So the agreed upon order of
,,operations is to do parentheses first -- let me write it over
,,here -- then do exponents. If you don't know what
,,exponents are don't worry about it right now. In this video we're not going
,,"to have any exponents in our examples, so you don't"
,,really have to worry about them for this video. Then you do multiplication --
,,"I'll just right mult, short for multiplication -- then you do"
,,"multiplication and division next, they kind of have the"
,,same level of priority. And then finally you do
,,addition and subtraction. So what does this order of
,,"operations -- let me label it -- this right here,"
,,that is the agreed upon order of operations. If we follow these order of
,,operations we should always get to the same answer
,,for a given statement. So what does this tell us? What is the best way to
,,interpret this up here? Well we have no parentheses --
,,parentheses look like that. Those little curly
,,things around numbers. We don't have any
,,parentheses here. I'll do some examples that
,,do have parentheses. We don't have any
,,exponents here. But we do have some
,,multiplication and division or we actually just have
,,"some multiplication. So we'll order of operations,"
,,do the multiplication and division first. So it says do the
,,multiplication first. That's a multiplication. So it says do this
,,operation first. It gets priority over
,,addition or subtraction. So if we do this first we
,,"get the 3 times 5, which is 15, and then we add the 7. The addition or subtraction --"
,,"I'll do it here, addition, we just have addition. Just like that. So we do the multiplication"
,,"first, get 15, then add the 7, 22. So based upon the agreed order"
,,"of operations, this right here is the correct answer. The correct way to"
,,interpret this statement. Let's do another example. I think it'll make things a
,,"little bit more clear, and I'll do the example in pink. So let's say I have 7 plus 3 --"
,,I'll put some parentheses there -- times 4 divided by
,,2 minus 5 times 6. So there's all sorts of crazy
,,"things here, but if you just follow the order of operations"
,,you'll simplify it in a very clean way and hopefully we'll
,,all get the same answer. So let's just follow the
,,order of operations. The first thing we have to
,,"do is look for parentheses. Are there parentheses here? Yes, there are. There's parentheses"
,,"around the 7 plus 3. So it says let's do that first. So 7 plus 3 is 10. So this we can simplify,"
,,"just looking at this order operations, to"
,,10 times all of that. Let me copy and paste
,,that so I don't have to keep re-writing it. So that simplifies to
,,10 times all of that. We did our parentheses first. Then what do we do? There are no more parentheses
,,"in this expression. Then we should do exponents. I don't see any exponents here,"
,,"and if you're curious what exponents look like, an"
,,exponent would look like 7 squared. You'd see these little small
,,numbers up in the top right. We don't have any exponents
,,here so we don't have to worry about it. Then it says to do
,,multiplication and division next. So where do we see
,,"multiplication? We have a multiplication,"
,,"a division, a multiplication again. Now, when you have multiple"
,,"operations at the same level, when our order of operations,"
,,"multiplication and division are the same level, then"
,,you do left to right. So in this situation you're
,,going to multiply by 4 and then divide by 2. You won't multiply
,,by 4 divided by 2. Then we'll do the 5 times
,,6 before we do the subtraction right here. So let's figure
,,out what this is. So we'll do this
,,multiplication first. We could simultaneously do this
,,multiplication because it's not going to change things. But I'll do things
,,one step at a time. So the next step we're going
,,"to do is this 10 times 4. 10 times 4 is 40. 10 times 4 is 40, then you"
,,"have 40 divided by 2 and it simplifies to that right there. Remember, multiplication and"
,,"division, they're at the exact same level so we're going"
,,to do it left to right. You could also express this as
,,"multiplying by 1/2 and then it wouldn't matter the order. But for simplicity,"
,,multiplication and division go left to right. So then you have 40 divided
,,"by 2 minus 5 times 6. So, division, you just"
,,"have one division here, you want to do that. You have this division and you"
,,"have this multiplication, they're not together so you"
,,can actually kind of do them simultaneously. And to make it clear that you
,,do this before you do the subtraction because
,,multiplication and division take priority over addition and
,,"subtraction, we could put parentheses around them to say"
,,"look, we're going to do that and that first before I do that"
,,"subtraction, because multiplication and"
,,division have priority. So 40 divided by 2 is 20. We're going to have that minus
,,"sign, minus 5 times 6 is 30. 20 minus 30 is equal"
,,to negative 10. And that is the correct
,,interpretation of that. So I want to make something
,,"very, very, very clear. If you have things at the same"
,,"level, so if you have 1 plus 2 minus 3 plus 4 minus 1. So addition and subtraction are"
,,"all the same level in order of operations, you should"
,,go left to right. So you should interpret this as
,,"1 plus 2 is 3, so this is the same thing as 3 minus"
,,3 plus 4 minus 1. Then you do 3 minus 3
,,is 0 plus 4 minus 1. Or this is the same thing
,,"as 4 minus 1, which is the same thing as 3. You just go left to right. Same thing if you have"
,,"multiplication and division, they're at the same level. So if you have 4 times 2"
,,"divided by 3 times 2, you do 4 times 2 is 8"
,,"divided by 3 times 2. And you say 8 divided by 3 is,"
,,"well, we got a fraction there. It would be 8/3. So this would be 8/3 times 2. And then 8/3 times to"
,,is equal to 16 over 3. That's how you interpret it. You don't do this
,,multiplication first or divide the 2 by that and all of that. Now the one time where you can
,,"be loosey-goosey with order of operations, if you have all"
,,addition or all multiplication. So if you have 1 plus 5 plus 7
,,"plus 3 plus 2, it does not matter what order you do it in. You can do the 2 plus 3, you"
,,"can go from the right to the left, you can go from the"
,,"left to the right, you could start some place in between. If it's only all addition. And the same thing is true if"
,,you have all multiplication. It's 1 times 5 times
,,7 times 3 times 2. It does not matter what
,,order you're doing it. But it's only with all
,,multiplication or all addition. If there was some division
,,"in here, if there's some subtraction in here, you're"
,,best off just going left to right.

Number Partens,OMgsimpghnU,right let's have a look at what we've got yet they told us to study the number sentence below and answer the questions okay great let's first studied and answer the 
,,questions they gave us five eight and 11 well I don't know what you noticed but the first thing that I noticed is that for you to move from five to eight we need to 
,,add three and to move from eight to eleven we need to add three again okay so let's just think about that okay what do we call that number is the common difference now why a difference because actually to find it you actually win term two minus term one which is 8 minus 5 which is 3 and if you take the third term by the way that's how we write it I term three minus term two again would be 11 minus 8 which is three so because we're subtracting this value here is called your common difference so your difference is actually equal to 3 if we would go to our table that we've got right at the top here what I've done is I first made a column which is very useful for you which shows the position of the term which will be in this guy's term 1 2 & 3 and then the value of the term which is actually the sequence that I've given you which will be 5 8 and 11 now the reason why I've done that it's because I really saw that the first question they asked us is to write a formula to describe the relationship between the position of the term in the sequence which they labeled in and the value of the term which they labeled T okay now whenever there are XI 
,,to write a formula a formula means that you have to find the position of the term to the term relationship now what we've done so far is we found a term to term relationship term to term means how do I move from the first term to the second term from the second term to the third term that's how a term to term relationship it's very useful but for you to now find the 90th term for instance it's an absolute disaster because you'll have to write down all the terms adding three every until you 
,,get to the 90th term and as you've probably noticed in any math test time is a serious problem for us so that's not gonna work so you'll have to make use of your second option here which is your position two term relationship which means what is the relationship between one and five and what is the position between two and eight and three and eleven I can the first thing I can tell you here is whenever you have a sequence with a common difference okay like we have here there is a common difference D is three okay when you're writing down your formula you will definitely have a three in in your formula which means they will always be d x in in your formula in that will be then plus or minus something else will be added to that but you definitely know that you're going to have three in your formula all we need to discover is what is added on or subtracted here okay cool so let's write out number sentences term one would then be three terms what plus what to end up with five because that is our first term okay so if we are going to go three in we're gonna say 3 times 1 because that is our immediate aesthetic and it's I like that let's start in at this stage which was your in V I can I'd max inside so now we'll say three times what 1 is 3 plus what gives us 5 while definitely plus 2 a Canary's check for our second term we've got 3 times to remember our second term is equal to 8 3 times 2 gives our 6 6 plus what gives us I'd it's 2 again you see we can pretty much see what our formula gonna be it's probably gonna be 3 in plus 2i but let's just make sure let's check the third guy term 3 is going to be equal to 3 x 3 which is 9 we've gotta end up with an 11 if we add 2 to that 9 plus 2 is 11 you see pops your uncle this is your formula so your formula is simply going to be T in equals to 3 in plus two so that's the important thing to remember if you look at your sequencing you see you've got a common difference which means you keep on adding something or subtracting something then you know that the in part of your formula will always be your difference x in okay right Melissa will have a look at the next question in the next question they say now what is the value of the 19th term we know that you've got the formula now what is the value of the 90th term okay so what is important is to know that they've given us the position of the term so they gave us the value of in they told us that in is equal to 90 if you look at our table here we have that number we are looking for the value of the term so we're simply going to use our formula that's why we've got a formula by the way because if you didn't have a formula you would have had to keep on adding three adding three adding three until you get to the 90th term I guess let's take our formula we're finding the value of the term and we're gonna go three in the price of the end I'm gonna substitute a ninety plus two so TN which represents the value of my term as then three times 
,,ninety which has two and a 70 plus two which will then give me 272 so now you know that term 90 is equal to 272 great next one which term has the value of 50 okay so now they gave us the value of the term so they gave us the teapot or the TN pot they're looking for the position of the term now only two variables in the sequence 
,,as a we'd obviously looking here for the position of the term there are only two variables in this sequence which means they're either going to ask you for the value and give you the position or they're going to give you the position or for the value occur right so let's have a look please for in 50 year and we are solving for the in that is the letter that we are going to isolate here so a simple linear equation the first thing you need to do is you need to get rid of your other terms which it's my plus two so mathematically what I do is I'm going to subtract two from each side I know that's not what you do all you do is you say I take the two across 
,,the equal side to the other side but unfortunately I have to do the right thing so I've got to explain to you mathematically what you're actually doing but we're gonna end up at the same point you are also going to end up with fifty minus two as 48 on the left hand side equals to three in on the right hand side because two minus two is zero so now an indicator of the three it's three multiplied by M so we do the inverse operation we divide by three so I'm going to end up within to be equal 
,,to sixteen right so term 16 is actually equal to 50 and then ask us which term has a value of 15 it's the 16th term right in this listen I want to show you how to work with a very special type of a number sequence and this is the fractional number sequence but this is a very special one because you turn to move from the one term to the next term in terms of the entire fraction you separate the numerators and the denominators if you for instance look at this one yet if you look at your numerators which means your numbers at the top you've got a 1 a 3 and a 5 now that's quite easy to see that we have a difference here of 2 which means we actually add 2 every time to get to the next term 3 to 5 you also add 2 to move to that next terms which means we can actually say we have a difference here of 2 because 3 minus 1 gives me 2 and 5 minus 3 gives me 2 now if you look at your denominators there you've got a 2 a 5 and 8 what a simple sequence if you just look at it like that where 
,,you move from them one term to the next by simply adding a 3 from 5 to 8 again we just add a 3 so here in the denominator we have another comment difference I'm just gonna call that D 1 and that will then be equal to 3 now the first question was to write down the fourth term now that'll be quite easy for us now because we've found out how to move from one term to the next so we know what our term to term formula is here we simply add a 2 to the numerator and a 3 to the denominator right so 
,,let's go let's write down our third term which was 5 over 8 so now to get to the next one I'm simply going to go and add 2 at the top and add 3 at the bottom so my new term would be 5 plus 2 is 7 8 plus 3 is 11 okay that's simple enough okay let's move to the next question now here it comes right down an algebraic rule to describe the pattern separate rules for the numerator and the denominator will be required so now here we must remember that when we have an algebraic rule we're actually 
,,connecting the position of the term to the value of the term so this is a position to term formula but we've already found out quite a lot remember we looked at our 
,,tops our fourth one now as well and we looked at our denominators our bottoms and what we did was we said in their numerators we have a common difference of two and 
,,in the denominators we have a common difference of three so when we're gonna write down a formula we've discovered before in one of the previous videos I told you this little trick that when you have a common difference in your formula you're you would have d x in would be part of your formula so if you would for instance look at the whole formula for this entire fraction at the top you'll have the common difference of two x in so two in will appear somewhere here in your formula whereas in the denominator you would have d x in my d is a three so I will have three in some way here and my formula but that will be my numerator and again here I've got my 
,,denominator right so let's have a look if we look at our numerators we've got one three five seven now I know for my first term I'm going to have to multiply it by one gives me two but I'm supposed to end up with a one so I'm gonna subtract one and that will give me a 1 so at this stage I'm saying the formulas to n minus 1 but I can't just say that I I need to check let's go for the second term 2 times 2 now which is four minus one gives me three is that correct yes my second term is three 
,,let's go for my third term I'm gonna go two times three is six minus one gives me five yes it's correct I can pretty pretty much go and say that TN is equal to two in minus one okay so that's my formula for the top let me just quickly get rid of those little dots and there we go my formula for my numerator will be 2 n minus 1 right now let's go for the denominator denominator I said term 1 will have to be 3 times 1 VIN and I've got in with a two-year I see left side in 3-1 I know that'll give me two but I need to check jump two will then be 3 times 2 is 6 minus 1 gives me a 5 is that correct yes it's a 5 let me check my third term that'll be 3 times 3 
,,is 9 minus 1 is 8 yes that's great okay great so we can pretty much say in the denominator we've got 3 in minus 1 so that was my formula for my numerator and this is my formula for my denominator okay so once again let me just get rid of that and then I'm gonna write around 3 n minus 1 and that is my denominator formula so this 
,,entire thing that I've got here that will then be my algebraic rule which will describe this entire pattern okay next question they said write down this that xxx term but we've already got our formula so that is absolutely no issue for us now we're simply gonna go term 30 as then equals to 2 times 30 minus 1 over 3 times 30 minus 1 because you must remember if they ask us for the 30th term then we know that in is then equal to 30 so in this formula my n will be 30 so these my 30 there's my 
,,30 and these my 30 and remember what we've got on the left-hand side here will give me my entire value of my term so I'll end up with 2 times 30 which is 60 minus 159 over 3 times 30 which is 90 minus 189 right and that's your 30s term and because you've got a rule you didn't have to count on account on and count on from the fourth term up until the 30th term

Number Partens,flXVRy1hjf4,hello grade 8 children today I am here to teach you mathematics relevant to your textbook so what's the first unit in your textbook that's called number patterns so 
,,this is an interesting topic and we'll create number patterns using numbers so let's take 1 2 3 what are those those are digits so here we call these are counting numbers as well counting numbers so one two three like that we can't write all numbers so that's why we put three dots after this so if any pattern if you can't write 
,,it all you have to put three dots we can create different number patterns from these counting numbers so let's take different patterns check the first one one three 
,,five seven nine what are those we call these are odd numbers numbers less than ten only if you take odd numbers you have to write down 11 13 like that but this is the number set less than check so that's why here we put curly brackets and write down 1 1 3 5 7 9 so here you can't see 3 dots this is not continuing now we can find 
,,a next term by adding 2 to the previous so here how do you get 3 from 1 we can add 2 3 plus 2 you get 5 5 + 2 7 7 + 2 9 so since the exact number of terms in this number pattern can be specified therefore it is a finite number time so here certain numbers are there so remember this term finite number pad tick the same thing 1 3 
,,5 7 9 odd numbers less than 10 in this number pattern what's the first term the first number in the number pattern we call the first term so in this one what's the first term second term is 3 third term five fourth term seven and fifth term is now let's take these numbers 2 4 6 8 10 12 what are those those are even numbers so we can divide these numbers by 2 the remainder is 0 so here you see two three dots that means this number pattern continues what you call that that's called in finite 
,,number pattern so what's the first term in this sequence or number buggy that's 2 the second term is 4 36 4 8 and the fifth term so you know how to identify terms in the number pad and what are the two words you learn finite number pattern L in finite number pattern let's take this one 5 8 11 14 17 so when you take two numbers next to each other what do you call that consecutive term so here 5 & 8 are consecutive terms when you take 8 and 11 those are also consecutive terms so you can take 
,,any 2 you can take any two terms next to each other those are called consecutive terms so 14 and 17 also consecutive terms so we'll take that one and see the pattern how you get a it from five we need to add three 8 plus 3 you get 11 11 plus 3 14 14 plus 370 so how can we find out this number so you can take any two terms consecutive terms in the number pattern if you take this is the next term and the one before that that's called previous term we can take the difference so how do you get 
,,this number 11 minus 8 or 8 minus 5 so what you call that number common difference so you are learning another term that's common difference how you get the common difference you need two consecutive terms and take the difference when you are taking the difference don't subtract 5 minus 8 that's wrong so next term minus the previous term so we'll do that so you can either take 8 minus 5 Oh 11 minus 8 you are getting same answer or 14 minus 11 or 17-14 so that's how we find out the common difference let's take this one find the common difference of the following number pattern's now you know we can take the difference between two consecutive terms so you can take any two numbers so I'll take these two then what's the difference 16 minus 12 you get this one what's the common difference these two 36 minus 30 that's six when you take these two twenty minus ten that's ten look at this question write down the first five terms of the following number patterns you have given the first term and the common differences you can start from the first seven common difference is three means you need to add three to the previous term 7 + 3 10 10 plus 3 13 13 plus 3 16 16 plus 3 19 one two three four five and you can put three dots to show that it is continuing next one first term is 14 then common difference is plus four means adding four to the previous one four plus 14 plus 480 18 plus four 22 22 plus four 26 26 plus four 30 next one first term six and common difference six so that means multiples of six so starting from 6 6 plus 6 12 12 plus 6 18 18 plus 6 24 24 plus 6/13 this one first term is 12 and the common difference is eight at eight to that 12 plus 8 20 20 plus eight twenty eight twenty eight plus eight 36 36 Plus eight forty four one two three four five can put three dots after that look at this one right down the next two terms of the following sequences so you need to identify the pattern 712 so what's the common difference 12 minus 7 adding fine so that means in this number pattern the common difference is +5 so that means add 5 to that 27 plus 5 32 32 + 5 30 silver this one identify the common difference first you get server last 7 so what you do 41 is the last term so you add 7 to that you get 48 48 plus 750 this one what's the common difference how do you get 12 from 9 adding 3 let me you can start from here 21 plus three twenty four twenty four plus three twenty seven this Molly plus five 16 plus five you get 20 bar then you can 
,,start from here 36 plus five 41 41 plus five 46 this one have you get thirty from twenty four adding six to that so that means 48 plus 6 54 54 plus six that's 60 this one following number pattern is created multiplied the previous term by 2 now this is multiplication 2 times 2 you get 4 4 times 2 8 8 times 2 16 16 times 2 32 so 
,,this is the number pattern so I can write this one starting from 2 4 8 16 32 now look at this 1 2 4 8 10 20 a different number pattern following number pattern is created first added to and then multiplied by 2 so added to 2 plus 2 you get 4 times 2 8 then adding 2 8 plus 2 10 10 times 2 20 so this is also another number pattern so 2 4 8 10 20 now look at these so first 3 terms are the same but fourth term and fifth term those are different so from these two patterns we observed even though the first 3 terms are the same can create different number patterns so same for three terms but you can create different number pants now look at this one added 3 to the previous term 3 plus 3 you get 6 6 plus 3 9 9 plus 3 12 12 plus 3 15 so here what are the numbers three six nine twelve fifteen now first three terms are the same 369 but this is 18 and 21 so how can you create that pattern first multiplied by two and then added three multiplied by two you get six then added 3 6 plus 3 9 then multiplied by 2 again 9 times 2 18 18 plus 3 21 so this one is 3 6 9 18 21 so first three terms are the same but you can create different number patterns fill in the blanks to generate different number patterns so what can we do hi plus 5 10 10 plus 5 15 that means adding 5 15 20 25 30 look at this one you can do another partner we can do multiply by 2 and add 5 5 times 2 10 10 plus 5 15 and what's the next number 15 times 2 30 30 plus 5 35 35 times 2 you get 70 this one 7 14 21 multiples of server so that means adding 7 to that so 21 plus seven twenty eight twenty eight plus seven 35 35 plus 7 42 now create another number pattern different one see first three terms try to create another one this one I can do multiply by 2 and then add 7 multiplied by 2 first and then at 7 so multiply by 221 times 242 add seven more T naught now again x - 2 times 9 18 so 2 times 9 18 2 times 4 8 + 1 98 now we'll discuss what is general term of the number pattern take this number pattern two four six eight ten twelve means even numbers so you want to write down the general term of the multiples of two now we'll try to do that so term number term and pattern okay what's the first term in this sequence or number pattern that's how can I write down two I can write 1 times 2 or 2 times 1 second term second term is 4 
,,try to write down number 4 - x - third term 6 what's the pattern I can write this one as 2 times 3/4 1 8 2 times 4 now see your pattern 10th term I need no tense term so 10th term is what 2 times 10 by looking at the pattern we can get 2 times 10 because first term is 2 times 1 second term is 2 times 2 so temp term 2 times 10 that's 20 then what about nth term n means any term I can write 2 times N or when you write without this multiplication I can write - so what's the enter to win we call this as general term so nth term is the general term of the number pattern so what you can write for multiples of Oh general term is 2 what are the numbers for n you have to start from one n equals 1 first term in equals 2 second term so likewise when you substitute in values we can find out any term so you need general term to find out the terms now what are these numbers 3 6 9 12 15 18 multiples of 3 write down the general term of the multiples of 3 so we'll try to do the same thing like before first term first term is 3 what's the pattern I can write 3 times second term is 6 3 times 2 this number and this one is the same third one 9 3 times 3/4 1 
,,12 3 times 4 then what about temperature I can write 3 times 10 that becomes 30 and what about the general term nth term three times in oh I can write down three so 
,,what's the general term of multiples of 3 is 3 and so I can write down this one as 3 n so we found out the general pattern for multiples of 2 that's 2 it general term for multiples of 3 that's 3 n now this one feel the table below by observing the previous pattern multiples of 2 2 multiples of three general term is 3/8 can you identify then what about multiples of four that's foreign so you saw the patent two three four what about multiples are fired five multiples of 7 this is 7 in multiples of chain chain in and multiples of 11 obviously that's a lemon now the reverse process finding terms using general term if you know the general term how can we find out these terms so in this example first three terms first three terms means N equals one N equals two and in equals three so what you do take the general term substitute one for first term that's three to get the second term you substitute n equal to 3 times 2 6 when N equals 3 you get the third term so that's what about tenth term general term is trillion so tenth term is 3 times 10 that's previous question which tell me 60 now the end term is given 60 and you are asked to find out what's the end value so what you do we equate general term is trillion and that's equal to 60 then how you solve this you can divide this by 3 to get in so 60 divided by 3 what you get n equals 60 divided by 3 you get 20 so 20th term is 60 or in other words we can say 20 multiple of 3 is 60 now the general term is given as 5 in you are asked to find out for three terms 11th term and which term is 75 so what you do for the first three you substitute N equals 1 you get the first term N equals 2 
,,you get the second term M equals 3 you get the good so 5 10 15 are the first three terms and then 11th term next one you are asked to find out the 11th term so how we find out the LMR term substitute 11 so 5 times 11 you get 55 so 11th term is 55 this one the third part which term is 75 means nth term is given 75 so you equate in term is 5 in general term that's equal to 75 so how you find out n divided by 5 75 divided by 5 you get 15 so 15 multiple of 5 is 75 this one you have given the general term is 11 find the 10th term so how you find out the 10th term substitute 10 for and 10th term is equal to 11 times 10 hundred 10 next 120th term so what you 
,,do substitute N equals 20 general term is 11 and that's given and you asked to find out the 20th term substitute in s 20 multiplied by 2 you get 22 put 1 0 220 this 
,,one the third part which term is 121 now the reverse process you'd have given the in term you also find out the in value and the fourth part also same way you asked 
,,to find out which term is 77 so we'll do that substitute then to get n you divide by 11 get 11 for it so 11th term is 121 what about 77 when you divide by 11 you get in ass so so seventh term is 77 fill in the blanks now you have given different number patterns and you asked to write down the first term and the change Roger so observe the first one four eight twelve sixteen multiples of four that means addition multiples are four that means adding four what's the first term for what's the general term for em then 9 18 27 36 multiples of 9 starting from 9 9 18 27 36 so what's the general term 9 in 1 2 3 4 this is also number pattern but you're adding 1 
,,to that so what's the general term starting from 1 we can write 1 in 8 16 24 those are multiples of 8 starting from 8 so the general term is a 10 identify this multiples of 12 starting from 12 you can write 12 in 1 3 5 7 9 11 find the general term for odd numbers what are even numbers 2 4 6 8 so we found out the general pattern 
,,for even numbers multiples of 2 what's that that's 2 in now we'll try to find out the general term for odd numbers what's the first term if it's even numbers what's 
,,the first term but in our pattern the first term is 1 so what can you see you have to subtract 1 to get this one second term even numbers when you consider the second term is 4 but in this one that's 3 how you get 3 from 4 4 minus 1 third term for the even pattern six this one five you can subtract and get five one from the term fourth term is eight for even numbers in this one seven 8 minus 1 is 7 tenth term you get 2 times 10 20 odd numbers what's the 10th term one less than that so we observed a pattern one less than that so I can write 20 minus 1 that's 19 xx - 2 times 20 that's 40 but we know that's this is 1 less than that this is 39 so what's the general term we found out general term for even numbers that's 2 in so what's the pattern 2 n minus 1 so we can straightaway find out the general term for odd numbers that's 2 n minus 1 we can get odd numbers by subtracting 1 from all even numbers so remember now what's the general term for odd numbers 2 n minus 1 using that now we'll try to find our 23rd odd number to do that you need to know the general term so what's the general term for numbers 2 n minus 1 if you want twenty third term you substitute N equals 23 so 2 times 23 minus 1 so what's that you get 46 minus 1 forty hi 45th so what it means here 23rd odd number is 45 find the 36th odd number so what's the general term for numbers to win - what if you want 36 substitute 36 for in 2 times 6 12 1 remaining 2 times 3 6 + 1 7 72 minus 1 you get 71 36th odd number is 71 find the 18th odd number so what's the general term 2 n minus 1 18 term you substitute 18 for 2 times 8 16 1 remaining so 36 minus 1 you get 35 18th odd number is 35 which odd number 33 now the reverse process we know the general term is 2n minus 1 for numbers so we can substitute to win minus 1 is equal to 33 now 
,,is that linear equation simple algebraic equation you know already how to solve that so what you do you can get rid of this minus 1 by you can get rid of this minus 
,,one by adding 133 plus one so what you get here 34 is equal to two it to get em you can divide this by two so when you do that you can get n m equals 2 times 1 2 4 14 that's 7 so 17th odd number is 33 which odd number is 81 now you need to get the general term so what's general term general term is 2 n minus 1 now that's equal to 81 now solve that equation Advan first to get rid of this minus 1 you get 82 is equal to 2 in then you need to divide this by 2 to get n N equals 41 so 41 or term 
,,is 81 which odd term is 17 same thing take the general term equal to 70 get rid of this minus 1 that means adding 1 you get 18 is equal to 2 in then divide by 2 what you get you get 9/9 odd number is 17 now you need to know what R square are numbers so look at this diagram starting from 1 then 2 rows and 2 columns you can create a square so two times two that's four then three rows and three columns you can create the next square number four rows and four columns you can get their next one 
,,now we'll try to find out the general term for square numbers here is the pattern of circles forming squares which lengths and widths are the same what's the first term that's one second term for we'll try to write down the pattern first term I can write one times one second terms I can write 2 times two third term nine that's three times three if it's eight eighth term I can write by looking at this pattern eight times eight what's that 69 tell nine times nine that's 81 then what about enter this should be n times in so n times n you can write down as in squared so what's the general term for square numbers you can take as in squared now using the general term of the square number can you find the tenth square number so what's the generator in squared 10th term means we substitute check ten square are same as ten times ten you get hundred so tenth square number is 100 this one find the 12 square how you do take the general term n squared and it's not stood 12 12 times 12 that's unread 44 so 12 square number is 144 find the 15 square number write down the general term substitute 15 15 times 15 is 225 so 15 square number is 225 now we'll 
,,take triangular numbers look at the picture for starting from 1 you need 3 circles to create the next triangle what about the other one you need 6 circles to create 
,,the next triangular number next 1/4 110 to create the fourth triangular number so what's the first term first term is 1 second term is 3 third term 6 fourth term 10 
,,what about fifth term can you see the pattern right like this this is one how can you get three I can write 1 plus 2 6 1 plus 2 Plus 3 you get 6 10 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus 4 then what about fifth number 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus 4 plus 5 sum of numbers up to 5 so what's the number that means adding 5 to the previous term 10 plus five you get 15 as a fifth term of the triangular numbers now we can find out this one using a method now we'll take this one if you want adding one up to four when you take first and the last you can get one plus four you can get five to plus three you can get high so when you pair up the numbers like this you can get five in two methods either 2 plus 3 or 1 plus 4 so we can easily find out this as 5 is the number when you add you are getting 2 times of that so 5 times 2 that's 10 so this is the 
,,fourth triangular number so if you want fourth you add 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus 4 how we get the number this is the easiest way to do pair up the numbers like this and then see how many times you are getting the number so in the number is 5 and 2 times you are getting that's 10 we'll take another one if you want 8 triangular number 
,,you have to add 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus like that up to 8 when you pair up like this 1 plus h you get 9 2 plus 7 9 3 plus 6 9 4 + 5 9 how many times you are getting nine one two three four four times you're getting nine so what's the number 36 so eight triangular number is 36 now 10th triangular number what you do 1 plus 2 plus up 
,,to 10 so when you pair up how many sets you can get think about a pattern now previous one we got 4 into 9 is equal to 36 4 is yeah how many digits are there eight 8/2 so we can think about this is 8 divided by 2 you get 4 what about 9 9 you are getting think about first and last 1 plus 8 you did not so we'll try to use that pattern in the next one what's the total 1 plus 10 you are getting 11 2 plus 9 also 11 so how many Elevens you can you will get we can see 10 numbers that they are 10 divided by 2 5 times you are getting 11 so 5 times 11 oh I can write 5 as 10 divided by 2 and how you get 11 first and the last one 1 plus J now can you see the pattern 11 is obtained by adding the first term and the last term the following are 5 such terms so how you create that 10 divided by 2 now what is 10 number of terms and this is the first term and this is the last / - I can rewrite this as this 10 times 10 plus 1 is 11 over 2 so what's the formula you can find the number of terms multiplied by first and the last term addition divided by two so we'll try to apply this formula to find out any triangular number take this one one two eight eight triangular number what's the pattern again we found from the previous one number of terms into first Plus last divided by 2 number of terms 8 divided by 2 and x first 
,,and last one plus 8 again i can write 8 times 9/2 so when you simplify what you get 2 times 1/2 times 4 36 1 2 20 mins xx triangular number so I can write 20 divided by 2 here x 1 plus 20 this is same as 20 into 21 divided by 2 when you simplify you get 210 this one 50th triangular number 50 numbers are they are and divided by 2 1 plus 50 50 times 51 divided by 2 you get 25 times 50 baht so multiplication 25 times 51 means first multiply by 20 and then 5 2 times 1 is 2 and 2 times 5 ten high times 1/5 and 5 times 5 25 so when you add it you get thousand 275 now you need to find out the generator so what's the pattern if there are n digits in the next number is one more than that n plus 1 if the previous number is in you're adding 1 to that n plus 1 divided by 2 so what's the general term for the triangular number 
,,n times n plus 1 divided by 2 here you don't need to write down multiplication side brackets also ok but if you think that this is not talking you can write as in times n plus 1 divided by 2 so we'll try to find out any triangular number using the chain rule to find the 10th triangular number so what's the general term for triangular numbers in times in plus 1/2 now if you want 10th one you substitute 10 10 is n 10 plus 1 over 2 so 10 times 11 over 2 that becomes 50 so general term is n into n plus 1 over 2 for triangular numbers find the 20th triangular number so general term ending to n plus 1/2 so you need xx that means in equals 20 so 20 into 20 plus 125 so you get 10 times 21 210 find the fortieth triangular number you need the general term n into n plus 1 divided by 2 when this is 40 so 14 241 over 2 divided by 2 you get 20 that means multiply by 2 and put a 0 2 times 1 to 2 times 4 8 44th triangular number same as before to take the general term and substitute 44 now substitute 44 44 into 45 44 + 1 then x 22 so 45 x 22 you get 900 plus 45 945 so 945 is the 44th triangular number find xxx triangular number general term so the triangular numbers are n into n plus 1 divided by 2 so if this is xxx triangular number substitute N equals 30 fifteen times 31 so 31 into 15 10 and 5 multiply by 1 and then multiply by 5 add it together you get 465 is the 30th triangular number find the hundredths triangular number general term is n into n plus 1 divided by 2 in this hundred substitute hundred here you get 50 times hundred one so put 0 and x 5050 is the hundredth triangular number 1 + 2 + 3 up to 15 from this sequence which triangular number do you get we observe the pattern 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 fourth triangular number 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 v triangular number so if this is up to 15 this is 15th triangular number up to 28 adding 1 + 2 + 3 up to 20 so what is the triangular number that's xx from this sequence which triangular number one up to 27 so that's 27th triangular this one up to 19 so this is 19th triangular find the sixteenth triangular number if the fifteenth triangular number is 120 so we know the pattern fourth triangular number 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus 4 then to get the fifth one you have to add 5 to that now 16 1 you need so fifteenth one is 120 so how do you get the 16th one 
,,"from 15th one you need to add which number either 15 or 16 you have to add 16 to that so 120 plus 16 you get 136 this one find the 21st triangular number if the 20th one is given 210 you are asked to find out 21st one so which number you need to add 210 plus 21 so that's one here 3 2 231 find the 10th triangular number the 9th triangular number is 55 it's a similar way ninth one is 55 and you are asked to find out the tenth one so how do you do ad turn to that get 65 find the 80th triangular number if the 79th one is given as 3,240 have you get that adding 80 to that so at eighty three thousand three hundred twenty that's the 80th triangular number now we'll try to find out pattern in between square our numbers and the triangular numbers so what are these 1 3 6 10 15 21 are triangular numbers let's take 1 + 3 is 4 so 4 is the square number that's the second square number and here 3 plus 6 you get 9 that's the third square number what about this one 6 + 10 you get 16 so what's that that's the fourth square number I can write this one is 2 squared second square number third square number 3 squared 16 is 4 square number now try to identify "
,,a pattern what's one that's the first triangular number so if I put a symbol like this is first triangle enough 3 is the second triangular number so when you add these two you are getting second square number I put a square to represent the word square what about this one second triangular number and this is third triangular number you are getting third square number find out a relationship this is third triangular number this is fourth triangular number you are getting fourth square number have you seen the pattern 3 4 3 + 1 4 2 + 1 3 1 + 2 2 2 consecutive triangular numbers when you add you get this square number so last square number if this is 4 this is fourth square number if this is 3 this is third square number and this this is 2 this is second square number so what's the pattern when you take any triangular number twenty first triangular number plus twenty second triangular number what you get we get 20 second square number now we'll use that pattern to identify this 
,,one fifth triangular number and sixth triangular number what you get what's the pattern you get sixth square number so you can write what's this number here six square then what about tenth one and eleventh triangle you are getting xi square number you can write 10 1 plus xi 1 you get xi square Arnim 21st and the 22nd but you get 21st triangular number and 22nd triangular number you get 22nd square number 20 or we can write in numbers 22nd square 33rd triangular number and 34th triangular number you are getting 34th square you can do this is 33 33rd triangular number and 34th triangular number you are getting thirty fourth square no so that's the relationship between triangular numbers and the square numbers now we will look at example number 1 in your textbook write the terms of each of the following number patterns the number pattern of the prime numbers between 1 and 17 written in ascending order so what are prime numbers only divisible by 1 and itself what's the lowest prime number 2 so you can write down to then what's the next prime number 3 5 7 11 13 14 15 16 then 17 but can we write down 17 it says in between in between means between means 1 and 17 not included so you can't write 17 there so ascending order means lowest to highest second one the number pattern of the odd number starting from one written in ascending order just the odd numbers 1 3 5 7 11 13 all numbers so what we do we have to put three dots to represent this is continuing third one the 
,,number pattern starting from 1 and followed by the terms two and one written alternatively so as to when one separately starting from one and followed by the terms so starting from one followed by the terms two and one written alternately 2 1 2 look again 1 2 so that's another number pad so we can put three dots to represent this is continuing exercise 1.1 fill in the blanks in the number pattern 1 3 5 7 9 what's the first term 1 second term is 3/4 - 1 2 3 4 that's seven in the number pattern 4 8 12 16 20 multiples of 4 the first term is 4 second term that's 8 and the third term is 12 question number two write the terms of each of the following number 
,,patterns the number pattern of the even numbers between one and nine written in ascending order so what's the first number even numbers 2 4 6 8 10 10 you can write because this is in between these 1 & 9 so this is in ascending order so that's up to this point next one the number pattern of the multiples of 6 from 6 to 36 written in ascending order so multiples of 6 to 36 means you can write 36 as well 6 times 2 12 6 times 3 18 24 6 times 5 30 6 times 6 36 the number pattern of the even numbers greater than 7 written in ascending order greater than 7 means above 7 so what's the lowest even number 8 starting from 8 you can write 8 10 12 like that so this is continuing with 3 dots the number pattern of the prime number starting from 2 written in ascending order so starting from 2 what are the prime numbers 2 3 5 7 like that this is not ending in finite number pattern so you can put three dots question number three copy the below given statements in your exercise book and mark the correct statements with a correct or incorrect symbol we'll take the first one the terms of a number patent have to be in ascending order tick ten eight six like that that's not in ascending order that's descending order that's also a number pattern so the first one is wrong because no need to be always in ascending order second one the terms of a number patent have to be different from each other no because five five five this is also number pattern so no need to be different to each other so here this is also wrong third one if the tenth term of two number patterns are different then the two number patterns are different to each other so think about you have two number sets number patterns tenth term here you got five hundred something here the tenth term is two hundred so different so different means the two 
,,number patterns are different so it says if the tenth term of two number patterns are different then the two number patterns are different so that's true example number one consider number pattern of the multiples of two starting from two written in ascending order so when you write down the number pattern this is two four six eight like that multiples of to find 11th term so what's the general term we know multiples of two the general term is two ends then using the general term you can answer these questions eleventh term so have you find out the 11th term substitute 11 for you get 2200 third term 2 times 103 you get 206 then the last part find which term is hot so 128 of this number pattern that means we know the general term is to win that's given as 728 so how we find out in divide this by to say 128 divided 
,,by 2 2 times 3 6 6 4 12 and 4 for 8 360 fourth term that's multiple of 2 is 728 example number 2 the general term of the number pattern of the multiples of 3 starting from 3 and written in ascending order is 3 so already given so we can write down 3 6 9 12 like that so nth term is given or the general term is 3 in first part find the 13th term so I will find out the 13th term substitute 13 in 9 so 39 then part to find which term is 87 so 87 is equal to three yen so how do you find out n divided by three so in so I'll rewrite this in other way rock three and means eighty-seven divided by 3 you get in eighty seven divided by three twenty ninth term is 87 in other words twenty nine multiple of three is 87 example number three in the number pattern of the multiples of four starting from four and written in ascending order with general term for so general term is given for then what's the chapter tenth term means and B equals can write substitute and nickel step four times 10 that means what part two what is the 11th term so 11th term just substitute in equals 11 four times 11 you get 44 which term is hundred so this is continuation so this is about multiples of four four which term is 100 so in this one in term is given for n means given 100 divided by four to get and when you divide by 4 you get 25 so 
,,25 fifth multiples of 4 is 100 is 43 a term of this number pattern what are the reasons for your answer okay we'll check whether 43 in this number pattern for N equals 43 you divide by four what happens you get ten yeah one and here nothing and three remaining out of four you're getting a fraction for n what is n means number of terms can you get a fraction for a number of terms you can't get a fraction so that's why so 43 is not in the number pattern so here we can write in either fraction there are 4 43 is not in this exercise 1.2 copy the table given below and complete it number pattern first term and the generator so what's the first term here hi these are multiples of 5 so what's the general term 5 in multiples of 2 that's 2 with multiples of 3 3 multiple of ten that's ten named this is 10 20 multiples of 10 
,,starting from 10 you can write 10 in 8 16 24 32 multiples of 8 starting from a twister this is 8 n these are multiples of 7 starting from 7 7 and what about this one multiples of 12 starting from 12 that's 12 in and 1 2 3 4 multiples of once so starting from 1 this is 1 in oh you can write without one just in question number to 
,,write the number pattern of the multiples of 5 between three and thirty-three written in ascending order so starting from three to 33 in between so what's the first 
,,multiple of five five five times to 10 five times three 15 20 25 30 35 but you can't write 35 this should be in between 3 and 33 so up to this point so this is a finite number partner question number three in the number pattern 11 22 33 of the multiples of 11 starting from 11 and written in descending order what is the general term we already know the general term is 11 and what is the 9th term you substitute in equals nice 11 times 9 that's 99 which term is 121 now we know the general term 11 M equals 120 1 when you divide by 11 you get N equals 11 11th multiple of 11 is 125 fourth one in the number pattern 9 18 27 36 of the multiples of 9 starting from 9 and written in ascending order what is the general term now you already know multiples of 9 the general term is 9 end what is the element job substitute in equals 1199 third part which term is 217 e now we know the general term is 9 in equate to 270 so when you divide by 9 what you get xxx term is 270 question number five in the number pattern with general term hundred in so you have given general term as hundred what is the eleventh term so 11th term means you're substituting in equals eleven hundred times you never you get 1100 part two which term is 500 that means 100 N equals 500 when you divide by hundred you get fifth term is 500 question number six what is the smallest multiple of three larger than 100 which term is it in the number pattern of the multiples of three starting from three okay so larger than 100 101 check whether it's divisible divided by 3 3 times 3 9 4 11 you can't you can't divide by 3 102 3 times 3 9 12 12 is divisible by 3 so what's the lowest number multiple of 3 after 100 that's 102 which term is it in the number pattern of the multiples of 3 starting from 3 so 3 6 9 like that they are asking which term is 102 so that means we know these are multiples of 3 what's the general term 3 n so we can equate 3n equals 102 so what's a divided by 3 you get 34 so 34 multiple of 3 is hundred - question number 7 what's the nth term that's basically general term of the pattern of the even numbers greater than 1 but less than 200 greater than 
,,1 what's the lowest multiple of 2 that's 2 for each like that what's the largest number less than 200 you can't write 200 so one before that 198 this is in ascending order smallest to largest the smallest value of n is 1 we know n V equals 1 you get the first what is its largest value that means you are that means you need to find the value of n 498 so we can write 2 N equals hundred ninety-eight divided by 2 so that means 99th term is 198 question number eight it has been estimated that in a country having a population of 2 million people the population will increase by 2 million every 25 years estimate the population of the country in 200 years so first thing we need to find out how many years are there how many steps are there for 200 years so every 25 years it's increasing so find out how many times it's changing 200 divided by 25 is 8 so that means 8 times it's changing so starting from 2 million so I'll write millions here so starting from 2 after first 25 years this becomes 4 million adding 2 million every 25 years so they're asking if this is 200 years not the population if this is 200 years that means if this is 200 years that means 8 times this is increasing so that means 8 turn 8 term of this sequence so after 50 years this becomes 6 million so this is the sequence we know these are multiples of 2 so what's the general term that's 2 when so you need 8 term what's the eighth term 2 times 8 that's 16 so these are in millions so we can write 16 million 
,,people after 200 years example number four in the pattern of the odd numbers starting from one what is the general term so one three five seven what are those odd numbers we found out even numbers the pattern is 2n odd numbers you can get it from subtracting one from even numbers so what's the general term of odd numbers - in - 
,,we'll do the second part part 2 what is the 72nd term so we know the general term is 2 n minus 1 so 70 second term is n V equals 72 so substitute you get 2 times 72 
,,minus 1/2 times 2 for 2 times 7 14 minus 1 you get 143 so 70 second term is 143 third part which term is 51 this is about odd number so general term is 2 n minus 1 that's equal to 55 add 1 to get rid of this one and then you get 2n equals 52 divided by 2 you get 2 times 2 4 4 12 that's six twenty sixth term is 51 exercise 1.3 in the pattern of the odd numbers starting from one and written in ascending order what is the twelfth term so what are the numbers 1 3 5 those are the odd numbers what's the general term for numbers we know that general term is 2 and minus 1 you can use that general term you are asked to find out 12th term 12 term means you substitute 12 in and you get 23 for that and what's the fifteenth term 15 term you substitute N equals 15 30 minus 1 you get 29 part 3 which term is 89 is all about odd numbers so we can write down n star is 89 add 1 you get 90 equals to n divided by 2 you get 90 divided by 2 45 part 4 which term is the greatest odd number less than 
,,100 what's the odd number greatest or number 99 so 99 is the largest or number less than 100 question number 2 find the value of the sum of the 34th term of the pattern of the even number starting from two and the 34th term of the pattern of the odd number starting from what so there are two patterns here what's the first pattern even numbers so starting from two so two four six like that so you are taking thirty fourth term of the even number and the thirty fourth term of them odd numbers 
,,what are numbers one for what are numbers one three five seven so they asking thirty fourth after odd number as well and first you need to find out thirty fourth term separately I'll take the total because you need the sum okay so we know the general term of the even numbers is to it then which term you need thirty fourth term N equals 34 you get sixty eight in this sequence odd numbers what's the general term one less they're even numbers to win minus one so what's thirty fourth term of that two times 34 minus 1 you get 67 now they asking what's the sum of these two values so 68 plus sixty seven hundred thirty-five exercise 1.4 what is the 10th term of the square number pattern starting from 1 and written in ascending order can you remember the general term of a square number general term of square numbers N squared now they asking temperature so starting from here you have to always look at the starting point so 1/4 like that so when you take the square numbers 1 squared 2 
,,squared 4 3 squared 9 so what's the 10th term 10th term you substitute 10 10 squared means 10 times 10 hundred question number two what is the tenth term of the triangular number pattern starting from one and written in ascending order so what are triangular numbers 1 plus 2 3 3 plus 3 6 6 plus 4 10 10 plus 5 15 and what's the general term of triangular numbers we found that general term for triangular numbers are in n plus 1 over 2 now we need till term 10th triangular number substitute 10 for n 10 times 10 plus 1 divided by 2 or you can write 10 times 11 divided by 2 2 times 5 11 times 5 is 55 question number 3 a certain number greater than 1 less than 50 which is a term of the square number pattern starting from 1 so 1 2 squared is 4 so like wise this is less than 50 and written this is in green and written in 
,,ascending order is also a term of the triangular number pattern starting from 1 and written in ascending order so in triangular numbers 1 1 plus 2 3 3 plus 3 6 like 
,,that 10 15 these are triangular numbers so one term is in both number partners what is this term so they are asking what is this term we know what's the general term of square numbers we know that's N squared what's the general term of triangular number in n plus 1 divided by 2 if one number in both number patterns these two are equal so we can take N squared is equal to in n plus 1 over 2 now what can I do I can multiply both sides by 2 to get cancel out I get 2 N squared is equal to expand brackets you get N squared n into n n squared n into 1 that's plus N when you take this term to this side 2 N squared minus n square what you get these are like terms I can ride to n square minus N squared is equal to n so N squared is equal to n so I can divide this by n you get N equals 1 so only number belongs to both is N 
,,equals 1 so we can write N equals 1 is there term belongs to both of these number factors square number as well as a triangular number question number 3 a certain number greater than 1 and less than 50 which is a term of the square number pattern starting from 1 L written in ascending order is also a term of the triangular number pattern starting from 1 and written in ascending order so we'll take square numbers first starting from 1 for 2 squared 9 16 4 squared 5 squared 25 6 squared 36 7 
,,squared 49 because up to 49 because this is less than 50 if you take triangular numbers when you take triangular numbers starting from 1 1 plus 2 3 3 plus 3 you get 
,,6 6 plus 4 10 10 plus 55 15 15 plus 6 21:21 plus seven twenty eight twenty eight plus eight 36 36 Plus 9 45 and 45 plus ten 55 you can't write 55 because this is less than 50 so these are the square numbers and these are the triangular numbers and they asking one number is there in both sequence greater than one so don't consider one day are other than one there's another number which numbers in both sequence 36 so 36 is the term in both number patterns which square number is it one two three four five six six square number which triangular number is it one two three four five six seven eight eight triangular question number four the sum of the fourteenth and fifteen terms of the triangular number pattern starting from one is a square number show that this statement is true and find which term it is of the square 
,,number pad fourteen and fifteen triangular numbers and this is the sum can you remember the pattern we observed first triangular number and the second triangular number is equal to the second square number if you take eight one and ninth number of the triangular numbers the sum is equal to the ninth square number now they're asking fourteenth triangular number and the fifteenth triangular number is which one fifteen square number so when you take this one this is the square number you get 15 square number so is this statement correct the sum of two triangular numbers these are consecutive two triangular numbers that's equal to a square number so the statement is true can dried statement is true and find the term it is of the square number pattern find which term so which term is that fifteen square question number five write the total number of triangles in each figure in order and see whether you can identify the pattern the pattern of the total number of triangles in the figures in the the given order is identical to the pattern of triangular numbers starting from one L written in ascending order find the total number of triangles in the eighth figure that is drawn according to this pattern so we need to find out how many triangles are there first diagram how many triangles are there just one triangle this one one two and we can take the bigger one that's three this one one two three four five six what about this one first we'll count small numbers small triangles one two three four if you take two at a time one two three so 4 plus 3 7 and then 7 8 9 and the bigger one that's 10 so these are the number of triangles inside these diagrams the pattern of the total number of triangles in the figure in the given order is identical to the pattern of the triangular number starting from 1 and written in ascending order so we found out these are triangular numbers find the total number of triangles in the eighth figure so we'll see what's the total number of triangles so we can find out that term we already know in into n plus 1/2 if you want the a trigger so that means eighth term in equals 8 8 times 8 + 1 9 divided by 2 2 times 1/2 times 4 that means 36 so you can write there are 36 triangles in the eighth trigger question number 6 sigh uni buys a till and start saving money by putting 1 rupee into it on the first day so 1 so 1 rupee first day on the second day she puts 2 rupees so second day she puts 2 rupees means the total is 2 plus 
,,1 333 rupees so increasing 3 plus 3 6 and so how much money is in the till by the end of the tenth day now what's this button these are triangular numbers 1 3 6 next day 4 rupees 6 plus 4 10 so these are triangular numbers you can apply the general term so what's the general term of triangular numbers and mean 2n plus 1 divided 
,,by 2 now they ask what's the value and of 10th day so 10th term turn into 11 divided by 2 divided by 2 you get 55 that means 55 rupees in the 1030 so siren approached 55 rupees in the tank miscellaneous exercise in the pattern of the odd number starting from 1 commencing from the first term if the first two terms then the first 
,,three terms then the first four terms are added and continued accordingly a special type of numbers is obtained what is the special name given to these numbers find 
,,the number that is obtained if 15 of these terms are added in order to in order starting from the first term so read it carefully in the pattern of the odd number starting from 1 1 3 5 like that 7 commencing from the first term if the first two terms first is 1 first 2 terms what's the addition of first 2 terms you get for first 3 terms five five plus three eight eight plus one nice first four terms nine plus seven 16 what you get what are these numbers these are square numbers so what is the special name for this these are square numbers find the number that is obtained if 15 of these terms I added that means you're asking to find out the fifteenth - 
,,so 15th term you can use the general term so general term of the square numbers is equal to N squared the fifteenth term is 15 squared that means 15 times 15 220 question number two milk things brought to a shop to be sold were arranged on a rack in the following manner ten teens on the lowest shelf and every other shelf having 
,,one chin less than the number on the shelf below one ting on the top most shop so one next one adding so two three like that what's the lowest one that's ten things 
,,so this is like a triangle okay be right this way first shelf one second shelf two teens third shelf three teens like that last shelf the bottom shelf that's ten find a number of milk tins that were brought to the shop so that means adding all these numbers so what's the sum you can add 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus 4 plus 5 plus 6 plus 
,,seven plus eight plus nine plus ten can you remember what's the pattern there this is like one to ten addition that means this is like tenth trying unit number finding tenth triangular number so without adding up to ten you can just do this is tenth triangular number what's the generator general term of the triangular number is 
,,n into n plus one Oh - it's a substitute ten ten into eleven divided by 2 you get fifty five tins are there by two all the milk tins on the four topmost shelves were sold within two weeks find the number of milk tins that were sold so first four means 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus 4 that means fourth triangular number will substitute to 
,,the formula in equals 4 4 times 5 divided by 2 you get 10 so this is the number of teens sold within two weeks so what's the so they're asking the number of milk teens that were sold so number number of teens sold is question number three what is the sum of the integers from 1 to 31 - like that they are asking what's the sum of 
,,all digits up to 30 so we know 1 + 2 + 3 up to 30 is the 30th triangular number general term of the triangular number is n into n plus 1 divided by 2 now substitute 
,,30 there what you get divided by 2 you get 15 times 31 multiply 30 1 times 15 multiply 10 and 5 you get 5 times 1 5 5 times 3 15 465 so sum of all digits 1 - 30 is 465 so we covered all theory related to number patterns let's your first unit we'll see what we did so we did an expression in in obtain for the intern how to find out the general term and then we did always in should be a positive whole number starting from 1 you can't get fraction 4 in then the next one general term of multiples of 2 you got to win general term of odd numbers subtract 1 from that that's 2n minus 1 general term of square numbers that's N squared finally we did general term 
,,of triangular numbers that's n into n plus 1 over 2 and also we observed another thing when you add two consecutive triangular numbers you will get a square number if it's first one and second one addition of triangular numbers you get second square number eight one and ninth one triangular numbers you get nine square not so remember all these and practice with all exercises and examples when you practice you can master in number patterns

Number Partens,8OcQPkfC74c,in this lesson we are simply going to extend patterns okay so the first thing that I just want to clear up with you as you must remember that they are always two ways that you can find your and your numbers in a sequence the first one is your term to term relationship okay which means you are going to try to link the first term 
,,to the second term and the second to the third and the third to the fourth so we get a check it is the relationship between the terms that's your first option your next option is your position two term relationship okay which means you are going to try to connect the position of the term like this is 1st 2nd 3rd 4th position of 
,,the term to the value of the term like for instance in this first sequence or this first pattern the fourth term is minus 7 so the value of the fourth term would be 
,,minus 7 but when you simply ask to extend the pattern it's much easier for you to try to see if there's not a relationship between the terms ok it's much quicker okay but if you if you see that you're running against a wall you and you can't find the term determine relationship you're going to consider a position to term relationship alright let's have a look at the first one now the first thing that I always do is I check if the numbers in the pattern is getting smaller or if they are getting bigger which means if it's an increasing function getting bigger or a decreasing function now if you look at this first guy if we put put these numbers on a number line okay they should tune it's like that zero that will be your minus 1 that would be a minus 4 and that would be a minus 7 then you can clearly see that this sequence is a decreasing sequence okay your values are getting smaller and smaller now in a case like that you can consider your relationship from the one term to the 
,,next term to be either a minus or a division these are all operations that would make your values smaller or maybe a root okay so let's have a look now the first thing we will do is let's look from leads to how we would move from 2 to minus 1 okay now from to 2-1 we will subtract three how did I get that so quickly okay so what 
,,I do is I take my second term let me just rewrite them yeah I take my second term and I say turn to a minus term one what is that I go minus one minus two that gives me a minus three let me check for the next one and so on minus four minus minus one so I'm gonna take term 3 minus 2 2 which is minus 4 minus minus 1 remember that 
,,minus and minus will give you a plus so you'll have minus 4 plus 1 which will give you minus 3 again and you'll see the same a class through the next one minus 7 minus minus 4 will also give me minus 3 so here I'm sitting with a common difference of minus 3 we call that a common difference and we can say our common difference is a minus 3 which means that in order to extend our pattern we simply have 2 minus 3 every time we actually saying we're adding a minus 3 every time so what we'll do 
,,is to move on from minus 7 I'll go minus 7 minus 3 and again minus 3 to get to the next term and again minus 3 to get to the next term okay let's see what that will 
,,be minus 7 minus 3 will give me a minus 10 minus 10 minus 3 will give me minus 13 and minus 13 minus 3 will give me minus 16 and those are my next three terms I used the term to term relationship which means I checked how are the terms related to each other right let's look at the next guy they gave us five fifteen forty five 135 is we can clearly see here now all positive numbers so we can clearly see this increasing sequence which means the numbers are getting bigger and bigger so I'm gonna definitely consider addition multiplication and maybe squaring or cubing or something like that in order to make the numbers bigger and bigger so let's have a look how they are relighted 15 and I've got a 45 I'm just gonna work with the first three you actually only need the first three terms let's see if the if they've added something five plus what gives me 15 that's a ten but 15 plus ten again will give me 25 now there's definitely not a difference of ten okay but literally if they didn't maybe so that's not gonna work let's check if they're in maybe multiply about something so let's see five multiplied by what will give me 15 you can also work the opposite way and say 15 divided by five what is that that gives me three let me look at the next guy as well 45 divided by 15 again what is that that is three as 
,,well so what they've done is they've multiplied by three to go from the first to the second term they've actually multiplied by three and to move from the second to 
,,the third term they've also multiplied by three now this value here we call a common ratio it's called a ratio because we're dividing to get to that term the same as the previous one can you remember we subtracted to get to it so that's why it was called a difference so my common ratio which also mikuma or is equal to three year so this differently a term to term relationship year so we can simply go on with that sequence let's move on from 135 and what we going to do is we're going to multiply by three to get the next term and then we're going to again multiply by three to get the next term and we're going to multiply by three to get the next term and these numbers are gonna get a lot 135 multiplied by 3 that will give me 405 multiplied by 3 again will give me 1215 I think and if I take that one again and I multiply that by 3 I should get three thousand six hundred and forty five and that will be my last three terms huge terms our tiffni suggests use your calculator take them okay let's have a look at the last guy okay they gave us here a 1 a 4 and 9 and a 16 ok increasing sequence again so I'm going to check firstly for term to term relationship have they added something from to move from the one to the other or have them maybe multiply it by something to move from the the one term to the next term okay right I'm gonna check first for common difference which means that they add something let me see 4 minus 1 will give me 3 let's check 9 minus 4 gives me 5 and no this is definitely no common difference okay let's check for a common ratio let's check 4 divided by 1 will give me 4 9 divided by 4 is definitely not gonna give me 4 so this is also not a common ratio so my term to term has not been too successful okay I'm gonna try position to turn just check the handwriting cars it's getting worse and worse position to term okay so let's find our positions here let's check this was the first term this is the second term this is the third term and this is a fourth term now you're going to check is there any connection between 1 & 1 2 & 4 3 & 9 & 4 & 16 yes I think that's quite clear I can see that 1 squared 1 squared will give me 1 2 squared will give me 4 3 squared will give me 9 4 squared will give me 16 so what they're doing is they're taking the position of the term and 
,,they squaring it so actually if you would look at the formula of this yeah it will be in squared you take the position every time and you square it okay great so if 
,,they want to you see they've given us 1 4 9 16 so they want the first term now I want that guy so we're gonna take 5 squared for the next term which is 25 six squared for the next term which is 36 and seven squared for the next term which is 49 great that's the rest of our sequence

Number Partens,CJoswoLMNTc,numeric and geometric patterns up to now you've learned about the different patterns numeric pattern will be a pattern that are made from and is created with numbers and a geometric pattern can be made from dots or matches or lines and in the past you just look what did you do with the previous term to get the next term you learn from with a constant difference or a ratio but now you have to learn in grade seven the rule determine the rule to find the next pattern with the numeric patterns 
,,it uh of patterns that's created by numbers and it patterns with a con without a constant ratio or a difference you get different ones the names that you have to know will be a triangular number pattern and in fact you learned about these you sort it and you will recognize a pattern you've done this in the previous grades as well you just didn't learn the name so with a triangular number pattern is a number pattern that makes a triangle if you look at this one there it will be one three six ten so you add plus two plus three plus four plus five it starts with one and then you add two and it makes a triangle then you add three it still makes a triangle 
,,you add four so you add every time one more than what you added to the previous term and you call that your triangular number pattern the screen number pattern think of the exponents that you've done with your screen number pattern it is square one so it means term one here is term one and then you square term one one times one 
,,gives you one then you square term two so two squared is four three squared is 9 4 squared is 16 and it's a square number pattern a cube number pattern is when you get the cube of each term so it's 1 times 1 times 1 1 cubed gives you 1. 2 times 2 times 2 is 2 cubed is 8. 3 cubed 27. 4 times 4 times 4 is 64. you have to know and 
,,recognize in grade 7 after 6 cubed is 216. so when you get the square number button you will remember in the pause it was just plus 3 plus 5 plus 7 plus 9 is every time 2 more than what you added to the previous term and that is actually your square number pattern the next one is your italian stallion fibonacci numbers it is here you add the previous term to this next term to get the next term so it's 0 plus 1 gives you 1. one plus one gives you two two plus one is three three plus two is five so you add the previous term to this term to get the next term and fibonacci recognize that if you add those terms it will make a pattern that looks like a shelf so it's these 0 1 5 8 13 21 34 55 we find it in the snails shelf beautiful patterns in the nature then patterns with a constant ratio or a constant difference it will be patterns that are that differ all the time but you add the same number to get the next pattern so if you look at this one it is you add three matches you're starting with four matches then you add three to get the next one and you add another three to get the third term so it's 4 plus 3 gives you 7 so there are 7 matches in this one so your ratio is a constant difference there you add 3 again because now to determine the rule because you add three every single time it will be the term number taskbar three term one taskbar three gives you three term two by 3 gives you 6 but you still need one extra one so it will be term 1 times by 3 is 3 plus 1 to get the fourth four matches term two times by three is six plus that one extra one it's actually where the first one you start with four and then every time you just add a third one to get term three three times three is nine plus the extra one so your rule remember always first write down your rule your rule will be termed tens by three plus 1 so to determine term 13 first always write down your rule term times by 3 plus 1 to determine term 13 it's 13 times by 3 plus 1 that gives you 39 
,,plus 1 so in your 13th term you will use 40 numbers or the 40 matches or they can ask you what will be your 13th term and then you say 13 times by 3 plus 1 and that 
,,will be 40. the following one also give metric pattern but it can also be written in a number as a number pattern so it is you have one two three four five six matches to add the next one you will add one two three four five matches so every time that you grow the pattern you will add five matches so it will be a number or this 
,,one is a geometric pattern with a constant ratio the difference stay the same so it will be 6 plus 5 gives you 11 plus 5 gives you 16 and so it continues so it will 
,,be 6 plus 5 is 11 16 21 26 and 31 so to determine your rule it will be term taskbar five because i add five every single time but now the first one if i say one times by 5 it gives me 5. so what do i still need to get 6 it will be plus 1 so my rule will be term times by 5 plus 1. if they ask you to determine the tenth term so then you write down your rule again first always that's term times by five plus one ten times about five plus one gives you 50 plus 1 and that's 51. you look at the next geometric pattern now it starts with six matches but now you just add four one two three four one two three four because you add four every time to determine your rule you will say the term times by four but look at the first one if you say term one task by four gives you four how many do you still need to get six it will be 
,,two so your rule will be term times by four plus two to determine the 25th term for example you first write down your rule term times by 4 plus 2. so it's 25 times by 4 is 100 plus two gives you a hundred and two remember to write down your rule before you replace the variable with the certain term number

Number Partens,wCtc75zDZkc,learning of ayah hi i'm aya today i'm going to talk about number patterns a number pattern is a series of numbers that follow a particular pattern or sequence number patterns let's find the next two numbers by following each pattern two four six eight ten twelve plus two plus two what is the pattern add two is the pattern glowing or shrinking growing let's try another one 30 27 24 21 18 fifteen minus three minus three what is the pattern subtract three is the pattern growing or shrinking shrinking let's try this one zero one zero one zero one zero one what is the pattern repeating numbers repeating numbers the same grouping over and over again the pattern never changes fill in the missing values inscribe the number pattern 20 25 30 35 40 45 what is the pattern add five twenty-five twenty-two nineteen sixteen thirteen ten what is the pattern subtract 3 24 20 16 12. eight four what is the pattern subtract 4 7 14 21 28 35 42 what is the pattern at seven one two three one two three one two three what is the pattern repeating numbers things to remember number pattern is a list of numbers that follow a certain sequence or pattern going when the numbers are getting bigger shrinking pattern the numbers are getting smaller repeating upon the same number grouping over and over again that's about it for our number patterns for today you can check my other videos about patterns thank you for watching this is i am saying bye bye

Number Partens,8C0n3V5jgt8,ha monokuma sharing with you a very interesting video on triangular numbers now this is part one which is very good for our junior and middle school students we look into pattern of making dots and forming triangles so let's begin with the single dot so we have one dot here and now we'll start making a pattern so we'll introduce two layers so we started with one dot then we added two more to make a particular triangle right so if I add one more layer by adding three more dots I could have a triangle with six dots so we have three dots now so if I add a triangle one layer at the base then what I get is another triangle with three layers we started with 
,,one thought we made two layers adding two at the bottom then third one three at the bottom and now we'll add the fourth layer to it so we started with one dot added 
,,two then we added three and now we are going to add another one so what we have here is the fourth pattern likewise this pattern can grow so let's make a table to check in every pattern how many dots are there right so we'll just make a table here to check how many dots are we getting as the pattern grows so let's say this is dots and here let's write the pattern number so beginning with pattern number one we get one dot in pattern number two this is our pattern number one this is pattern two three four and so on so in pattern number two you can count we have three dots Creek in pattern number three we have three more than three so it becomes six pattern number four we have full more than previous six so we get 10 so in five if we keep on adding one more each time then we can form a pattern right so so likewise in six we are going to have how many so what we see here is that as we move on first we added two dots and then we added three dots and then four five and now we should add six great so 15 plus 6 is 21 and likewise we can grow this pattern and find the number of dots now as an exercise can you tell me how many dots will be there in the tenth pattern without actually making them right so as you can see we are adding one more each time right so one way is we can count as going up so let's add seven now so we get 28 so for eight will add eight right so we get 28 plus eight as 36 plus 9 right so we get 45 and then for 10 with at 10 we get 55 do you see that 
,,so adding these numbers each time will give us the next pattern it was easy to figure out how many will be there in the tenth pattern let me just push this a bit but if my question is how many will there be in the hundredth pattern now going in this fashion is so difficult right what should we do so we should figure out a pattern rule so that gives us an idea of getting into a pattern rule right what kind of rule can be have one way of writing the rule is start at one add two right add two 
,,and then add one more each time right so you could write this as your pattern rule but this pattern rule helps you to make a table like we were trying to make earlier we need another kind of rule which could straight away give us the number we call that rule as explicit rule well without going through all the sequence directly we can find how many are there in the hundredth pattern right so father we have to relate these numbers somehow so what we see here is that in first we have one in two we're three in three we are six four we have ten five we have 15 now we also see that the previous one adds to the next one to get to the new one right in such kind of patterns what you observe is that these numbers could be derived if I do a small trick here to get to one I can multiply 1 and 2 and then divide by 2 right so so if I do 1 times 2 and then divide by 2 what do I get let's figure it out 1 times 2 is 2 and then divided by 2 is 1 correct let's follow this method now for the second one so I'll do 2 times 3 and then divide by 2 what do I get 2 divided by 2 is 1 and 3 times 1 is 3 or you can say 2 times 3 is 6 6 divided by 2 s 3 right so so that gives you the number 3 and if I continue with this pattern for 3 I'll write 3 times 4 divided by 2 for 4 I'll write 4 times 5 divided by 2 similarly I can continue so for 10 what can I write for 10 I can say this 10 times 11 / - right so that gives me 55 right the number matches do you see that with 100 what I do 100 times 1 and 1/2 that will be my answer so 100 by 2 is 50 so we go 50 times hundred and 150 means 1-0 you had and multiplied by 5 so 5 0 5 so we had 5050 dots for the hundredth pattern do you see that so that is how you can apply a rule and this kind of rule is called explicit rule so if the number is n then we say explicit rule here is n times n plus 1 Y divided by 2 if you have two numbers like this one after the other these numbers are called consecutive numbers right these are called consecutive numbers I missed em in between these aren't consecutive numbers so it is product of consecutive numbers divided by 2 so half the product of consecutive numbers give you the numbers in your triangular patterns student and stand now so that is how we can now my question here is to find new patterns so can you create or find new 
,,patterns here let's try to figure it out how we can find new patterns so we can work on these numbers so if I add 1 & 3 how much do I get if I add 3 & 6 what do I get so what we will do now is try to add these numbers and see what do we get so let me rewrite these numbers right so we'll write horizontally 1 3 6 10 15 and so on let me write here 1 3 6 10 15:21 and so on now what I'm trying to do is add the term numbers which are side by side so if I add one and three what do I get one plus three is four right what is 3 plus 6 3 plus 6 is 9 6 plus 10 is 16 10 plus 15 is 25 15 plus 21 is 36 and so on do you see that these numbers which you get by adding term numbers side by side are perfect squares so 4 is 2 squared 9 is 3 Square 16 is 4 squared 25 is 5 squared 36 is 6 square and so on so you also see a pattern of squares perfect squares when you add two term numbers side by side so that's kind of a very important rule or pattern which we observe in triangular numbers I hope that really helps you to appreciate these triangular numbers and welcome our you should feel free to post questions subscribe to my videos put some likes if you like thank you and all the best

Number Partens,OlUBFXfLE0c,hey guys today we're going to continue our unit on patterns and equations and today we're talking more specifically on finding the rules for patterns now we have been talking about learning what an equation is and how it's equal on both sides when now we're switching to the patterns side of it and finding the rules now you still will be using equations and in fact you are finding the rule for these patterns which involve an equation solving making finding the equation that is there so if we look at this pattern here for example we can see are this table sorry if we look at this table here we can see that the numbers already in but today we're going to 
,,be looking at tables that have mystery numbers our blanks that we're going to have to fill in now tables are often used as a means of displaying numbers pairs if the number pair faut pairs follow a pattern you can write a rule for the table a a rule is a numerical expression as we said that describes the relationship between each pair of numbers so let's look at this table below here let's look at this table so we're going to find a rule for these two you have the top to bottom generally our rule goes from the top number to the bottom number and it'll be opposite if we go from bottom to top so let's look at the rule here so I can look at these two I can say I'm either from the top one to the bottom one I'm either adding two so I'm adding two or I'm multiplying by three because one times what gives me 3 1 times 3 now usually when you find tables you're going to either add subtract multiply or divide to find your patterns or rules and you have to figure out which one so you have to know all your facts that's why it's important to know all your facts readily so you can do these very quickly and find the rules very quickly so 1 times 1 plus 
,,2 is 3 and 1 times 3 is 3 so now let's see which one of these works let's try a plus 2 plus 2 does that equal 6 no so we know this one cannot be our rule so let's see multiplying by 3 works 2 times 3 2 times 3 equals six so let's try 5 5 times 3 5 times 3 yes 5 times 3 equals 6 is 15 sorry in 6 times 3 6 times 3 is 18 yes that works in 8 times 3 is 24 now it's important that you want to check all of all the numbers that you have all the parts on the table just to make sure your rule is correct because if it's not correct you or if the first one is correct and the second one is correct but the third one is not correct then you could be wrong completely 
,,so you want to make sure that it's all correct so at this one my rule is multiply by 3 so let's go ahead and look at another example where we don't have all the blanks filled in so let's look at this table here so we have this table here and I see have three different missing numbers now oftentimes your table will look something like this you can find your role here and then you have to find in the missing parts here so with this one you can see you have the rule that you have the top one but not the bottom one then you have the bottom the bottom one without the top one and then this one you have two blanks so let's go how I can find each one of these 
,,first step is finding our rule here so these will tell us what our rule will be so since the top one is bigger than the bottom on all of these I know I'm either going to subtract or I'm going to divide so let's look at the first one 4 - what gets me to 4 4 minus 2 and then let's look if I divide 4 divided by what egos 204 also divided by 2 gets me gets me - so let's see which one over here 10 minus 2 does that get me 8 yes so the rule with this one works here and then 8 minus 6 yes that still works so 10 divided by 8 no so we know the vision is not going to be a rule but subtracting subtract by 2 will give me my answer and I check to make sure that it 
,,works with all of the ones I have so I know that this is correct so subtracting by two alright so now now that we know the rule subtract by two we are going to see if we can find out what these would be so 14 minus 2 so 14 minus 2 is going to be 12 and then so with this one this one we have to go backwards now if we're going backwards the top one is going to be bigger correct so instead of subtracting 2 we're going to have to add 2 so like 12 plus 2 is 14 6 plus 2 is 8 so let's try 7 plus 2 would be 9 and so we can check our rule with the top 1 9 minus 2 so it's back and forth there they became they become somewhat of a fact family so that's how it works now if you have two blanks they are going to be you can pretty much put in whatever you want up here so we like 18 and then you just apply the rule 18 minus 2 would be 16 so that's how these work

Number Partens,w-HEaLbb6f4,did I gents I hope you guys are doing role and that you're managing during this lockdown period I'm driving the parents up for whoa I thought I just put a short lesson together of this number pattern section that is also in your textbooks there might be a few areas that you're not too sure about hopefully this all are not those 
,,issues and help you to completely understand there are a few things in the section that are pretty simple that I'm sure you guys already know how to do so I can spend too much time on that I'm going to be focusing more on the work concerning the general rule and number patterns okay so let's get started this will be familiar to 
,,you because this is from your textbook in the section of there are a few things first of all identify pattern or relationship between consecutive terms in order to extend the pattern that's the easy part make a general rule about the pattern with which you can find consecutive terms that's what I'm going to be focusing on the most now and work with geometric patterns links quite wrong with the previous one okay so a few examples of identifying the pattern and extending it here you can see we have all of terms er particular terms get these are called terms and they have positions as well one two three four five six you see there that are going up bar - 
,,maybe term is going up by two so he's heading to every term so the next number of the 14 will be 14 plus 2 which is 16 and just show another yeah we've clearly yeah 
,,we have another pattern goes from 3 to 7 to 11 to 15 so it's pretty clear that it's going up up for every time so to get the next term off the 15 you add 4 we'll get 19 and then you're off the 19 you add for gang and get to any needed 3 etc third one is a little bit different because it's not additional subtraction all we have multiplication so you go from 1 to 3 you have to multiply by 3 from 3 to 9 you multiple three and nine to 27 lost power 3 so to go from 27 to the next term you have to multiply by 3 and you'll get 81 you know do the same with 81 to get to the next term if you want to yeah we just have a pattern involving shapes so yeah we have these to be shapes here and you see going to be adding to here going from 1 1 tone 1 squared - 3 squeeze you have to add 2 or 3 squares to 6 squares you have to add 3 
,,so you added to you at a 3 thanks oh I ain't going to add 4 you see over here then the one after that before we going to add 5 ok yeah we just have some fractions makes a little bit more interesting we see the numerator numerator adding 1 every time we have - 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 the denominator starting with F 3 and adding before every time so as it shows you add 1 to the numerator every time and then add 4 to the denominator okay I'm not going to go too much into this next one yeah it's just exercise 1 yeah identify the relationship between the consecutive terms I write down the next to turn that is the easy part it's not that hard to identify a pattern and the until you determine the consecutive terms I'm pretty sure you guys are able to do this on your own and if you're stuck weasel in the night okay so the more challenging part is finding the general rule for pattern but I'm going to explain it to you and I'm pretty sure you get it do you cookie if you haven't done so already okay so the general rule for number patterns it shows the relationship between the term at its position than the sequence we often refer to the true as T in or the in - so we'll you'll see a few symbols here and I will explain what those symbols mean because I do have a specific meaning so when when we do number patterns one of the most common ones we refined our ones with a constant difference between the terms so most of the ones we've looked at already have that type of sequence so if the sequence IV a go from 2 to 7 for 7 to 12 and 12 to 17 in other words you're adding far every time so that is your constant difference okay constant because it's the same thank you Tom so adding 5 every time so what do these symbols mean here T is abandoned one is representing the position so it's the value of the first two this one is the value of the second to the value of the third value of the fourth term in which we see over here in represents the position but like I said here that's in usually so that position is the first one but T is the value if you understand that it'll really help you a lot going forward and don't only get confused between the two so here what they're saying is the value of the fourth one minus the value of the third one is equal to the value of the third one minus the value of the second one which is equal to the value of the second one - that ideally the first one gives you far this is the wildest rating that they have a constant difference but you don't you know that you won't be lost that sort of question or to write that out on a test that's just a way of showing you at the constant difference is 5 ok so 
,,let's do an example here we have sequence 3 270 11 to 15 determine the general rule of the sequence from si the general rule that's another way of writing it in symbolic form ok the general rule so how do we do that like we sort of the previous example you look for a constant difference so what is the difference between each turn and is it constant in this case it is we have we are adding for every time and by the way constant difference isn't always addition it can be subtraction so if this is written the other way around 15 11 7 3 then our constant difference wouldn't beat plus 4 between minus 4 okay let's deal with the first question before we get to regions adding 4 that is your constant difference so remember you'll general over here TN is equal to 4 n minus 1 that's your answer but you will you're going to start off with the difference the difference is full okay so you're right down to write down 4 that's it that's all you need right done and then it's always going to 
,,be 4 times in so it's always going to do the constant difference Tom's in now what is in in is the position so you can pick any one of these as long as you write substitute the position and then so let's take the first position now this is the first term so this position is 1 so you put full Tom's 1 what is for Tomba 1/4 but with a value of the first position is multiple the value of the first position is 3 so you put 3 in there so you've got like a little equation wrong so 3 equals 4 so what unless you do to this 4 because 3 doesn't equal 4 3 equals 4 minus 1 so this minus 1 over here you need to work out it is not going to be given to you it's not always going to be minus 1 sometimes when you plus 2 u plus 5 or minus 6 it can be anything the point is you get this value by applying the method that I just explained so let's recap the first thing you do if you get asked to determine the general find the constant difference the constant difference in this case is full so you're right down to four okay and then four times in so you pick any position I usually pick one so four times one okay but then you write the value you have to write the value of that position on this side of the equal sign TN remember T stands for the value so you've got three here equals four now you need to do something to this four times one to get it to equal the side of the equals R otherwise this equal sign means nothing and that equals means that's the same so you've got three equals full and then it's going to have to be minus one to be current or a chance all right that makes sense what letter to Ward's on is just not find the 58 turn in the pattern using the general rule is the next question so 58th turn that's its position we need to find the value of that to so we remove position must go in the place of in because in represent position so then you're going to write 58 in ins place so you will have to say four times 58 minus one and that is going to give you your value of this of the X term which is 231 so the value or the 58th term is 231 but they can also ask you the other way around like this which term in the sequence has a value of 30 on so now you don't put that 39 in the in position because in represent position this is a value so you have to put it in T's places so you have to put it in this on this side okay so if we scroll down you'll see four n minus one equals 39 so that means if you take that one away that means you have to add one to the side so you get four in equals 40 now what Tom's full gives you 40 because that's what ins position is 4 times 10 gives you 14 so in equals 10 what does that mean what does it mean of in is 10 that means the position of this value is thin so they said which term in the sequence has a value of 59 so we know that the 10th term in this sequence will have the value of 39 this saves you Tom you don't have to write out the sequence until you get to the 10th term does that make sense because we can ask you much bigger numbers that are going to take you very long to add out the sequence in order to get you the 10th term or whatever term it is here's another example that we're gonna have a look at given the sequence determine the general rule so you see this is a common question well what is the first thing we need to do I 
,,put it above you have to look for the constant difference what is the constant difference here to go from negative 2 to negative 5 and from negative 5 to negative anything from negative a to negative 11 you have to subtract 3 you subtract 3 from the negative 2 you get negative 5 etc so that is a constant difference negative 3 so you write down negative 3 Tom's 1 that would be the position the so if your first if you choose your first position where negative 3 time to 1 but the first positions value over there is negative 2 a negative 3 times 1 equals negative 3 not negative 2 so what do we need to do to negative 3 to get it to the end of T we have to add 1 so that answers our question yet so T end will equal negative 3 in plus 1 now can use that general rule to answer the questions that follow and here's a lovely 
,,exercise which you guys can do that will help you to apply the list of the defender guarding general rule yeah they give you the general rule already so that's not too bad they've given it they've given it to you're ready and you need to determine the first three terms so let's have a look at this tricky if you put the first term would be position one so you put one in the inter-basin can we call it a substitution like when you substitute someone on the sports would you replace them so you 
,,replace their in with one that'll give you one plus two which will give you the value of the first term which is three then you substitute 2 in a for the second term so two plus two is four and then for the third term you three plus two is five so you get it was three four and five and you do the same for all of these to get the value in first three terms to determine the hundreth term you put a hundred in here a hundred plus two it's going to be a hundred and two for question two point one okay I know I've gone through this change by quickly image it's quite difficult sometimes to explain without writing on that on a whiteboard to you what I'm thinking but gentlemen you're and feel free to ask me any questions in the comment section of this video or you are walking to send me a private message and I'll get back to you right over this

Number Partens,OMgsimpghnU,right let's have a look at what we've got yet they told us to study the number sentence below and answer the questions okay great let's first studied and answer the 
,,questions they gave us five eight and 11 well I don't know what you noticed but the first thing that I noticed is that for you to move from five to eight we need to 
,,add three and to move from eight to eleven we need to add three again okay so let's just think about that okay what do we call that number is the common difference now why a difference because actually to find it you actually win term two minus term one which is 8 minus 5 which is 3 and if you take the third term by the way that's how we write it I term three minus term two again would be 11 minus 8 which is three so because we're subtracting this value here is called your common difference so your difference is actually equal to 3 if we would go to our table that we've got right at the top here what I've done is I first made a column which is very useful for you which shows the position of the term which will be in this guy's term 1 2 & 3 and then the value of the term which is actually the sequence that I've given you which will be 5 8 and 11 now the reason why I've done that it's because I really saw that the first question they asked us is to write a formula to describe the relationship between the position of the term in the sequence which they labeled in and the value of the term which they labeled T okay now whenever there are XI 
,,to write a formula a formula means that you have to find the position of the term to the term relationship now what we've done so far is we found a term to term relationship term to term means how do I move from the first term to the second term from the second term to the third term that's how a term to term relationship it's very useful but for you to now find the 90th term for instance it's an absolute disaster because you'll have to write down all the terms adding three every until you 
,,get to the 90th term and as you've probably noticed in any math test time is a serious problem for us so that's not gonna work so you'll have to make use of your second option here which is your position two term relationship which means what is the relationship between one and five and what is the position between two and eight and three and eleven I can the first thing I can tell you here is whenever you have a sequence with a common difference okay like we have here there is a common difference D is three okay when you're writing down your formula you will definitely have a three in in your formula which means they will always be d x in in your formula in that will be then plus or minus something else will be added to that but you definitely know that you're going to have three in your formula all we need to discover is what is added on or subtracted here okay cool so let's write out number sentences term one would then be three terms what plus what to end up with five because that is our first term okay so if we are going to go three in we're gonna say 3 times 1 because that is our immediate aesthetic and it's I like that let's start in at this stage which was your in V I can I'd max inside so now we'll say three times what 1 is 3 plus what gives us 5 while definitely plus 2 a Canary's check for our second term we've got 3 times to remember our second term is equal to 8 3 times 2 gives our 6 6 plus what gives us I'd it's 2 again you see we can pretty much see what our formula gonna be it's probably gonna be 3 in plus 2i but let's just make sure let's check the third guy term 3 is going to be equal to 3 x 3 which is 9 we've gotta end up with an 11 if we add 2 to that 9 plus 2 is 11 you see pops your uncle this is your formula so your formula is simply going to be T in equals to 3 in plus two so that's the important thing to remember if you look at your sequencing you see you've got a common difference which means you keep on adding something or subtracting something then you know that the in part of your formula will always be your difference x in okay right Melissa will have a look at the next question in the next question they say now what is the value of the 19th term we know that you've got the formula now what is the value of the 90th term okay so what is important is to know that they've given us the position of the term so they gave us the value of in they told us that in is equal to 90 if you look at our table here we have that number we are looking for the value of the term so we're simply going to use our formula that's why we've got a formula by the way because if you didn't have a formula you would have had to keep on adding three adding three adding three until you get to the 90th term I guess let's take our formula we're finding the value of the term and we're gonna go three in the price of the end I'm gonna substitute a ninety plus two so TN which represents the value of my term as then three times 
,,ninety which has two and a 70 plus two which will then give me 272 so now you know that term 90 is equal to 272 great next one which term has the value of 50 okay so now they gave us the value of the term so they gave us the teapot or the TN pot they're looking for the position of the term now only two variables in the sequence 
,,as a we'd obviously looking here for the position of the term there are only two variables in this sequence which means they're either going to ask you for the value and give you the position or they're going to give you the position or for the value occur right so let's have a look please for in 50 year and we are solving for the in that is the letter that we are going to isolate here so a simple linear equation the first thing you need to do is you need to get rid of your other terms which it's my plus two so mathematically what I do is I'm going to subtract two from each side I know that's not what you do all you do is you say I take the two across 
,,the equal side to the other side but unfortunately I have to do the right thing so I've got to explain to you mathematically what you're actually doing but we're gonna end up at the same point you are also going to end up with fifty minus two as 48 on the left hand side equals to three in on the right hand side because two minus two is zero so now an indicator of the three it's three multiplied by M so we do the inverse operation we divide by three so I'm going to end up within to be equal 
,,to sixteen right so term 16 is actually equal to 50 and then ask us which term has a value of 15 it's the 16th term right in this listen I want to show you how to work with a very special type of a number sequence and this is the fractional number sequence but this is a very special one because you turn to move from the one term to the next term in terms of the entire fraction you separate the numerators and the denominators if you for instance look at this one yet if you look at your numerators which means your numbers at the top you've got a 1 a 3 and a 5 now that's quite easy to see that we have a difference here of 2 which means we actually add 2 every time to get to the next term 3 to 5 you also add 2 to move to that next terms which means we can actually say we have a difference here of 2 because 3 minus 1 gives me 2 and 5 minus 3 gives me 2 now if you look at your denominators there you've got a 2 a 5 and 8 what a simple sequence if you just look at it like that where 
,,you move from them one term to the next by simply adding a 3 from 5 to 8 again we just add a 3 so here in the denominator we have another comment difference I'm just gonna call that D 1 and that will then be equal to 3 now the first question was to write down the fourth term now that'll be quite easy for us now because we've found out how to move from one term to the next so we know what our term to term formula is here we simply add a 2 to the numerator and a 3 to the denominator right so 
,,let's go let's write down our third term which was 5 over 8 so now to get to the next one I'm simply going to go and add 2 at the top and add 3 at the bottom so my new term would be 5 plus 2 is 7 8 plus 3 is 11 okay that's simple enough okay let's move to the next question now here it comes right down an algebraic rule to describe the pattern separate rules for the numerator and the denominator will be required so now here we must remember that when we have an algebraic rule we're actually 
,,connecting the position of the term to the value of the term so this is a position to term formula but we've already found out quite a lot remember we looked at our 
,,tops our fourth one now as well and we looked at our denominators our bottoms and what we did was we said in their numerators we have a common difference of two and 
,,in the denominators we have a common difference of three so when we're gonna write down a formula we've discovered before in one of the previous videos I told you this little trick that when you have a common difference in your formula you're you would have d x in would be part of your formula so if you would for instance look at the whole formula for this entire fraction at the top you'll have the common difference of two x in so two in will appear somewhere here in your formula whereas in the denominator you would have d x in my d is a three so I will have three in some way here and my formula but that will be my numerator and again here I've got my 
,,denominator right so let's have a look if we look at our numerators we've got one three five seven now I know for my first term I'm going to have to multiply it by one gives me two but I'm supposed to end up with a one so I'm gonna subtract one and that will give me a 1 so at this stage I'm saying the formulas to n minus 1 but I can't just say that I I need to check let's go for the second term 2 times 2 now which is four minus one gives me three is that correct yes my second term is three 
,,let's go for my third term I'm gonna go two times three is six minus one gives me five yes it's correct I can pretty pretty much go and say that TN is equal to two in minus one okay so that's my formula for the top let me just quickly get rid of those little dots and there we go my formula for my numerator will be 2 n minus 1 right now let's go for the denominator denominator I said term 1 will have to be 3 times 1 VIN and I've got in with a two-year I see left side in 3-1 I know that'll give me two but I need to check jump two will then be 3 times 2 is 6 minus 1 gives me a 5 is that correct yes it's a 5 let me check my third term that'll be 3 times 3 
,,is 9 minus 1 is 8 yes that's great okay great so we can pretty much say in the denominator we've got 3 in minus 1 so that was my formula for my numerator and this is my formula for my denominator okay so once again let me just get rid of that and then I'm gonna write around 3 n minus 1 and that is my denominator formula so this 
,,entire thing that I've got here that will then be my algebraic rule which will describe this entire pattern okay next question they said write down this that xxx term but we've already got our formula so that is absolutely no issue for us now we're simply gonna go term 30 as then equals to 2 times 30 minus 1 over 3 times 30 minus 1 because you must remember if they ask us for the 30th term then we know that in is then equal to 30 so in this formula my n will be 30 so these my 30 there's my 
,,30 and these my 30 and remember what we've got on the left-hand side here will give me my entire value of my term so I'll end up with 2 times 30 which is 60 minus 159 over 3 times 30 which is 90 minus 189 right and that's your 30s term and because you've got a rule you didn't have to count on account on and count on from the fourth term up until the 30th term

Number Partens,f4c8izcEX4s,hello graduate children today i'm here to teach you chapter four in your textbook that's directed numbers we can call it directed numbers as well so we'll see what are the basics here what is this one what what you call this one this is a number line so starting point is 0 and then towards the right hand side you get positive numbers towards left hand side you get negative numbers so 0 plus 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4 like that towards this side to the right side minus 1 minus 2 minus 3 to the left side of 0. what about in between in between means any decimals or fractions in between the whole numbers but only we mark the integers half 0.5 is in between 0 and 1. so any fraction or decimal in between the integers now what are these plus 1 plus 1.2 plus 3.5 these are directed numbers there's a direction that's why we use plus or minus so here it's better to write directed numbers in brackets because we can see that whether it's towards positive side or towards negative side now here use plus for addition and subtraction we use minus sign so therefore it is better to write directed numbers in brackets so here minus 3 means to the left side of 0 
,,3 units to the left plus 8 means towards right hand side plus 5 towards right hand side minus 4 towards left hand side so when you want to show directed numbers sign is important and make sure that you put brackets now what are the properties in directed numbers magnitude and the direction so what is magnitude means the size of 
,,the directed number just a number direction means whether it's positive or negative so consider plus 3 what's the magnitude there you take only the number plus 3 that is the distance on the number line from 0 to plus 3 this is towards right hand side plus sign represent the number is in the right hand side to zero consider minus five directed number what's the magnitude there magnitude is five so what's the meaning of that magnitude 5 means starting from 0 to -5 distance from 0 to -5 and minus means the number is in the left hand side to zero write down the magnitude and the direction for given directed numbers plus seven so what's the magnitude 7 what's the direction plus plus means to the right minus 8 magnitude is 8 minus means to the left of 0 plus 4 4 is the magnitude this is to the right and minus 10 10 is the magnitude this is to the left 0 that's not moving so magnitude 0 and what's the direction none not moving left or right minus six means six is the magnitude minus means to the left plus 12 plus 12 means magnitude is 12 and plus means to the right now look at this one numbers with the same magnitude and opposite signs are located in equal distance from zero when you add these the answer is zero now what it means now take this one so here i can start minus 3 minus 2 minus 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 like that minus 3 what it means 0 to minus 3 distance plus 3 means 0 to right hand side distance so these two distances are the same when you add what happens opposite 
,,sides get cancel out and you get 0 if this is plus 7 to get 0 you need to add minus 7. if this is 0 plus 8 is there that means you have to add minus a and if this is minus 10 is there you have to add plus 10 to get 0. so we call it's the additive inverse additive inverse means if you take plus 3 minus 3 is the additive inverse of plus 3. now if you take plus 7 what's the additive inverse that's minus 7 minus 12 what's the additive inverse of minus 12 that's plus 12 when you add these you get zero addition of directed numbers so what we do so plus 2 plus 5 so we can start from plus 2 in grade 7 you did starting with 0. now we can start with plus 2. so plus 2 is there here and adding plus 4 so straight away 4 units from here 1 2 3 4 so the answer you are getting here is the final answer so what is plus 2 plus 4 that's plus 6 so the answer is plus 6. start from plus 2 and move 4 places to the right answer is obtained from the last position on the number line let's take this one 
,,minus 3 so start with -3 plus plus means to the right and plus 4 means you are moving 4 places to the right 1 2 3 4 so you're moving to this side so what's minus 3 plus 4 answer is plus 1 this one negative 2 plus negative 3 so starting from negative 2 and adding negative 3 adding means to the right but you are subtracting here another minus three now again you have to go back to left so another three one two three to the left side so what's the final answer minus 2 adding 3 places to the left so final answer is minus 5. so start from minus 2 and move 3 places to the left answer is obtained from the position on the number line find minus 4 plus 7 so starting from minus 4 plus seven that means moves to the right seven places one two three four five six seven so here to here so what's the final position plus 3 here 2 this is 3 so plus 3 is the answer this one plus seven and minus eight so here plus seven starting point is plus seven adding and here minus eight so minus means you have to move eight places to the left one two three four five six seven eight so this is the final position so what's the answer minus one plus 4 plus minus 7 so starting point is plus 4 plus and minus 7 means moves 7 places to the left so what's the answer 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 so here 2 here so the final position is minus 3 write down the answer at once now all are positive and addition so what you do just add the numbers and put the sign positive both numbers are positive answer is also positive and value is the sum of the two numbers so you can do at once 5 plus 3 8 sine is positive 7 plus 2 9 sine is positive 6 plus 4 10 sine is positive 8 plus 6 fourteen sign is positive nine plus one ten sign is positive and four plus four eight sine is positive write down the answer at once now what happens you get both negatives and addition sign is there so what we do both numbers are negative answer is also negative and the value is the sum of the two numbers if both are negative just add it 3 plus 2 5 but the sign is negative 5 and 3 8 here negative 7 plus 6 13 negative 30 5 and 5 10 that's negative 10 9 plus 2 11 that's negative 11 and four plus four eight that's negative eight write down the answer at once now what happens one is positive and the other one is negative so what we do here addition of directed numbers with opposite signs ignore the sign and take the difference between the two values sine of the answer is always the sign of the larger number so what we do take the difference 7 and 2 difference is 5. and which one is a bigger plus 7 so the answer is plus 5. 6 and 3 difference is 3 positive 6 is the bigger one it's plus 3 10 and 4 what's the difference 6 but large number is negative so negative 6 here 11 and 8 what's the difference 3 large number is positive so you put positive 3 subtraction of directed numbers now you are asked to find out plus 4 minus minus 2 using number line so what's the starting value plus 4 here subtraction is left and minus 2 you need to get the opposite direction so that means plus 2 so 2 places to the right so you get 6 is the answer so we can write plus 4 minus minus 2 is plus 6. this one find minus 3 minus minus 5 using number line so minus 3 is the starting point minus means left subtraction and minus 5 you have to consider the opposite that means five places to the right one two three four five so you get plus two so minus three minus minus five is plus 2. find the answer using number line so starting value is plus 3 minus minus means left here plus 4 so left 4 places 1 2 3 4 so you get this number so what's the answer minus 1. 5 minus minus 7 start with minus 5 okay so these are all positive numbers and here minus is left and another minus means opposite direction seven places to the right one two three four five six seven so you get plus 2 as the answer so make sure that you put brackets so the answer is plus 2. this one plus 4 is the starting point minus plus 6 means 6 places to the left 1 2 3 4 5 6. 6 places to the left the final as is minus 2 so you can write -2 there zero minus minus four what's the starting value zero and here minus and another minus get cancel out so you are moving four places to the right one two three four what's the final answer you get plus four so here also plus four is the answer this one 0 that means starting point is 0 minus plus 5 means moves 5 places to the left 1 2 3 4 5. you get minus 5 so what's the answer minus 5 is the directed number plus 2 minus plus 4 starting value is plus 2. this is all positive and minus to the left 4 units 1 2 three four so here this way so the answer is minus two write down the answer at once now you know what you have to do so here 7 and these all this is positive both positive and the subtraction just subtract 7 minus 5 plus 2 8 minus 4 what's 8 minus 4 plus 4 10 minus 6 you get 4 and this is plus 4 9 and plus 5 difference is 4 and this is plus 4 6 and 4 subtraction you get plus 2 11 and 9 
,,you need to subtract 11 minus 9 2 11 minus 9 is 2 that's plus 2 this side minus 3 and plus 4 now so here difference is 1 and look at this one so you have to add starting from minus 3 move 4 places to the left again so what's the answer 4 and 3 you get 7 that's minus 7 this one starting from minus 5 moves 9 places towards left side 9 plus 5 14 that's minus starting from minus 10 you are moving 12 places again to the left side so you are adding these two numbers so 22 and this is minus 8 and 
,,4 addition is 12 and this is minus because starting value is minus 4 you move 8 places to the left starting point is minus 9 move 11 places to the left that means just add these two numbers starting from minus seven subtract plus eight means moves eight places to the left eight plus seven fifteen that's minus additive inverse we know if it's plus 2 when you add minus 2 to both sides what happens you get plus 2 n minus 2 becomes 0 so you get x equals minus 2 so what's the additive inverse of plus 2 that's minus 2 so minus 2 is the additive inverse of plus 2 addition of additive inverse numbers the answer is 0 so when you add additive inverse you get the answer 0. now we'll see these numbers you are getting 0. how you get 0 when you add additive inverse plus 3 when you add additive inverse of plus 3 that's minus 3 you get 0 minus 2 there when you add plus 2 you get 0 minus 8 when you add plus 8 you get 0 plus 9 when you add minus 9 you get 0 minus 3 additive inverse is plus 3 minus 7 additive inverse of that is plus 7 to get 0 plus 11 additive inverse is minus 11 when you add additive inverse values you get 0 write down the additive inverse of given numbers plus 3 or 3 inverse minus 3 minus 8 plus 8 is the additive inverse 9 is minus 9 minus 6 that means plus 6 plus 11 means minus 11 is the additive inverse minus 1.5 plus 1.5 plus three and a half minus three and a half minus six point three plus six point three and plus seven and a half means minus seven and a half minus 2 1 4 means plus 2 and 1 4 so these are the additive inverse of these numbers now when you have two numbers directed numbers to subtract what you can do you can add the additive inverse and change the question for example if the question is plus 5 minus plus 2 that means you can add the additive inverse of plus 2. so this is same as plus five plus of minus two so both cases you get the same answer so here also plus five and minus two phi minus two is plus three then subtraction means moves two places to the left that is also plus three so subtraction of directed numbers means addition of additive inverse of that number write down the following subtractions as addition of additive inverse and find the answer now how can i write this question plus 7 i can write plus of minus 2 adding these two numbers so what we can do 7 and subtract 2 you get plus 5 plus 6 minus becomes plus additive inverse of minus 5 is plus 5. so you get 6 and 5 addition that's plus 11 plus 6 is there minus becomes plus of the additive inverse that's minus 2 that means 6 minus 2 you get plus minus nine and here additive inverse of minus five is plus five so nine and five addition we take the difference and put the sign of the larger number it's minus 4. this one minus 11 is there addition of additive inverse is minus 3 then minus 11 minus 3 both are the same sign add it and put the minus sign so minus 40. here also you can do the same thing minus 8 adding the additive inverse of minus 4 that's plus 4. so take the difference that's 4 put the sign of the bigger number that's minus 4 minus 6 addition of the additive inverse that's minus 3 both signs are the same so add it and put the sign minus 9 plus 11 addition of the additive inverse that's plus 3 11 plus 3 14 that's plus minus 12 additive inverse of plus 
,,3 is minus 3 both negative so add it that's 15 both negative so you get the answer also negative minus 9 adding of the additive inverse of minus 5 that's plus 5. so 
,,this is the difference because 1 is positive and 1 is negative and they put the sign of the larger numbers you get minus 4 for subtraction write down the addition of additive inverse numbers and find the answer same thing i can write minus as the plus of the additive inverse so you get 11 plus 3 40. now we'll do this one minus 6. plus 3 here you can convert to addition of additive inverse of minus 8 that's plus now these two you can add 8 plus 3 11 11 minus 6 you get 5 that's positive this 
,,one minus 9 plus minus 2 and here convert to addition of the additive inverse that's plus 6. so minus 2n minus 9 minus 11 minus 11 and plus 6 means the difference is 5 the bigger number is minus 11 so you get minus 5 minus 1 plus 8 minus becomes additive inverse of that that's plus 3 and plus plus 2. 8 plus 3 11 11 plus 2 plus 30. this one plus 11 and here convert to positive addition of additive inverse of minus 4 is plus 4 and here also adding the additive inverse of minus 2 is plus 2. now all are positive just add the numbers 11 plus 4 15 15 plus 2 17 multiplication of directed numbers so what we do ignore the sign just multiply the two numbers and 
,,then what you do if both signs are the same answer is positive always if the signs are different you get a negative answer 3 times 2 6 plus plus both signs are the same you get plus 6 2 and 2 4 both pluses plus 4 2 and 1 2 both pluses you get plus so remember same sign you get always positive when you multiply by zero what happens multiplication of directed number by zero is always zero now look at this one multiply the directed numbers 3 times 2 6 and this is plus 2 times 2 4 and this is plus 1 times 2 2 same sign you get plus 0 times plus 2 you get 0. so when you look at this side you see a pattern 6 4 2 0 what are these numbers minus 2 minus 4 and minus 6 will check whether it's true both numbers are not the same now same sign 1 is negative and 1 is positive so the answer is negative so 2 times 1 2 you get negative 2 2 times 2 4 you get negative 4 3 times 2 6 negative 6 because 1 is positive the other one is negative so here you need to remember multiplication of positive 
,,numbers answer is always positive multiplication of positive number with a negative number answer is negative write down the answer once answer is positive when multiply two positive numbers so all these are positive numbers so you get positive answer 5 times 3 50 plus 15. 4 times 3 12. so plus 12 two times six twelve plus twelve seven times two fourteen plus fourteen and four times four sixteen that's plus sixteen one times three three that's plus three eight times two sixteen plus sixteen eleven times two twenty two that's plus six times three eighty that's plus 10 times 440 that's plus find the answer 3 times -2 ignore the sign and here 1 is positive and 1 is negative you get the answer negative this is 4 minus 4 1 times 2 2 this is minus 2. 0 times -2 is 0 now look at this one same sign minus and minus so you 
,,get positive 2 2 times 2 plus 4 because both are negative both are negative you get plus 6 so what's the thing you need to remember multiplication of positive number and a negative number is always a negative answer answer is negative multiplication of two negative numbers the answer is positive write down the answer at once answer is negative and multiply a positive and a negative number now plus as minus here all these 1 is positive the other number is negative so always the answer is negative 3 times 2 6 that's negative 6 3 times 2 6 negative 6 4 times 4 16 negative 16 6 times two twelve that's negative twelve eight times five forty that's negative 
,,forty six times three eighteen that's negative eighteen eight times two sixteen negative sixteen here nine times one nine negative nine four times four sixty that's 
,,negative two times 11 22 that's negative one negative and one positive answer is always negative write down the answer at once answer is positive and multiply two negative numbers in all these both numbers are negative so the final answer is positive three times two six five times one five six times two twelve eight times three 
,,twenty-four nine times two eighteen then 4 times 3 12 5 times 3 15 11 times 1 that's plus 11 10 times 2 20 9 times 3 27 so here both negative means the final answer 
,,is positive write down the answer at once yeah you get combination sometimes positive sometimes negative both negative answer is positive one is negative one is positive answer is negative one is positive one is negative answer is negative so you need to multiply separate 9 times to 80. both negative answer is positive 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative so 10 times 3 30. 11 times 3 33 both negative that means plus one negative one positive answer is negative both negative positive answer one negative one positive answer is negative both negative answer is positive 9 times 4 36 both negative means answer is positive 12 times 224 one negative one positive answer is negative write down the answer at once look at all these questions multiplied by zero when you multiply any number by zero what's the answer 
,,you always get zero so what are these answers all these are zeros because you are multiplying by zero any number with zero is always zero find the value now you can 
,,take 2 at a time and find the answer 4 times 3 12 but it's negative now both negative the answer is positive twelve times five sixty plus one minus four and minus two four times two eight both negative means plus plus say ten minus 3 multiplication 8 times 3 24 1 is plus 1 is negative means you get a negative answer this one minus 9 minus 1 both negative means plus 9 now multiply with 4 9 times 4 36 both positive means the answer also positive minus 5 times 2 you get a negative answer because 1 is positive and the other one is negative multiplied by negative both negative now so you get a positive answer again take 2 at a time 8 times 3 24 both positive one is positive one is negative so first multiply four times four sixteen one remaining four times two eight plus one nine one plus and one negative answer is negative both negative you get a plus answer plus 33 and when you multiply by a negative the answer is a negative one both negative you get plus answer 3 times 2 6. here you can do separately these two 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative 4 times 3 12. now 12 times 6 ignore sign and multiply 6 times 2 12 1 remaining and here 72 is it positive or negative 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative here 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is 12 there minus 12 negative 12. both negative answer is positive 4. now 12 times 4 48 what's the sign one negative one positive answer is negative this one again take two at a time negative both you get positive 10 positive both you get positive 6 now multiply both positive you get positive 60. here both negative negative negative you get positive answer here negative negative positive answer now positive positive multiplication you get positive answer 9 times 4 is 30 6. find the value just multiply by two first two times one two two times three six what's the sign one negative one positive answer is negative multiply by two two times one two two times five ten ten point two is the answer both 
,,negative you get plus sign four times this 4 times 3 12 1 remaining 4 times 1 4 plus 1 5 so 5.2 both positive means answer is positive this one multiplied by 2 6 and 2 1 is negative and 1 is positive answer is negative now we look at division of directed numbers now we know multiplication 5 into plus 2 you get plus 10. now what 
,,happens when you take 10 divided by plus 2 you take this one to this side that becomes division so what's the answer you are getting plus 5 divide the numbers ignoring the sign answer is positive when dividing positive number by a positive number so just ignore the sign 10 divided by 2 you get 5. both positive means answer is also positive write down the answer once 8 divided by 2 is 4 how you decide the sign both positive means positive sign 15 divided by 5 is 3 both positive you get the positive answer 10 divided by 10 1 both positive you get 1. 16 divided by 4 4 you get plus 4 8 divided by 2 that's 4 that is also plus 4. 20 divided by 5 20 divided by 5 is 4 both positive you get positive 4. 16 divided by 8 you get 2 that's plus 2. 30 divided by 10 that's 3 you get plus 3. 40 divided by 10 you get 4 both positive means plus 4. 36 divided by 6 you get 6 both positive so when you divide both positive numbers the answer is positive now this one we know plus into minus 4 is negative 4. and when you take this one to this side negative 25 divided by negative 4 you are getting plus 6. so now look at this question both negative answer is positive answer is positive when dividing negative number by a negative number write down the answer at once both negative numbers all in all these questions both negative numbers when you divide both negative numbers the answer is positive just normal division 8 divided by 2 4 answer is plus because both are negatives 16 divided by 
,,4 4 that's plus 4. 20 divided by 5 you get 4 that's plus 4. 18 divided by 6 you get 3 that's plus 3 12 divided by 2 6 that's plus 6 18 divided by 9 you get 2 that's 
,,plus 2. 20 divided by 10 you get 2. ours is plus 2. 30 divided by 10 that's three answers plus 40 divided by 20 you get plus 2 24 divided by 12 you get plus 2 because both the numbers are negative negative number divided by a negative you get a positive answer now what happens here 1 is negative and 1 is positive so minus 8 and 
,,plus 3 we know that's minus 24 when you take plus 3 to this side that means minus 24 divide by plus 3 you need to get minus now what happens 1 is negative 1 is positive answer is negative answer is negative when dividing negative number by a positive number here also both numbers are negative you get positive 24. when you take this one here minus 6 to this side what happens plus 24 divide by this is plus 24 divide by minus 6 the answer is minus 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is always negative answer is negative when dividing positive number by a negative number so it can be positive first number and the divisor is negative or divisor is positive and the number given is negative final answer is negative write down the answer at once plus and minus so you get negative 12 divided by 4 3 plus and minus 18 divided by 6 is 3 you are getting a negative answer again minus n plus 30 divided by 5 is 6 answer is minus 6 negative positive 28 divided by 7 that's 4 you get negative 4. 27 divided by 9 you get 9 times 3 so this is negative now look at this one 12 divided by 4 you get 3 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative 18 divided by minus 6 1 is positive and 1 is negative answer is negative 30 divided by 5 6 1 is positive and 1 is negative so answer is negative 28 divided by 7 you get 4 1 is positive and 1 is negative answer is negative 27 and 9 you get 3 answer is negative 3 so you need to remember when you get same sign pluses you get positive or either same sign negatives the final answer is positive when you divide here this one one positive and one negative always you get negative answer order is not important you can get negative number divide by a positive still the answer is negative so multiplication of different signs answer is negative so in this case you get negative here you get positive for same sign write down the answer at once now combination so first multiply numbers separately and then decide the sign 7 times 2 40 both pluses answer is plus 6 times 2 12 both minus answer is plus now the division 12 divided by 6 answer is 2 this is minus and plus the sign is negative division again 30 divided by 15 you know that's 2 sign is negative because 1 is negative and 1 is positive 32 divided by 8 you get 4 1 is negative 1 is plus means answer is negative 9 times 3 27 1 is positive and 1 is negative that's minus 16 divided by 4 you get 4 both negative answer is positive 18 divided by 18 you get 1 both negative answer is positive 40 divided by 20 ans is 2. both negative means you get plus 27 divided by 3 you get 9. one negative and one positive you get minus again eight times eight multiplication 64. both negative you get plus now division 64 divided by 8 that's 8 1 positive 1 negative answer is negative 12 times 3 multiplication you get 36 1 positive 1 negative answer is negative 36 divided by 12 you get 3 both negative here you get plus 48 divided by 2 that's 24 1 negative 1 positive answer is negative 8 times 4 32 both negative answer is positive here division negative negative division you get 4 divided by 4 1 both negative means the sign is plus 18 divided by 1 you get 18. both negative that's plus 40 divided by 8 that's 5. one negative 1 positive means you get minus 9 times 3 27 and both positive means answer is positive so that's not hard you can just multiply the numbers and then decide the sign simplify following directed numbers so we can do the numerator first and then the denominator 4 times 3 12 but this is negative because 1 is positive and 1 is negative now 12 divided by 6 is 2 one negative and one positive answer is negative 8 times 4 32 is this plus or minus minus minus both means this is plus 2 times 2 4 1 minus and 1 positive means you get minus 4. now division 32 divided by 4 is 8 plus and minus the answer is minus this one we'll do these two first 5 and 2 10 minus minus becomes plus and then here three times one three one positive one negative is minus three now you can do ten times three 30 but this is negative and divide by negative 30 divided by 3 is 10 both negative means the final answer is positive this one we'll 
,,do these two 8 times 2 16 that's positive and multiplied by a negative value here 6 times 2 12 and you get a negative answer no numerator multiply you get 3 times 6 
,,18 1 remaining 3 times 1 3 plus 1 48 that's negative because 1 is positive and 1 is negative now divide by -12 both negative answer is positive 48 divided by 12 is 4. so you get plus 4 as the answer do this we'll do these two separately 9 times 3 27 that's minus and then 12 times 3 36 that's minus because 1 is negative and 1 is 
,,positive now 27 times 4. 108 that's negative negative that's positive divide by minus 36 the answer is negative 1 is positive 1 is negative how many times are there 
,,36 times what's the answer 3 3 times so you get 3 times 36 is 108 so you get negative 3 as the final this one you can do these two minus 8 and 4 minus 32. multiplied by plus 2 here 4 times 4 16 and this is minus minus plus now numerator separately 32 times 2. that's plus into minus minus 64. divide by plus 16 minus n plus minus 
,,how many 16s are there for sixty-four four so answer is minus four this one 12 times 4 you get 48 that's minus 3 times 2 6 minus minus plus now divide 48 divided by 
,,6 8 but this is minus because 1 is negative well 1 is positive 12 times 8 96 plus into minus that's minus 3 times 2 6 both minus that means plus 6. how many sixes are there divide by six you get one for 36 that's 16. is it positive or negative one is negative one is positive answer is negative these two what is eighteen times three 24 3 times 1 3 plus 2 54 but the answer is negative 6 times 3 18 answer is positive now divide how many 18s are there for 54 3 so the answer is 3 minus and plus 
,,different signs you get negative so the answer is negative 3. here we'll take these two first 4 times 3 plus 12 and then with minus 6. here 18 times 2 you get 36 that's minus 1 is positive 1 is negative now multiply these two 72 12 times 6 but the answer is negative now both negative 72 divided by 36 is 2. both negative means answer is positive now we'll look at example number one find the value of minus 3 plus minus 2 by using the number line so number line is given what's the starting point minus 3 so this is the starting point and then what we do plus minus 2 means 2 places to the left so 2 places to the left means answer is minus 5 review exercise 
,,now we'll take the review exercise find the value of each of the following by using the number line plus 2 and plus 6. so we'll take the number line okay so what's the starting value plus 2 so here i'll take minus 2 minus 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and we'll put 8 here these are pluses that's the number line starting point is plus 2 and 
,,plus 6 means 6 places to the right one two three four five six so what's the answer plus eight plus eight and minus 5 so we'll take the number line again so plus 8 is there so we need 8 i'll mark this one as 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 minus 1. now start from plus 8 and plus minus 5 means moves 5 places to the left so 1 two three four five what's the answer plus three minus two n plus three we'll take it minus two so that means i'll take this one as minus 3 minus 2 minus 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 these are pluses so starting value is minus 2 plus plus 3 means move 3 places to the right 1 2 3 answer is plus 1. this one take the number line and starting value is minus 3 so 
,,you need to check minus three but here minus means moves left so we'll start from here plus one you need to decide what are the numbers you need so here minus 3 is the starting point and here this is left means you need more minus values so four places to the left one two three four answer is minus seven this one plus 4 and minus 6 is there that means towards left side so we'll take plus 4 here starting point is plus 4 6 to the left 1 2 3 4 5 6. so you get minus 2. find the value of each of the following you can do it at once what's the condition both pluses means just add the two numbers 3 plus 2 5 so you get plus 5 now both negative that's also adding two numbers four plus two six you put a negative sign here one is positive one is negative you take the difference five and three difference is two but bigger number is positive you put plus 2 plus and minus take the difference that's 6 bigger number is negative so you put negative 6 here this is additive inverse addition so what's the answer negative 7 and 7 difference is 0. so when you add additive inverse you get 0. these two all positive so that means adding the numbers 5 plus 2 7 7 plus 3 now here all these negative numbers so that means adding negative numbers 3 plus 1 4 4 plus 4 8 what this is negative 8. all these two these two positive and the other one is negative so what is this one plus two plus four you get plus six now you have to take the difference because 1 is positive and 1 is negative so 9 and 6 difference is 3 bigger number is negative so minus 3. here you have to take the difference because 1 is positive and the other one is negative so 5 over 7 minus 2 over 7 that's 3 over 7. so answer is 3 over 7. how you decide the sign the bigger one is this that's positive 1 is positive 1 is negative 2 so take the difference when you subtract you get 8 and here 1. so 1.8 is the answer which one is bigger 5.2 that's negative so the answer also negative here what are these two additive inverse so additive inverse addition is zero example number one find the value of plus 2 minus minus 3 by using the number line so here first look at it plus 2 and minus minus that means you have to move towards right side so starting with plus 2. so we can take plus 2 somewhere here so this is plus 1 0 minus 1 minus 2 plus 3 plus 4 plus 5 plus 6 plus 7 so start with plus 2 here move three places to the right one two three so what's the final answer that's plus five find the value of minus 2 minus plus 3 by using the lambda line so before we mark the numbers just see minus 2 that means starting value is minus 2 moves to the left 3 units so when you are marking the number line we can take i'll take minus 6 minus 5 minus 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 starting with minus 2 moves left by 3 units 1 2 3. so the answer is minus five example number three find the value of minus two minus minus three by using the number line so we'll take the number line now here before we mark the points you have to look at carefully starting point is minus 2 minus minus means you have to move to the right side by 3 units so we can take minus 3 minus 2 minus 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6. these are positive values so starting value is minus two moves three places to the right one two three that's the answer plus one exercise 4.1 find the value by using the number line so we'll take the number line and now how we label you have to look at starting value is plus 4 and minus means you are moving to the left so plus 4 will mark it somewhere here and starting value is plus 4 moving towards left side by 2 units so final answer is plus two take a number line for this now how we label this so here starting point is plus 1 and here minus minus means moves towards right side so we can start from here i'll take plus 1 here plus 2 plus 3 plus 4 plus 5 
,,plus 6 like that and here this is 0 minus 1. so start from plus one and moves two places to the right one two so what's the final answer final answer is plus three this one using number line so we'll take the number line and starting with minus 2 and here minus means moves to the left so we'll start -2 somewhere here it's easy first you decide otherwise you can't put all the numbers so this is plus 1 minus 3 minus 4 minus 5 minus 6 like that starting value is minus 2 3 places to the left one two three so you get minus five this one minus one and minus minus 3 so what you have to do starting with minus and minus minus means moves towards right side so i'll start minus 1 somewhere here these are pluses so starting value is minus 1 moves three places to the right one two three one two three so answer is plus two this one starting value is minus 6 and you have to move towards right side because minus minus towards right side so we'll start from -6 here so starting value is minus 
,,6 5 places to the right 1 2 3 4 5 answer is minus 1 this one starting point is plus 2 minus minus means towards right hand side so i can start with plus 2 here here 
,,plus 1 and 0 starting with 2 and 2 places to the right this is plus 4. example number four find the value of plus two minus minus four so we can use addition of additive inverse i can change the question to adding the additive inverse of minus 4 that's plus 4. now both positive 4 plus 2 addition is plus 6. find the value of minus 5 minus plus 2. so convert this to additive inverse adding the additive inverse of plus 2 that's minus 2 now this is both minus addition so just add it and put the sign so you get minus 7. find the value of minus 7 minus minus 3 so how you do minus 7 is there adding additive inverse of minus 3 is plus 3 now difference 7 and 3 
,,difference is 4 and put the sign of the bigger number that's minus 4. example 7 find the value of minus 12 minus minus 15 minus plus 5. so these two i can convert minus 12 addition of additive inverse of that plus 50 and here also adding additive inverse that's minus 5. now these two take the difference minus 12 and 15 take the 
,,difference you get 3 that's positive now again consider this one now 1 is positive and 1 is minus you take the difference difference is 2 and the bigger number is minus you get minus 2. example eight find the value of plus three fifths minus so you can do the additive inverse of plus one over 5 means minus 1 over 5. now this is 
,,difference so you take 3 over 5 minus 1 over 5 that's 2 over 5 is the difference which one is bigger positive answer is bigger so the answer is plus 2 over 5. example 9 minus five and a half minus plus two so what you do i can rewrite this as adding the additive inverse of plus 2 that's minus 2. so this means both minus now edit 5 and 2 7 and you get 7 and a half both minus means the answer is minus example 10 minus 3.2 minus i can write plus of the additive inverse of plus 1.4 that's minus 1.4 now both negative negative means adding so 3.2 and 1.4 just add it you get 4.6 but both negative means the answer also negative example number 11 find the value of minus 8.4 minus minus i can change it to plus with the additive inverse of minus 2.5 that's plus 2.1 now 1 is negative 1 is positive take the difference 6.3 so which one is the bigger number minus so you put a minus psi exercise 4.2 fill in each cage with the suitable directed number here minus 5. we can convert to additive 
,,inverse of plus 3 that's minus 3. now both negative add the two numbers 5 plus 3 8 so you put minus eight this one convert to additive inverse so this is plus with plus four one is positive one is negative take the difference four and three difference is 1 bigger number is positive plus 1. convert to additive inverse plus 7 plus minus 1 additive inverses plus 1 7 and 1 both positive you get plus 8. this one plus 7 additive inverse of minus 2 that's plus 2 and both pluses 7 plus 2 you get plus 9. find the value of each of the following so 4 you can write this one as adding the additive inverse of this 4 minus 1 you get 3 positive number because the higher number is positive minus 8 plus additive inverse of minus 2 that's plus 2. take the difference 8 and 2 difference is 6 bigger number is minus answer is minus 6 convert to addition plus of additive inverse that's plus 7 take the difference because 1 is negative and 1 is positive so you get 4 bigger number is positive that's plus 4 here also you can start from plus 9 addition of the additive inverse that's plus 6 9 and 6 addition 15 that's plus minus 5 addition of additive inverse plus 5 yeah minus 5 and plus 5 difference is 0 this one adding the additive inverse that's minus 3 so 0 and minus 3 answer is minus 3 here minus 11 addition of additive inverse of plus 4 that's minus 4 both negative so add it so 15 answer is negative this one convert the question plus 2 plus minus 1 adding of the additive inverse that's plus 4 2 minus 1 take the difference you get plus 1. plus 1 and plus 4 you get plus 5 this one i can take minus 5 convert to addition additive inverse of this is minus 2 again convert this one plus with additive inverse that's plus 6. now these two both negative so just add it and put the sign this is plus 6 now 1 is positive and 1 is negative take the difference 7 and 6 difference is 1 bigger number is negative so you get negative 1 this one plus 4 and here adding the additive inverse that's minus 2 again adding the additive inverse that's minus 8. now 4 and 2 take the difference that's 2 that's plus 2. and now again take the difference 8 and 2 difference is 6. bigger number is negative so you put negative six this one four and a half adding the additive inverse of minus 2 that's plus 2 now this means adding these two numbers 4 and 2 6 6 and a half that's positive this one minus 6 and 1 4 is there adding of the additive inverse that's 1 4 plus 1 over now you have to take the difference so we'll take the difference six one fourth minus one fourth so one fourth one fourth get cancel out you get six what's the sign the bigger number is negative so the answer is negative 6 this one plus 15.7 adding the additive inverse that's plus 2.3 now this is addition 15.7 and 2.3 adding 7 plus 3 10 and 6 plus 2 8. so 18.0 so plus 18.0 this one will take first minus 2. adding the additive inverse of plus 3.5 that's minus 3.5 adding 4.5 4.1 now these two both negative that means adding you get 5.5 that's negative and adding plus 4.1 again the difference one is positive one is negative so take the difference you get 1.4 which number is bigger negative number so answer is negative 1.4 this one plus three and a half adding the additive inverse of minus 2 that's plus 2 here also adding additive inverse of this is plus one third now look at all of this all are adding so three plus two five that's the whole part half plus one third what's half plus one third convert to the same denominator lowest common multiple is six three times two so three times one three two times three six so two times one two so you get five over six so what's the final answer 5 and 5 over 6 so that's positive example number one simplify so here multiplication what you do just multiply the two numbers and same sign you get plus multiplication here 6 and 2 12. 1 is positive and 1 is negative answer is negative simplify the following here first one two times five ten one is positive the other one also positive both positive means ansi is positive second one three times two six 1 is negative 1 is positive answer is negative third one 5 times 3 
,,15 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative 15. here 4 times 3 12 12 times 2 24. now we'll decide the sign both negative you get plus again plus with plus answer is plus example number four plus 2.5 into minus 5. just multiply by 5 first 5 times 5 25 5 times 2 10 plus 2 12. so 12.5 how do you decide the sign one is positive one is negative answer is negative here multiplied by 12 first 3.4 multiplied by 12. 10 and 2 4 and 3 2 times 4 8 2 times 3 6. when you add it you get 4 0 8 and here 1 decimal place so 40.8 is the answer but how you decide the sign minus minus both the final answer is positive find the value exercise 4.3 so straight away you can do 5 times 420 both positive means answer is positive 5 times 420 1 is negative 1 is positive answer is negative 10 times 550 both negative answer is positive 7 times 3 21 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative both negative just multiply 1 times 4 4 both negative means you get a positive answer here 11 times 0 when you multiply any number by 0 always you get answer 0 6 times 4 24 1 is negative and 1 is plus answer is negative 12 times 3 you get 36 1 is positive one is negative answer is negative here we'll multiply first two times two four four times five twenty now we'll decide the sign one is negative one is positive answer is negative that's negative and this negative both negative means the answer is plus here 3 times 1 3 3 times 2 6 6 times 5 30 decide the sign negative negative positive here positive negative you get negative now again positive negative means the final answer is negative multiplied by 2 you get 5 both positive answer is positive now here you need to multiply by 20 3 now 20 and 3 times one two two times four eight three times one three three times four twelve when you add it you get ninety four point three now one is positive one is negative means answer is negative example number one now it's division same thing you divide and finally you can put the sign 6 divided by 2 you get 3 both negative you get positive 3 6 and 2 division you get 3 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative this one 15 divided by 5 answer is 3 both 
,,positive you get positive 3 9 divided by 3 is 3 1 is negative 1 is positive you get a negative answer 15 divided by 3 you get 5 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative 9 divided by 3 3 both negative you get positive answer exercise 4.4 find the value of each of the following 10 and 2 division you get 5 plus and plus both 
,,positive means the final answer is positive 12 divided by 4 that's 3 both negative means final answer is positive 15 divided by 3 is 5. 1 is positive and 1 is negative answer is negative here 21 divided by 7 is 3 1 is negative and 1 is positive answer is negative negative 5 divided by 5 5 divided by 5 is 1 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative 1. 20 divided by 4 is 5 both negative means answer is positive now here 8 times 2 16 both positive that's positive now you have to divide by this 16 divided by 4 that's 4. 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative this one we can simplify the denominator first 6 and 2 multiplication that's 12 both negative means you get positive ones now 36 divided by 12 is 3 1 is negative 1 is positive answer is negative do the numerator 5 times 4 20 one negative one positive 
,,answer is negative denominator now 2 and 2 4 both minus means positive 1's now do this one 20 divided by 4 is 5. 1 is negative 1 is positive answer is negative do the numerator 9 times 8 72 both negative means plus answer 4 times 3 12 1 is negative 1 is positive answer is negative 72 divided by 12 you get 6 1 is positive and 1 is negative answer is negative fill in each cage with the suitable directed number answer is negative that means you are getting a plus value so 20 divided by 2 you get 10. so plus 2 because minus n plus the answer is negative 18 and 6. how you get 6 18 divided by 3. now decide the sign this is plus answer is negative that means 
,,you are getting negative 3 division you get 5 that means 10 divided by 2 is 5. now decide the sign this is plus here minus so both should be minus to get plus answer answer is 4 4 divided by 1 is 4 positive and the answer is negative so this should be negative value how we decide this one when you divide this one by 2 you are getting 6. so think about reverse way so if this is 12 here 12 divided by 2 you get 6. how you get 12 from 3 this should be 4 now decide the sign this is minus and minus if it's plus and minus the answer is minus but the answer is given is plus so that means this should be a minus value so minus 4 now this one you are getting minus 28 here plus 7 is there 7 into 4 28 but this is minus means this should be minus 4 now numerator is ok now to get 7 what should be this answer you are getting minus 4 because minus minus plus 28 divided by 4 is 7. now how you get minus 4 there 2 times 2 but this is minus so you have to multiply it by minus 2. so we covered all theory related to directed numbers subtracting a number from another number is the same as adding the additive inverse of the second number to the first number a positive number is obtained when two directed numbers of the same sign are multiplied or divided a negative number is obtained when two directed numbers of opposite signs are multiplied or divided so remember all these properties in directed numbers and practice all the exercises and examples

Number Partens,dv213FzqkM8,looking on sequences or patterns and rules you may recognize a lot of this what we did last year there's a difference between finding the pattern and finding the rule I have an example up here of triangles being made for toothpicks and we're going to kind of make a t-chart or keep track of how many try or how many toothpicks it 
,,takes to make these triangles okay so the first one I have one triangle how many toothpicks do you count there are three okay the second one I have two triangles but how many toothpicks did it take to make that it took five in your book they kind of the illustrations a little better for three triangles how many toothpicks did it take somebody said seven we count one two three four five six seven and four four triangles we get nine now we could continue this pattern week if we were four five triangles what would be four six four seven four eight in doing so we're trying to find the pattern is there a pattern that occurs what do you notice it looks like 
,,I'm adding two each time so we can say if you remember from last year that we can state it as an x equals now so this one would be next equals now and what +2 can that's stating the pattern now not all patterns have an x equals now there may be a pattern where goes one then it goes two then you add three than yet four okay but what we're looking at now is we're looking at a special pattern which you either add or subtract the same number each time and that can be stated as a next equals now now when you're given a pattern like this I'm going to make a suggestion that's really really huge if you do this it'll make your life so much easier when you're trying to find not just the pattern but the rule I have a sequence of numbers 3 5 7 9 11 same sequence or pattern that we had up here instead of writing going across horizontally let's make them into a t-chart okay what's the end representing the term number first second third and so forth okay I think I have this down later on so let's write let me go down to that one each term has a place three is in the it's the first term so you can kind of call it the first place second term third term and so forth a term or you can call it in okay what's the second term five what's the third term fourth nine and the fifth is 11 okay now we have already found the pattern correct that's going this direction how does each change each time that's the pattern and you notice we add two each time but you know I kind of like shortcuts I kind of like to see if I could find a shortcut so if I want to know what the 20th term was in other words if I have 20 triangles how many toothpicks am I going to need and I sure would like to do it some way other than counting down six seven eight nine ten all the way down so what is it that we're going to find in order to get that shortcut know what that's called Mary I'm going to find the rule now the rule goes from term number to your number okay in other words if I go to the second 
,,what do I do to this to to get if I would I do to three to give a seven what I do to four to get a nine and so forth I want you to think about that just for a minute if you think you've come up with a rule that would apply don't you share with your partner and see if they agree okay where do you noticing crystal she says I've taken my term number times 2 and then adding one let's try it 1 times 2 is plus 1 is 2 times 2 is plus 1 is 3 times 2 is plus 1 is Wow must be working so 20 times 2 is plus 1 would be 41 so my rule that I'm going to refer to is 2n plus 1 where n is my term number the pattern was your next equals now statement now it doesn't always have to be an x equals now statement and the pattern could have been a plus one plus two plus three and then you put dot dot dots syn to that pattern continues and 
,,then we find the rule now did you notice anything about that rule and the pattern that have something in common maybe something you might have a clue about what you 
,,notice Taylor okay the pattern was a 2 so do you think that always your rule might involve a 2 well if it's not there's not a direct connection that's a place to start okay I'm not going to say it always works but it's always a good place to start in other words if I can say to myself okay 1 plus 2 is 3 but not 2 plus 2 doesn't 
,,give me 5 ok that's not going to work so let me try multiplying 1 times 3 is 3 but 2 times 3 isn't 5 okay that's not working so that tells me that's probably a two-step rule it's going to have two steps that take place and we found that did so try using the 2 or taking 2 times your number and then see how far off you are okay so I tried 2 times 1 and I got 2 but I'm still how many away from one away 2 times 2 is 4 by I'm still one away 3 times 2 6 months still 1 away so then that tells me I'm going to take 2 times n plus 1 do you think that always works let's try it write this one down in your handy-dandy and try it see if you can come up with a pattern and the rule 5 8 11 14 and 17 first okay ok your first step is I'm going to transfer it into a t-chart my first term was 5 my second term was 8 and oftentimes they'll be just listed as number so you have to translate that into which term the third term is 11 the fourth term is 14 and the fifth term is what 17 okay the first thing is let's look for our pattern marry what you do to find the pattern okay I'm looking at your numbers and just see what are they doing in other words from here what a might where am I going each time I am adding 3 ok so I can say that that's my pattern to add 3 can I state that in the next equals now yes next equals now plus 
,,three if you couldn't put it in next equals now like let's say it went up one and then went up two then three you would put a plus one comma plus two comma plus three comma dot because you've given enough to show us what the pattern is okay but this clearly is a plus three every time okay now let's take a look at your rule because remember if we find that this happens sometimes that helps us with our rule let's see is there anything I can do directly like one plus four gives you five so it's two plus four eight that's not working is it okay one times five five yes but it's two times five eight okay that doesn't work that's where you need to start you need to look to see is there a direct relationship there isn't so what do you think Jake okay and what was your pattern three so does it have anything to do a three so try this what's 1 times 3 and I'm 2 away from my goal right what's 2 times 3 and I'm 2 away from my goal hmm what's 3 times 3 and I'm 2 away from my goal so we can say that the rule if I put it in here I'm going to have to take 3 times in and then do what to it plus 2 how many had that good so this helps us helps us if I want 
,,to ask okay if I have a hundred terms what would be the hundredth term in this sequence what would I do Michelle 300 which gives you three hundred plus two that's right you get three hundred two so that saves me from having to make that whole long boring list is if I can arrange it and find a rule yes Sean do you always use this I'm saying a lot of times it could be a key there are some times that no that doesn't help you one clue is Sean if you're going to have term one two three four five it works sometimes they have other numbers than one two three four five so then it doesn't always work if they give them to you okay when we get to plotting ordered pairs it oftentimes does not work Sean okay if they're just giving you a set of numbers then you can use the first second third fourth fifth and you put them in that order what's this kind of pattern called this kind of pattern is called an arithmetic sequence the one that we just looked at it's called an arithmetic sequence or pattern an arithmetic sequence is when you add or subtract the same amount to each term it's a special pattern or sequence which you add or subtract the same amount to each term for instance if I have the pattern 1 3 5 7 9 I would be adding 2 each time so this one is an arithmetic sequence if I had the example of 10 6 2 negative 2 negative 6 I'm having to subtract 4 each time therefore it 2 is also an arithmetic sequence now let's take a look at the pattern 4 9 14 19 let's see if there's a pattern and if there is a rule that we can apply for the first thing if you're specially if you're looking for your rule is to set it up using a t-chart okay that's the key if you want if I try to find the rule set it up in a t-chart he'll give a few minutes to work on that okay say I want you to try to find the pattern and then the rule in order to get us so that we know what the twelfth term will be I saw a chord my first term was for my second term is nine third was 14 and fourth was 19 what pattern did you notice occurring Shawn next equals now what are you doing each time just right here how am I going from 4 to 9 what am i doing that's my pattern that's I don't want the rule quite yet we're going to get to the rule I'm sorry I can add 5 thank you sorry Saint this thing in my ear it was even worse my hearing aids don't work up near as well okay I need upgrade of your right you're adding five each time and we show that here okay so that would be our pattern next equals now plus five now take that and try to make a rule out of it and Shawn what did you get huh okay so let's make this an in so I'm going to take five times in and then 
,,one minus one let's see if it'll work then 1 times 5 it's 5 minus 1 is 4 2 times 5 is 10 minus 1 is 9 3 times 5 is 15 minus 1 is 14 it works what happens then when I put a 12 in 4 in 5 times 12 is 16 minus 1 is 59 very good very good it did it did in this case good observation okay any questions on arithmetic sequences

Number Partens,aBq0jBHHiVs,hello grade 8 children today we will discuss the revision exercise in the first so before you start this one make sure that you follow all 10 chapters and then revise from this revision exercise so we look at the first question it says find the value of square root 361 so how we find out square root of 361 you can use prime factors when you divide 361 by 19 19 times 1 and again you get the remainder so 19 times 19 you get 361. so it's a square number so we can write 361 as 19 squared and then when you take square root and square term it get cancelled out and you get 19 as the answer evaluate 5 tons and 75 kilos multiplied by 12. so we'll write in a column tons and kilograms 5 and 75. it's better to put three digits here multiplied by 12 so how we multiply 12 times 5 60 6 remaining 12 times 7 84 84 plus 6 90. so you get 900 that's less than thousand so you can write as it is 12 times 5 60. so what's the answer 60 tons and 900 kilograms write down the value of minus 1 to the power 11 so what you know about this the power is odd any number negative 1 to the power odd number you get a negative answer so negative answer but this is 1 1 to the power any power is 1 so you get negative 1 what is the complement of the angle 28 what is complement means the sum is add up to 90 degrees so to find out the other 
,,angle so you take 90 degrees and subtract so you get 2 6 so 62 degrees is the other complement angle what is the supplement of the angle 28 what is supplement means 
,,add up to 180 so how you can find out the other angle by subtracting this 28 from 180. so 8 plus 210 1 remaining so 3 5 1. so you'll get 152 degrees find the value of x so this is a straight line what you know about this straight line that's add up to 180 straight angle so we'll do 52 plus 58 first 110 now we can subtract from 180 to get the other angle so the other angle is 70. so we can write x plus 110 equals 180 so x is 180 minus 110 and we found that that's 70 degrees so x is 70 degrees so here you can write why this is 180 because it's a straight angle this one this is a point around the point the angle sum is 360. so you can write 120 and 90 first added 210 so you can write 210 plus aaa three times 3a is equal to 360. so what's 3a subtract 210 from 360 you get 150 when you divide by 3 you get 50 as the angle write down the number of faces edges and vertices of a dodecahedron what is dodeca means 12 and you know faces is equal to 12 then what you can remember the sum is 32 so from the sum 32 you can find out by subtracting 12 you get number of vertices so vertices is 20 and how many edges are there we know 32 all together 32 minus 
,,2 30 edges are there so remember 32 and 12 faces it's easy to remember because it's dodecahedron means 12 phases are there fill in the blanks this is algebra question factorization so for when you take it out from the whole thing this becomes 3 that's how you get 12 4 times 3 then here y is there 4 times 9 36 and when you take 4 out this becomes 1 find the value of each of the following so these are directed numbers adding same sign you add the numbers five plus three eight and put the sign minus here adding different signs take the difference seven and four difference is three bigger number is minus so you put minus 3 here take the difference 13 and 5 difference is 8. bigger number is 13 so that's plus subtraction you can convert to adding additive inverse so minus 5 plus additive inverse of minus 2 that's plus 2. now this is two different signs take the difference and put the sign of the bigger number minus 3 convert to addition by taking the additive inverse of minus 10 that's plus 10 different signs take the difference and put the sign of the bigger number here again you can write as addition by taking the additive inverse of minus 5 that becomes plus 5. so here adding you get plus 5. find the value of each of the following now multiplication directed numbers multiplication so here just multiply 3 times 2 6 3 times 1 3 same sign you get always positive 8 times 5 40 different signs you always get negative now division also same thing 12 divided by 3 4 different signs you get negative same sign here you get positive 12 divided by 3 plus 4. when you multiply any number by 0 always you get 0 here 0 divided by any number that's also zero fill in the cages and rewrite the following now answer is minus so here positive that means this should be a negative value how you get 4 24 divided by 6 so minus 6 is the answer answer is 4 16 divided by 4 is 4 but 1 is negative and this should be positive to get minus answer so this is positive because positive 
,,and negative you get the answer negative 32 the answer is 4. so you have to divide by 8. so 32 divided by 8 but the answer is negative means you have to put a negative sign so negative 8 this one addition answer is minus 6 and minus 10 is there so you need the difference so what's the difference here you need 4 to get 6 but the 
,,bigger number is minus so you get the answer negative so i can put plus 4 for this here minus 6 is there so adding minus 5 and minus 1 you are getting minus 6. multiplication again 4 times 2 8 both minus the answer is positive the general term of the triangular number pattern starting from 1 is n into n plus 1 divided by 2. right the first term of the triangular number pattern how you find out the first term first term becomes n equals 1 substitute 1 1 1 plus 1 divided by 2 you get 1 times 
,,2 divided by 2 2 2 get cancel out the first triangular number is 1. write the 19th and 20th terms of this pattern so we can use n equals 19 for 19th ter so you get 19 nineteen plus one divided by two nineteen into twenty divided by two so two times ten ten times nineteen hundred and ninety if this is 20 substitute 20 20 plus 1 divide by 2 you get 20 into 21 divided by 2 10 times 21 you get 210 so 19th term is 190 20th term is 210 it is given that 10 into 11 is 110 find which term of the triangular number pattern is 55 you need to know the general term is you need to know the general term in n plus 1 divided by 2 now look at this one 10 into 11 is 110 so we'll divide this by 2 so you have to do the same thing to the other side so what happens this one is equal to 110 divided by 2 you get 55 that means you get 55 when n equals 10. so which term is that triangular number tenth triangular number it is given that 18 times 19 is 342. find which term of the triangular number pattern is 171. now we'll divide by 2 and see 2 times 1 2 for 17 that's for 14 that's 7 and 1. so 171 you are getting for 80 triangular numbers so they're asking which term is 171 so which term that's the 18th triangular number show that the sum of the 19th and 20th terms of the triangular number pattern is equal to the 20th term of the square number pattern which starts from 1. so we'll look at it we found out what's 19th to 19th triangular number is we found here 190 and 210 190 and 210 when you add it what you get 0 10 400 so what's 400 400 is 20 squared so 20 times 20. so what's so what's the square number 20th square number you are getting so that's correct so you are getting 20th square number so when we were doing the lesson can you remember i did 19th triangular number plus 20th triangular number you are getting 
,,20th square number question number four find the perimeter of the square design so this is the square so all sides are equal so what's the perimeter 4 times one side 4 times 6 24 the units are centimeters find the perimeter of the isosceles triangle decide so isosceles means we are given these two lengths are equal so this is eight means this is eight so what's the perimeter so perimeter is eight plus eight plus six sixteen plus six twenty two centimeters the two designs are pasted together as shown to form a composite figure find the perimeter of the composite figure so when you ask to find the perimeter this length we are not taking so what are the lengths we need to add so we need to add six how many times one two three times six how many eighths two eighths eighteen and sixteen thirty-four centimeters look at 
,,this diagram the straight lines a b and c d are drawn such that they intersect each other perpendicularly at p this point the given figure is obtained by joining ac 
,,cb and db and then producing them right three pairs of complementary angles complementary means add up to 90. here 62 and 28 when you add you get 90 degrees so that 
,,means those two are complementary so how you write down the angle pcb and this angle cbp now when you add these two also that's what is 90 you get 90 degrees so 58 plus 32 also 90 pd b angle this angle and p b d p b d angle those are complementary what else we look at these two these two also 90 degrees so 36 and 54 also 90 degrees so what are those c a p and a c p those are complementary angles write three pairs of supplementary angles supplementary means 180. so you need to get a straight line here this one this one you need three this one so those are supplementary so we'll write down so you can write a c b angle and a c b angle and e c b angle this one a p c angle c p b n and this one d b c angle tbc angle with c b f c b f angle those are supplementary add up to 180 write four pairs of vertically opposite angles so when you take two straight lines intersecting you get vertically opposite angles so identify vertically opposite angles so you need four pairs one two this is 
,,another pair and here this one with this one and here with here so those are the four pairs of vertically opposite angles so we'll write down a p d angle and c p b angle a p c and with d p b d p b other side c b f angle c b f c b f with d b g and this side c b d angle c b t angle with fb g f b g so those are the four pairs of vertically opposite angles what is the magnitude of fbg f b g so what's this one we know we know these two are vertically opposite angles are equal so what's f b g angle just add the two angles 28 and 32 60 degrees cbd and dbg are a pair of supplementary angles write down the magnitude of dbg cbd this one and dbg d bg this angle a pair of supplementary write down the magnitude of d b g so supplementary means add up to 180. so we found that 60 so d b g angle is 180 minus 60 degrees you get 120. name and angle which is supplementary of c b p c b as b b p so this one if this is 28 c b p c b p is 28 supplementary means add up to 180 so subtract from 180 so 28 so 152 degree angle write down the value of the angle you named so here they are asking the value here 152 what's the name of that angle 100 52 is supplementary here you that means this angle so p b g you can write p b g find the magnitude of c b f c b f this angle this side c b f so what's the angle this angle is 60 so this is a straight line so 180 minus 60 you get 120 or you can use the vertically opposite angles so that's 120 find the sum of the angles around the point b and establish the fact the sum of the angles around a point is 360. so we'll add it and see we found this is 60 this is 60. so 60 plus we found this is 120 and here also we found 120 and here vertically opposites angles are equal we found 60. so and and see hundred and twenty hundred and twenty two hundred forty sixty and sixty hundred and twenty now add it together you get three hundred and sixty so that's the point b so around the point the sum of angles is equal to 360. question number six the perimeter of a rectangle is 16x plus 10 units its length is 5x plus 3. write an algebraic expression for its breadth so what's the perimeter we know 2 times length plus breadth is equal to the perimeter so that's given 16 x plus 10 but when you divide this by 2 both sides what happens length plus breadth is equal to 16 divided by 2 8 
,,x and 10 divided by 2 you get 5. now we know length is 5x plus 3 so what is breadth you subtract so 8x plus 5 minus 5x plus 3. 8x minus 5x 3x 5 minus 3 is plus 2. so the breadth of this rectangle is 3x plus 2 units because we don't know the measurements exactly so you can write units a cuboid of length breadth and height equal to 2n in and in -1 units respectively is shown in the figure show that the sum of the lengths of all its edges is 4 times 4n minus 1 units length of all its edges okay so we'll take two inside how many sides with two n how many sides are there one two three other side 4 so down also you get another led so 2n times 4 then how many sides are there with n n is the breadth that means this side one two three and this side four how many sides with height one two three four so four times in minus one that's the sum of all lengths now we'll simplify four times to eight here you get 4a 4 times n4n and 4 times minus 1 minus 4. 8 and 4 12 12 plus 4 16 n n minus 4 
,,you can take 4 out and write 4 n minus 1 so you are getting this one as the answer so this is units because this is a length simplify the following now that means expand brackets and then add like terms so we can first use rainbow method and multiply 5c minus 10 plus 12 5c minus 10 and plus 12 you get plus 2. expand brackets 70 
,,minus 63 7 times 9 minus t 7d minus d60 minus 63. here you can multiply 4f plus 20 plus 2f minus 3. 4f and 2f6f 20 minus 3 you get 17. this one multiply separately and here separately minus 2 gh and here 4 times 2 8 minus 8 g minus 3 g h and minus minus becomes plus 6 g are there any like terms they send this minus 2 g h minus 3 g h means minus 5 g h minus 8 n plus 6 you get minus 2 g this one multiply set 4 h i 4 times 2 8 h minus 7 i minus minus plus 7 are there any like terms no you can't simplify further question number eight if the relationship a squared is equal to b squared plus c squared is true for this right angle triangle find a when b equals 8 and c equals 6. what is this pythagoras theorem so this is hypotenuse squared is equal to sum of square of some of the other two sides now apply it's true a squared is equal to b square plus c squared because it's a right angle triangle b is eight c is six substitute eight squared is 64. 6 squared is 36. you get 100. a is square root of 100. so 10 times 10. so you can write 10 squared square root and square term get cancel out and you get 10. this is in centimeters x plus 4y squared as 
,,a power of a product 4y squared so i can write 2 squared and y squared 4 is 2 squared now same power i can write 2y whole thing squared right 8ab whole thing squared as a product of powers and simplify it so 8 a b squared means 8 squared a squared and b squared what is 8 squared 8 times 8 64. a squared and b squared so the answer is 64 a squared b squared simplify 2p to the power 3 and 3q to the power 3. now same power i can write 2p and 3q inside brackets and put 3 2 times 3 6 p q power 3 
,,then i can write it 6 to the power 3 p to the power 3 and q to the power 3. what is 6 to the power 3 6 times 6 36 36 times 6 216 p to the power 3 n q to the power 3. sure that 6 to the power 3 is equal to 8 times 27 so we'll do 6 to the power 3 means 6 times 6 times 6 what is 6 i can write 2 times 3. again six is two times three six is two times three now i can take two separately and three separately what is 2 times 2 times 2 that's 8. what is 3 times 3 times 3 that's 27. so this is equal 
,,to 8 times 27. show that when minus 3 to the power 4 is simplified the same value as of 9 squared is obtained so we'll do minus 3 to the power 4 what's that minus 3 
,,multiply minus 3 multiplied by 4 times now we can do 3 times 3 9 same sign you get plus 9 here again plus 9. now plus and plus multiplication is also plus 9 squared 
,,is there so answer is same as 9 squared so no need to put plus so you can write 9 square next part without obtaining the value of minus 15 to the power 3 into minus 
,,27 to the power 4 explain whether the answer is a positive value or a negative value okay so here the power is odd negative number to the power odd is always negative here negative value to the power even always positive now a negative value and a positive value multiplication so you get definitely a negative answer so you get a negative value a sign board near an old bridge indicates that the maximum load which the bridge can support is 8 tons a lorry of mass 5.5 metric tons is loaded with 80 bags of cement of mass 50 kilos each calculate and show that it is dangerous for the lorry loaded with the bags of cement to cross the bridge so you have to check the total mass so what's the mass of lorry 5.5 metric tons so tons this is given in tons so i'll write 5.5 turns there and each bag 80 kilograms each bag is 50 kilograms and 80 bags are there so mass of bags 50 kilo each and how many bags are there 80 bags so when you multiply 0 0 5 times 8 40. so 4000 kilograms means how many tons you have to divide by thousand to get tons so three zeros get cancel out you get 4 tons now what's the total weight total mass total mass is 5.5 and four you get 9.5 what's the maximum load for the bridge it says 8 tons only so here extra 1.5 tons are there so you can say 9.5 is bigger than 8 there are four dangerous to cross the bridge what is the minimum number of bags of cement that should be removed for the lorry to safely cross the bridge now what's the extra weight 8 and 9.5 difference is 1.5 tons what's the mass of one bag that's 50 kg so we can check it extra load is 1.5 star so in kilograms you multiply by thousand thousand five hundred 
,,kg one bag is 50 kilos so number of bags is equal to 1500 divided by 50 5 times 3 so you can get take you can take 30 bags now directed numbers addition so here different signs what you do take the difference that's 4 and put the sign of the larger number that's plus 4 this is same sign you add it and put the sign so that's minus 9. here different sign take the difference that's 6 the bigger number is 18 so that's minus 6 here different signs so take the difference five and a half minus three so you get pi minus three two two and a half so two and a half is there so the bigger number is plus so you get plus two and a half and this one different size different signs take the difference when you take the difference you get 2.6 so which one is bigger minus sign so minus 2.6 here subtraction you can convert to addition of additive inverse so we are adding plus 3 now this is plus 10 plus 3 you get 30. this one subtraction i can write as additive inverse of this adding additive inverse so this is plus 3. so difference now because 2 different signs 7 and 3 4 bigger number is minus so minus 4 here minus 7 you can write as additive inverse of this both minus so just add it minus 27 this one plus 17. plus 17 and here adding the additive inverse of that you get 29 that's plus this one you can write at adding additive inverse of this so both pluses so that means at 7 plus 3 10 and 11 so plus 11 is the answer multiplication and division 4 times 3 12 this is plus and minus so the answer is minus 5 times 6 30 both negative so the answer is positive this one you get 4.8 plus and minus becomes minus 1 negative 1 positive you get a negative answer 20 divided by 4 is 5 1 is negative 1 is positive answer is negative 35 divided by 5 is 7 both negative that means answer is plus expand the given algebraic expressions and simplify them so first we'll expand it and then simplify 10x minus 50 minus 4x and 7 there 10x minus 4x is 6x minus 15 and 7 you get minus 8. multiply this and expand you get 3xy plus 5x minus 8xy and plus 2. these two like terms 3 and minus 8 is minus 5xy 5x is separately they are n plus 2. you can't add these two this one expand records here also you need to expand brackets minus 3a times 5 minus 15 a 3 times 7 21 this is plus 21 a b 5 times a 5 a and 5 times minus 2 that's minus 10. now minus 15 and plus 5 minus 10 a and here 21 a b and minus 10. so you can't add these two simplify the following so again you have to open brackets and 
,,simplify so first expand it 4a plus 7b there minus 3a and minus into plus minus 3c what are the like terms this and this 4a minus 3a you get a plus 7b minus 3c you expand 2 times 3 6x 2 times -7 minus 40 minus 2xn plus 5. 6x and 2x you get 4x minus 14 and plus 5. so you get minus 9. this one multiply 3a times a 3a squared 3 times 7 21e and here 5a squared minus 20a plus 4. now 3a squared and 5a squared 8a squared 21a and minus 20 you get plus 1a or a and you get plus 4. find the value of each algebraic expression when x equals minus 2 y equals 3 and z equals minus 3. so we'll substitute three times minus two and four times y is three three times minus 
,,two minus six plus four times three plus twelve 12 and 6 different signs so you take this difference and put the sign of the bigger number plus 6. x squared y minus 
,,2 squared y is 3 5 3 squared minus two times minus two is plus four four times three and here three times three nine four times three twelve nine times five forty five when you add it you get fifty seven this one will do inside and then multiply the answer by four two times minus two minus three times three minus four times minus three first we'll simplify inside 2 times minus 2 minus 4 3 times 3 9 and this minus minus 9 minus 4 and minus 3 you get plus 12. now 4 here simplifying side 12 minus 9 you get 3 3 minus 4 you get minus 1. so 4 times -1 the answer is minus 4. question number 15 write down the geometrical shape of the faces of each solid given 
,,below regular tetrahedron so what's the shape you need four equilateral triangles cube so what's the shape a square regular octahedra again eight-sided shape that meriangles 20 equilateral triangles write down the highest common factor of each of the following groups of terms so we'll do separately 3x means 3 times x 12xy 12. 12 is 2 times 2 4 4 times 3 12 x y 15y you get 3 times 5 and then y to find out the highest common factor we look at the common ones so here 3 is common we can take 3 
,,that's all x is not common so what's the highest common factor that's 3. this one again find out the factors separately 12x 3 times i'll write starting from two two 
,,times two four four times three twelve six x y two times 3 x n y 9 x squared 3 times 3 x and x now find out the common ones one three is common and one x is common so highest common factor is three x this one we write separately 3 a squared b 15 a b and 15 y 3 times a times a times b 15 a b 3 times 5 times a times b 15 y is 3 times 5 times y no what's common 3 is common that's all 5 is not common here so highest common factor is 3 this one 4x squared y 6xy and 8xy squared four two times two x times x and y six is two times three x n y eight two times two times two x and two one now find out the common factors two is common another 2 is not common what 
,,about x here x is common and y is common 1y is common so what's the highest common factor 2 x y factorize the following expressions so three terms so just see what's the common factor for all four is common take it out and remaining ones right inside 4 times 2 you get 2x 4 times 1 so that's y 4 times 3 is 12 so you write 3 there here what's common 3x is common when you take 3x 5 x remaining and y remaining here so when you are factorizing try to find out all factors and take it out three terms are there what's common a b common and 6 15 18 3 is com 3 a b is common take it out and the remaining part 2 a remaining from this minus 5 from this term plus 3 
,,already taken so 6 a b so 6 c remain here this one what's common 4 m you can take it out so remaining part is minus n here minus 5 m and plus 4 you have already taken so 3 is remaining question number 18 write down the perfect squares that are in the range of values from 1 to 100 1 squared 1 2 square 3 squared 9. 4 squared 16 5 
,,squared 25 6 squared 36 7 squared 49 8 squared 64 9 squared 80 1 and 10 squared 100 so you need to write all in the second part the digit in the units place of a perfect square is six write two digits that could be in the units place of its square root so how you get 6 4 times 4 16 so the last digit is 6. 6 times 6 also you get 
,,last digit six so what are the possible two numbers four and six third part which digits do not appear in the units place of a perfect square can you remember 2 3 7 
,,8. so from these numbers in the last digit you are not getting any perfect squares fourth one find square root of nine hundred okay so 900 we can write as 30 times 30 so here we can easily find out dividing by 30 30 times 30. so i can write 30 squared and take the square root square root and square terms get cancel out and you get square root of 900 is 30. if you can't figure out at once so what you do you divide by prime factors and see 450 divide by 2 225 divide by 3 7 5 divided by 3 25 and 5 and 5. then what you do you can write as 2 squared 3 squared and 5 squared so 2 squared 3 squared and 5 squared when you take the square root all get cancelled 
,,out and you get 2 3 and 5. 6 times 5 you get 30. fill in the blanks conversion tons and kilograms so multiplied by thousand so 3000 kilos how you convert to tons and kilograms you divide by thousand three tons and 500 kilos here tons is given how you convert multiply by thousand so four thousand fifty kilograms to tons divide by thousand that means three places to the left to twelve point five here kilograms your tons and kilograms all in kilograms 10 tons means multiply by 1000 you get 10 
,,000 and here 50 all together you get 10 050 kilos evaluate the following so how do you evaluate this one three squared into five three times three nine nine times five you get 45 here 4 cubed and 2 squared what is 4 cube 4 times 4 16 16 times 4 64. 64 times 4 2 times 2 so what is 64 times 4 256 this one 2 to the power 3 2 times 
,,2 times 2 8 3 times 3 9 8 times 9 70 2. minus four times minus four you get plus sixteen and then five to the power three is five times five times 525 so 16 times 20 5 times 5 means 125 so multiply 10 and 6 you get you get two thousand this one minus three times minus three times minus three you get a negative answer and two times two is four three times three nine nine times 3 27 times 4 108 but this is negative 108 minus 1 to the power e 1 power always plus so 5 squared is 25 25 times 4 you get 100 as the answer so we covered all exercises in the revision exercise term one so i'll come back with you to do the second term work

Number Partens,FPzSNP8n8tk,hello grade 8 children today i'm here to teach you chapter 12 in your textbook that's triangles and quadrilaterals you have done this one in grades six and seven we'll see more about triangles and quadrilaterals this is a triangle what's a triangle a polygon formed with three straight line segments is called a triangle so we can label a b c also we can write this symbol to represent a triangle without writing the word triangle so when you see something like this symbol that means a triangle now we'll see what are the characteristics of a triangle first you need to know what are sides so when you take a b say triangle this is one side a b is one side can say side 1 a b what's side 2 this is another side we'll call it side 2 we can label it as b c then the third side side three we can write a c the three straight line segments making up a triangle are called sides of the triangle now we'll look at vertex point the point where any two sides intersected is called a vertex so when you look at abc triangle vertex a is opposite side of bc so vertex a point is opposite to bc what is vertex b vertex b is opposite side of ac and vertex c is opposite side of a b so this is one vertex point this is another vertex point and this is the third one so you get three vertices in a triangle angles there are three interior angles in a triangle what are they a b c a b c means this angle b c a b c a is this angle and c a b c a b is this angle they can also be written as angle a so the middle letter abc you can write as b middle letter we can write b c a we can write at c angle c a b angle we can write as a angle so what are the three angles these are all interior angles so all these are interior angles now we'll look at what are exterior angles take abc triangle bc side has been extended b c extended to d 
,,then you get the angle outside the triangle this is one exterior angle then we can extend ca line to e and you get this exterior angle this is also exterior angle and when you extend a b line to f we get fbc is another exterior angle so when you are extending the lines you have to either select clockwise or anti-clockwise so if 
,,you are taking other way around if this is the triangle if you extend this way you have to extend this one and this one so what are the exterior angles you are getting this one this one and this one so how you label the exterior angles a c d a c d is this one b a e b a e is this angle and fbc fbc is this angle now we'll look at 
,,this exterior angle so when you extend bc line to d you get this exterior angle a c d so what are the opposite interior angles to that so when you take this 60 angle this is an interior angle but opposite means opposite interior angles means other two interior angles so this angle and this angle a pair of interior opposite angles so i can write opposite interior angle this is also opposite interior angle so how can you write down the opposite interior angles to acd you can write b ac bac angle this one and a b c a b c angle is the other opposite interior angles take this triangle c a is extended to e and you get this exterior angle p a e so what are the interior opposite angles to that so here this angle is interior but you can't take that one opposite to that is this angle and this angle so how can we write down 
,,this angle abc angle and b c a angle so those are opposite interior angles now we look at what are the types of triangles so categorizing triangles made according to sides and interior angles by looking at the side length and the angles we can define triangles so we'll look at the first one categorizing according to sides look at this one one side is four centimeter other one is six centimeter and the other one is seven centimeters we call these a scaling triangle the sides of the triangle 
,,are different from one another so all these lengths are different so what we call those scale in triangle next one is isosceles triangle what are isosceles in this triangle a b length and ac length both are equal so when two sides are equal in length it is an isosceles triangle so we know in an isosceles triangle this angle is equal to this angle as well so a b is equal to ac then the other one we call equilateral triangle what are equilateral triangles all sides are three sides are equal so nine centimeter nine centimeter and nine centimeter so what about the angles in an equilateral triangle each angle is 60 degrees now we look at triangles according to the interior angles so the first one we call acute angle triangle so look at these values 80 40 60. all angles are less than 90 degrees all are acute angles so when you get triangle with all acute angles we call these are acute angled triangles so remember the word acute angled triangle when all three angles are less than 90 degrees then the other one we call obtuse angle triangle so what is obtuse means an angle more than 90 n less than 180 so in this one 130 is a is an obtuse angle so it is an obtuse angle where it is greater than 90 degrees if one angle in a triangle is an obtuse angle we can call that it is an obtuse angle triangle can we get two obtuse angles you can't get two obtuse angles only one obtuse angle in any triangle why is that because when you add two obtuse angles it becomes more than 180 degrees so you can get only one obtuse angle the third type is called right angle triangle right means right angle means 90 degree angle so abc in that one is 90 degrees if one angle of a triangle is 90 degrees it is a right angled triangle so there cannot be two right angles why 90 plus 90 180 so what about the third angle you are not getting a triangle so only one right angle you can get so opposite to 90 degree angle we call this ac length is the hypotenuse we call it hypotenuse so ac ac length is the hypotenuse in this triangle finding the sum of the three interior angles in a triangle so we can do an activity so this is abc triangle so what we can do first label angle a b c and you can cut all these three interior angles and we'll see what is the sum of those angles so we'll do in the next page what happens to 
,,these three angles so what you can do you take a paper draw a triangle any triangle label abc and then cut it cut it like this and take those pieces and paste on a another sheet so we'll see what happens now these are the three pieces that i cut from the triangle so take any line so in this one a or b is a straight line so try to paste these papers on top of a b line we'll take the point o so take the pieces and try to paste these you take these pieces and so we'll take this point so i'll paste this one here and take this piece and try to connect and this one i can keep it here what happens now look at this diagram what happens when you take all these 
,,three angles it fits to a straight line so what is this angle aob is a straight angle so what's the sum of interior angles in a triangle the sum of all three interior angles in a triangle is 180 so you can check you can draw any triangle obtuse angle triangle right angle triangle or acute angle triangle and check whether the sum is 180 so in all cases you will get the sum of interior angles at up to 180. now we'll take this triangle you have given two angles and you are asked to find out this one x but we know the sum of interior angles in a triangle is 180 so we can use that to find out the value of x so we can write 70 plus 30 plus x is and eighty seventy plus thirty is hundred plus x is hundred and eighty subtract hundred from both sides you get x equals 180 minus 100 so this is equal to x so x is 80 because the sum of interior angles in a triangle is 180. this is a right angle triangle so you're asked to find out the value of y so this is 90 so what can you write 90 plus 
,,30 plus y is equal to 180 angles sum of a triangle then 90 plus 30 120 then how can you find out the y value subtract 120 from both sides 180 minus 120 is equal to 60 degrees so y equals 60 degrees take this triangle you're asked to find out the a b c angle separately so this is 2x 3x and x so what can you write 3x plus 2x plus 
,,x is equal to 180 because angle sum of a triangle so now like terms you can add 3 plus 2 5 5 plus 1 6x is 180 divide this by 6 to get x x equals 30 degrees now we found out x is 30. what's the a angle a angle is 3 x 3 times 30. that's 90 degrees what's the b angle the angle is 2x 2 times 30. that's 60 degrees and c angle is x that's 30 degrees so when you add these three angles what you get you are getting 180. find the angles unknown in the following triangles so we can use the sum x plus 
,,40 plus 80 is 180 that's the angle sum of a triangle 40 plus 80 you get 120 now subtract 120 from both sides you get x equals 180 minus 120 that's 60 degrees this triangle what is this triangle 120 obtuse angle is there obtuse angle triangle so the sum is 180 so you can write 120 plus 40 plus x is 180 120 plus 40 you get 160 plus x equals 180 x becomes subtract 160 from both sides 180 minus 160 you get 20 degrees so x becomes 20 degrees identify triangles that can have following angles and 
,,underlying so what's the property the sum of interior angles add up to 180 so we need to check whether you get 180 so 65 and 25 90 90 and 90 that's 180 so that's a triangle and it's a it's an acute angle triangle is it acute no 190 degree angle is there right angle triangle second one 140 140 plus 60 you get 200 that's more than 180 it's not a triangle this one 120 plus 30 you get 150 150 and 50 200 that's also not a triangle what about this one 8 80 and 70 150 150 plus 30 180 so that's a that's an acute angle triangle because all angles are less than 90 other one 60 70 50 is it 180 so 120 plus 60 yes that's also a triangle this 130 so you get 150 150 
,,plus 50 200 that's more than 180 so what are the triangles you get this is right angle triangle and these two are acute angled triangles look at this one you have given c you are asked to find out c when a equals 75 and b is 65 in abc triangle so when you draw the triangles a is 75 b is 65 and you are asked to find out c angle so what's the property we'll put x angle so 75 plus 65 plus x is equal to 180 sum of angles in a triangle what's 75 and 65 you get 140 when you subtract 140 from both sides you get x equals 180 minus 140 that's 40 degrees so x equals 40 degrees that means the angle c is 40 degrees find q and r when p equals 80 and q is equal to r two angles are equal what type of triangle isosceles triangle we take p q r p is 80 and q and r both angles are equal so put x here this is also x and we know that 
,,these two lengths are equal for an isosceles triangle now we can use the sum of three angles 80 plus x plus x is hundred sum of angles in a triangle 80 plus x and x 
,,becomes 2x now subtract 80 from both sides so 2x equals 180 minus 80. so you get 100 degrees now divide both sides by 2 you get x equals 100 divided by 2 is 50 degrees so q angle also 50 degrees and r also 50 degrees take this one the proportion between the ratio between abc is 3 to 4 to 5 in triangle abc we'll draw it abc triangle is there a to b to three a to b to c is three to four to five so we can take a is three x b is 4x and c is 5x now we can use the sum 3x plus 4x plus 5x is 180 angle sum of a triangle like terms you can add 5 plus 4 9 9 plus 3 12 x is equal to 180 divide this by 12. so x becomes 12 times 1 12 and here 6 remaining for 60 12 times 5. so x equals 15. so what's a and a angle is 3 times 15 you get 45 degrees b angle 4x 4 times 15. what's 4 times 15 you get 60 degrees now c angle what's the angle 5 x so that means 5 times 15 5 times 15 is 75 so those are the three angles in this triangle exterior angles of a triangle now we'll take this abc triangle length a b is extended to d what's the exterior angle you get d b c length bc extended to e what's the exterior angle you are getting a c e length ca this length extended to f so what's the exterior angle you are getting that's b a f or f a b so you get three exterior angles now when you are extending the lines make sure that you either take clockwise or anti-clockwise so this is anti-clockwise extended the lines now we'll look at the relationship between all exterior angles so we want to find out what's the sum of these three exterior angles so what can you do you can draw any triangle and extend the lines either anti-clockwise or clockwise if you are doing clockwise so you have to do this way this angle and then this one and this one so these are the three angles so you can cut it so cut these three angles and we'll 
,,try to paste it so we'll see what happens when you take all these three exterior angles what happens we'll look at it so after you cut all exterior angles take any point o and try to paste on that we'll try to paste these three angles so we'll take this one so we'll take the other angle try to fit to one point so you are getting and now take this angle and try to fit what happens when you are try to connect you will get all these three angles fit onto one point so what's what's this point point o so what's the sum angle around a point so angle around a point we know that that's 360. so what's the sum of exterior angles in a triangle the sum of three exterior angles is also 360 degrees so you can do this activity you can draw any type of triangle extend the lines and cut all the three angles and try to paste on a point you will get it fits exactly without any gaps so that's why we can say the sum of exterior angles add up to 360. take this diagram so you have given a triangle 
,,and some of the lines extended and created exterior angles show that a plus b plus c is 360. so what we can do we can find out this angle what's see angle 180 minus 
,,30 degrees because this is a straight line so what's the c angle that's 150 what's a angle this one we know this whole thing is 180 so a angle is 180 minus 100 that's 80 degrees what about this one this is also add up to 180 that's a straight angle so b equals 180 minus 50 that's 130 now we'll add and see what's a plus b plus c 
,,150 plus 80 plus 130 what's the sum 0 8 plus 5 13 13 plus 3 60 1 remaining and here you get 360. so we are getting a plus b plus c is 360. so actually what i n b and c exterior angles exterior angles add up to 360 degrees show that p q r is 360. so we can do same thing now a plus b plus c we know that that's 180 degrees angle sum of a triangle how can you write r r i can write 180 minus c what's q q is 180 minus p and p equals 180 minus e all these because of straight angles now we'll try to add all these three r plus q plus p what you get 180 plus 180 360 and another 180 minus a plus b plus c so here minus sign i took it out so you get this one but we know from this equation this is equal to 180 degrees now what happens you can subtract these two and you get p plus q plus r is 360 degrees so that's actually the sum of exterior angles we know that that's 360 degrees find x in this triangle x is any exterior angle when you extend this line you get this exterior angle now you can use that property these three are exterior angles in a triangle what's the sum of angles these three exterior angles we know that that's equal to 180 306 what's the sum of exterior angles that's equal to 100 what's the sum of these three exterior angles that's equal to 360 degrees now at these two you get 6 260 plus x is equal to 360 degrees so how can we find out x subtract 260 degrees from 360 degrees so you get 100 for x now we'll take a quadrilateral so what's this shape four-sided polygon that's called a quadrilateral so what's the interior angles what are interior angles of a quadrilateral we get four sides four angles so in this quadrilateral you get four sides four angles and four vertices so what are the four sides you get you get a b b e d e and a d those are the four sides so what are the four angles you can write a angle b angle d angle and e angle so what's the quadrature we can label as a b e d a b e d or if you go this way you can say a d e b so you have to 
,,go anticlockwise or clockwise when you are labeling a quadrilateral so you can say a b e d is a quadrilateral so what are the four vertices so vertices are a b and e d a b e d are four vertices now we'll look at the relationship between four interior angles in a quadrilateral so what you can do you can draw any quadrilateral four-sided polygon and then label four angles as abcd and then cut it so you can cut all four angles and see what will happen so we'll see what happens to the sum so these are the four pieces now take any point on space and try to fit these angles so i'll take this one and fit on top of this point and take this one and this one take it and try to paste it so you get this and take this one and try to fit it so what happens there are no gaps or overlaps so it exactly fits around a point so we know that what's the angle some around a point that's 360. so all four angles can paste around o point without any gaps so therefore the sum of angles is 360. so what 
,,can you say about this one the sum of four interior angles in any quadrilateral is 360. so you can draw different types of quadrilaterals and see you can take something like this a parallelogram of any four-sided figure and see what happens to all these four angles you get the sum of all interior angles in a quadrilateral is equal to 360. now we'll use that one to find out unknown angles so this is a quadrilateral four-sided figure and you asked to find out this angle x so what can you write we know that the sum of angles add up to 360. so this is 90 degrees 90 plus x is 360. now we can find x at these three angles first you get 10 15 one remaining and this is 250 250 plus x equals 360. so what's x subtract 250 from both sides you get 110 degrees so you get 110 now look at this one this is also a quadrilateral so 
,,that's like trapezium now add all the angles so you get 90 plus 90. these two are 90 degrees and 150 and x that's equal to 360. now add these three 0 and 99 18 18 plus 5 23 2 and 1 that's 3. so 330 plus x equals 360 x equals subtract 330 from 360 you get 30 degrees so this angle is 30 degrees exterior angle of a quadrilateral now how we get exterior angles we need to extend lines in a b c d quadrilateral length a d a t is extended to p what's the exterior angle you are getting p d c length 
,,dc this length extended to s then you get this exterior angle that's b c s length c b extended to r and you're getting a b our exterior angle length ba this length extended to q and you get q a d q a d exterior angle so here you have to choose either clockwise or anti-clockwise here this is anti-clockwise when you extend the lines you get these exterior angles now look at this one when you extend anti-clockwise and clockwise you get all these exterior angles now how many exterior angles you are getting one two three four five six seven eight eight exterior angles but we know these are vertically opposite angles those are equal so these angles are equal so that means how many exterior angles are there we get only four exterior angles that's a b c d so you need to remember when you are extending lines if you are using anti-clockwise what are the angles you are getting this one this one this one and when you extend this one you get this one so anti-clockwise you get these four abcd angles when you extend clockwise you get the other four abcd angles now we'll try to find out a relationship between exterior angles in a quadrilateral so what you can do you can draw any quadrilateral and extend the lines either clockwise or anti-clockwise and label pqrs and then cut it cut all these four angles and try to 
,,paste on a point so we'll try to do that so take any point o and try to fit these angles so take one angle and keep like this and take the other one and try to paste it without any gaps or overlaps you can't keep gaps there then take this one and try to paste it what happens and this one so when you paste it what happens you are not getting any gaps or overlaps this is exactly fit around a point so what you call this we know that all four angles paste around point o without any gaps so what's the sum of these angles these angles add up to 360 because we know the sum of angles around a point is 360. so in any quadrilateral the sum of angles of 4 exterior angles is equal to 360. now we'll use that property to find out the unknown angles so this is a quadrilateral extended lines anti-clockwise way and then these are 
,,the exterior angles now what can you say about these angles the sum is 360. so 80 plus 120 plus 110 is equal to you get 10 11 one remaining and 3 310 now we know the sum is 360. so subtract 310 from 360 you get 50 degrees so a is equal to 50 degrees look at this question three exterior angles of abcd quadrilateral are 120 130 and 70 degrees find the remaining angle so we know the sum of all four exterior angles add up to 360. so we'll first add these three you get 200 and 320 remaining angle is 360 minus 320 so what's the remaining angle that's equal to 40 degrees now we'll look at review exercise name the three sides and the three angles of the triangle shown in the figure so what are the three sides k l l m and k m o m k k m k l and l m are the three sides of this triangle what are the three angles you can either write l angle k angle m angle or if you are writing properly how can you write l angle k l m then how can you write k angle l k m and what's m angle that's k m l so those are the three angles draw an obtuse angle triangle and name it abc measure a b c b a c and a c b and write down their magnitude so you need to draw an obtuse angle trend we can draw an obtuse angle triangle means one angle is more than and more than 90 degrees so this is an obtuse angle triangle so we label it a b c so b angle is the obtuse angle now we need to measure the angles so we'll take the protractan measure a b c angle abc is this angle so take the protractor and try to measure these angles so we'll keep the protractor on top of the line here so what's the angle here we can measure from this way that's 143 so 143 now we'll measure the 
,,other angle now we did abc now b ac bac angle b ac angle this one so we'll take this angle and try to measure this so you get 20 degrees so you get 20 degrees for that then we'll take the other angle what's the other angle bca bcu a or a c b a c b angle let me show it and see so here this is an acute angle so you need to measure this way but in this protractor i can't read the value so i'm reading from this way so 163 163 so what's the angle 180 minus 163 you get 17 degrees so that's 17. degrees now we'll see the sum of angles 10 eight and here one so you get sum of three angles add up to 180 degrees draw a triangle pqr as in the figure and produce qr 
,,to s measure prq pr qn this angle and prs p r s these two and write down their magnitudes so we'll draw the triangle so i'll draw a triangle like this so this is p q r triangle and extend qr to s now we'll measure pr q angle this angle so take the protractor and measure this angle so you get so we have to measure this way so i'm getting 120 3 123 that means 180 minus 123 57 so 57 degrees for pr prq now this angle is from here that's 123. so prs 123. so we know that when you add these two you are getting 180 degrees because this is a straight line question number four draw a quadrilateral a b c d and produce a b to e this is this line and you can draw similar diagram to that any quadrilateral so i can draw this and label this one a b e c d measure e b c e b c this angle and a b c this angle and write down the magnitudes so we'll do that using the protractor so we need to turn this way to measure this angle so what's this angle so we'll first write down ebc angle e b c angle e 
,,b c so this way that's here from here that's 70. so 180 minus 70. so you get 110 degrees for eb c so this is e bc angle is 110 now what's this angle abc angle abc angle is from here to here so i get here to here 70 degrees now when you add it you get 180 because a b e is a straight line example number one find the magnitude of abc that means x value we know this is a triangle what's the angle sum of a triangle that's equal to 180 and when you add these two you get 80 so 35 and 45 80 degrees plus x equals 180 so what's x subtract 80 from that so you get 100 degrees for x example number two find the magnitude of qpi qpr means 3x angle this is a right angle triangle the sum of angles in a right angle or any angle is add up to 180 so this is 90 degrees 3x and 2x becomes 5x and now subtract 90 from both sides you get 5x equals 180 minus 90 that's 90. so 90 divided by 5 you get x value 5 times 1 5 for 40 that's 8. so 18 degrees so 18 is x so what's the q p r angle three x three times eighteen so you get fifty four degrees example number three find the values of x and y according to the information marked in the figure so you're asked to find out x and y value now take e triangle what can you say when you take a d e triangle 85 x and 30 are the interior angles so you can write x plus 85 plus 30 degrees is 
,,equal to 180 because of angle sum of a triangle now add these two you get 5 11. so x plus 115 is equal to 180 so what's x you subtract 115 from 180 so 10 and 1 remaining so you get 6 here 65 degrees for x now we need to find out the y value now we can consider abc triangle when you take abc triangle the angle sum is also 180 so 
,,y plus x is 65 plus 80 that's equal to 180 and these two you get 5 and 14. so 145 so what's y value y is 180 minus 145 so you get y as 35 degrees so x is 65 and y is 35 exercise 12.1 find the magnitude of the angle marked as x in each figure so this is a triangle angle sum of a triangle is 180 these two you get 10 and 140 plus x equals 180 so what's x 180 minus 140 you get 40. degrees this one a right angle triangle so x plus 90 plus 53 is equal to 180 angle sum of a triangle so these two you get 143 subtract 143 from both sides what you get thirty seven so x is 37 degrees this one an obtuse angle triangle 130 plus x plus x is 180 x and x becomes 2x and when you take 130 to the other side you get 180 minus 130 that's 50 degrees when you divide this by 2 you get x value x equals 25 degrees this one all angles are equal what's the triangle equilateral triangle so we can say x plus x plus x is 180 3x is 180 means x equals 180 divided by 3 60 degrees so in an equilateral triangle each angle is 60 degrees find the magnitude of each of the angles in each triangle so this is a triangle abc i can write 2x plus 3x plus 60 is 180 2x and 3x becomes 5x and when you take 60 to the other side you get 180 minus 60 that's 120 degrees so 5x equals 120 means when you divide by 5 you get x equals 2 and for 20 that's 4. so x is 24 so you're asked to find out all angles so what say equals 2x 2 times 24 you get 48 degrees p angle b angle is 3 x 3 x 24 72 degrees c angle already known that's 60 degrees so these are the three angles in this triangle this one another triangle so you can add all these interior angles and equate to 180 5x plus x becomes 6x now take 100 take 30 to the other side so 6x equals 180 minus 30 degrees so you get 150. so 6x equals 150 divide both sides by 6 x equals 2 for 30 that's 5. 
,,so x is 200 x is 25 degrees now what's p angle p angle is 30 q angle is 5x 5 times 25 125 and the other angle our angle is x that means 25 degrees this one again another triangle we can write 3 a plus 2 a plus a is equal to 108 sum of angles in a triangle add like terms 3 plus 2 5 plus 1 6 a equals 180 divided by 6. what you get a equals 30 degrees now we found out a is 30. so what is m manga a mangle is 3 a 3 times 30. that's 90 degrees k angle 2a 2 times 30 that's 60 degrees and l angle is 30 degrees question number three find the magnitude of each of the angles denoted by an english letter in each figure so here two unknowns are there so first we'll take abc triangle we know the angle sum is 180. so 70 plus 38 plus x is 180 at these two you get 108 plus x equals 180 x becomes 180 minus 108 what's the value 72 degrees for x now we need to find out why we know this is a straight line so what's y y is 180 minus 72 so you get 100 degrees this one you need to find out a and b so we'll first find b here what's b here what are these two b angle is 40 degrees why vertically opposite angles are equal vertically opposite angles then we found out b so what's a you can use the angle sum of a triangle so 80 plus b that's 40 plus a is 180 80 plus 40 you get 120 plus a equals 180 subtract a subtract 120 you get 180 minus 120 that's 60 degrees so a equals 60. this one first you can find x this is a straight line so what's x x plus 140 is 180 because straight angle now what's x 180 minus 140 that's 40 degrees now we found out x value how we find out y we can take interior angles y plus y plus x equals 180 sum of angles in a triangle angles in a triangle so you can write 2y y plus y 2y plus x x we found that's 40 is equal to 180 so take 40 to the other side 2y equals 180 minus 40 that's 140 divide by two you get 70 degrees so x equals 40 and y equals 70. this one first we'll find out x angle according to k l in triangle we can write 35 plus 90 plus x is 180 sum of angles in a triangle so these two 125 and when you subtract 125 from 180 you get x value so 55 degrees 55 degrees for x now take the bigger triangle klm triangle you can say this is a right angle triangle so 90 plus 90 plus x that's 55 plus y equals 180 these two you get 145 plus y equals 180 so y becomes 180 minus 145 so you get 35 degrees for y value this triangle look at carefully which one we can take so we can first find the a angle a b k triangle when you take a b k triangle 30 plus 70 plus a is 180 angle sum of a triangle 30 plus 70 is 100 plus a equals 180 so when you take 100 to the other side you get 80 degrees for a now we found out a how can we find out b you can use the other triangle ade triangle when you take a d e triangle you can say b plus a is 80 and 20 is equal to 180 angle sum of a triangle 80 plus 20 that's hundred now when you subtract 100 from both sides you get 80 degrees for v value example number one find the value of x in the figure this is a quadrilateral the sum of angles in a quadrilateral is 360. so i can write x plus 90 plus 130 plus 75 is equal to 360. and these three you get 5 19 and 295 so when you subtract 295 from 360 you get the x value so you get 5 and 10 16. so 65 degrees for x value example number two find the values of x and y in the figure here straight away you can write 2x equals 140 because these are vertically opposite angles so what vertically opposite angles are equal so when you divide by 2 you get x equals 70 degrees so x is 70. now you can use the angle sum of a quadrilateral here to find out y so we can write y plus 100 plus x is 70 and here 2x 2 times 70 that's 140 that's add up to 360 degrees now add these three angles you get 310 and when you subtract 310 from 360 you get 50 degrees for y value so we found out x is 70 and y 
,,is 50 degrees exercise 12.2 find the value of x in each figure given below so this is a quadrilateral so you can add all these interior angles and equate to 360. when you add all these angles 5 and 5 10 1 remaining 10 16 16 plus 521 subtract 210 you get x value so you get 150 degrees for x this one you need to find out x this is also a cardi lateral all these angles add up to 360 degrees add like terms 2 plus 2 4 4 plus 1 5. so 80 plus 5 x equals 360. so 5x equals 360 minus 80. 280 when you divide by five so what's the x value five times 525 for 30 that's 6 of x equals 56 degrees this one again a quadrilateral so at all these angles you get 360. we'll 
,,add like terms 6 plus 2 8 8 plus 2 10 x 10 x equals 360 when you divide this by 10 you get x equals 36 degrees this is also another quadrilateral so add all the interior angles and equate to 360. so i'd like terms 10 plus 2 12 x equals 360. so 12 x becomes 360 minus 60 that's 300 divided by 12. you get x value 12 times 2 24 6 remaining that's 5. so x becomes 25 degrees find the values of x and y in each figure given below look at carefully and see which one we can find now when you take the bigger triangle we know angle sum of the triangle is 180 so you can write x plus 75 plus 25 is 180 these two you get 100 when you subtract 100 from 180 you get 80 degrees for x now we can find out the y value how can we find out y value so we can use this quadrilateral and find out the y value so what's this one 180 minus hundred five 75 degrees so 75 here now we can use the sum of angles in a quadrilateral is 360. so 75 plus 75 plus x x we found 80 and y is equal to 360. 150 here 150 plus 80 230 that is equal to 360 now subtract 230 you get 134 value here without using that what do you know about these two you can easily find out why using another method y is actually sum of sum of opposite interior angles is the exterior angle so you can use that way also 105 plus 25 so 130 degrees this one you can easily find 
,,out x first what's x 180 minus 115 because this is a straight angle so 65 degrees x is 65 you can find out y using the sum of angles in a quadrilateral y plus 120 plus 85 plus x x is 25 x is 65 that's equal to 360. these three you get 10 and 9 6 15 17 1 remaining that's 270 now subtract 270 from 360 you get 90 degrees so y equals 90 degrees this diagram here this is opposite angle so what's x straight away x equals 90 degrees vertically opposite angles are equal now we found out this value 
,,so this is 130 that's also vertically opposite angles now we can use the sum of angles in a quadrilateral so we can write y plus y plus 130 plus the x value 90 is 360. 2y plus 220 equals 360. subtract 220 from 360 what you get 140 so divide both sides by 2 you can find out the y value that's 70 degrees look at this diagram what 
,,can you find out first you can find out x value so when you take the triangle 30 plus 50 plus x is 180 sum of angles in a triangle 50 plus 30 80 and when you subtract 80 from 180 you get 100 degrees that's x how can we find out the y value now how can we find out y now look at this triangle this is 30 this is 50 80. so what what is this angle 180 minus 80. so you get 100 degrees now we can easily find out using this quadrilateral so 50 plus x that's 100 plus 100 plus y equals 360. that's the angle sum of a quadrilateral 250 plus y equals 306 so what's y 360 minus 250 that's 100 degrees so we found out x is 100 and y equals 110 straight away you can find out the x value x is vertically opposite angles now you can find out the y value what's the angle sum of a coordinate true 360. so you can write 80 plus x and x becomes 2x 2 times 70. plus y equals 360. so 80 plus 2 times 70 140. now subtract this value first add these two you get 220 plus y equals 360. so what's y 360 minus 220 you get 140 degrees for y question number three find the magnitude of each of the following angles based on the information marked in the figure dcf dc f is 2x so that's 2x we need to find out x now take ef cd quadrilateral efcd quadrilateral you get 90 90 2x and 120 so four angles are these when you add all together you are 
,,getting 360. so angles in a quadrilateral 90 90 180 180 and this one 300 plus 2x equals 360. when you subtract 300 from 360 you get 2x equals 60 degrees now divide this by 2 you get 30 degrees for x but we need 2x that's 60 degrees for this angle abc now abc this angle what's that angle take a b c triangle when you take a b c triangle 100 x and you can find out the other angle so we'll put y there so y angle so 100 plus y plus x x is 30 degrees that's equal to 180 is the triangle 100 plus 30 hundred and 30 when you subtract 130 from 180 you get the y value that's 50 degrees y is 50 degrees aed angle now a e d and this angle how can we find out that angle here we can take a e d b quadrilateral and find out a e d angle so we'll take the quadrilateral 100 100 plus y value y is 50 plus 90 and the angle required so we'll put z letter z is equal to now 360. that's a quadrilateral when you add these three you get 0 and 240 240 plus z equals 360. so what's the z value z value is 360 
,,minus 240 so you get 0 2 1. so 120 degrees so what's the angle here the angle is 120 that's the angle we need this is z angle or i can write as 120 degrees now we'll look at example one find the value of x in the figure what are those when we extend the lines we get exterior angles so any polygon when you take all exterior angles that is add up to 360. so we can use that property x plus 100 plus 130 is equal to 360. x plus when you add these two you get 230 is 360. subtract 300 subtract 230 from 360. you get 130 degrees so x is 130 degrees example number two find the magnitudes of the three exterior and the three interior angles of the triangle abc now we know the exterior angles add up to 360. so i can write 3x plus 2x plus 4x is 360. so when you add it you get 9x equals 360. divide this by nine you get x equals 
,,40 degrees so what are the three exterior angles exterior angles are 3x 3 times 40 you get 120 and the other one 2x 2 times 40 that's 80 and 4x 4 times 40 160 degrees so those are exterior angles now we'll find out the interior angles what are interior angles this one is 180 minus 2x so interior angles 1 is 180 minus 2x 2 times 
,,40 that's 80. so 100 degrees what's the other one 180 minus 3x 3 times 40 120 you get 60 degrees what's the other one 180 minus 4x 4 times x 160. so you get 20 degrees so these are the interior angles and these are the exterior angles exercise 12.3 first question select and write the exterior angles from among the angles a b c d e x and y shown in the figure explain why the other angles are not exterior angles so when you take a this angle is this so that's an interior angle so b is an exterior angle then x also you get an exterior angle so this is y is a straight angle that's not the exterior angle not extended the lines then when you take this way so e another exterior angle but here d is this one so that's an interior angle and what's the other angle see also outside the triangle that's an exterior angle so these are exterior angles while the other angles are not exterior angle y is 180 that's a straight angle d is the interior angle why this is equal because of vertically opposite angles and a also interior angle because of vertically opposite angles so we took a b c d e x so we found out all angles question number two find the value of each of the angles denoted by an english letter in each figure given below so these all are exterior angles of a triangle so sum of exterior angles add up to 300 add these two 300 plus a equals 360 subtract 300 you get 60 degrees for a this one when you extend the lines do you get these exterior angles this one this way but 
,,here this is the exterior angle when you extend this way and this way or you can do if it's this way and this one should be this angle but that's equal to the same so you can take this is a now these three are exterior angles 140 plus a plus a is 360. so 2a equals 360 minus 140 what you get here so 220 so 2a a becomes 220 divided by 2 100 10 degrees when you extend the lines you get these three exterior angles so you can write x plus 90 plus 145 is 360. these two you get 235 subtract 235 from 360. hundred and twenty five so 125 is the x value this one again these are exterior angles so x plus x plus x is 360. so 3 x equals 360 divided by 3 you get x value so that's 120 degrees this one extend and see whether these are exterior angles so this is okay these two exterior so you have to extend this line and this is the exterior angle so if this is 43 what is this angle 180 minus 43 so 137 now we can find out x using the sum of exterior angles add up to 360 for any polygon 285 when you add these two and when you subtract 360 when we subtract 285 from 360 you get the x value 5 10 so you can 9 9 plus 7 16 so 75 so x is equal to 75 degrees according to the information marked in the figure find brc b r c this angle how can we find out that one think about brc triangle and you can find our vrc triangle sum of angles is equal to 180 30 plus 40 plus brc angle is 180 70 plus brc angle is 180 subtract 70 you get 110 degrees for brc angle part 2 apc apc angle is apc descent now we can take apc triangle apc triangle 30 plus a p c angle plus 20 degrees is 180 that's also a triangle sum of angles in a triangle is 180 so 30 plus 20 is 50 apc angle plus 50 equals 180 so what's apc 180 minus 50 100 30 degrees so apc is 130. now third part we need b q a b q a is this angle how can we find out that angle look at carefully and see b q a angle can you see these three are the exterior angles of this pqr triangle so we can add v q a angle plus the r angle we found that's 110 and the p angle we found that's 130 those three angles add up to 360 because of exterior angles now we can find out pqe angle so this is part 3 so bqa angle is 360 minus these two sum of these two you get 0 4 and 2 240 so what's the subtraction you get 120 degrees example number one find the value of x what are these angles when you extend the lines anti-clockwise you get these exterior angles so what's the sum x plus 55 plus 90 and 90 add up to 360 because of exterior angles x plus 180 
,,and 55 when you add it 235 and subtract 235 we get 125 for x example number two find the values of x and y according to the information marked in the figure so how can we find out x now look at carefully when you extend this line you get this one when you extend this slide and this one you get 60 x 60 and then when you extend this line you get 130 and 90. all these are exterior angles so 130 plus 60 plus 90 plus x is 360. add these three you get 15 18 one remaining and 280 so what's x 360 minus 200 so 80 degrees so x equals 80 degrees now we need to find out y how can we find out why this is 90. if we can find out this angle we can think about using the angle in a triangle angle sum of a triangle so we can see this is 30 so this is 30. now we can use a triangle 90 plus y plus 30 equals 180 because of angle sum of 
,,a triangle you get 120 plus y equals 180 so what's y 180 minus 120 that's 60 degrees exercise 12.4 find the value of a marked in each figure so when you extend all these line clockwise you get these exterior angles so the sum of exterior angles sum of xt angles add up to 360. now add these three you get 5 5 10 1 remaining 10 18 
,,20 25 plus a equals 360. so what's a 360 minus 250 you get hundred ten this question now see whether these are exterior angles this is interior so when you extend this one you get here this is this is when you extend this is the exterior angle so that's also a because of opposite interior angles this is a because of vertically opposite angles now when you extend this one this is the other exterior angle so if this is 30 what is this angle 180 minus 30 that's 150 now we have all four exterior angles add up to 360. so 150 plus a plus a plus another a is equal to 360 degrees so 150 plus 3a is 360. so what's 3a 360 minus 150 so when you subtract you get 210 divide by 3 you get a value that's 70 decrease so a equals 70. this one check whether these are exterior angles when you extend you get this one when you extend this one this is but when you extend this is the exterior angle but this is also 2a because vertically opposite angles are equal and when you extend this line this is 
,,a now take the sum 2 a plus a plus a plus 2 a 2 a plus a plus a plus 2 a is equal to 360 degrees 2 plus 2 4 4 and 2 6 a equals 360. divide this by 6 what you get a equals 360 divided by 6 you get 60 degrees for a value question number two find the value of each of the angles based on the given below what is the value of x this is a straight line what is x x equals 180 minus 110 so x equals 70 degrees second one what is the value of a a is here now look at carefully the extended lines when you extend this one you get 85. here x when you extend this is 140 that's the exterior angle and when you extend this line you get a so a plus 85 plus x plus 140 you 
,,get 360. what's the reason sum of exterior angles add up to 360. we found x so a plus 85 plus 70 plus 140 equals 360. a plus at these three 295 is 360. so what's the value 360 minus 295 so 65 is the a value now we need to find out the b value that's part 3 b value straight away you can find from 180 minus a a is 65 because this 
,,is a straight angle so what's b 115 decrease that's b value question number three find the magnitudes of the angles marked in the figure as a b and c what say a is 180 minus 110 so you get 70. why what's the reason straight angle then what's the b values again this is a straight angle 180 minus 85 95 degrees now let's see we need to check the exterior angles when you extend this one you get here see when you extend this line this angle that's b angle is the exterior angle here 110 and when 
,,you extend this one this is 70. those are the exterior angles so we can add 70 plus c plus b value that's 95 plus 110 that's equal to 360 because of exterior angles 
,,add these 3 5 10 17 1 remaining so 275 plus c equals 360 so what's the value of c 360 minus 275 85 degrees for c so we found out a b and c this one straight away we 
,,can find out b and c what's b 180 minus 108 that's 72 because of straight angle see also we can find 180 minus 72 that's 108 straight angle now we need a angle now check what are the exterior angles when you extend this one you get this then you need to extend this one so this angle is the exterior angle see vertically opposite 
,,angles are equal then when you extend you get b and when you extend you get 105 so you can write 105 plus a plus c plus b is 360. exterior angles add up to 360. 105 
,,plus a c is 108 and b equals 72. that's equal to 360. now add these 108 1072 180 180 plus 105 285 so 285 plus a equals 360. so a equals 360 minus 285 so you get 75 degrees for a question number four find the values of x and y in each figure what are the values now here when you take the big triangle this is extended and you get 
,,this angle and here when you extend this line 122 and this angle is the other exterior angle that's x so you can find x plus 118 plus 100 22 is equal to 360 because 
,,sum of exterior angles add up to 360 in this triangle so you can find x x plus 240 is 360. so what's x 360 minus 240 so x equals you get 120 degrees so x is 120. now how can we find out y look at this triangle small triangle when you extend this line here you get y angle that's not an exterior angle so this is y opposite interior vertically opposite angles are equal now if this is x we found 120 what is this angle 180 minus 120 60 degrees now you can find y using the angle sum of a triangle y plus 60 plus 70 is 180 y plus 130 is 180 so what's y 180 minus 130 that's 50 degrees look at this diagram when you extend this line you get this exterior angle when you extend you get this exterior angle and here this is exterior angle and this is this so what can you say about x plus 105 plus 62 plus 128 that's equal to 360. x plus when you add these 3 what you get 5 1 remaining 9 so 295 plus is equal to 360. so what's x 360 minus 295 so decreases x so what's the y value now we found x 
,,is 65 now look at this triangle what is this angle 180 minus 105 so you get 75 degrees and this is 25 opposite interior angles are equal now you can use angle sum of a triangle so 75 plus y plus 25 is 180 so y plus 100 is 180 so what's y 180 minus 100 that's 80 degrees so x is 65 and y is 80. question number five what is the value of a plus b plus c plus d we'll see whether these are exterior angles when you extend this line you get this one here this is exterior and this is exterior and this is xt so you can straight away write down b plus c plus d plus this is a yes this is also you can take it that's 360. so a plus b plus c plus d 360 exterior angles second one what is the value of bce b c e that's also yeah when you take the triangle b plus c plus e that's also 360. exterior angle exterior angles of a triangle but any polygon x the sum of exterior angles add up to 360. then according to the answers of 1 and 2 show that e equals a plus t so both are 360. so i can write b plus c plus d plus a is equal to b plus c plus e subtract b plus c from both sides so this get cancel out you get a plus d equals e so you get e equals a plus d so we covered all theory related to triangles and quadrilaterals so you need to remember the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is hundred and eighty the sum of interior angles of a quadrilateral is 360. the sum of the exterior angles of a triangle is 360 and the sum of the exterior angles of a quadrilateral is 360. and remember when you are finding exterior angles you need to extend the lines either anti-clockwise or clockwise then only the sum is equal to 360. practice all examples and exercises and thorough with triangles and quadrilaterals

Number Partens,CT9iX5osAs4,hello grade 8 children today I am here with another new topic we'll see what's the topic about you have done numbers two plus three and a half minus five oh you have done point three plus 95 so all these are with numbers so we call this is number theory then you have done straight lines circles squares parallel lines and angles 
,,all are these geometry what about letters what are these two x plus three Y minus five plus three X letters and numbers combination we call that algebra so today we 
,,are doing about algebra so what's the topic chapter five algebraic expression so we'll find out what are the terms involved in this uni and what are the concepts look at this one the price of a coconut is 48 rupees the distance from Colombo to Gul is hundred kilometers there are 31 days in the month of January Ravinder gets 80 points in mathematics course so what are they is 48 130 180 what are those those are numbers if I ask you a question what's the height of a student in grade 8 class so we can't give a specific value usually the height of the students in the class will be different from one another so therefore we need to define a term called variable so what's variable changing values of height as it is not a fixed number so when you don't get a fixed number when the value is changing we call those are variables we use algebraic terms or expressions to denote changing values so we'll take height as a letter so we use algebraic expression like x today not changing values any letter this one profit varies from one day to another day from Nima's three-wheeler so it's changing all the time it can be named as I'll put a receipt a so what's a it's a variable because it's changing all the time this one radius of three circles are three centimetres four centimetres and five centimetres respectively when we consider radius of the circle we can take this one is R that's a variable we can use a letter so what's the R value we can write R equals three centimeters R equals four centimeters that our equals five centimeters so what's the variable they are our that's the radius of the circle this one city does a bias certain number 
,,"of string hoppers to sell in his boutique every day if we do not know the number exactly can show it as another variable we'll take simple B where B is an unknown set we don't know exactly the amount of string hoppers that city dancer buys look at this one in the figure above shows three containers of the same size all three containers contain an equal amount of liquid it can be considered as what you can use another letter H because it is an unknown constant because we don't know exactly what's the water level is so here what's the variable H height of water so lowercase letters such as a b c or you can put X Y Z so any simple lowercase letters we can use to represent variables so it can be an unknown constant or a variable look at this one the daily income of poachers fruit shop can be stated as X so what is X they are jail income he saved his income by 2,000 rupees a day find the remaining amount of money what's the total income X he's saving to thousand rupees each day so what's the remaining amount you can write in terms of X X is the total value daily income subtract 2000 so the remaining amount is X minus 2000 so this is an algebraic expression so what are the terms terms in this algebraic expression we can write x an mm so those are called terms of algebraic expression so what are the terms "
,,you learn now you learned about variable and we can use simple letters for variables and the next term is terms of an algebraic expression look at this one the price of a coconut is extra base the price of 8 coconut so what you do you have to multiply by 8 so one coconut is x and x 8 so what's the value you get 8x rupees so what are the terms you can say 8x is an algebraic term and the number in front of the letter here X is the variable the number in front of the letter is called coefficient so what's the coefficient in this term 8 8 is the coefficient of the algebraic term we learned about variables terms and coefficient now look at this one combination of algebraic terms 5x plus 3y minus 4z that's called algebraic expression so what are these 5 x 3y minus 4 are the algebraic terms and what about this one the number in front of the letter what you call that coefficients coefficients and terms the width of the rectangle is X its length is 7 its length is 7 meters more than the rich right the algebraic expression for the length so how can we write down length 7 more than that ex-mo more means in maths plus addition X plus 7 is the length so what's the algebraic expression for length X plus 7 if the length of the rectangle is wild now they have given this one is y if this one is y write down the algebraic expression for width we know the width is 7 meters less than the length so we can write by -7 if you take length as Y that's Y minus 7 is the weight the price 
,,of a pen is extra pays the cost of a pencil is why rupees the price of a book is 0 please so what about price of three prints one is X and 3 you have to multiply by 
,,3 3 X 3 times X you don't need to write down the multiplication sign you can write 3x price of 4 pencils one pencil is why 4 pencils for y price of several books one book is zero Peas seven books 7z give the cost of buying all the above in the form of an algebraic expression so the total cost we can add it together 3x plus 4y plus 7c that's an algebraic expression write the terms of this algebraic expression so you have given an algebraic expression what are the terms 3x for bi and 7z coefficient of 3 X we know what is coefficient means the number in front of the letter that's 3 coefficient of 4y what's the number in front that's four coefficient of 77 is the coefficient there build algebraic expression for the following statements we'll try to write in terms of letters you can take these letters given add 7 to the double of X what if double means 2 times X so adding 7 to double of X means 2x 2x plus 7 subtract 6 from the 3 times of X but if three times means 3x 3x and you have to subtract 6 subtract 3 from the sum of x and y sum of x and y means the addition X plus 1 and subtract 3 divided by y how you divide we can write x over 1 divide X by y and subtract from seven so that turns that you have to subtract from seven that means seven - so we'll write seven minus x over Y not X over Y minus 7 because from 7 you have to subtract this amount divided the multiplication of a and B multiplication of a and B by 3 means a B divided by 3 divided the multiplication of 
,,a and B by 3 and subtract from 10 from 10 means 10 minus this value filling the gaps in the following table algebraic expressions are there as you break terms so you have to write down only algebraic terms so what are the algebraic terms 7 x + 3 by what's the coefficient 7 & 3 what are the I do break terms here 6a + 3 B here you don't write down these constants algebraic terms means only terms with letters what are the coefficients 6 & 3 here Excel why hyphens are 1 and 1 in this one 3 a coefficient is 3 this one - 3 X + 7 5 coefficients are -3 here and so this one you get a fraction but here this is an algebraic term 2x over 3 you can write X in the numerator and 3 by over 5 also an algebraic term then what's the coefficient you have to take the whole thing the fraction 2/3 three fits this one this is an algebraic term 5x over 7 and minus 2y over 3 so what's the coefficient there five over seven is the coefficient of x term and minus two-thirds is the coefficient of weiter look at this question the cost of an arranges extra pays the cost of an apple is y rupees the cost of a mango is zero peas build algebraic expressions for the following price of two oranges and five mangoes oranges is X so 2x plus because this is both together five mangoes one mango easy five mangoes 5z price of two mangoes and seven apples two mangoes is to Z and seven apples Apple is why rupee so 7 y cost of six oranges and eight apples six oranges one orange is X plus six six and eight apples one Apple is why that's eight why price of five oranges seven apples and three mangos five oranges that's 5 X 7 apples 7 y then 3 mangoes 3z question number five cost of one orange one apple and two mangoes one Apple is why and one orange is X and two mangoes - Z - look at this one right down the algebraic expression for the total cost to buy three kilos of sugar two kilos of Thailand five kilos of flour we are one kilo of each product is a rupees be rupees and C rupees respectively so what are the values total cost we need three kilos of sugar so sugar is a so three a five kilos then two kilos of Dar Daly's be rupees to be and five kilos of flour flour is C rupees of five C next one one kilo of red dollies extra peas and one kilo of yellow dollies why rupees write down an algebraic expression for the extra mounts pen for buying five kilos of yellow da then three kilos of red that means the price is high when you buy five kilos of yellow da so what's the difference five 
,,kilos of yellow doll yellow one is by rupees 5 i- three kilos of red on red dollies extra piece per kilo so 3x so the difference is this well the capacity of a bucket days M liters and bucket B is in liters you need to use 12 buckets of a and eight buckets of B at once to fill a tank what is the capacity of the track so what's the total amount of a buckets yeah 12 a buckets so M liters are there so 12 M then what about from B buckets so need eight buckets of B each bucket contained in liters so eight and so the capacity of the tank is 12 m + 8 in the father's age in one of the families years the age of the mother is beers the daughter's age is Sears give the sum of ages of the father and mother in the form of an algebraic expression fathers ages a mother's ages B so the total is a plastic give the sum of the age of the mother and daughter in the form of an algebraic expression mother's age is B daughters ages the total of the ages of the father mother and dot all three of them a plus B plus C write the sum of the total age of the three above after 10 years in the form of an algebraic expression so we have to add 10 for each value 10 and 
,,10 and 10 for all three people that means 30 so the total value is a plus B plus C plus 30 so after 10 years this is the total value manufacturers men extra piece to make a table the manufacturer made a profit of twice as much as the cost price and sold it to a retailer the retailer solely to the consumer with a profit of by rupees right the profit of the manufacturer in the form of an algebraic expression so how can you write down an algebraic expression manufacture a spend X to make a table that's the cost value the manufacturer made a profit of twice as much as the cost price so what's the profit to X so write the profit of the manufacturer in the form of an algebraic expression err so that's 2x give the selling price of the table by the manufacturer in the form of an algebraic expression so the profit is 2x and the cost price is X so what's the selling price X plus 2x when you add it that's 3x so that's the selling price right the selling price of the retailer to the consumer in the form of an algebraic expression now the retailer sold it to the consumer with a profit of Y rupees so this is the price this retailer bought that means 3 X and he keeps by rupee profit so you have to add Y so this is the selling price of the retailer to the consumer the shape shown in the above is a square and a rectangle made out of matchsticks give the perimeter of the square in the form of an algebraic expression one side is given X for sides and there X plus X plus X plus X 
,,what's the perimeter for X give the perimeter of the rectangle in the form of an algebraic expression how you find out the perimeter you have to add all these lengths so a plus 2b plus a plus 2b a and a you are getting 2 a 2b and 2b when you add 2 plus 2 4 that's 4 B give the full length of the matchsticks used to construct the 
,,above images in the form of an algebraic expression so total length so length for the squares for X and length for this one is 2a plus 4b subtract the total length of the matchsticks used to make the square from the total length of the matchsticks used to make the rectangle in an algebraic expression so you have to subtract the 
,,lengths of matchsticks used to make the square from this one so what's the total here two way plus 4b and subtract the lengths for this one that's 4x look at this one give the perimeter of the equilateral triangle in the form of an algebraic expression equilateral means all sides I equal a and a n a what's the perimeter 3a right the perimeter of the write angular triangle in the form of an algebraic expression so just add all the lengths together we'll do that X plus X plus 2 plus X plus 1 
,,now you can simplify like terms you can add X X X 3x 2 & 1 that's right the total perimeter of the above diagrams in the form of an algebraic expression so this is the perimeter of the write angular triangle and is the parameter for the equilateral triangle so add it together 3 E + 3 X + 3 multiplying an algebraic expression by 
,,a number so we'll see how we can multiply the algebraic expression by a number width of the rectangle is X this is the width and the length is 1 determine the perimeter of the rectangle x + y + X + 1 so you can write down 2 times X plus y of x + alright separately x + y X plus y when you simplify you get 2 x + 2 I now I want to 
,,just separate these two parts this part separately and this part separately what's the length of this part when you separate this what's the length of this one x + y you get the same length here X + 1 so double of this x + y so length of one part is X plus y length of 2 parts you multiply by 2 so 2 times X plus 1 but we took the same diagram finding perimeter fully and taking separately you have to get the same answer so in both methods the perimeter of the same figure is equal so we can write down 2 x + y is equal to two x plus 2y now look at this one when there's a number in front you are multiplying both these X terms by two so when X plus y is x to both the terms x + y x - so now we observe when there's a number in front of an algebraic expression you have to multiply all terms with that number a box contains 
,,a red glass balls and B blue glass balls determine the total number of glass balls in such high boxes number of total ass balls in a box was that a plus B number of 
,,total glass balls in five boxes you have to multiply 5 times a plus B then number of red colored balls in a box separately there are a red color glass balls so number of red color balls in a box is a number of red glass balls in five boxes that's five B multiplied by five if you take separately blue ones how many blue ones are there be blue ones for five boxes you get five be blue ones in five boxes so what can you say about this one the total the total is now we can write total is 5 a + 5 
,,B the answer received in either of the two methods should be equal so in this case five times a plus B is equal to 5 a plus 5b now look at this one when you multiply by the constant each term you get this one remove the brackets of the following algebraic expressions now we can use that knowledge you gain from the previous two questions there's a number in front this is a minus B is the algebraic expression so what you do multiply the first term as shown by the first arrow so this is the first arrow multiply this value here 3 times a 3 and then multiply the second term as shown by the second arrow I'll put numbers this is one red one pink one is 1 and 
,,the other color I'll take blue so this one multiply this one that's two three times minus B minus 3b now we'll follow that multiply and give me the answer this one with this you get 5x this one with this five times minus y minus five now try first this one seven times m 7m then this one seven times n plus seven ten times P 10 P 
,,plus 10 times Q 10 Q here the arrows are used to show the order to multiply so here always first one we can take first one and this is the SEC and why remove the brackets using arrows now now you can do that I mean there's a number in front of the algebraic expression you have to multiply all terms in the algebraic expression inside the bracket by the outside number yes with this this with this 3 into X 3 X 3 into 2 y + 6 1 now do this 1 7 into a 7 a 7 into minus 4 B that means minus 28 eleven times tu-22m 11 times n 11 4 times 3 P 4 times 3 12 P 4 times minus 2q so that's minus 8q this one 6 times X 6 X 6 times minus 11 by minus 66 1 8 times 3 24h 8 x k8 now look at this one you get three terms but same thing you have to multiply each and every term by the outside number this one three times five a 15 a three times to be six be three times c plus 3 C now do that four times X for X for x - y - y 4 times 7 that's + 28 8 times 2 16 a 8 times 7 56 be 8 times C that's 8 say look 
,,at this one 2 times X - x - x - 7 y minus 14y 2 times 3 z 6z 4 times P 4 P 4 times minus 3q - 12 Q 4 times 2r 8 11 times M 11 M 11 times 3 n 33 and 11 times 2 11 times 2 22 with l22 multiplying an algebraic expression by a negative number so now there's a negative number in front so we'll practice first with negative minus 3 times a minus 3 minus 3 times B minus 3 B negative into positive always you get a negative answer negative 5 times X negative 5x negative 5 into negative Y now negative into negative positive plus 5 minus 1 into 3 minus 3 minus 1 into minus 2 B plus 2 B minus into plus minus and here 5 times 2 10 2 times 2 4 that's plus because minus into minus plus and you get B here 2 times 7 here - into plus minus 14 C now you know how to multiply so plus into plus plus plus into minus minus minus into plus minus and minus into minus plus now we'll remove the brackets so you need to first multiply the first one when this number minus 3 a minus 3 times B minus 3b minus 
,,5 X and here so minus 5x minus 5 minus y you get plus 5i we did that minus 3 a and here minus 3 a you get here - nothing means 1 so this is like 1 minus 1 into 3 a minus 3 minus 1 into minus 2 B that's plus 2b this one this one minus 2 times 3 a what's the value minus 2 times 3a minus 6a this one - two - 2b plus 4b and here - two times seven you get minus 14c remove the brackets now so use arrows to multiply minus 3x minus - plus 6y this one when you multiply minus - plus 3 times 2 6 minus 
,,3 times minus 7 plus 20 months what this one you have to multiply all three terms minus 5 a minus - plus 5 times 4 20 get be your minus 5 times C minus 5 see this one multiply minus 8 times a minus 8 a - eight - seven be multiplication + 56 8 times 7 56 B question number 5 - 7 into minus X plus 7 X minus 7 into 2 y minus 14y - 7 into minus c plus 7z here minus 11 times 2 X minus 22 X minus 11 times -3 plus 33 yeah do all these multiplications try 4 times X 4 X 4 times minus 7y minus 28 y 4 
,,times 5 20 minus 3 times a minus 3 minus minus plus 21 B minus in 2 plus minus 24 6 here minus 11 times 2 minus 22 X here minus minus plus 11 times 3 plus 33 Y here 
,,you get minus 22 this one multiply minus 6 times 2 minus 12 minus 6 minus 7 plus 42 and minus 6 and minus 5 plus 13 this one minus 10 into minus 3 plus 30 minus 10 times chobe - 20 B and minus 10 times sake - 10 see what about this one - 4 times 3 H minus 12 which minus 4 times minus 4 plus 16 K minus 4 times minus 4 plus 60 now we're do multiplying an algebraic term by another algebraic term earlier we multiply by a constant now multiplying by an algebraic term 3x + 4 y how we multiply 3x 
,,times 4 1 so what we do we multiply that numbers first 3 times 4 12 and then x + y so without writing we can write without writing multiplication sign 12x what this 
,,one multiplication 7b into foil we can multiply separately the number 7 times 4 and then be a 7 times 4 28 be a it is better to write down then letters in order 28 a B but this is not wrong VA is okay but it's better it is good to write the letters in English at alphabetical order this 1 minus 3 by minus 5 X so we can multiply minus 3 and minus 5 first and then Y and X minus 3 times minus 5 plus 15 y X you can write 15 X Y to a times 7 B now we'll multiply at once 2 times 7 14 a into B a B 
,,you can write at once 3 X into 5 y 3 times 5 15 X into y X Y now there's a bracket minus sign minus 7 times 3 minus 21 a times B a B this one Phi times -3 minus 15 M times n m in here minus 4 times minus 3 plus 12 a and B you can write a B for x minus seven minus twenty eight Y into X Y X or what's the better one x1 multiplication of an algebraic expression by an algebraic term find the area of the following two rectangles separately so what's the area of the rectangle this one is length into breadth or length into width so area of the rectangle is any times X so what's that the X what's the area of the other rectangle length is B width or break is X B times X VX sum of areas you can just add it a X plus B X now when you combine the two rectangles now you are getting a big rectangle two rectangles are merged in the above diagram what's the length of this rectangle length is a here B here a plus B what's the area of the rectangle now length is a plus B and the with operate is 
,,X so X into a plus B as same rectangles are merged areas are equal now what's the area we got before a X plus B X so we can write a X plus B X is same as X into a plus B now sick how do you get this one so when you multiply the expression here can you see you get a X plus B X it is required to multiply all the terms inside brackets given by the outside term remove the brackets using arrows first one is this second one is this a 2 X a X a into - why - a why B into X BX be in 2 - 3 y - 3 B by C into a see a or a see C into 7 B 7 BC so here you can write AC as well is C + 7 BC when you remove brackets using an arrow first draw an arrow and write it then draw the next arrow and write it we'll do that separately X into a exhale Oh a X X into minus B minus BX X into 2 C 2 CX of XE y into p YP y into 2q minus 2 Q minus 2 y qi qi y into our are Y now try into p a p a into 3 q 3 a key a into for our for a 2 a into X 2x - 3 y that is -6 a why this 1 3 b into m 3b 3b into 4 12 B 5 a into 2 X 10 X 5 a into minus 3y minus 15 a why here - -5 a into z5 a 0 minus 3 into X minus 3 X minus into - now you get plus 6 a 1 plus 6 a expand brackets without using arrows no will do without arrows 3p into x 3p x 3p into minus 2 y minus 6 P for a into 2 where 8 a 4 into minus 3n minus 12 a in this one minus 4 into X minus 4 a X minus 4 times minus 3/12 a y minus 11 8 into 2 B minus 22 a be minus 11 a into minus 3 C you get plus 33 a see this one 7 a mintue l 7m n 7m into 428 look at this diagram area of the entire rectangle length is X with this a so what's the area a times X shaded area now can you see this square with length a a into a or we can write a square area of the unshaded part so you have to subtract total area that's a X minus the shaded area e squared sum of two algebraic expressions when you are adding you have to consider like terms so like terms only you can add or subtract when you consider these two terms what can you do you can add a terms with a 2a and 
,,3a you can add and then 3b and 5b separately so what do you get 5a + 5 + 3 8 at the time of addition or subtraction you have to add or subtract the like terms remove brackets and simplify taking like terms so first you have to multiply and then simplify here without arrows we'll do 2 times X 2 X 2 times y - 1 and then you have to add this 3x so I'd like terms 2x + 3 X you get 5x + 2 y right as it is here five times a five wave hi x minus B 5 B and plus seven B is there five way you can add 
,,separately yeah - five plus seven what's the value plus two so take the difference and put the sign of the bigger number plus two that's me here multiply by 4 8 X 4 
,,times y 4y now what are the like terms 8 XL minus 5x that's 3x plus 4 here you have to multiply both these terms here 3 times X 3 X 3 times y 3 by here 2 times X 2 X 2 times y 2 now add the like terms 3x + 2 X you get 5 X 3 y + 2 y you get high five do it separately 2 times a 2 a 2 times -3 b -6 b plus 5 times a highway by x - Oh Big Ten now I'd like terms - and five seven that's seven minus six and ten take the difference + OB this one seven times - 14 X 7 times y 7y this one three times X minus three x + -3 y add the like terms 14 -3 11 X 7 - 3 + 4 y this one 3 x - 6 a 3 times 5 15 b + 7 e + 10 B what are the like terms a terms 6 + 7:30 15 minus 10 plus 5 so 5 b minus 5 times 7 -35 a minus 5 times -3 plus 15 plus 40 a now like terms add 40 - 35 5 a + 15 subtraction of two algebraic expressions you have to do the same thing right the first algebraic expression in brackets right the second algebraic expression in another brackets remove both brackets and simplify three-year you nothing means just multiply by one yeah - is there so that means this is minus 1 multiplied by minus 1 minus 1 times a minus a minus 1 times minus 2 B you get plus 2 B now like terms added 3 and minus a 2 a 4 B plus 2 B you get 6 this one subtract this from this so that means you have to write this one first 12x plus 7 1 so here just multiply by one 12x plus 7 1 minus this means open brackets with minus 1 minus 1 times 7 minus 7x minus 1 times minus 2 plus 2 I like terms you get 12 minus 7 5 x 7 + 2 9 5 subtract 2x minus 3 from this so from means first this one so 6x + 7 when there's a minus sign change the sign minus 2x and minus minus becomes plus 3 like term 6 and minus 2 4 X 7 + 3 that's 10 subtract this value from this so first you write here so 3p plus 8q - open brackets with minus 1 - P last - q + + 7 3 
,,p + - b - p8 q + 2 Q thank you and our terms you get only this one so that's 7 simplify so that here multiply and first open brackets and then simplify 4 times a 4 4 times -3 minus 12 minus 2 times a minus 2 a minus 2 x - 7 + 14 now like terms that for a and minus 2 a 2 a minus 12 and plus 14 you get plus 2 open brackets first 5x - 5 minus 3 times X minus 3 X minus 3 and minus 2 you get 6 y 5x + 3 X 2 X - 5 I + + 6 Y you get Y this one has a minus 2 in front so when you are multiplying be careful - 2 times 3 - 6 Z minus 2 and minus plus plus times foil the Savoy here you get minus 8b add like terms minus 6a + 4 you get minus 2 a 4 B and minus a 2 B minus 4 B this one Phi P into 2 Q 10 PQ or QP 5 P into 4 20 P here - 3 P into Q minus 3 P Q minus 3 P into 2 minus 6 peace now these are two like terms 10 P Q minus 3 P Q you get 7 PQ 20 P minus 6 P you get plus 14 substituting the values in the edge break expression so now we will see how we can find out the expression with substituting values so what's the first one determine the value of 5 a plus 4 when a equals 3 so substitute a equals 3 there so what happens five times three plus four so 
,,what's five times three 15 15 plus four you get 19 look at this expression seven A plus 2 B now you get two letters so substitute these two values equals three and B equals three so 7 M plus 2 B is the expression so we'll substitute 7 times is 3 7 times 3 plus 2 times B equals 3 so 7 times 3 21 2 times 3 6 21 plus 6 27 look at this one now you get three unknown letters 5 a 2 B 7 C values are given a equals 5 B equals 3 and C equals -2 substitute 5 into a is 5 2 times 3 and say x minus 2 so 
,,minus 7 x minus 2 5 times 5 25 minus 2 times 3 minus 6 and here minus minus becomes positive seven times 2 plus 14 now simplify 25 minus 6 you get 19 19 plus 14 33 determine the value of the following expressions when x equals 2 and y equals minus 3 we substitute 8 times X is 2 y equals minus 3/8 times 2 16 5 times minus 3 minus 15 16 minus 15 you get 1 here 12 times 2 minus 3 times minus 3 12 times 2 24 minus into minus plus 2 so 3 times 3 9 9 plus 4 13 so you get 33 now look at this one so same values you have to plug what are the values x equals 2 and y equals -3 9 mean 2 2 plus XY means X into y so 2 into minus 3 y equals minus 3 9 times 2 18 minus 6 you get 12 2 times X X is 2 5 times minus 3 plus 11 2 times 2 4 minus 15 plus 11 so 4 minus 15 you get minus 11 minus 11 and plus 11 you get 0 this one 4 times X 
,,X is 2 2 times minus 3 plus 8 4 times 2 8 minus 6 plus 8 8 minus 6 2 2 plus 8 10 here X is 2 y is minus 3 plus 2 minus 7 times minus 3 2 times minus 3 minus 6 here plus 2 is they are already according to Bodnar's you have to multiply first minus into minus plus 21 minus 6 plus 2 minus 4 minus 4 plus 21 you get 17 determine the value of the following algebraic expressions when a equals 3 and B equals 5 so what you do first first we'll open brackets and then substitute 3 times 2 6 6 8 3 times 3 you get 9 so 9 B now substitute after you multiply now substitute the value 6 times 3 9 times 5 because B equals 5 and a equals 3 6 times 3 18 9 times 5 45 what's the addition 63 in this one you have given the same question we'll try in a different way earlier we multiplied and then simplify now we'll do we'll simplify inside brackets and then multiply by three so three is there two times a is 3 B equals 5 now simplify inside 3 times 2 6 3 times 5 15 3 times 6 plus 15 21 now multiply 3 and 21 3 times 1 3 3 times 2 6 so you are getting the same answer get the same as if simplify inside brackets or without removing bracket so you can do any method first you can multiply and simplify and then substitute or simplify inside the brackets and then multiply by the outside number remove the brackets and substitute the values so first remove the brackets 7 a plus 14 B substitute the values 7 times 3 plus 14 times 5 say 1 times 3 21 here 5 times 425 times 1 5 and 7 add it you get 91 
,,this one 4 times 3 12 a and 8 B substitute the values of 12 times 3 minus 8 times fun now simplify 12 times 3 36 8 times 5 40 36 minus 40 you get minus here 11 times 2 22 a plus 11b so 22 times a 3 because 566 plus 55 hundred twenty-one this one 9 times 3 27 a 9 x -2 18 B now multiply 27 times 3 and 18 times fun 3 times 7 21 two remaining 3 times 2 6 plus 2 81 minus 5 times 8 44 remaining so you get 90 81 minus 90 you get minus 9 determine the value when a equals 3 B equals -2 and C equals 
,,1 so just substitute the values 2 times 3 7 x minus 2 make sure you put brackets when you get negative numbers 3 times 1/6 minus minus plus 14 plus 3 so 6 plus 3 9 9 plus 14 23 this one 5 times 3/2 x minus 2 and 4 into 1 15 minus 4 plus 4 minus 4 plus 4 get canceled out you get 15 11 x equals 3 B equals -2 and C equals 1 according to what must do the multiplication first 11 times 3 33 minus 2 times minus 2 plus 4 and you get minus 3/4 minus 3/1 33 plus 130 in this one first simplify and then substitute values of the following algebraic expressions when a equals 5 because 3 and C equals -2 so you have given this expression so what you do first open brackets 2 where 2 B 3 B 3 C then what you do simplify the terms add the like terms to a you have to write as it is 2b and 3b becomes Phi B and 3c here now substitute the values equals 5 B equals 3 and C equals -2 2 times 5 10 5 times 3 15 minus 60 so but you get 10 minus 6 4 4 plus 15 19 this one first open brackets 3 a 3 times minus B minus 3 B 4 times B 4 B 4 times C minus 4 C here because there's a negative sign now I'd like terms 3-year you can't simplify minus 3 and plus 4 that's plus 1 B or B minus 4 C now substitute the values 3 a means multiplication 3 times a 3 times 5 B is 3 4 times minus 2 first multiplication according to but must 5 times 3 15 minus 4 minus 2 plus 8 so you get 8 plus 3 11 11 and 15 you get 26 this one first open brackets 3a plus 3b here to be and -2 C 5 C 5 a so each one you have to multiply by the outside number now like terms 3a and 5a 8 a 3 B and plus 2 B 5 B -2 C + + 5 C plus 3 C now multiply 8 times a what's the value for a a 5 3 minus 2 I'll write down here equals 5 B equals minus 3 B is 3 and C equals -2 C equals -2 so a is 5 B 3 C minus 2 8 times 5 14 15 here and -6 15 minus 6 you get 9 9 plus 40 49 this one 7 a 7 B minus 7 C and then plus 2a minus 2b minus 2 C when you multiply by 2 add like terms 7 + + 2 9 e 7 B and minus 2b + 5 b minus 7 and minus 2 minus 9 see now my tip life is five B's tricky and C is minus 2/9 times 5 45 five times three 15 and minus minus becomes plus nine times two eighteen now add all together 1018 one remaining five six seven so 78 is the answer this one you get fractions but same procedure just substitute the values for a eight over be sixteen over C so now substitute equals 2 so 4 over 2 8 / BBS for 16 over C C is 8 now you have to simplify first 4 divide by 2 you get 2 8 divided by 4 you get 2 16 divided by 8 you get 2 2 + 2 + 2 6 this one substitute the values a equals 2 2 divided by 2 B is 4 4 divided by 4 C equals 8 8 divided by 8 simplify division first 2 divided by 2 is 1 4 divided by 4 is 1 8 divided by 8 is 1 1 plus 1 plus 1 you get 3 this one substitute a B means a times B 2 times 4 plus BC means B times that's 4 times C means 8 minus C times a C is 8 and a equals to 8 32 16 so 32 minus 16 is 16 16 and 8 addition you get 24 now we will look at remove exercise complete the table given below algebraic expression is given unknown term of the algebraic expression coefficient of the unknown term terms of the algebraic expression and final column is mathematical operations in the order they appear in the algebraic expression so first of all what's the unknown letter X coefficient is the number in front of the letter that's three and these are called algebraic terms and what is the operation plus and multiplication is three times X now we look at the next one what's the letter here Y what's the coefficient of that term to what are the algebraic terms to Y and 4 and what's the operation first multiplication and then addition next one what's the algebraic letter B coefficient 4 and terms for P and minus hundred and the operation for times P that means multiply and then subtract this one P is the letter coefficient nothing means one terms PN minus 10 and what are the operations used 1 times P times and then - what's the later here in coefficient is + 3 terms 3 n n minus 7 and operation first multiply and then subtract question number two the length of a table is two meters more than its breadth write an algebraic expression for the length of the table by taking its breath as V when you take this table B is the bread length is 2 meters more than its brick so what's the expression B plus 2 back to write

,,only is minus 2 4 times 8 32 minus minus becomes plus 20 minus 20 bar 8 times 3 24 minus 16 now you can subtract here 20 minus 21 minus 132 minus 1 31 31 plus 24 you get 55 55 minus 16 30 not so the answer is 39 so we covered all theory in algebraic expressions so what are the things we did when multiply an algebraic expression 
,,by a number each term of the algebraic expression needs to be multiplied by the number that is the coefficient of each algebraic term should be multiplied by the given number and simplify so make sure that you multiply by the coefficient when multiplying an algebraic term by an algebraic term there our coefficients are much like first and then the unknowns are multiplied when multiplying an algebraic expression by an algebraic term every algebraic term of the algebraic expression needs to be multiplied by the given algebraic term by substituting values for the unknown terms of an algebraic expression we obtain a numerical value for the algebraic expression so when you are simplifying either you can simplify brackets first and then multiply or expand brackets and then substitute the values so practice all these questions examples and exercise and thorough with algebraic expressions

Number Partens,TsFLRXw5lKY,hello grade 8 children today I'm here to teach you chapter 3 in your textbook that's angles this is a geometry lesson we'll see what are the basics related to angers what is an angle so angle is formed by two line segments from one center point so if we take this point oh oh a OB are the two lines so here we can say Oh a and OB 
,,pass from the center point oh oh is the vertex point we call this is the vertex point and it is fixed and Oh a and OB ah raise angle is what is the angle form we can write two ways we can start from a a OB so this is how we write a OB and we put a hatch above representing that o is the angle or we can start from the other side B or a so we can write like this or if it's one angle we can write down just a anger this is also possible so when you take this diagram you get two line segments and a fixed point so we can define angle as a rotation so how we can define an angle as a rotation rotation of a line segment what is the line if you take this one Oh a is the line segment around the point oh it's called the anger so when you rotate here to here you get an anger so this is the angle created and this is clockwise we are rotating clockwise from a units off angles what are the measurements we use we used degrees how we represent degrees so we put a small 0 so here superscript of 
,,0 so if this is 30 degrees we put 30 and put a small 0 here so this means 30 degrees so you need tough measurement used for measuring and angle is decrease symbol for degrees is a small circle in the superscript so if you take the circle the entire circle so how many degrees is that so 360 so entire circle is recognized as 360 degrees so here can you see the degree sign 360 degrees starting angle at always zero because this is not rotating so here starting angle is zero degrees now we'll rotate half of a circle so this is the fixed line and starting from the fixed point or 1/4 of a circle we know the full circle is 360 so 360 and 1/4 of that what's the angle you'll get 90 degrees so this is 90 degrees normally we represent this angle as ur a square like this so that means this is 90 degrees then rotation of half of a circle so here to here is half of 360 so you get 180 degrees what about this one 3/4 so when you divide the circle into 4 parts this is starting from here 3/4 of a circle full circle is 360 3/4 of that 3/4 of 360 what's the value for x this 990 times 3 270 so this is 270 decrease so what are the types of angles that we need 
,,to learn so first one is acute angles what is that cute angle so the angle in between 0 and 90 degrees so less than 90 degrees and above 0 degrees is called acute angle right angle so right angle is 90 degrees so we represent using a square like this then obtuse means the angle is more than 90 degrees so here if this is 90 degrees this is more than 90 degrees and less than 180 degrees so we call it as obtuse angles what is straight angle means if the angle is 180 and this is a straight line so GFP is a straight line if it's a straight line we call this angle is a straight angle 180 degrees and you need to know another type of angle that's reflex angle 
,,reflex angle is angle above 180 so this is 180 line above 180 and below 360 so this is the 360 degree line so you can get either this type of angle oh yeah more than 270 also possible so this is up to here that's 270 so this angle is more than 270 as well so these two are called reflex angles or cheese and angles what are just and angles so angles e OB and b or c or c OB b or c adjacent angles in the above diagram so what are the properties in adjacent angles common arm is there so two these two angles this is the common arm one fixed line is there so that's Oh big you need to get a common vertex point so this is the vertex file so what's the vertex here Oh Oh vertex point and angle situated in opposite sides of the common so common arm is here so this sandal is anti-clockwise and this angle is clockwise so angle 
,,situated bow in both sides so these are the three properties satisfied for adjacent angles now identify in this diagram what are adjacent angles look at this o P lie when you take Opie line that's the common arm from here there's an anger anti-clockwise what's the angle P o our reflex angle P you are this is the reflex angle Modell's 180 and less than 360 and what's the other angle this is clockwise measured this angle P or Q so P or Q and P or our reflex angle ah adjacent angles with common arm o P so what's the fixed point here or is the vertex point look at this one identify what's the common arm and what are the two adjacent angles so when you look at this diagram we can see this is the common arm o our common arm and what are the two angles from this this is one q or r QR or you can write R Rho Q and what's the other one this one so we can write P or our reflex angle so these are the two adjacent angles in this diagram what's the common now we can see common arm is o Q and what are the two angles this one here measured anti-clockwise p or q p oq' angle and what's the other angle Q or are these are adjacent angles with common arm or 
,,Q and what's the vertex point vertex point is o what are complementary angles two pairs of adjacent angles add up to 90 degrees we call those are complementary angle now take a look at these two this angle is 60 degrees and this is 30 degrees so what is 60 degree angle plus 30 degree angle you get 90 degree so the sum is 90 degree so we can say a Obi angle and P or a angle ah complementary angles because the sum of the two angles is equal to 90 degrees write down the complementary angle to 
,,the given angles thirty's there how you find out the other girl 90-30 that's 60 degrees 50 if one angle is 50 what's the other complementary angle you subtract 50 from 90 you get 40 degrees 85 90 minus 85 that's 5 degrees 24 90 minus 24 you get 66 degrees 36 90 minus 36 but you get you get 54 90 minus 36 and what about 3 degrees 90 minus 3 degrees you get 87 so these are complementary angles look at this one ninety degrees and zero are not complementary angles zero angle does not exist so don't take 90 and zero those are not complementary angles complementary adjacent angles so complementary means add up to 90 what are adjacent angles adjacent angles you need to have a fixed point vertex point comma Nam and the two angles to ated on both sides of the common Nam now look at this diagram you can see when you add a abd angle and DBC angle what's the sum this angle and this angle you can see is 90 degrees so that means these two angles are complementary now why this is complementary adjacent angles so when you take this diagram this is the common arm and this is the vertex point and this angle measured this way anti-clockwise this angle measured clockwise so the two angles on both sides of the common are so these are complementary adjacent angles supplementary adjacent angles supplementary means the sum of two angles add up to 180 now look at these two C B a or ABC and abd so what are the two angles 110 l70 so when you add it you're getting hundred eighty so we call two angles equal to 180 are supplementary angles and these are also adjacent when you take this common arm a B so when you take this slide on top of this line you're getting an angle like this so this is the BD lie so you can see Oh a is the common ah and this angle measured anti-clockwise this angle measured clockwise and this is the fixed point B so two angles equal to 180 are the supplementary angles and you can say a b c and a BD we are supplementary adjacent angles because when you take it together you get adjacent angles as well write down the supplementary angle to the given angles so what's the condition the sum is equal to 180 if 40 is the angle 180 minus 40 is the other supplementary angles that's 140 8500 80-85 mercy angle 5 and 1 remaining so that's 995 60 degrees 180 minus 60 that's 120 degrees 75 watts the supplementary angle 180 minus 75 you get Conrad 5 117 so subtract 117 from 180 63 degrees 29 you get all these are angles this is 29 so subtract you get one here and here subtract from 181 there and this is three so five 151 so these are the supplementary angles so what are supplementary angles the angle sum is 180 supplementary adjacent angles means we did that before so the sum is 180 as well as the two angles are adjacent now look at this guy Group abd is haunted DBC is 70 so when you add it you get 180 decrease so these are supplementary adjacent angles because when you take this is the common arm BD and the common vertex vertex is B and 
,,the two angles measured both sides those are the three properties for an adjacent angle now we look at what our vertically opposite angles now look at this one a B is a lie and C D is another line straight lines so intersect these two lines at O this is the intersection point so you get four angles there one two three four four 
,,angles and here's shaded once what are shaded ones e OC and the other one B OD a pair of vertically opposite angles so here this is one angle and this is the other vertically opposite angles now when you look at other way around this is also vertically opposite angle so what are the other unshaded Part A or D aug angle and be your C angle these are another pair of vertically opposite angles so how we get vertically opposite angles when you get any two straight lines intersecting each other 
,,now two lines are there pql SR so identify a pair of vertically opposite angles in the above diagram we can say this and this our vertically opposite angle so here P o R and s o Q angles are vertically opposite angles what are the other two this angle with this angle so you can write P o s angel' and Q o our angle is also vertically opposite angles so you get two pairs of vertically opposite angles now one angle is given eighty degrees a OD anger so what's a or C angle we know C D is a straight line so what's the angle so if this is straight line this is a straight angle 180 so 180 minus 80 a OC angle is 100 a or D angle is 80 and also this is a straight line a B is a straight line so what's this angle this angle that's B or D angle B your J angle is also 180 so I can write a OD angle plus D B or D angle it's 180 
,,so this is also 100 degrees so this is hundred that's B oh t angle so I can write B or D angle is hundred degrees now look at carefully this and this what can you say a oh D that's a or c a.o c and b or g angles we know that these are vertically opposite angles and also they are equal so remember the two vertically opposite angles now I can write a Oh C and B or D vertically opposite angles are equal similarly what can you say about the other one this is 80 this is also 80 so we found out this is also 80 so what's that B oh see anger so similarly I can write a OD and be your C angles are equal that's 80 degrees so we can say vertically opposite angles 
,,are equal this diagram identify vertically opposite angles that I equal POS POS is here what's the other vertically opposite angle this one Q or R if you take P or P o R naught P Q R this is P or R P o R is equal to this angle so that's Q or s so these two are vertically opposite angles find the values of a B and C what can you 
,,say about a angle can you see this is a straight line so a is 180 minus 100 because this is a straight angle so what's the answer eighty degrees then what you know about C angle E and C both are equal because those are vertically opposite angles so is 80 that means C is also 80 vertically opposite angles then what about B B and 
,,100 these are two vertically opposite angles so we can say B is also 100 degrees because of vertically opposite angles this diagram find the values of P Q R this is 
,,70 so this is a straight angle so what's be 180 minus 70 that's hundred check so we can write that's because of straight angle then you can write P is equal to R so 
,,this is hundred ten because of vertically opposite angles seventy and Q is also vertically opposite angles so Q is equal to 70 these two are because of vertically opposite angles now we look at angers around a point so the fixed point here is o so when you take from here around this point we know that the sum of angles add up to 360 degrees so here we can write all these angles so what are the angles X Y Z and this sandal is a all these angles add up to 360 degrees so when you get a point make sure that the sum of angles add up to 360 degrees find a and B so this is the fixed point so this is also around a point so how can we find out a now when you take this line this is a straight line this is 90 given here to here straight angle here to here straight angle because this is a straight line so what's a is 180 minus 90 degrees because this is given as 90 degrees so that's 90 but we know the angles around a point is 360 so what's big B is 360 minus all three angles so here what are the three angles 90 a is 90 and 100 so when you add it you get 280 degrees 280 degrees is the other three angles so what is B 360 minus 280 so what's the value 
,,8 so B is 80 degrees look at this one this is a point so we can consider angles around a point to find out the value of a 60 plus 80 plus 80 what's the sum 220 and all the angles add up to 360 so what's a it is 360 minus 220 what's the answer answer is hundred forty degrees find the value of x here what can you say about this one this is a straight line so what's this angle straight angle so X plus X plus X is 180 because of straight angle then X plus X plus X is 3x is 180 divided by three 
,,you get the value of x so x equals 60 degrees you have given several angles and identify types of angles so acute means the angle less than 90 degrees 30 degrees is 
,,then an acute angle what are the other angles less than 90 55 68 84 forty-eight loser accurate right angle means 90-degree angle obtuse obtuse means more than 90 less than hundred eighty degrees hundred twenty hundred forty 170 hundred twelve what is less than hundred eighty visa more than 180 straight angle means equals two hundred and eighty so I can take 180 degree n then what are reflex angles reflex angles are more than 180 and less than 360 so 270 195 200 and 318 those are the reflex 
,,angles you have given several angles and you are asked to write down pair of complementary angles complementary means the sum add up to 90 degrees what are the angles add up to 90 degrees look at 70 and 20 at up to 90 degrees so you can write a b c and k l so these are complementary angles add up to 90 degrees and write down the pair of supplementary angles what are supplementary means add up to 180 this sand that's 150 plus 30 you get 180 so x y z and c d e are supplementary angles because these are add up 280 identify the type of angles so what is this angle less than 90 degrees acute angle this one more than 90 degrees obtuse this one also less than 90 degrees acute and we look at some more angles this is more than 90 degrees less than 180 no twos angle this one yeah 90 degrees so what you call for 90 degrees right angle this one 180 straight angle this one more than 180 what you call that reflex this is also more than 180 so that's also reflex this is 90 degrees so what is 90 means right angle this is two straight lines intersect at one point so what are these two vertically opposite angles find X in this diagram we know this is a straight line and this is add up to 180 so 2x plus X plus 60 is hundred eighty now take 60 to the other side that means subtract first we'll add these two to X and X becomes 3x and subtract 60 from both sides you get 3x equals 180 minus 60 degrees left 180 minus 60 means 123 X 620 means divide this by 3 you get x equals 40 degrees I'm glad 20 divided by 3 so X is 40 degrees find X in this diagram this is mentioned this is 90 degrees so 2x plus x equals 90 degrees what are those complementary 
,,2 X plus X is 3x equals 90 degrees divide this by 3 you get x equals 30 90 divided by 3 find ABC can you see this one and this one vertically opposite angle so a equals 85 you can write down what the reason vertically opposite angles then B equals what when you take this straight line B equals 180 minus 85 so B equals 180 minus 
,,85 because of straight angle so subtract you get 5 and 9 so 95 is the B value now what is C B and C are vertically opposite angles so we can say see also 95 because 
,,of vertically opposite angles a bee is a straight line find ABC so I'll put a bee here a bee is a straight line fine ABC now when you take this three angles a plus 3a plus two ways hundred eighty that's a straight angle so add it together 3 + 2 5 + 1 this becomes 6 8 equals 180 when you divide by 6 you can get there a value so you get a equals 30 degrees now we'll look at this one this side lower side here what can you say about 4 a and B that's also straight angles so before that we'll find out for a is 34 times 30 is 4 that's 120 degrees now what can you say about these two angles these are straight angles so for a and B straight angles so 180 minus 
,,4 is equal to B so you can't just subtract 180 minus 120 that's 60 degrees because these two are straight angles look at this one find y when x equals hundred check 
,,so this is given hundred and ten what's the Y value we know this is straight line so Y is hundred eighty minus hundred check so that's 70 degrees find y when x equals 150 if this is 150 what's the relationship 180 minus 150 is why so that becomes thirty and then here find X when y equals forty same thing happens X is equal to again 180 minus the Y value now why is for T you get hundred forty degrees find X when y equals fifty these two are straight angles so you can subtract from 180 so you get 130 there this one this is a fixed point what's 50 and 30 and you shown is 80 this is 80 80 plus two x two x three X is equal to write it here these three angles add up to two x two x three exist have an X and this is equal to what is this 180 degrees so all together is 7x and this is 50 and 30 80 all together what's equal 
,,to this is equal to hundred eighty or 360 this is a point 360 degrees so angle at a point angle around a point so what is 7x 360 minus 80 degrees so you can subtract you get 280 so 7x equals 280 so what's what's the value divided by 7 to get the x value so X is equal to 40 degrees so make sure this is a point so angle sum of a point is 360 look at this one it's given a OD AOC b OC the sum is 260 find the values of all four angles so what's this Stanga BOJ angle so b OD angle is 360 it's minus 260 because this is a point and sum of angles around a point is 360 so 360 minus 260 you get hundred decrease that's for B or D then what can you say B or D angle and this angle AOC angle both are equal vertically opposite angles so you can write a OC is equal to 100 degrees so this is hundred this is hundred then how can you find out be your C anger we know a B is a straight line this is 100 so this becomes 180 minus 100 that's 80 degrees now Bo say is 80 means a OD is also 80 degrees that's vertically opposite angles look at this one a B and C D are straight lines intersect at oh this is a fixed point find the value of x what can you say about this angle and this angle these two are equal vertically opposite angles so X and X 2x is equal to 80 degrees so how we find out X divide by 2 so X is equal to 40 degrees find a from this diagram we can first add 60 and 40 is 100 hundred degrees so for a is what this is a straight angle so for a equals 180 minus 100 that's 80 degrees so how you find out a divided by 4 so a equals 20 degrees look at this diagram and find out what's the value of a this is a point so we can add all these angles add up to 360 so 5 + 2 7 7 + 3 10 10 plus 2 12 a is 360 so what's a divided by a equals 30 decrease find X here this is a straight angle X plus 30 plus X plus 20 and 
,,60 and up to 180 now I'd like terms x + X becomes 2 X 30 plus 20 50 50 plus 60 hundred ten now how we find out X so 2x equals subtract 180 from subtract 110 from 180 you get 70 degrees is 2x divide by 2 what you get X is equal to 35 70 divided by 2 is 35 find ABC PQR all these angles this is a straight angle so a is 180 minus 70 so hundred check what's B P is 70 because this and this both are vertically opposite angles B is 70 vertically opposite angles see a and C vertically opposite angles so C is equal to 110 that's vertical same reason this side this is also another point two straight lines are there so straight away you can write P equals 180 minus 150 that's 30 degrees because of straight angle then q q 150 both are vertically opposite angles so Q is 150 vertically opposite angles and what's our R and P both are equal those are vertically opposite angles so our a same as P that's 30 degrees the reason is the same vertically opposite angles a B and C D are straight lines find ABC this is 90 degrees so what's 90 plus 60 on Brad 50 so what's a because this is a straight angle a is 180 minus 150 that's 30 degrees so what's the reason straight angle what's the B value we is 60 degrees what's the reason vertically opposite angles then let's see what can you say about si si is these two lines so this and this a with 90 vota vertically opposite angles so a plus 90 so 90 plus 30 you get 120 vertically opposite angles now we will look at the review exercise so we covered about obtuse acute reflex angles and complementary and what is supplementary angles and vertically opposite angles so now we will see how we can apply those properties in the exercises look at the first question copy the two groups a and B given below and join them appropriately 135 which type of angle it says obtuse angle 90 is right angle 180 is a straight angle 35 is acute angle 245 is reflex angle more than 180 and 990 also reflex angle and 280 also reflex angles by considering the given figure find the magnitude of each of the angles given below and cried the type of each angle a OB a OB is 90 degrees what's the anchor right angle C or D C 
,,OD given that that's 40 degrees that's a acute angle B OD which one is B OD b o T that's also 90 degrees that's a right angle and B or C this angle so how can we find out vo C 90 minus 40 90 minus 40 is 50 degrees so that's an acute angle AOC 90 Plus this so this is 50 we found so a oh C is equal to 90 plus 50 so what is ninety 
,,plus fifteen hundred forty degrees a OD so a OD is a straight line so 180 that's straight angle look at this one draw the following angles using a protractor and name them so first one is PQ R so what we do we take the ruler and draw a straight line okay and then what we do we take a point P we take the point Q because you have 
,,to draw the angle PQR now take the protractor what we do we keep it on top of the point Q and measure the angle so what's the angle sixty degrees from here anti-clockwise we can mark the point so this is the point here 60 degrees so you can move this and draw the line passes through this point and this point so I can draw the line like this so that's P QR 60 degree angle so this is 60 degrees now look at this one ABC is 90 degrees so how we draw the 90 degree angle draw a line and then you 
,,can mark the angle here B angle so we'll take any point B now we can measure 90 degrees so take the ruler not the ruler protractor and keep the protractor on top of 
,,point B and Misha here you have to keep it properly this one on top of this line so something like this yes still not okay so here make sure that you keep them okay 
,,so here now it's correct so keep on top of the line now mark the point 90 degrees from here so this is the mark and you can draw the line now take the ruler connect 
,,this point and this point that's 90 degree and so this is 90 degree angle so you need to label this this is a B C so ABC is 90 degrees 130 degrees so what you do take a line and draw the line there and you need to mark a point so we'll take this point is there this so why now we need to measure 130 degrees so take the protractor keep on top of the line and here on this point zero point on Y now from here you have to measure that's hundred thirty so here to here this is 130 mark take the projector away and now you can take the ruler and connect this point with this one then what's the angle XYZ so we can mark this is X Y Z and this is 130 degrees this way is 130 degrees 48 degrees so how we draw 48 so take the ruler and then Mark a point will mark L so this is the point we have to mark that's angle then 48 degrees 
,,take the protractor keep on top of this and mark 48 degrees so 48 is here 40 and in between 50 and here so this is 48 now you can connect these two points with a ruler so mark it and then connect label the two points K and K L M angle is 48 degrees question number four as shown in the figure draw two straight line segments a B and C D such that they intersect each other at Oh make sure the magnitude of each of the angles AOC that's this angle C or B this one and B or G this one and a or D so all four angles we need to mission and write them down what is the value of AOC and c OB with first measured using the protractor take the protractor keep on top of this line and you can measure this part so here in your protractor you can measure from this way as well my one you only from this side so I have to subtract this 
,,value from 180 so 180 minus 140 so here to here is 40 degrees so I can write a or C angle is 40 degrees then boc angle or c OB angle i can measure from here that's 144 you you can measure from both sides zero is here as well as zero is here so look at carefully and measure the correct way so c OB is an obtuse angle that's hundred forty now a OC with measured co b b OD so how do you do B or D B or D is this way so we need to keep the protractor this way so this way and we can measure here to here that's 40 degrees b OD is 40 degrees here to here you can measure so 180 minus 40 or i can get straight away hundred forty-four a OD angle a OG is hundred forty degrees now what is the value of AOC plus Co be these two AOC is 40 degrees C or B is 140 so when you add these two what you get hundred eighty degrees so those two are 180 degrees are the two angles AOC and b OD equal to each other AOC forty B or D is also forty so these two are equal these two I call what are they vertically opposite angles so we can write they are equal example number one calculate the compliment of 38 what is complement means the sum is 90 degrees so complement angle 
,,is 90 minus 38 subtract you get 2 here and fast so 52 degrees is the complement angle if ABC is 48 PQR is 66 KLM is 42 and XYZ is 24 name the pairs of complementary 
,,angles among these angles so complimentary means 90 degrees find out what are the angles add up to 90 look at these two 48 plus 40 to 90 degree so you can say ABC and KL m complementary what is 66 and 24 at dancing 66 and 2490 so those are complementary so you can write P Q R and what's the other one 24 XYZ these also complementary angles example three explain whether the powers of angles given in the figure are supplementary angles so what's the condition for supplementary the angles add up to 180 so we'll check 62 plus 180 underneath so that means a OC + PQ are supplementary look at these 253 and 170 what's the sum 117 so not add up to 180 so you can write not supplementary angles exercise 3.1 copy and complete the complement of 60s but its complement of 60 90 minus 60 degrees supplementary of 60 180 minus 1620 
,,the complement of 75 90 minus 75 so what's the anger 15 degrees supplement of 75 180 minus 75 now so hundred five degrees the complement of 25 is 90 minus 25 it's a 
,,65 degrees supplement of 25 180 minus 25 hundred fifty-five degrees what's the complement of one degree 90 minus 189 degrees what is supplementary of one degrees that's hundred seventy-nine 180 minus one from among the angles ABC PQR KLM BOC mnl TEF select and write down two pairs of complementary angles and two pairs of supplementary angles so with first two complementary angles what are complementary add up to 90 degrees so we can take these two 72 and 80 90 degrees so BOC and ABC what is check 75 with 1575 and 1596 you are so those are complementary now we'll look at supplementary angles so hundred sixty-five and fifty what's the sum 165 and 1580 so supplementary means the angles add up to 180 so you can write k l m and p q r those are supplementary so what is 108 and 7280 so you get em in L angle + 108 and ABC ABC angle so these are supplementary angles question number three according to the figure given here what is the sum of B or C and C EOG first we'll find B or C vo 
,,C is 25 C OG C or D is given 65 so what's the sum add it together you get 10 and 9 so 90 degrees what is the complement of B or C so B or C and C or D are complementary angle so if it's B or C what's the other angle C or C what is the magnitude of a or G what is that a gee is this whole thing 20 plus 25 plus 65 what's the sum hundred tip what is the sum of a ood that's hundred ten and goe 70 so that's hundred eighty degrees what is the supplement of do e do en e yo D add up to 180 means those are supplementary angles so what's the supplement of D or e that's a or T what is the complement of do a D or E so do II what's a compliment 70 is there so 90 minus 70 that's 20 degrees now what is the anger so you need to find out a 20 degree angle that's complement of D or e so what's that 20 degree angle is a or b so you can write this is same as a oh yeah so that's the complement of do a 4 question right two pairs of complementary angles in the given figure complimentary means add up to 90 degrees so we can take this angle so two angles are there CD B angle plus or we can say plus B D anger it's 90 degrees the sum of two angles add up to 90 degrees so those are complementary angles what's the other one we can take here these two a b d angle and DB c angle that's add up to 90 degrees that's also complementary ax the straight line segments a b and c d intersect at oh right four pairs of supplementary angles in the figure supplementary means add up two hundred and eighty 
,,so look at that 80 plus hundred is 180 so i can write c oh a angle and a or d that's 180 because 80 and 100 that's supplementary then when you take other way rock a 
,,OD + d OB also 180 this way also supplementary now when you take C D line D OB angle + b OC angle that's also hundred eighty degrees and the last pair is when you take a beeline be your C angle and see o angle that's also hundred eighty degrees right two pairs of complementary angles according to the information marked in the given figure complementary means add up to 90 degrees so what are those yeah these 2 P X cube angle and q XR that's 90 degrees and also can you see that's why this is 
,,also 90 so we can write Q X R and R X that's also 90 degrees copy these statements in your exercise book and please tick in front of the correct statements and wrong mark in the front of the incorrect statements the complement of an acute angle is an acute angle 90 - a small angle so definitely it's an acute angle so this is correct the complement of an acute angle is an obtuse angle so cannot be more than 90 degrees because complement means 90 degrees so this is wrong the supplement an obtuse angle is an obtuse angle supplement means 180 so obtuse angle is in between 90 and 180 and it cannot be exceed 180 so that's wrong the supplement of an acute angle is an obtuse angle yes because if this is less than 90 180 minus that angle definitely you get an obtuse angle so the supplement of an acute angle is an obtuse angle that's correct example 1 explain whether the pairs of angles denoted by a B in the figures given below are pairs of adjacent angles so what are the conditions for adjacent angles there should be a common arm now look at this one okay Q are common and is there a fixed-point vertex point this is Q and this is r so no common vertex so these two are not adjacent angles so you need to check all three properties to satisfy four adjacent angles explain whether the pairs of angles denoted by a 
,,and B in the figures given below are pairs of adjacent angles yeah common vertex is there that's P is there a common arm here B P P see here a PN PD so no come on um so therefore a and B not adjacent angles example one explain whether the pairs of angles denoted by a B in the figures given below are pairs of adjacent angles so check B is this one and a is here here to here common vertex is o is there a common arm so these two are the lines and here this is the other line okay common arm you can take as Oh a now check whether these two angles on both sides of the way this is also measured this way this is also measured same way so these are not adjacent angles so you can write down measured angles on the same side of a common arm so therefore a and B are not budgets and angles example two in the given figure PR is 
,,a straight line segment find the magnitude of PQ s PQ s PQ R is a straight line so what is PQ s hundred eighty minus 45 because this is a straight angle and subtract 5 so this is 5 335 degrees example 3 find the magnitude of a or P so how we can find this is a straight line a B is a straight line so we can say this is a straight angle so what's the condition for a straight angle that's 180 so 2 X plus 3 X plus 50 degrees is equal to 180 because this is a straight angle 2x and 3x becomes 5x 
,,and take 50 to the other side subtract 50 from both sides you get 5x equals 180 minus 50 that's 130 so divide by 5 you get so X is equal to 5 times 2 10 for 30 that's 6 so 26 degrees exercise 3.2 write whether the pairs of angles marked as a and B in each figure is a pair of adjacent angles so what can you say about this Oh L is common Oh is the vertex point and this angle measured this way this is measured this way so angles on both sides so what can you say a and B are adjacent angles this one what's the common our vertex is okay so P is the vertex here we'll take this is the common ah Oh a not away P a is the common um let this angle measure this way this angle measured this way so on both sides so you can write a UH a and B measured both ways so that means a and B are adjacent triangles this diagram this is a 
,,and this is B here common arm is MX it means the fixed point that's vertex point but to this common arm this is measured same on the same side and be measured on the same side so not adjacent not adjacent angles if PQ is a straight line segments in each figure given below find the magnitude of the angle marked by an initiator so this is a straight line so what's x straight away you can write that's 180 minus 120 60 degrees what's the reason because of straight angle this one PQ is a straight line so what is a a is hundred eighty minus 68 because of straight angle 112 this one PQ is a straight line so what's T 180 minus 95 because of straight angle so 85 decrease when you look at this one how can we find out the X letter P Q is a straight line so you can write 40 plus 90 plus X is 180 40 plus 90 130 so what's X X is 180 minus hundred 30 that's equal to 50 degrees this one PQ is a straight line so we can write E Plus E Plus E is 180 so 3 a equals 180 equals 180 divided by 3 that's 60 degrees question number 3 in the figure if a B is a straight line segment find the magnitude of a og a og is 2x so a B is a straight line so what can you say 
,,about these three angles add up 280 because these three are on a straight line straight to X and X 3 X subtract 90 from both sides you get 3x is 180 minus 90 that's 
,,90 degrees so how can we find out X divided by 3 you get 2x equals 30 degrees so what's a or D D is 2x so 2 times 30 60 degrees PQ is a straight line segment according to the information marked in the figure find the magnitude of P or s POS is 3x so we'll first find X we can see 3x plus 2x plus 80 is 180 degrees because of straight 3x and 2x becomes 5x subtract 80 from both sides you get 100 divided by 5 you get x value is 20 now you have X value what's the P or s Sanga P OS is 3x 3 times 20 that's 60 degrees and part two it says find the magnitude of s o Q so Q is 80 plus 2 times X 2 times 20 so according to Bodmin you have to do multiplication first 
,,2 times 20 is 40 40 plus 80 120 degrees question number five conclude whether p oq' in each of the given figures is a straight line so we'll add NC 130 plus 50 you get 180 that means straight angle so Pete Oh Q or P or Q is a straight line this one we led 139 and 42 181 so that's not equal to 180 so you can write P or Q is not a straight line looks like it's straight but when you calculate the values it's not a straight line well I don't see this one 5588 37 180 so that means P or Q is a straight line this 145 plus 113 plus 22 that's also 180 so we can say P Oh Q is a straight example number one find the magnitude of the angle marked as a OD that's X in the given v so this is a point so we have to think about angles around the point so what's the sum of angles around the point that's 360 so what's 120 last 130 plus 90 you get here nine plus three twelve fourteen one remaining so three three hundred forty so we can write find X as 360 minus 340 because and girl around a point 
,,is 360 degrees so x equals 20 degrees example two APB is 150 DP see hundred so find B PC B P C is three X so we need to solve for X first so we know this is a fixed 
,,point and 150 and 101st you get 250 then we can write 2x plus 3x plus 250 is equal to 360 because angle around a point now solve 2x and 3x becomes 5x subtract 250 from both sides what you get you get 110 divided by 5 both sides you get x equals 5 times 2 10 5 times 2 10 so x equals 22 degree now we need to find out B PC anger so what's B PC angle is 3 X 3 times 22 you get 66 decrease exercise 3.3 find the value of x so this is a point so you can find the sum of all angles that's add up to 360 so first we will take 130 plus 160 you get 290 then X plus 290 is 360 around a point no subtract 290 from both sides you get what's the value 70 degrees for X find the value of a this is the point so we can say a plus 50 is 360 and go around a point so what's a subtract 50 from both sides you get 310 that's a reflex angle find the value of a so this is the point you can add all together a plus E Plus E Plus E is 360 for a equals 360 divide both sides by 4 you get a equals 90 degrees find the magnitude of APC APC is the whole angle so what's the value APC here this is also a PC this is also a PC so how you identify which one if it's a PC reflex angle this is this one more than 180 this is just the AP C angle so a PC angle is 360 minus these two value sum of these two values so 90 and 120 that's 210 so you subtract 210 from there so you get hundred 50 decrease so if it's a PC just the angle that can be obtuse angle a PC reflex means more than 180 degrees find the magnitude of SOR SOR is 3x so we'll first find X 110 plus 80 you get 190 then 2x and 3x plus 190 is 360 because this is angle around a point so 5x plus 190 is 360 subtract 190 
,,from 360 what you get 16 so you get 7 and 1 so 5 sequels 170 divided by five thirty four degrees for X this is folks then how can we find out it's so our angle that's three x three x 34 three times 4 12 three times 3 9 plus one tip so hundred two degrees a B is a straight line if APR is 150 so this is given 150 find the magnitude of Q P B QP b is this angle so how we find out we can first find out these two angles and then subtract from this one you get the other angle now it's given a B is a straight line so what is this angle this angle this is 180 so I can write 150 plus x equals 180 because of straight angle and x equals subtract 150 you get 30 degrees for X now we found out X is this angle that's 30 now we need to find out this so what is B PQ or q PB angle is 180 minus 2x because this is also a straight angle now substitute 180 minus 2 times the t-bog mas according to bot mas multiplication first 180 minus 60 you get hundred twenty is the this angle QP be example number one find the magnitude of each angle around the point P in the given figure we are XY + KL a straight line segments so what can you say about this Sanga LP why angle is also 135 vertically opposite angles then what's this angle so this is a straight angle because L K is a straight line so you can write find x PL angle is 180 minus 135 that's straight angle 45 degrees that's x PL so x PL and KP y angles are vertically opposite angles so these two are equal so you can write that's 45 find the magnitude of each of the angles marked by an English letter in the figures given below ABCDEF a straight lines what are these two X is 43 vertically opposite angles we know that vertically opposite angles are equal this one what can you say about this one if you take this line and this line 130 is equal to this one so X plus 30 is 130 how can we find X subtract 30 from both sides that's equal to 100 degrees so here what's the reason vertically opposite angles okay these two are straight line what can you say about this and this a plus a is 135 vertically opposite angles are equal so 2a equals 135 divided by 2a inker 2 times 6 12 and 2 times 7 14 and 
,,one remaining means 67 point five degrees for a look at this one a B and C D are straight lines so this is equal to this one so we can write 90 plus 6 equals 125 so 
,,you can write down the razor vertically opposite angles subtract 90 from 125 to get X so you get 35 degrees this one what can you say about a B and C D yeah this angle is equal to this sang so what can you say straight to me B is 55 degrees vertically opposite angles then if you take the other two lines this one and this one this whole angle is equal to this whole angle so what can you say about 55 plus a is equal to 65 plus B B is 55 now add it together 120 so a equals subtract 55 from that you get 65 degrees for a now we found a and B what C see you can find out using straight angles so a plus B plus C is a straight line under an 80 what's a 65 what's B 55 now subtract these two angles you get the C well so what's the sum of these two 65 and 55 hundred-twenty so subtract 120 you get 60 degrees for C value so all of these angers we've found using vertically opposite angles here and this one straight angle find the values of the angles denoted by x y and z in the given figure b by BD x c are straight lines and ABC and AC b are a pair of complementary angles what is the magnitude of ABC first we'll find out XYZ here this and this vertically opposite angles so we can straight away write x equals 90 then Y is 58 same reason Z how can we find C C is 180 minus 58 because of straight angle subtraction 122 so Z is 122 so we found X Y C now they're asking to find out ABC but it's given ABC and ACB it says supplementary not supplemented complementary complementary means 90 degrees ABC you'll find out which angle ABC and AC B AC B angle that's why ACB is y so y plus ABC angle that's given 90 degrees we know the Y value so we can find out them ABC value 90 minus the Y value what's y 58 degrees subtract you get 32 degrees so because this is complementary so we covered all theory related to angles so we did the sum of pair of acute angles is 90 then we call these are complementary angles if the sum is equal to 180 that's supplementary angles an acute angle which needs to be added to a given acute angle for the sum of the two angles to be 90 is called a complementary and a pair of angles which have a common arc and a common vertex and are located on either side of the common arm is called pair of adjacent angles and the sum of angles located around a point on one side of a straight line is 180 and angles around up point is 360 and what's the other one we learned vertically opposite angles created by the intersection of two straight lines are equal to each other so practice all these exercises and examples and thorough with the angles listen

Number Partens,Slw5SCy9P14,hi friends if you watch this whole video you'll find the topic real easy the topic will seem natural to you so what's the topic for today that's right this video is 
,,about numbers in this video we'll explore the different type of real numbers such as natural numbers whole numbers integers rational and irrational numbers and then 
,,we'll finish off with our top three test oriented questions on this topic let's go back to the kindergarten days and start with counting numbers remember the Rhine one two three four five once I caught a fish alive well these numbers such as 1 2 3 and so on are called natural numbers and they are denoted by the letter M let's draw a circle to represent the set of natural numbers now whole numbers includes all the natural numbers and zero so we can draw the whole number circle around the natural numbers integers include all the whole numbers and negative numbers such as minus 1 minus 2 minus 3 and so on so we can draw the integer circle around the whole numbers one important thing for you to keep in mind is that zero is considered neither positive nor negative let's place the diagram we just did on our concept board now the question is are there any numbers between any two integers let's say between 0 & 1 yes and we use them all the time for example half one-third point seven 
,,point eight so between any two integers you have these non integer numbers which are known as fractions or decimals and this entire set of integers and fractions and decimals are called rational numbers and they are denoted by the letter Q any rational number can be written as a fraction P by Q where P and Q are integers the only restriction is that Q should not be 0 since division by zero is undefined now is the natural number 3 also a rational number what do you think so 3 can be written 
,,as 3 by 1 it can be written as a fraction you know P by Q form so 3 is also a rational number now what about 2.5 so we can write it as 25 by 10 and if you simplify the fraction you get 5 by 2 so 2.5 is also a rational number so any rational number can be expressed in a P by Q form that is in this fraction form the only restriction is Q should not be equal to 0 and typically P and Q don't have any common factor except 1 so we write the fraction in its simplified form let's add the non integers to our set diagram the integers and non integers that is fractions and decimals together are called rational numbers let's talk more about rational numbers that are not integers as we learned rational numbers are fractions represented by the P by Q form you can calculate the fraction by dividing and we end up with a decimal number for example 7 by 10 is 0.75 by 2 is 2.5 7 by 4 is 1.75 these are all examples apples of terminating decimal numbers that is the decimal digits stop or terminate after a point because on dividing by the denominator the remainder is zero but there are other fractions which on dividing don't terminate for example two by three is zero point six six six six and it just goes on so we write it as zero point six with a dot or a line on top to represent that the digit six is recurring which means repeating let's take another example one by seven so if you look at the answer here can you see the repeating pattern that's right it's zero point one four two eight five seven recurring let's take a look at another example one by six so that's going to be zero point one six six six six and it just keeps repeating but notice that we write it with a dot or a bar only on top of six because only the six is repeating so these are called recurring decimal numbers well on dividing by the denominator the remainder is never zero and the digits in the quotient keep repeating if you take any fraction how do you determine that on division you're going to get 
,,a terminating decimal number or a recurring decimal number of course one simple way is to actually do the division but there's another trick where you don't need to 
,,divide now what's the trick you need to take a look at the denominator and if the denominator has factors of two and five only then you're going to get a terminating decimal number otherwise it's going to be a recurring decimal number let me pull up some examples to illustrate this let's start with the example of seven by for now what are the factors of the denominator for its two into two now our goal is to convert the denominator into multiples of tens so I'm going to multiply 5 into 5 in the numerator and in the denominator so I get 175 by 100 that's 1.75 so this is a terminating decimal number but if we take 37 by 150 so what are the factors of the denominator they are 2 into 3 into 5 into 5 and if you divide we get zero point 2 4 6 6 6 and so on so this is a recurring decimal number and why is that because if you carefully look at the factors in the denominator you can see that there's a three there for it to be a terminating decimal number you need factors of two and five only now our rational question is are there numbers that are not rational the answers yes these are called irrational numbers for example root 2 root 3 cube root 
,,of 10 these are all irrational numbers but we look at these in a separate video let's try to place the different numbers that we've learnt on a number line are you familiar with the number line an everyday example is a ruler or a measuring tape like this with numbers marked on it unlike the measuring tape the number line has both positive and negative numbers so let's draw a number line and try to place the different numbers on it so here's our number line let's mark the natural numbers on 
,,it 1 2 3 and so on let's draw another number line and Mark the whole numbers on it so it's going to be the natural numbers and 0 in our third number line let's mark 
,,the integers so it's going to be all the whole numbers and the negative numbers minus 1 minus 2 minus 3 and so on in the next number line let's mark the rational numbers so it's going to be all the integers and decimals and fractions for example one point five is here midway between one and two two point eight is here and it's closer to three and minus half is midway between 0 and minus 1 we can also visualize the number system by starting from the top that is from the real numbers let me pull up the concept board for you real numbers can be divided into rational and irrational numbers rational numbers can be divided into integers and non integers now 
,,integers can be divided into negative integers and whole numbers whole numbers can be split into zero and positive integers which are natural numbers coming back to 
,,the non integers fractions and decimals these can be divided into terminating decimals and non terminating or recurring decimals now let's say you want to find rational numbers between any two given rational numbers for example between 3 & 5 one simple answer is 4 we can get it by finding the average 3 plus 5 by 2 which is equal to 4 if you want to find more rational numbers then you can do 3 plus 4 by 2 that's 3 point 5 & 4 plus 5 by 2 which is 4 point 5 now let me pull up some more interesting examples for you if you want to find two rational numbers between two fractions for example 1 by 7 & 4 bytes since the denominators here are equal and the numerators have a gap we can fill in the fractions in the gap so our answer is going to be 2 by 7 and 3 by 7 but what if there's no gap for example if we have to find two rational numbers between 1 by 7 and 2 by 7 then what do you do we can create a gap by multiplying the numerator and denominator with a number since we need two rational numbers we will multiply by 2 plus 1 which is 3 multiplying the numerator and denominator of the two fractions by 3 we get 3 by 21 and 6 by 21 again the denominators are the same but can you see that we've got a gap in the numerator so the two fractions we can insert our 4 by 21 and 5 by 21 now let's look at the case where the denominators of the two fractions are not the same for example if we want to insert six rational numbers between 1/2 and 2/3 as you can see the denominators are not equal so the first step is to make the denominators equal so our two fractions become 3 by 6 and 4 by 6 similar to our previous case now the two denominators are equal but there's no gap in the numerators so what should we do that's right we need to multiply by a number and since we need to insert six rational numbers our number is going to be 6 plus 1 which is 7 so let's multiply the numerator and denominator of the two fractions by 7 so here we have 21 by 42 and 28 by 42 so here are 
,,the six rational numbers that we can insert between these two fractions and on simplifying the six rational numbers and that's our answer let's talk about fractions 
,,and decimals how to convert fractions to decimals and decimals to fractions converting fractions to decimals is easy you just need to divide for example 3 by 4 is 0.75 a terminating decimal number 1 by 3 is 0.33 3 recurring a recurring decimal number now if you want to convert 0.75 to a fraction then we can write it as 75 by 100 simplifying we get 3 by 4 so these are simple but a more interesting question is how do you convert a recurring decimal number to a fraction for example 0.333 recurring now we know that 0.3 is 3 by 10 0.33 is 33 by 100 0.333 is 333 by thousand but we are looking for zero point 3 3 3 3 recurring so let me show you the technique 
,,how to convert a recurring decimal number to a fraction coming up for you right now let X be the recurring decimal number which is 0.3 recurring in this case so let's write it as X equal to 0.33 3 3 and so on now we need another number where the part after the decimal is the same so let's multiply X by 10 and we have 10 X equal 
,,to 3 point 3 3 3 and so on so as you can see here X and 10x have the same part after the decimal now let's subtract X from 10x so I'm going to copy the first line here on subtracting we get 9x equal to 3 so X is 3 by 9 and if we simplify we get 1 by 3 so we have converted our recurring decimal number 0.3 recurring to a fraction 
,,1 by 3 let's look at another example again let X be the recurring decimal number which is one point two seven recurring to find another number with the decimal part 
,,matching this time we can't multiply by 10 we need to multiply by 100 and as you can see in hundred X the decimal part matches so once again subtracting X from 100 X we get 99 X equal to 126 and on simplifying we get 14 by 11 so we've converted our recurring decimal number to a fraction now that we are done with the topic of rational numbers let's take a look at the top three questions on this topic coming up for you right now I would like you to pause the video right here and try solving these questions let's make this more interactive than just watching the video so do post your answers in the comments below or if you have any doubts questions feel free to write it in the comments below and I'm going to make a commitment to answer all of them promptly so I'm going to move off and let you solve these questions thanks for watching the whole video I hope the number system is really easy for you now and the numbers seem more rational and natural to you all puns intended in that sentence and do remember to Like comment and share out this video and go and hit the subscribe button for my channel right now you

Number Partens,bXkewQ7WEdI,"Hi Rob here with Math Antics. just wanted to say hi to all the people who watch our videos, and say thank you so much for watching and liking and subscribing. I "
,,"know we usually dont do milestone videos, but this seemed like a pretty cool milestone that we just had to mention it. We have one times ten to the six YouTube subscribers! Thats crazy!  Thats awesome! Thank you SO much! Oh wait You dont know what numbers like one times ten to the six even mean? Well youre in luck! We have a video that explains it. In fact, its this video that youre watching right now! Hi Im Rob.  Welcome to Math Antics. Have you ever heard people use numbers like "
,,"that? 1 times 10 to the 6th or maybe 3.4 times 10 to the negative 8th? Well those are examples of a way of writing numbers called Scientific Notation. Huh that didnt sound quite right, let me try that again. Scientific Notation Ah yes thats better. Numbers can be really big or really small, right? Like, if you wanted to "
,,"count up all the cells that make up your body, it would be a really big number. something like 35 trillion cells! But if you wanted to measure the diameter of one of those cells using meters, youd get a really small number. something like 0.0000005 meters. Not only are really big or small numbers a lot of work to write down because of all the zeros, theyre hard to quickly evaluate and compare. At a glance, its not easy to tell just how many number places there are in these really big or small numbers. And thats where Scientific Notation can really help us out! Instead of using a long sequence of decimal digits to represent numbers, Scientific Notation uses a shorter number multiplied by a power of 10. And its always in that form:  some number times 10 to the some exponent. Heres an example of a really "
,,"long number: One-hundred, twenty-five million. And heres the equivalent number written in Scientific Notation: 1.25 times 10 to the 8th Wanna see how these two numbers are just different ways of writing the same thing? Lets start by making a copy of our big number and messing with its decimal point a bit. Wheres the decimal point you ask? Remember that its always here, immediately to the right of the ones-place. We just dont need to show it if there arent any decimal digits. Okay, so "
,,"what would happen if we shift the decimal point one place to the left? Well, doing that would change the number, right? By definition, the decimal point is always immediately to the right of the ones-place, so shifting the decimal point shifts the ones-place and all the other number places too. And if we line up the ones-place of our new number with the ones-place of the original number, you see that the new number is 10 times smaller. That means shifting the decimal point one place to the "
,,"left is equivalent to dividing a number by 10. But, do we want a number thats 10 times smaller than before? Wellno.  We dont want to change the value of the number at all. We just want to write it in a different way. Since shifting the decimal resulted in a number thats 10 times smaller than before, to compensate and keep the value the same, we need to multiply the new number by 10. Making the number smaller and then compensating for that might seem like a weird thing to do, but it will make more sense in a minute. Lets do that process again. Lets make a copy of the new number and shift the decimal point to the left again. Since that shifts all the number places, we can align the ones-places and see that the same thing happened. The new number is 10 times smaller than before. So to keep it the same value as "
,,"the original number, we need to compensate by making it 10 times bigger. We need to multiply by another 10. And if we repeat that process again if we make another copy and shift the decimal point again, well see that the number gets 10 times smaller, so we need to compensate by multiplying by another 10. Alright, time out!  We seem to have a little problem here. Each time we shift the decimal point to the left, our number gets smaller. But since we have to compensate with a factor of 10 each time, its making kind of a mess! This part is getting shorter, but this part is getting longer! No problem Exponents can fix that! Do you remember that exponents are a way of writing repeated multiplication? If you dont, then be sure to watch our videos about them before moving on. Instead of writing 10 times 10, we can write 10 to the 2nd power, and instead of writing 10 x 10 x 10, we can write 10 to the 3rd power. Thats much better!  Now we can continue on. Well shift the decimal point again and multiplying by 10 again. But this time, instead of writing another times 10, we can just increase the exponent by 1 since there would be a total of four 10s being multiplied together. Lets keep going with this process of shifting the decimal point to the left and multiplying by 10 for each number place we shift. And well stop when theres only one digit remaining to the left of the decimal point. Wow!  Thats quite a pattern. Each time we shifted the decimal, the number got 10 times smaller. So, each time we had to multiply by another 10 to keep the value the same. And because we did that, each one of these lines represents the same value. So even though it looks a lot different, this last line has the exact same value as the first one. In fact, its just the original number written in Scientific Notation. But, why is it only this last line, and not any of the others? I mean they all look pretty scientific to me! Ah thats a good question. For a number "
,,"to be in proper Scientific Notation, its supposed to have only 1 digit to the left of the decimal. There can be more than one digit to the right of the decimal, depending on the accuracy of the number, but just 1 digit to the left. But why? I mean that rule sounds kinda arbitrary. Its not arbitrary at all! If there's more than one digit to the left of the decimal point, that would mean that we didnt get out all of the factors of 10 that we could have. And factoring out ALL of the 10s "
,,helps us quickly determine a numbers order of magnitude. Order of magnitude!? What in the world is that? That sounds kinda scary! Order of magnitude is basically 
,,"just how many 10s you need to multiply to get a certain number. And when a number is in Scientific Notation, the order of magnitude is just the exponent, because thats telling us how many 10s to multiply together. In this example, the Scientific Notation says that if we take this small decimal and multiply it by eight 10s, well get our original number. So Scientific Notation is a way of taking a really big number and reducing it down to a value thats less than 10, but keeping track of how many 10s we would need to multiply together to get the full number. You can think of it as basically just extracting its order of magnitude and storing it in exponent form. But why would we want to do that?  I mean it seems kinda complicated. Well yeah, but did you see how much writing it saved us? When we wrote out 125,000,000 we had to write ELEVEN characters, including commas. But when we wrote the same number in Scientific Notation, we only had to write EIGHT characters. What? not convinced that its worth the savings? Well how about this number? Thats a LOT of zeros to write, isnt it?! But in Scientific Notation, this number is just 8.4 times 10 to the 31st power. Thats much better! So Scientific Notation is very useful when it comes to writing down really large numbers or really small ones. For "
,,"example, this number is really small:  0.00000095 Its much less than 1, but its not zero. And heres the same number written in Scientific Notation. Again, it consists of a number that has only one digit to the left of the decimal point which is being multiplied by 10 to a certain power. But do you notice anything different about the exponent? Yep its negative!  So what does that mean? Well, the short answer is that positive exponents show repeated multiplication while negative exponents show repeated division. And since this is a negative exponent with 10 as the base, it means to repeatedly divide by 10. To see how that works, lets copy our original number and do that decimal-point-shift-thing again. Only this time, were gonna shift the decimal point to the right. What happens if we shift it one place to the right? It makes the number 10 times bigger than it was before. There used to be 6 zeros between the decimal point and the '9', but now theres only 5. Again, we dont want to change the value, so what can we do to compensate for shifting the decimal point? In this case, since shifting one place to the right made the number 10 "
,,"times bigger, we need to compensate by dividing the number by 10. And because of the way multiplication and division are related, dividing by 10 is the same as multiplying by 1 over 10 (or one-tenth) so we can just multiply by one-tenth. OR we can multiply by 10 to the negative 1, because 10 to the negative1 is just another way of writing one-tenth. That may seem odd if you havent learned about negative exponents before, and we explain it in more detail in our video about the Laws of Exponents. For now, all you really need to know is that multiplying by 10 to the negative 1 is the same as dividing by 10, so it compensated for shifting the decimal point one place to the right. Continuing on, if we shift the decimal point another place to the right, the same thing happens we make the number 10 times bigger. So to keep the value the same, we have to multiply by another factor of 10 to the negative 1. And it youre wondering whether we can combine these exponents, youre on the right track! 10 to the negative 1 times 10 to the negative 1 combine to become 10 to the negative 2, which makes sense because we shifted the decimal point a total of two places to the right. And if we shift the decimal point 3 places to the right, we need to multiply by 10 to the negative 3 to compensate. And if we shift 4 places, then we need 10 to the negative 4 to compensate.  get the idea? And if we continue doing that until the decimal point is positioned so that theres only 1 digit to the left of it, that gives us the number in Scientific Notation:  9.5 times 10 to the -7 And can you figure out what the order of magnitude of this number is? "
,,"Yep just like before, the exponent tells us. Its negative 7. Being able to quickly identify a numbers order of magnitude is pretty handy. For example, if the order of magnitude is a big positive exponent, then you know right away that youre dealing with a really big number. But if its a big NEGATIVE exponent, then you know "
,,"youre dealing with a really small number. And if youre comparing two really big number like these two, or two really small numbers like these two, its hard to tell at a glance which is actually bigger or smaller. But if you see them in Scientific Notation, its easy to see that this numbers order of magnitude is bigger than "
,,"the others, which means that its bigger, and this numbers order of magnitude is less that the others which means that its smaller. So now that youve seen how Scientific Notation works, and you realize that its just a short-hand way of writing really big or really small numbers, lets break down the procedure for converting back and forth between numbers written in regular form and Scientific Notation. Starting with these two examples in regular form First, count how many number places you would need to shift the decimal point for there to be only 1 digit to the left of it. For this number wed need to shift 8 places, and for this number; 6 places. The number of places you need to shift will be the exponent in the Scientific Notation form, but the sign of that exponent is determined by the direction you shifted. If you shifted to the left (because you started with a big number) then the exponent will be positive. But if you shifted to the right (because you started with a small number) then the exponent will be negative. So that gives you the times 10 to the something part of the Scientific Notation and to get the number thats "
,,"multiplied by that power of 10, you just take the shifted decimal number and remove any zeros that dont really need to be shown. There that wasnt too hard, was it? But what if we start out with numbers in Scientific Notation and want to convert them into regular form? Lets do that with these two examples. The first step is to look at the exponent which is the order of magnitude of the number. It tells you how many 10s you'll need to multiply or divide by to get the number in regular form. If the exponent is positive, it means that youll need to multiply by that many 10s. In this example, that means that we would need to multiply by a total of seven 10s to get the number in regular form. That would be a lot of work, but we can also just shift the decimal point that number of places. Which direction do we need "
,,"to shift it? Well since were multiplying by factors of 10, we need to shift it in the direction that will make the number bigger. That is, we need to shift it to the right. So, well just shift the decimal point 7 places to the right. But as you can see, theres arent 7 digits after the decimal, so any places that dont have "
,,"a digit will just be filled with a zero. There Our number is regular form is 41,650,000 In this second example, the exponent is negative, which means that well need to divide by that number of 10s to get the number in regular form. Again, we could just do that division, or we can shift the decimal point to save time. Since dividing by factors of 10 make a number smaller, well need to shift the decimal point in the direction that results in a smaller number that is, to the left. Since our exponent is negative 5, well shift the decimal point 5 places to the left. And any places that we shift past that dont already have a digit in them will get filled with a zero. Well also put a zero in the ones-place since thats always good form for decimal numbers. There Our number in regular form is 0.0000109 Alright thats the basics of Scientific Notation. Its may seem a little confusing at first, but as you get more experience with it, it makes a lot of sense. And when it comes to writing really big or really small numbers, its totally worth it. And even if you understand how Scientific Notation works, it may take some practice to get good at converting back and forth between it and regular form, so be sure to practice on your own. As always, thanks for watching Math Antics, and Ill see ya next time. Learn more at www.mathantics.com"

Number Partens,flXVRy1hjf4,hello grade 8 children today I am here to teach you mathematics relevant to your textbook so what's the first unit in your textbook that's called number patterns so 
,,this is an interesting topic and we'll create number patterns using numbers so let's take 1 2 3 what are those those are digits so here we call these are counting numbers as well counting numbers so one two three like that we can't write all numbers so that's why we put three dots after this so if any pattern if you can't write 
,,it all you have to put three dots we can create different number patterns from these counting numbers so let's take different patterns check the first one one three 
,,five seven nine what are those we call these are odd numbers numbers less than ten only if you take odd numbers you have to write down 11 13 like that but this is the number set less than check so that's why here we put curly brackets and write down 1 1 3 5 7 9 so here you can't see 3 dots this is not continuing now we can find 
,,a next term by adding 2 to the previous so here how do you get 3 from 1 we can add 2 3 plus 2 you get 5 5 + 2 7 7 + 2 9 so since the exact number of terms in this number pattern can be specified therefore it is a finite number time so here certain numbers are there so remember this term finite number pad tick the same thing 1 3 
,,5 7 9 odd numbers less than 10 in this number pattern what's the first term the first number in the number pattern we call the first term so in this one what's the first term second term is 3 third term five fourth term seven and fifth term is now let's take these numbers 2 4 6 8 10 12 what are those those are even numbers so we can divide these numbers by 2 the remainder is 0 so here you see two three dots that means this number pattern continues what you call that that's called in finite 
,,number pattern so what's the first term in this sequence or number buggy that's 2 the second term is 4 36 4 8 and the fifth term so you know how to identify terms in the number pad and what are the two words you learn finite number pattern L in finite number pattern let's take this one 5 8 11 14 17 so when you take two numbers next to each other what do you call that consecutive term so here 5 & 8 are consecutive terms when you take 8 and 11 those are also consecutive terms so you can take 
,,any 2 you can take any two terms next to each other those are called consecutive terms so 14 and 17 also consecutive terms so we'll take that one and see the pattern how you get a it from five we need to add three 8 plus 3 you get 11 11 plus 3 14 14 plus 370 so how can we find out this number so you can take any two terms consecutive terms in the number pattern if you take this is the next term and the one before that that's called previous term we can take the difference so how do you get 
,,this number 11 minus 8 or 8 minus 5 so what you call that number common difference so you are learning another term that's common difference how you get the common difference you need two consecutive terms and take the difference when you are taking the difference don't subtract 5 minus 8 that's wrong so next term minus the previous term so we'll do that so you can either take 8 minus 5 Oh 11 minus 8 you are getting same answer or 14 minus 11 or 17-14 so that's how we find out the common difference let's take this one find the common difference of the following number pattern's now you know we can take the difference between two consecutive terms so you can take any two numbers so I'll take these two then what's the difference 16 minus 12 you get this one what's the common difference these two 36 minus 30 that's six when you take these two twenty minus ten that's ten look at this question write down the first five terms of the following number patterns you have given the first term and the common differences you can start from the first seven common difference is three means you need to add three to the previous term 7 + 3 10 10 plus 3 13 13 plus 3 16 16 plus 3 19 one two three four five and you can put three dots to show that it is continuing next one first term is 14 then common difference is plus four means adding four to the previous one four plus 14 plus 480 18 plus four 22 22 plus four 26 26 plus four 30 next one first term six and common difference six so that means multiples of six so starting from 6 6 plus 6 12 12 plus 6 18 18 plus 6 24 24 plus 6/13 this one first term is 12 and the common difference is eight at eight to that 12 plus 8 20 20 plus eight twenty eight twenty eight plus eight 36 36 Plus eight forty four one two three four five can put three dots after that look at this one right down the next two terms of the following sequences so you need to identify the pattern 712 so what's the common difference 12 minus 7 adding fine so that means in this number pattern the common difference is +5 so that means add 5 to that 27 plus 5 32 32 + 5 30 silver this one identify the common difference first you get server last 7 so what you do 41 is the last term so you add 7 to that you get 48 48 plus 750 this one what's the common difference how do you get 12 from 9 adding 3 let me you can start from here 21 plus three twenty four twenty four plus three twenty seven this Molly plus five 16 plus five you get 20 bar then you can 
,,start from here 36 plus five 41 41 plus five 46 this one have you get thirty from twenty four adding six to that so that means 48 plus 6 54 54 plus six that's 60 this one following number pattern is created multiplied the previous term by 2 now this is multiplication 2 times 2 you get 4 4 times 2 8 8 times 2 16 16 times 2 32 so 
,,this is the number pattern so I can write this one starting from 2 4 8 16 32 now look at this 1 2 4 8 10 20 a different number pattern following number pattern is created first added to and then multiplied by 2 so added to 2 plus 2 you get 4 times 2 8 then adding 2 8 plus 2 10 10 times 2 20 so this is also another number pattern so 2 4 8 10 20 now look at these so first 3 terms are the same but fourth term and fifth term those are different so from these two patterns we observed even though the first 3 terms are the same can create different number patterns so same for three terms but you can create different number pants now look at this one added 3 to the previous term 3 plus 3 you get 6 6 plus 3 9 9 plus 3 12 12 plus 3 15 so here what are the numbers three six nine twelve fifteen now first three terms are the same 369 but this is 18 and 21 so how can you create that pattern first multiplied by two and then added three multiplied by two you get six then added 3 6 plus 3 9 then multiplied by 2 again 9 times 2 18 18 plus 3 21 so this one is 3 6 9 18 21 so first three terms are the same but you can create different number patterns fill in the blanks to generate different number patterns so what can we do hi plus 5 10 10 plus 5 15 that means adding 5 15 20 25 30 look at this one you can do another partner we can do multiply by 2 and add 5 5 times 2 10 10 plus 5 15 and what's the next number 15 times 2 30 30 plus 5 35 35 times 2 you get 70 this one 7 14 21 multiples of server so that means adding 7 to that so 21 plus seven twenty eight twenty eight plus seven 35 35 plus 7 42 now create another number pattern different one see first three terms try to create another one this one I can do multiply by 2 and then add 7 multiplied by 2 first and then at 7 so multiply by 221 times 242 add seven more T naught now again x - 2 times 9 18 so 2 times 9 18 2 times 4 8 + 1 98 now we'll discuss what is general term of the number pattern take this number pattern two four six eight ten twelve means even numbers so you want to write down the general term of the multiples of two now we'll try to do that so term number term and pattern okay what's the first term in this sequence or number pattern that's how can I write down two I can write 1 times 2 or 2 times 1 second term second term is 4 
,,try to write down number 4 - x - third term 6 what's the pattern I can write this one as 2 times 3/4 1 8 2 times 4 now see your pattern 10th term I need no tense term so 10th term is what 2 times 10 by looking at the pattern we can get 2 times 10 because first term is 2 times 1 second term is 2 times 2 so temp term 2 times 10 that's 20 then what about nth term n means any term I can write 2 times N or when you write without this multiplication I can write - so what's the enter to win we call this as general term so nth term is the general term of the number pattern so what you can write for multiples of Oh general term is 2 what are the numbers for n you have to start from one n equals 1 first term in equals 2 second term so likewise when you substitute in values we can find out any term so you need general term to find out the terms now what are these numbers 3 6 9 12 15 18 multiples of 3 write down the general term of the multiples of 3 so we'll try to do the same thing like before first term first term is 3 what's the pattern I can write 3 times second term is 6 3 times 2 this number and this one is the same third one 9 3 times 3/4 1 
,,12 3 times 4 then what about temperature I can write 3 times 10 that becomes 30 and what about the general term nth term three times in oh I can write down three so 
,,what's the general term of multiples of 3 is 3 and so I can write down this one as 3 n so we found out the general pattern for multiples of 2 that's 2 it general term for multiples of 3 that's 3 n now this one feel the table below by observing the previous pattern multiples of 2 2 multiples of three general term is 3/8 can you identify then what about multiples of four that's foreign so you saw the patent two three four what about multiples are fired five multiples of 7 this is 7 in multiples of chain chain in and multiples of 11 obviously that's a lemon now the reverse process finding terms using general term if you know the general term how can we find out these terms so in this example first three terms first three terms means N equals one N equals two and in equals three so what you do take the general term substitute one for first term that's three to get the second term you substitute n equal to 3 times 2 6 when N equals 3 you get the third term so that's what about tenth term general term is trillion so tenth term is 3 times 10 that's previous question which tell me 60 now the end term is given 60 and you are asked to find out what's the end value so what you do we equate general term is trillion and that's equal to 60 then how you solve this you can divide this by 3 to get in so 60 divided by 3 what you get n equals 60 divided by 3 you get 20 so 20th term is 60 or in other words we can say 20 multiple of 3 is 60 now the general term is given as 5 in you are asked to find out for three terms 11th term and which term is 75 so what you do for the first three you substitute N equals 1 you get the first term N equals 2 
,,you get the second term M equals 3 you get the good so 5 10 15 are the first three terms and then 11th term next one you are asked to find out the 11th term so how we find out the LMR term substitute 11 so 5 times 11 you get 55 so 11th term is 55 this one the third part which term is 75 means nth term is given 75 so you equate in term is 5 in general term that's equal to 75 so how you find out n divided by 5 75 divided by 5 you get 15 so 15 multiple of 5 is 75 this one you have given the general term is 11 find the 10th term so how you find out the 10th term substitute 10 for and 10th term is equal to 11 times 10 hundred 10 next 120th term so what you 
,,do substitute N equals 20 general term is 11 and that's given and you asked to find out the 20th term substitute in s 20 multiplied by 2 you get 22 put 1 0 220 this 
,,one the third part which term is 121 now the reverse process you'd have given the in term you also find out the in value and the fourth part also same way you asked 
,,to find out which term is 77 so we'll do that substitute then to get n you divide by 11 get 11 for it so 11th term is 121 what about 77 when you divide by 11 you get in ass so so seventh term is 77 fill in the blanks now you have given different number patterns and you asked to write down the first term and the change Roger so observe the first one four eight twelve sixteen multiples of four that means addition multiples are four that means adding four what's the first term for what's the general term for em then 9 18 27 36 multiples of 9 starting from 9 9 18 27 36 so what's the general term 9 in 1 2 3 4 this is also number pattern but you're adding 1 
,,to that so what's the general term starting from 1 we can write 1 in 8 16 24 those are multiples of 8 starting from 8 so the general term is a 10 identify this multiples of 12 starting from 12 you can write 12 in 1 3 5 7 9 11 find the general term for odd numbers what are even numbers 2 4 6 8 so we found out the general pattern 
,,for even numbers multiples of 2 what's that that's 2 in now we'll try to find out the general term for odd numbers what's the first term if it's even numbers what's 
,,the first term but in our pattern the first term is 1 so what can you see you have to subtract 1 to get this one second term even numbers when you consider the second term is 4 but in this one that's 3 how you get 3 from 4 4 minus 1 third term for the even pattern six this one five you can subtract and get five one from the term fourth term is eight for even numbers in this one seven 8 minus 1 is 7 tenth term you get 2 times 10 20 odd numbers what's the 10th term one less than that so we observed a pattern one less than that so I can write 20 minus 1 that's 19 xx - 2 times 20 that's 40 but we know that's this is 1 less than that this is 39 so what's the general term we found out general term for even numbers that's 2 in so what's the pattern 2 n minus 1 so we can straightaway find out the general term for odd numbers that's 2 n minus 1 we can get odd numbers by subtracting 1 from all even numbers so remember now what's the general term for odd numbers 2 n minus 1 using that now we'll try to find our 23rd odd number to do that you need to know the general term so what's the general term for numbers 2 n minus 1 if you want twenty third term you substitute N equals 23 so 2 times 23 minus 1 so what's that you get 46 minus 1 forty hi 45th so what it means here 23rd odd number is 45 find the 36th odd number so what's the general term for numbers to win - what if you want 36 substitute 36 for in 2 times 6 12 1 remaining 2 times 3 6 + 1 7 72 minus 1 you get 71 36th odd number is 71 find the 18th odd number so what's the general term 2 n minus 1 18 term you substitute 18 for 2 times 8 16 1 remaining so 36 minus 1 you get 35 18th odd number is 35 which odd number 33 now the reverse process we know the general term is 2n minus 1 for numbers so we can substitute to win minus 1 is equal to 33 now 
,,is that linear equation simple algebraic equation you know already how to solve that so what you do you can get rid of this minus 1 by you can get rid of this minus 
,,one by adding 133 plus one so what you get here 34 is equal to two it to get em you can divide this by two so when you do that you can get n m equals 2 times 1 2 4 14 that's 7 so 17th odd number is 33 which odd number is 81 now you need to get the general term so what's general term general term is 2 n minus 1 now that's equal to 81 now solve that equation Advan first to get rid of this minus 1 you get 82 is equal to 2 in then you need to divide this by 2 to get n N equals 41 so 41 or term 
,,is 81 which odd term is 17 same thing take the general term equal to 70 get rid of this minus 1 that means adding 1 you get 18 is equal to 2 in then divide by 2 what you get you get 9/9 odd number is 17 now you need to know what R square are numbers so look at this diagram starting from 1 then 2 rows and 2 columns you can create a square so two times two that's four then three rows and three columns you can create the next square number four rows and four columns you can get their next one 
,,now we'll try to find out the general term for square numbers here is the pattern of circles forming squares which lengths and widths are the same what's the first term that's one second term for we'll try to write down the pattern first term I can write one times one second terms I can write 2 times two third term nine that's three times three if it's eight eighth term I can write by looking at this pattern eight times eight what's that 69 tell nine times nine that's 81 then what about enter this should be n times in so n times n you can write down as in squared so what's the general term for square numbers you can take as in squared now using the general term of the square number can you find the tenth square number so what's the generator in squared 10th term means we substitute check ten square are same as ten times ten you get hundred so tenth square number is 100 this one find the 12 square how you do take the general term n squared and it's not stood 12 12 times 12 that's unread 44 so 12 square number is 144 find the 15 square number write down the general term substitute 15 15 times 15 is 225 so 15 square number is 225 now we'll 
,,take triangular numbers look at the picture for starting from 1 you need 3 circles to create the next triangle what about the other one you need 6 circles to create 
,,the next triangular number next 1/4 110 to create the fourth triangular number so what's the first term first term is 1 second term is 3 third term 6 fourth term 10 
,,what about fifth term can you see the pattern right like this this is one how can you get three I can write 1 plus 2 6 1 plus 2 Plus 3 you get 6 10 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus 4 then what about fifth number 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus 4 plus 5 sum of numbers up to 5 so what's the number that means adding 5 to the previous term 10 plus five you get 15 as a fifth term of the triangular numbers now we can find out this one using a method now we'll take this one if you want adding one up to four when you take first and the last you can get one plus four you can get five to plus three you can get high so when you pair up the numbers like this you can get five in two methods either 2 plus 3 or 1 plus 4 so we can easily find out this as 5 is the number when you add you are getting 2 times of that so 5 times 2 that's 10 so this is the 
,,fourth triangular number so if you want fourth you add 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus 4 how we get the number this is the easiest way to do pair up the numbers like this and then see how many times you are getting the number so in the number is 5 and 2 times you are getting that's 10 we'll take another one if you want 8 triangular number 
,,you have to add 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus like that up to 8 when you pair up like this 1 plus h you get 9 2 plus 7 9 3 plus 6 9 4 + 5 9 how many times you are getting nine one two three four four times you're getting nine so what's the number 36 so eight triangular number is 36 now 10th triangular number what you do 1 plus 2 plus up 
,,to 10 so when you pair up how many sets you can get think about a pattern now previous one we got 4 into 9 is equal to 36 4 is yeah how many digits are there eight 8/2 so we can think about this is 8 divided by 2 you get 4 what about 9 9 you are getting think about first and last 1 plus 8 you did not so we'll try to use that pattern in the next one what's the total 1 plus 10 you are getting 11 2 plus 9 also 11 so how many Elevens you can you will get we can see 10 numbers that they are 10 divided by 2 5 times you are getting 11 so 5 times 11 oh I can write 5 as 10 divided by 2 and how you get 11 first and the last one 1 plus J now can you see the pattern 11 is obtained by adding the first term and the last term the following are 5 such terms so how you create that 10 divided by 2 now what is 10 number of terms and this is the first term and this is the last / - I can rewrite this as this 10 times 10 plus 1 is 11 over 2 so what's the formula you can find the number of terms multiplied by first and the last term addition divided by two so we'll try to apply this formula to find out any triangular number take this one one two eight eight triangular number what's the pattern again we found from the previous one number of terms into first Plus last divided by 2 number of terms 8 divided by 2 and x first 
,,and last one plus 8 again i can write 8 times 9/2 so when you simplify what you get 2 times 1/2 times 4 36 1 2 20 mins xx triangular number so I can write 20 divided by 2 here x 1 plus 20 this is same as 20 into 21 divided by 2 when you simplify you get 210 this one 50th triangular number 50 numbers are they are and divided by 2 1 plus 50 50 times 51 divided by 2 you get 25 times 50 baht so multiplication 25 times 51 means first multiply by 20 and then 5 2 times 1 is 2 and 2 times 5 ten high times 1/5 and 5 times 5 25 so when you add it you get thousand 275 now you need to find out the generator so what's the pattern if there are n digits in the next number is one more than that n plus 1 if the previous number is in you're adding 1 to that n plus 1 divided by 2 so what's the general term for the triangular number 
,,n times n plus 1 divided by 2 here you don't need to write down multiplication side brackets also ok but if you think that this is not talking you can write as in times n plus 1 divided by 2 so we'll try to find out any triangular number using the chain rule to find the 10th triangular number so what's the general term for triangular numbers in times in plus 1/2 now if you want 10th one you substitute 10 10 is n 10 plus 1 over 2 so 10 times 11 over 2 that becomes 50 so general term is n into n plus 1 over 2 for triangular numbers find the 20th triangular number so general term ending to n plus 1/2 so you need xx that means in equals 20 so 20 into 20 plus 125 so you get 10 times 21 210 find the fortieth triangular number you need the general term n into n plus 1 divided by 2 when this is 40 so 14 241 over 2 divided by 2 you get 20 that means multiply by 2 and put a 0 2 times 1 to 2 times 4 8 44th triangular number same as before to take the general term and substitute 44 now substitute 44 44 into 45 44 + 1 then x 22 so 45 x 22 you get 900 plus 45 945 so 945 is the 44th triangular number find xxx triangular number general term so the triangular numbers are n into n plus 1 divided by 2 so if this is xxx triangular number substitute N equals 30 fifteen times 31 so 31 into 15 10 and 5 multiply by 1 and then multiply by 5 add it together you get 465 is the 30th triangular number find the hundredths triangular number general term is n into n plus 1 divided by 2 in this hundred substitute hundred here you get 50 times hundred one so put 0 and x 5050 is the hundredth triangular number 1 + 2 + 3 up to 15 from this sequence which triangular number do you get we observe the pattern 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 fourth triangular number 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 v triangular number so if this is up to 15 this is 15th triangular number up to 28 adding 1 + 2 + 3 up to 20 so what is the triangular number that's xx from this sequence which triangular number one up to 27 so that's 27th triangular this one up to 19 so this is 19th triangular find the sixteenth triangular number if the fifteenth triangular number is 120 so we know the pattern fourth triangular number 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus 4 then to get the fifth one you have to add 5 to that now 16 1 you need so fifteenth one is 120 so how do you get the 16th one 
,,"from 15th one you need to add which number either 15 or 16 you have to add 16 to that so 120 plus 16 you get 136 this one find the 21st triangular number if the 20th one is given 210 you are asked to find out 21st one so which number you need to add 210 plus 21 so that's one here 3 2 231 find the 10th triangular number the 9th triangular number is 55 it's a similar way ninth one is 55 and you are asked to find out the tenth one so how do you do ad turn to that get 65 find the 80th triangular number if the 79th one is given as 3,240 have you get that adding 80 to that so at eighty three thousand three hundred twenty that's the 80th triangular number now we'll try to find out pattern in between square our numbers and the triangular numbers so what are these 1 3 6 10 15 21 are triangular numbers let's take 1 + 3 is 4 so 4 is the square number that's the second square number and here 3 plus 6 you get 9 that's the third square number what about this one 6 + 10 you get 16 so what's that that's the fourth square number I can write this one is 2 squared second square number third square number 3 squared 16 is 4 square number now try to identify "
,,a pattern what's one that's the first triangular number so if I put a symbol like this is first triangle enough 3 is the second triangular number so when you add these two you are getting second square number I put a square to represent the word square what about this one second triangular number and this is third triangular number you are getting third square number find out a relationship this is third triangular number this is fourth triangular number you are getting fourth square number have you seen the pattern 3 4 3 + 1 4 2 + 1 3 1 + 2 2 2 consecutive triangular numbers when you add you get this square number so last square number if this is 4 this is fourth square number if this is 3 this is third square number and this this is 2 this is second square number so what's the pattern when you take any triangular number twenty first triangular number plus twenty second triangular number what you get we get 20 second square number now we'll use that pattern to identify this 
,,one fifth triangular number and sixth triangular number what you get what's the pattern you get sixth square number so you can write what's this number here six square then what about tenth one and eleventh triangle you are getting xi square number you can write 10 1 plus xi 1 you get xi square Arnim 21st and the 22nd but you get 21st triangular number and 22nd triangular number you get 22nd square number 20 or we can write in numbers 22nd square 33rd triangular number and 34th triangular number you are getting 34th square you can do this is 33 33rd triangular number and 34th triangular number you are getting thirty fourth square no so that's the relationship between triangular numbers and the square numbers now we will look at example number 1 in your textbook write the terms of each of the following number patterns the number pattern of the prime numbers between 1 and 17 written in ascending order so what are prime numbers only divisible by 1 and itself what's the lowest prime number 2 so you can write down to then what's the next prime number 3 5 7 11 13 14 15 16 then 17 but can we write down 17 it says in between in between means between means 1 and 17 not included so you can't write 17 there so ascending order means lowest to highest second one the number pattern of the odd number starting from one written in ascending order just the odd numbers 1 3 5 7 11 13 all numbers so what we do we have to put three dots to represent this is continuing third one the 
,,number pattern starting from 1 and followed by the terms two and one written alternatively so as to when one separately starting from one and followed by the terms so starting from one followed by the terms two and one written alternately 2 1 2 look again 1 2 so that's another number pad so we can put three dots to represent this is continuing exercise 1.1 fill in the blanks in the number pattern 1 3 5 7 9 what's the first term 1 second term is 3/4 - 1 2 3 4 that's seven in the number pattern 4 8 12 16 20 multiples of 4 the first term is 4 second term that's 8 and the third term is 12 question number two write the terms of each of the following number 
,,patterns the number pattern of the even numbers between one and nine written in ascending order so what's the first number even numbers 2 4 6 8 10 10 you can write because this is in between these 1 & 9 so this is in ascending order so that's up to this point next one the number pattern of the multiples of 6 from 6 to 36 written in ascending order so multiples of 6 to 36 means you can write 36 as well 6 times 2 12 6 times 3 18 24 6 times 5 30 6 times 6 36 the number pattern of the even numbers greater than 7 written in ascending order greater than 7 means above 7 so what's the lowest even number 8 starting from 8 you can write 8 10 12 like that so this is continuing with 3 dots the number pattern of the prime number starting from 2 written in ascending order so starting from 2 what are the prime numbers 2 3 5 7 like that this is not ending in finite number pattern so you can put three dots question number three copy the below given statements in your exercise book and mark the correct statements with a correct or incorrect symbol we'll take the first one the terms of a number patent have to be in ascending order tick ten eight six like that that's not in ascending order that's descending order that's also a number pattern so the first one is wrong because no need to be always in ascending order second one the terms of a number patent have to be different from each other no because five five five this is also number pattern so no need to be different to each other so here this is also wrong third one if the tenth term of two number patterns are different then the two number patterns are different to each other so think about you have two number sets number patterns tenth term here you got five hundred something here the tenth term is two hundred so different so different means the two 
,,number patterns are different so it says if the tenth term of two number patterns are different then the two number patterns are different so that's true example number one consider number pattern of the multiples of two starting from two written in ascending order so when you write down the number pattern this is two four six eight like that multiples of to find 11th term so what's the general term we know multiples of two the general term is two ends then using the general term you can answer these questions eleventh term so have you find out the 11th term substitute 11 for you get 2200 third term 2 times 103 you get 206 then the last part find which term is hot so 128 of this number pattern that means we know the general term is to win that's given as 728 so how we find out in divide this by to say 128 divided 
,,by 2 2 times 3 6 6 4 12 and 4 for 8 360 fourth term that's multiple of 2 is 728 example number 2 the general term of the number pattern of the multiples of 3 starting from 3 and written in ascending order is 3 so already given so we can write down 3 6 9 12 like that so nth term is given or the general term is 3 in first part find the 13th term so I will find out the 13th term substitute 13 in 9 so 39 then part to find which term is 87 so 87 is equal to three yen so how do you find out n divided by three so in so I'll rewrite this in other way rock three and means eighty-seven divided by 3 you get in eighty seven divided by three twenty ninth term is 87 in other words twenty nine multiple of three is 87 example number three in the number pattern of the multiples of four starting from four and written in ascending order with general term for so general term is given for then what's the chapter tenth term means and B equals can write substitute and nickel step four times 10 that means what part two what is the 11th term so 11th term just substitute in equals 11 four times 11 you get 44 which term is hundred so this is continuation so this is about multiples of four four which term is 100 so in this one in term is given for n means given 100 divided by four to get and when you divide by 4 you get 25 so 
,,25 fifth multiples of 4 is 100 is 43 a term of this number pattern what are the reasons for your answer okay we'll check whether 43 in this number pattern for N equals 43 you divide by four what happens you get ten yeah one and here nothing and three remaining out of four you're getting a fraction for n what is n means number of terms can you get a fraction for a number of terms you can't get a fraction so that's why so 43 is not in the number pattern so here we can write in either fraction there are 4 43 is not in this exercise 1.2 copy the table given below and complete it number pattern first term and the generator so what's the first term here hi these are multiples of 5 so what's the general term 5 in multiples of 2 that's 2 with multiples of 3 3 multiple of ten that's ten named this is 10 20 multiples of 10 
,,starting from 10 you can write 10 in 8 16 24 32 multiples of 8 starting from a twister this is 8 n these are multiples of 7 starting from 7 7 and what about this one multiples of 12 starting from 12 that's 12 in and 1 2 3 4 multiples of once so starting from 1 this is 1 in oh you can write without one just in question number to 
,,write the number pattern of the multiples of 5 between three and thirty-three written in ascending order so starting from three to 33 in between so what's the first 
,,multiple of five five five times to 10 five times three 15 20 25 30 35 but you can't write 35 this should be in between 3 and 33 so up to this point so this is a finite number partner question number three in the number pattern 11 22 33 of the multiples of 11 starting from 11 and written in descending order what is the general term we already know the general term is 11 and what is the 9th term you substitute in equals nice 11 times 9 that's 99 which term is 121 now we know the general term 11 M equals 120 1 when you divide by 11 you get N equals 11 11th multiple of 11 is 125 fourth one in the number pattern 9 18 27 36 of the multiples of 9 starting from 9 and written in ascending order what is the general term now you already know multiples of 9 the general term is 9 end what is the element job substitute in equals 1199 third part which term is 217 e now we know the general term is 9 in equate to 270 so when you divide by 9 what you get xxx term is 270 question number five in the number pattern with general term hundred in so you have given general term as hundred what is the eleventh term so 11th term means you're substituting in equals eleven hundred times you never you get 1100 part two which term is 500 that means 100 N equals 500 when you divide by hundred you get fifth term is 500 question number six what is the smallest multiple of three larger than 100 which term is it in the number pattern of the multiples of three starting from three okay so larger than 100 101 check whether it's divisible divided by 3 3 times 3 9 4 11 you can't you can't divide by 3 102 3 times 3 9 12 12 is divisible by 3 so what's the lowest number multiple of 3 after 100 that's 102 which term is it in the number pattern of the multiples of 3 starting from 3 so 3 6 9 like that they are asking which term is 102 so that means we know these are multiples of 3 what's the general term 3 n so we can equate 3n equals 102 so what's a divided by 3 you get 34 so 34 multiple of 3 is hundred - question number 7 what's the nth term that's basically general term of the pattern of the even numbers greater than 1 but less than 200 greater than 
,,1 what's the lowest multiple of 2 that's 2 for each like that what's the largest number less than 200 you can't write 200 so one before that 198 this is in ascending order smallest to largest the smallest value of n is 1 we know n V equals 1 you get the first what is its largest value that means you are that means you need to find the value of n 498 so we can write 2 N equals hundred ninety-eight divided by 2 so that means 99th term is 198 question number eight it has been estimated that in a country having a population of 2 million people the population will increase by 2 million every 25 years estimate the population of the country in 200 years so first thing we need to find out how many years are there how many steps are there for 200 years so every 25 years it's increasing so find out how many times it's changing 200 divided by 25 is 8 so that means 8 times it's changing so starting from 2 million so I'll write millions here so starting from 2 after first 25 years this becomes 4 million adding 2 million every 25 years so they're asking if this is 200 years not the population if this is 200 years that means if this is 200 years that means 8 times this is increasing so that means 8 turn 8 term of this sequence so after 50 years this becomes 6 million so this is the sequence we know these are multiples of 2 so what's the general term that's 2 when so you need 8 term what's the eighth term 2 times 8 that's 16 so these are in millions so we can write 16 million 
,,people after 200 years example number four in the pattern of the odd numbers starting from one what is the general term so one three five seven what are those odd numbers we found out even numbers the pattern is 2n odd numbers you can get it from subtracting one from even numbers so what's the general term of odd numbers - in - 
,,we'll do the second part part 2 what is the 72nd term so we know the general term is 2 n minus 1 so 70 second term is n V equals 72 so substitute you get 2 times 72 
,,minus 1/2 times 2 for 2 times 7 14 minus 1 you get 143 so 70 second term is 143 third part which term is 51 this is about odd number so general term is 2 n minus 1 that's equal to 55 add 1 to get rid of this one and then you get 2n equals 52 divided by 2 you get 2 times 2 4 4 12 that's six twenty sixth term is 51 exercise 1.3 in the pattern of the odd numbers starting from one and written in ascending order what is the twelfth term so what are the numbers 1 3 5 those are the odd numbers what's the general term for numbers we know that general term is 2 and minus 1 you can use that general term you are asked to find out 12th term 12 term means you substitute 12 in and you get 23 for that and what's the fifteenth term 15 term you substitute N equals 15 30 minus 1 you get 29 part 3 which term is 89 is all about odd numbers so we can write down n star is 89 add 1 you get 90 equals to n divided by 2 you get 90 divided by 2 45 part 4 which term is the greatest odd number less than 
,,100 what's the odd number greatest or number 99 so 99 is the largest or number less than 100 question number 2 find the value of the sum of the 34th term of the pattern of the even number starting from two and the 34th term of the pattern of the odd number starting from what so there are two patterns here what's the first pattern even numbers so starting from two so two four six like that so you are taking thirty fourth term of the even number and the thirty fourth term of them odd numbers 
,,what are numbers one for what are numbers one three five seven so they asking thirty fourth after odd number as well and first you need to find out thirty fourth term separately I'll take the total because you need the sum okay so we know the general term of the even numbers is to it then which term you need thirty fourth term N equals 34 you get sixty eight in this sequence odd numbers what's the general term one less they're even numbers to win minus one so what's thirty fourth term of that two times 34 minus 1 you get 67 now they asking what's the sum of these two values so 68 plus sixty seven hundred thirty-five exercise 1.4 what is the 10th term of the square number pattern starting from 1 and written in ascending order can you remember the general term of a square number general term of square numbers N squared now they asking temperature so starting from here you have to always look at the starting point so 1/4 like that so when you take the square numbers 1 squared 2 
,,squared 4 3 squared 9 so what's the 10th term 10th term you substitute 10 10 squared means 10 times 10 hundred question number two what is the tenth term of the triangular number pattern starting from one and written in ascending order so what are triangular numbers 1 plus 2 3 3 plus 3 6 6 plus 4 10 10 plus 5 15 and what's the general term of triangular numbers we found that general term for triangular numbers are in n plus 1 over 2 now we need till term 10th triangular number substitute 10 for n 10 times 10 plus 1 divided by 2 or you can write 10 times 11 divided by 2 2 times 5 11 times 5 is 55 question number 3 a certain number greater than 1 less than 50 which is a term of the square number pattern starting from 1 so 1 2 squared is 4 so like wise this is less than 50 and written this is in green and written in 
,,ascending order is also a term of the triangular number pattern starting from 1 and written in ascending order so in triangular numbers 1 1 plus 2 3 3 plus 3 6 like 
,,that 10 15 these are triangular numbers so one term is in both number partners what is this term so they are asking what is this term we know what's the general term of square numbers we know that's N squared what's the general term of triangular number in n plus 1 divided by 2 if one number in both number patterns these two are equal so we can take N squared is equal to in n plus 1 over 2 now what can I do I can multiply both sides by 2 to get cancel out I get 2 N squared is equal to expand brackets you get N squared n into n n squared n into 1 that's plus N when you take this term to this side 2 N squared minus n square what you get these are like terms I can ride to n square minus N squared is equal to n so N squared is equal to n so I can divide this by n you get N equals 1 so only number belongs to both is N 
,,equals 1 so we can write N equals 1 is there term belongs to both of these number factors square number as well as a triangular number question number 3 a certain number greater than 1 and less than 50 which is a term of the square number pattern starting from 1 L written in ascending order is also a term of the triangular number pattern starting from 1 and written in ascending order so we'll take square numbers first starting from 1 for 2 squared 9 16 4 squared 5 squared 25 6 squared 36 7 
,,squared 49 because up to 49 because this is less than 50 if you take triangular numbers when you take triangular numbers starting from 1 1 plus 2 3 3 plus 3 you get 
,,6 6 plus 4 10 10 plus 55 15 15 plus 6 21:21 plus seven twenty eight twenty eight plus eight 36 36 Plus 9 45 and 45 plus ten 55 you can't write 55 because this is less than 50 so these are the square numbers and these are the triangular numbers and they asking one number is there in both sequence greater than one so don't consider one day are other than one there's another number which numbers in both sequence 36 so 36 is the term in both number patterns which square number is it one two three four five six six square number which triangular number is it one two three four five six seven eight eight triangular question number four the sum of the fourteenth and fifteen terms of the triangular number pattern starting from one is a square number show that this statement is true and find which term it is of the square 
,,number pad fourteen and fifteen triangular numbers and this is the sum can you remember the pattern we observed first triangular number and the second triangular number is equal to the second square number if you take eight one and ninth number of the triangular numbers the sum is equal to the ninth square number now they're asking fourteenth triangular number and the fifteenth triangular number is which one fifteen square number so when you take this one this is the square number you get 15 square number so is this statement correct the sum of two triangular numbers these are consecutive two triangular numbers that's equal to a square number so the statement is true can dried statement is true and find the term it is of the square number pattern find which term so which term is that fifteen square question number five write the total number of triangles in each figure in order and see whether you can identify the pattern the pattern of the total number of triangles in the figures in the the given order is identical to the pattern of triangular numbers starting from one L written in ascending order find the total number of triangles in the eighth figure that is drawn according to this pattern so we need to find out how many triangles are there first diagram how many triangles are there just one triangle this one one two and we can take the bigger one that's three this one one two three four five six what about this one first we'll count small numbers small triangles one two three four if you take two at a time one two three so 4 plus 3 7 and then 7 8 9 and the bigger one that's 10 so these are the number of triangles inside these diagrams the pattern of the total number of triangles in the figure in the given order is identical to the pattern of the triangular number starting from 1 and written in ascending order so we found out these are triangular numbers find the total number of triangles in the eighth figure so we'll see what's the total number of triangles so we can find out that term we already know in into n plus 1/2 if you want the a trigger so that means eighth term in equals 8 8 times 8 + 1 9 divided by 2 2 times 1/2 times 4 that means 36 so you can write there are 36 triangles in the eighth trigger question number 6 sigh uni buys a till and start saving money by putting 1 rupee into it on the first day so 1 so 1 rupee first day on the second day she puts 2 rupees so second day she puts 2 rupees means the total is 2 plus 
,,1 333 rupees so increasing 3 plus 3 6 and so how much money is in the till by the end of the tenth day now what's this button these are triangular numbers 1 3 6 next day 4 rupees 6 plus 4 10 so these are triangular numbers you can apply the general term so what's the general term of triangular numbers and mean 2n plus 1 divided 
,,by 2 now they ask what's the value and of 10th day so 10th term turn into 11 divided by 2 divided by 2 you get 55 that means 55 rupees in the 1030 so siren approached 55 rupees in the tank miscellaneous exercise in the pattern of the odd number starting from 1 commencing from the first term if the first two terms then the first 
,,three terms then the first four terms are added and continued accordingly a special type of numbers is obtained what is the special name given to these numbers find 
,,the number that is obtained if 15 of these terms are added in order to in order starting from the first term so read it carefully in the pattern of the odd number starting from 1 1 3 5 like that 7 commencing from the first term if the first two terms first is 1 first 2 terms what's the addition of first 2 terms you get for first 3 terms five five plus three eight eight plus one nice first four terms nine plus seven 16 what you get what are these numbers these are square numbers so what is the special name for this these are square numbers find the number that is obtained if 15 of these terms I added that means you're asking to find out the fifteenth - 
,,so 15th term you can use the general term so general term of the square numbers is equal to N squared the fifteenth term is 15 squared that means 15 times 15 220 question number two milk things brought to a shop to be sold were arranged on a rack in the following manner ten teens on the lowest shelf and every other shelf having 
,,one chin less than the number on the shelf below one ting on the top most shop so one next one adding so two three like that what's the lowest one that's ten things 
,,so this is like a triangle okay be right this way first shelf one second shelf two teens third shelf three teens like that last shelf the bottom shelf that's ten find a number of milk tins that were brought to the shop so that means adding all these numbers so what's the sum you can add 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus 4 plus 5 plus 6 plus 
,,seven plus eight plus nine plus ten can you remember what's the pattern there this is like one to ten addition that means this is like tenth trying unit number finding tenth triangular number so without adding up to ten you can just do this is tenth triangular number what's the generator general term of the triangular number is 
,,n into n plus one Oh - it's a substitute ten ten into eleven divided by 2 you get fifty five tins are there by two all the milk tins on the four topmost shelves were sold within two weeks find the number of milk tins that were sold so first four means 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus 4 that means fourth triangular number will substitute to 
,,the formula in equals 4 4 times 5 divided by 2 you get 10 so this is the number of teens sold within two weeks so what's the so they're asking the number of milk teens that were sold so number number of teens sold is question number three what is the sum of the integers from 1 to 31 - like that they are asking what's the sum of 
,,all digits up to 30 so we know 1 + 2 + 3 up to 30 is the 30th triangular number general term of the triangular number is n into n plus 1 divided by 2 now substitute 
,,30 there what you get divided by 2 you get 15 times 31 multiply 30 1 times 15 multiply 10 and 5 you get 5 times 1 5 5 times 3 15 465 so sum of all digits 1 - 30 is 465 so we covered all theory related to number patterns let's your first unit we'll see what we did so we did an expression in in obtain for the intern how to find out the general term and then we did always in should be a positive whole number starting from 1 you can't get fraction 4 in then the next one general term of multiples of 2 you got to win general term of odd numbers subtract 1 from that that's 2n minus 1 general term of square numbers that's N squared finally we did general term 
,,of triangular numbers that's n into n plus 1 over 2 and also we observed another thing when you add two consecutive triangular numbers you will get a square number if it's first one and second one addition of triangular numbers you get second square number eight one and ninth one triangular numbers you get nine square not so remember all these and practice with all exercises and examples when you practice you can master in number patterns

Number Partens,QH4VQDpvne0,hello children welcome to grade 8 mathematics classroom today we are going to discuss about the first lesson in grade 8 mathematics that is number patterns right before moving to the lesson i thought of telling you what you are going to learn after studying this lesson after studying this lesson you will be able to identify the 
,,n term of a given number pattern and find any term of a number pattern when the n term is given right now what is this number pattern first of all we have to have an idea what a number pattern is then we have to have an idea what the terms of the number pattern is so first of all we'll see what a number pattern is i'm going to consider about uh the odd numbers ah written from 3 to 11 in ascending order so what are the odd numbers uh from 3 to 11 just say 3 5 7 9 and 11 so we can write it in ascending order as 3 5 7 9 and 11 right now we have a look at this one so when we are writing a sequence of numbers in a certain order it may be the ascending order or the descending order so when numbers are written in a certain order according to a specific method or specific rule starting from a certain number that is called a number pattern so we should have a specific order that may be this ending order or the descending order and we should write the number sequence according to a specific method or a rule right now previously we have written a number pattern therefore why ah there was a specific order we have written it in ascending order isn't 
,,that so 3 5 7 9 and 11 that's in the ascending order what is the rule there all the numbers are odd numbers and we have to consider about this one as well every number in a given number pattern is called a term of the number pattern right once again we'll think about the numbers we have considered previously the odd number pattern from 3 to 11 we had 3 5 7 9 and 11 therefore we can say 3 5 7 9 and 11 are terms of this number pattern right we'll talk about the terms furthermore now have a look at this number pattern here i have mentioned at the number pattern of the multiples of 4 written in ascending order so what should be written there what are the terms 4 8 12 16 20 and we can write so many terms there because there's no end point specifically given isn't that so therefore we'll first of all identify about the 
,,terms so number 4 comes first therefore we can name it as the first term of the number pattern then it comes number eight that is the second term of the number pattern then number 12 so we can consider it as the third term of the number pattern then 16 is the fourth term of the number pattern and 20 is the fifth term as i have mentioned before we can write any more terms they are because they have not specifically given the end point of this number pattern now we have discussed about two types of number patterns first one was ah the number pattern where we knew the exact number of terms that was the odd number pattern starting from 3 to 11 isn't that so they are we had 3 5 7 9 and 11 that means we had only 5 terms there then we have discussed about the number pattern of multiples of 4 starting from 4 and written in ascending order they are actually we didn't know the number of terms because they have not mentioned the end point of that number pattern right therefore ah when we consider about this feature we can separate number patterns into two types first one is the finite number patterns finite number patterns in sense if we exactly know the number of terms in that number pattern or else we can say if the number of terms in the number pattern are finite we can name it as finite number pattern so we'll go through the definition of the finite number patterns number patterns in which the number of terms is finite are called finite number patterns so we can wants to an example the same example we have discussed previously this is the odd number pattern from 3 to 11. so we exactly know we have got only five terms there what are the 5 terms 3 5 7 9 and 11 right so if the number of terms is finite we have named it as finite number pattern so what about the other type if the number of terms is not finite then we can name the number pattern as infinite number pattern as we have discussed previously can you remember the number pattern of multiples of 4 starting from 4 and written in ascending order there we knew the starting point but we could write any number of terms in that number pattern because there was no end point isn't that so therefore we can move to the definition of the infinite number patterns as the number patterns in which the number of terms is not finite if the number of terms is not finite or if you can mention any number of terms in a number pattern we can call that number pattern as an infinite number pattern so we'll move on to another example there 5 10 15 20 25 and so on what is this number pattern yes it's the number pattern of multiples of 5 starting from 5 and written in ascending order right here also we know the first term second term third term but after that we can write up to any number of terms because this is an infinite number pattern so there's a special feature that we can identify an infinite number pattern how to identify an infinite number pattern if the number pattern is finite when writing the terms we can obviously write from the first term to the last term but if the number pattern is infinite we can't mention all the terms uh when listing down the terms therefore we can mention up to four or five terms after that we have to put a comma and put three dots afterwards why is that that represents that the terms can be continued because it's an infinite number pattern right by now we have discussed about uh the number patterns then the terms of the number patterns finite 
,,number patterns and infinite number patterns now we are going to discuss about the general term of the number pattern what is this general term we have discussed about the terms first term second term third term we have discussed about those terms what is this general term we'll see have a look at this example in the number pattern 2 4 6 8 and continues we can list down the terms they are first term second term first term is two second term is four third term is six fourth term is eight likewise we can list down the terms now what is this number pattern this is the number pattern of multiples of 2 starting from 2 and written in ascending order or else 
,,we can name this as the even number pattern starting from 2 and written in ascending order right but if i ask what is the 105th term of this number pattern is it easy to provide the answer quickly no isn't that so it's little difficult therefore we are going to introduce the n term of the number pattern what is this n term n term represents ah an algebraic expression that represents the general term of the number pattern so we'll see how to find the end term or how to get the general term of a number pattern here i have provided a table for you to observe a special feature we'll see first of all i have written the terms first term is 2 how can i obtain 2 when we observe this number pattern we have to have a common pattern to obtain the terms what is that we'll see first term can be obtained by multiplying the number of the term by 2. here the number of the term is 1 when we multiply it by 2 the answer is 2 therefore we got the value of the first term so we'll check it for the second term as well so number of the term is 2 multiplied by 2 so 2 multiplied by 2 yes we got the value of the second term correctly now we'll see for the third term the number of the term is 3 multiplied by 2 that means 3 multiplied by 2 is 6. yes for the third term also we got the value of the term correctly so therefore we'll check for the eighth term now now the number of the term is eight multiplied by two eight multiplied by two means sixteen once again we got the value of the term 
,,correctly therefore we are going to find an algebraic expression for the n term of this number pattern once again we will follow the same method number of the term n multiplied by 2 2 multiplied by n can be considered as 2 n therefore we can say the n term of this number pattern is 2n that means the general term of the number pattern of multiples of 2 starting from 2 and written in ascending order is 2 n right now we have constructed a general term uh to the number pattern of multiples of 2 starting from 2 and written in ascending order that is 2n so i'm going to use the general term in few questions and we'll see how we can use the general terms to get the answers for these questions quickly and correctly right this is my first question in the given number pattern part 1 what is the 12th term part 2 what is the 104th term right first of all we have to see what the given number pattern is we'll have a look at the terms of it 2 4 6 8 and it continues and they have mentioned 2n as well what is this this is the even number pattern starting from 2 and written in ascending order so we'll try to find the answer for the first one what is the 12th term before finding the 12th term we have to know what the general term is so here the general term is 2n so we need to find the 12th term therefore instead of of n we have to substitute the value 12 therefore we can easily get the answer uh for the 12th term that means value of the twelfth term here n equals twelve therefore twelfth term can be uh obtained by multiplying twelve by two the answer is twenty-four then the second question what is the 104th term once again we have to know the general term that is 2n in this case n is equals 104 why we need to find the value of the hundred and fourth term therefore we can easily get the hundred and fourth term by substituting the value of n therefore it becomes 2 multiplied by 104 so the answer is 204 right will moves to the third part of the question which term is 
,,162 at this time they are not asking about the value of the 160 second term they are not asking that they are asking which term is 162 that means the value is 162 but they don't know the number of the term they are asking us to find that therefore we can say the general term is 2n so the value we know therefore we can construct 
,,a simple equation to win equals 162 right now since it's a simple equation by now you know how to simplify this simple equation simplifying an equation in sense we have to have the unknown term in one sign and we have to take all the other values to the other side 2n means 2 multiplied by n so to get rid of the multiplication of n we have to divide both sides by 2. therefore 2n divided by 2 equals 162 divided by 2 so 2 to 2 cancel off in left hand side therefore we can get the value of n as 162 divided by 2 is 81. right now we have got uh the value of the third question as well right i have told you the general term of number pattern of the multiples of 2 starting from 2 and written in ascending order is 2n then what what can you say what is the general term of the number pattern of multiples of 3 starting from 3 
,,and written in ascending order we will see we can use the same method to find its general term so we can observe the general term of the number pattern of the multiples of 3 starting from 3 and written in ascending order is 3 n therefore we'll now consider about the general term of the number pattern of the multiples of 4 starting from 4 and written in ascending order so accordingly we can get its general term as well therefore the general term is 4n likewise the general term of the number 
,,pattern of the multiples of 7 starting from 7 and written in ascending order is 7 n likewise we can find the general term of any number pattern when it's given as a 
,,multiple of a whole number right so we'll move on to another question quickly this is my second question the general term of the number pattern of the multiples of 5 starting from 5 and written in ascending order is 5n ah here they have mentioned the general term as well so it's easy now part 1 what is the sixth term of this number pattern right here they have mentioned the general term so it's easy now as we have discussed previously when we substitute the value of n to the general term we can easily find the value of the term so we can find the sixth term as the general term is 5 n will substitute the value of n here that means the number of the term that is 6 therefore instead of n i have put 6 there so 6 multiplied by 5 is 30 therefore the sixth term of this number pattern is 30 right second question what is the 15th term of this number pattern once again we can easily find the 15th term as here the n is equals 15. so the general term is 5n we'll substitute the value of n therefore we can get 15 multiplied by 5 so the 15 term of this num pattern is 75 right so we'll move on to the third part of the question now which term is 125 right as we have discussed previously this time also they are not asking about the value of the 125th term they are telling the value is 125 they want to know which term is it right therefore once again the general term is 5 n so we can construct a simple equation as 5n equals 125 once again 5n means 5 multiplied by n therefore to get rid of the multiplication of 5 we have to divide both sides by 5 then it becomes 5n divided by 5 equals 125 divided by 5 therefore we can get the value for n as 25 that means 125 is the 25th term of this number pattern right then let's move on to the fourth part of the same question is 7 to 1 a term of this number pattern what are the reasons for your answer so here inside the same question they are asking us about two things first of all we have to check whether 31 is a term of this number pattern or not then we have to provide reasons here providing reasons in sense you have to show the workings ah and we have to show whether 71 is a term of the number pattern or not right now here the value is 71 if we are having value 71 in this number pattern we should have constructed this equation simple equation 5n equals 71. so if 71 is a value when we simplify this simple equation we should get a positive integer or else a whole number as the answer for n why is that n means the 
,,number of the term always the number of this term should be a positive integer or else a positive whole number so we'll check we'll construct the equation 5n equals 
,,71 once again 5n means 5 multiplied by n therefore to simplify this we have to divide both sides by 5 therefore it becomes 5 n divided by 5 equals 71 divided by 5 so here we can get an answer for n as 14 1 over 5 ah the other answer is not a positive integer so can we have a mixed number as the number of the term no obviously you should have a positive integer uh as the number of the term why we count uh in positive integers or else the counting numbers therefore here the answer is not a positive integer therefore we can say 71 cannot be a term of this number pattern right that is the end of that question we'll move on to another question what is the general term of the number pattern of multiples of 3 which is more than 2 but less than 311 i'll read it once again what is the general term of the number pattern of 
,,multiples of 3 which is more than 2 but less than 311 here they are asking about the general term ah of the number pattern uh of multiples of three and written in ascending order by now you know how to get the general term isn't that so therefore the general term is three n then they ask if the least value of n is 1 find the greatest value that can be taken for n right n means here the number of the terms so if the least value of the number of the terms is 1 therefore they are asking about 
,,ah the greatest value for n that means they are asking about the final term of this number pattern since they have mentioned this number pattern is in between 2 and 
,,311 we can observe that it's a finite number pattern so how to find the final term of this number pattern we'll see so here if 311 is a term of this number pattern we should have constructed an equation as 3 n equals 311 here we have taken 311 because this is uh the value is less than 311 so obviously the value should be less than that but we'll just consider 311 as a value we know that it's not a term of this number pattern but we need to get the greatest term first therefore to find the greatest term we'll construct this equation and then we'll try to simplify it the number of the term the value for n which we can get here by simplifying this equation would help us to find the greatest term or the last term of this number pattern right now here 3 n equals 311 once again 3n means 3 multiplied by n therefore to simplify this i need to have n alone in my left hand side therefore i'm dividing both sides by 3 therefore we can get a value for n as 103 2 over 3 right as i have mentioned before 311 is not a term of this number pattern it's not the value of a term but this answer would help us to find the greatest term or the last term of this 
,,number pattern right since we can't have 103 2 over 3 terms we can observe that the greatest term should be the hundred and third term so we can say the highest value which can be taken by n is 103 therefore 103 is the final term of this number pattern right now we have discussed about the general term of the number patterns of 
,,multiples of whole numbers and written in ascending order now we are going to cons consider about the general term of the odd number pattern starting from 1 and written in ascending order right now what are the terms they are the odd number patterns starting from 1 and written in ascending order we can get 1 3 5 7 9 11 likewise 
,,we can have any number of terms because the i'm talking about an infinite number pattern right once again we are going to construct the general term so we will try to observe a pattern there so here have a look at this table that i have given first term is 1 therefore 1 is going to be obtained like this have a look at this one the first term of the multiples of 2 starting from 2 is 2 so we got it by multiplying the number of terms by 2. here i'm going to obtain the first term of the odd number pattern starting from 1 and written in ascending order by multiplying the number of terms by 2 and subtracting 1 from that so when we consider about the first term the number of term is 1 multiplied by 2 is 2 into 1 2 subtracting 1 from that means 2 minus 1 the answer is 1 therefore we got the value of the first term so we'll use the same method for the second term as well the number of the term is 2 multiplied by 2 means 2 multiplied by 2 4 subtracting 1 from that means 4 minus 1 that 
,,is 3 ah we got the value of the second term also correctly so we'll check for the third term the number of the term is 3 multiplied by 2 means 3 into 2 6 subtracting 1 from that means 6 minus 1 equals 5 we got the value of the third term also correctly using this method so we'll check for the eighth term now now the number of the term is eight multiplied by two means eight multiplied by two sixteen subtracting one from that means 16 minus one is 15 right according to this method we are going to find uh the general term that means an algebraic expression for the n term so when we consider about the n term number of the term is n multiplied by 2 means 2 
,,n subtracting 1 from that means 2 n minus 1 therefore we can say the general term of the odd number pattern starting from 1 and written in ascending order is 2 n minus 1 right now we know the general term of the odd number pattern as well so we'll try to use this general term of odd number pattern starting from 1 and written in 
,,ascending order in few questions and we'll see whether it helps us to find the answers quickly so this is my first question in the odd number pattern 1 3 5 7 and continues starting from 1 and written in ascending order first one what is the general term we have already obtained that that is 2 n minus 1 second one they are asking us to find the love and term as i have mentioned before using the general term it's really easy to find the value of a term the only thing we have to do is we have 
,,to substitute the value of n now here n is equals 11 therefore we can substitute the value of n ah so it becomes 2 multiplied by 11 minus 1 so 2 multiplied by 11 is 
,,22 22 minus 1 is 21 so the 11 term of this number pattern is 21. then the third one ah what is the 34th term once again we can find it quickly using the general term we'll substitute the value of n here the n is equals 34 so we can get the equation as twice of 34 minus 1 so 2 into 34 means 68 68 minus 1 is 67 so 67 is the value 
,,of the 34th term of this number pattern right we almost the fourth question as well which term is 127 here they are not once again they are not asking about the 127th term they are saying which term is 127. that means the value of the term is 127 they need to know the number of the term so once again we can construct a simple equation using the general term therefore once again we can construct a simple equation using the general term so it becomes 2 n minus 1 is equals to 120 once again it's a simple equation by now you know how to simplify a simple equation simplifying and simple equation in sense we have to have the unknown term in one side and we have to move all the other values to the other side therefore in my left hand side i have got 2 multiplied by n minus 1 so first of all we have to get rid of ah this 
,,minus 1 therefore we have to add 1 to both sides so 2 n minus 1 plus 1 equals 127 plus 1 so in my left hand side now i have 2 n in my right hand side now i have 127 
,,plus 1 means 128 right now only the multiplication is there in my left hand side so 2 n means 2 multiplied by n so to get rid of the multiplication of 2 we have to divide both sides by 2 therefore we can get the value of n as 64. that means 127 is the 64th term of this number pattern right then we'll move on to the fifth part of the question part five which term is the greatest odd number less than 150 right now they are asking about the number of the term of the greatest odd number uh less than 150 so first of all we have to know what the greatest of odd number less than 150 we all know that 150 is an even number one less than that should be the greatest odd number less than 150 therefore one less than that means 149 right now therefore they are asking about the number of the term of 149 so once again we can construct a simple equation using the general term so 2 n minus 1 equals 149 once again we have to first of all get rid of minus 1 therefore i have add 1 for both sides 
,,so it becomes 2 n minus 1 plus 1 equals 149 plus 1 so in my left hand side i have got 2 n only in my right hand side i have got 150 only right now to find the value 
,,of n i have divided both sides by 2. so 2n divided by 2 it becomes n 115 divided by 2 it becomes 75 that means 149 is the 75th term of this number pattern right by now uh from the beginning we have discussed about the number two patterns then the terms of the number patterns then we have movements to the infinite number patterns infinite number patterns then we have discussed about uh the general term of the number patterns of multiples of whole numbers right now we are going to discuss about the general term of the square number pattern right you have already learned what square numbers are right have a look at this one the first now i have represented these square numbers using dots as well can you remember when you are in grade 6 you have represented square numbers using dots isn't that so so the first term of 
,,the square number pattern can be obtained by 1 multiplied by 1 is 1 square they how to get one multiplied by one here we have got one row and one column in this square of the first term so second term when we consider about the figure we have got two rows and 2 columns so we can get the value of it 2 multiplied by 2 that means square of 2 third term there are 3 columns and 3 rows therefore it becomes 3 multiplied by 3 3 squared likewise fourth term fifth term sixth term up to any number of 
,,terms you can obtain the values by multiplying the number of rows and columns of the ah picture representation right now we will have a look at the values of those so the first term as i have mentioned before 1 multiplied by 1 that is 1 squared that means the value is 1 the value of the first term is 1 likewise the value of the 
,,second term can be obtained by multiplying 2 by 2 that is 2 squared so that is equals to 2 likewise the third term 3 multiplied by 3 that is 3 squared that means 9. 
,,likewise we will have a look at the 10th term we can get the 10 term by multiplying the number of term by itself now the ten term number of the term is ten so ten multiplied by ten that is ten squared equals hundred according to this pattern we can get the nth term or the general term so here number of term multiplied by the number of term so when we consider about n term n multiplied by n that is equals to n squared therefore we can say the general term of the pattern of the square numbers starting from 1 and written in ascending order is n squared right now we know the general term of the square number pattern starting from 1 and written in ascending order then we are going to talk about the general term of the triangular number pattern right ah we have learnt about triangular numbers in previous grades as well 
,,isn't that so now how to get the first of it first term you have got one dot i have mentioned the picture representation of the triangular numbers as well when we consider about the first term we have got only one dot that means the value of the first term is 1 second term you can get 1 plus 2 so the value is 3 likewise you can 
,,get the value of the term third term by adding 1 plus 2 plus 3 the sum is 6 therefore the value of the third term is 6. so when we consider about the fourth term that is 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4 so the sum is equals to 10 that means the value of the fourth term is 10 therefore have a look at this now using this pattern using the previous pattern it's not easy to construct a general term therefore i'm going to double the triangular numbers or the value of the terms of the triangular numbers and try to construct a general term for this triangular number pattern we know that for the first term we you got only one dot now i am going to join two such values together right here in each and every term i have joined two such values together that means i have doubled the amount right ah for the first term i should have only 
,,one triangle but here i have joined two two ah two together so when we join uh two triangles together we'll consider about the number of rows and number of columns now so look at the first one there's only one row but two columns second one we have got two rows and three columns third one we have got three rows and four columns 
,,fourth one we have got four rows and five columns when you double it you can observe the number of rows is equals to the number of the term number of the columns is 
,,always equals to one more than the number of the terms so by multiplying these oh my counting the dots of these always we get the twice of or as double of the value 
,,of a term of the triangular number pattern therefore i am going to use that method but as i have mentioned before we'll get the value doubled of 8 therefore i have divided the value by 2. so previously you got in the first one one row two columns so i'm going to multiply the values number of rows and number of columns together 1 multiplied by 2 by multiplying it i'll get the value of two triangles i want the value of one triangle therefore i am going to divide it by two we consider about the second one the number of rows is two number of columns is three by multiplying the number of rows and columns you will get the value of two such triangles but i want the value of one such triangle therefore i am dividing the value by two so have a look at this table once again so 1 multiplied by 2 divided by 2 then i can get the value of the first term of the triangular number pattern value of the second term we'll get 2 multiplied by 3 divided by 2 uh you got the value as 3 that is the value of the second term of the triangular number pattern likewise third term can be obtained by multiplying 3 into 4 divided by 2 that is 6 that is the value of the 
,,third term so when we consider about the fourth term we can obtain the value by multiplying 4 by 5 divided by 2 so the value is 10 that is the value of the fourth term of the number pattern then likewise the 10th term can be obtained by multiplying 10 with 11 divided by 2 so 10 multiplied by 11 means 110 divided by 2 is 55 so according to the same method we can construct an algebraic expression for the n term so n term can be obtained by multiplying the number of the term that means n with 
,,the number of the term plus 1 that means n plus 1 divided by 2. therefore we can construct the general term of the triangular number pattern starting from 1 and written in ascending order as n into n plus 1 divided by 2 right now i'm going to move on to some questions which are there in your textbook so quickly take out your textbook this is the fifth question of exercise 1.4 that is they are in page number 11. so quickly take out your textbooks and read the question before me right before 
,,providing the answer for the question we have to have a look at this one just have a look now here it's about triangular numbers so we got the general term of the triangular number pattern starting from 1 and written in ascending order is n into n plus 1 divided by 2. it's it can be written without mentioning the multiplication 
,,sign right now we know the general term of the triangular number pattern so now we'll move on to the question find the total number of triangles in each of the following figures right now we have got four figures we can see some triangles there so we'll count the number of triangles present in part one we can see only one triangle in part two we can see two small triangles and a and one big triangle therefore all together it becomes one plus two three third one we can see three small triangles little big big triangles and one bigger triangle therefore ah all together 1 plus 2 plus 3 there are 6 triangles when you have a look at the fourth one what can 
,,you say there are 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4 number of triangles that means you can you have got 10 triangles right now i have put some dots after that also because i have understand what this pattern is this is the tranquil number pattern starting from 1 and written in ascending order right now how look at this one the pattern of the total number of triangles in the figures in the given order is identical to the pattern of the triangular numbers starting from 1 and written in ascending order ah now that's what we have already mentioned find the total number of triangles in the eighth figure that is drawn according to this pattern right if we are going to 
,,draw triangles according to this pattern they are asking about the number of triangles in the eighth figure right now we have identified the values represents the triangular number pattern starting from 1 and written in ascending order that means we can relate the question like this they are asking about the value of the a term 
,,of this number pattern right now we already know the general term of the triangular number pattern that is n into n plus 1 divided by 2 right now using this general 
,,term i'm going to find the 8th term right now 8th term can be taken by n into n plus 1 divided by 2 i'm going to substitute the value of n so here n equals 8 therefore it becomes 8 into 8 plus 1 divided by 2. when you simplify it 18 to 8 plus 1 means 9 18 to 9 means 72 72 divided by 2 means 36 that means the value of the 8th term is 36 right now i'm going to have a look at the first question in your miscellaneous exercise of unit 1 that's there in page number 12 quickly turn to that page please now the question in the pattern of the odd numbers starting from one commencing from the first term if the first two terms then the first three terms then the first four terms are added and continued accordingly a special type of number is obtained part 1 what is the special name given to these numbers so first of all we'll roughly write down what they are telling here first term then the first two terms then the sum of first three terms then the sum of first four terms likewise now the first term is 1 1 can be written as 1 squared as well 1 squared is also equals to 1 so uh sum of the first two terms 1 plus 3 that is equals to 4 so 4 i can write 
,,it as 2 squared next one 1 plus 3 plus 5 that is equals to 9 so 9 can be written as 3 squared or likewise here when we consider about these answers we can observe ah it's another number pattern what is this here the answers represents the square numbers right part two find the number that is obtained if 15 of these terms are added in order starting from the first term right now 15 of these terms are going to be added right once again i'll have the sketch now they are asking about the sum of the 15 of the terms right now we have previously observed that the answer of these additions is equals to the square number pattern therefore they are asking about 
,,the 15 term of the square number pattern therefore we can easily get the answer for this question by finding the 15th term we know that the general term of the square number pattern is n squared so we'll substitute the value of n here n equals 15 so we can get the value by multiply 15 by 15 that is 225 right now that is the final question that i have to discuss today so before winding up the lesson i'm going to recall the things that we have learned today that means i'm going to summarize the lesson first we have learned what a number pattern is then what the terms of the number patterns are then we have discussed about the n term of the number pattern that means the general term of the number pattern finally we have discussed how to obtain the values of the terms using the general term of number patterns under that we have discussed about the number pattern of multiples of a whole number then the number patterns of odd numbers then the number patterns of square numbers finally the number patterns of triangular numbers right now it's your time to do the homework that is you have to complete the exercises given in your textbook so that's 
,,it for today so if you have missed the lesson or else if you want to go through the lesson once again you can watch the lesson through the youtube channel channel nie so that's it for today see you in another lesson take care you

Number Partens,8OcQPkfC74c,in this lesson we are simply going to extend patterns okay so the first thing that I just want to clear up with you as you must remember that they are always two ways that you can find your and your numbers in a sequence the first one is your term to term relationship okay which means you are going to try to link the first term 
,,to the second term and the second to the third and the third to the fourth so we get a check it is the relationship between the terms that's your first option your next option is your position two term relationship okay which means you are going to try to connect the position of the term like this is 1st 2nd 3rd 4th position of 
,,the term to the value of the term like for instance in this first sequence or this first pattern the fourth term is minus 7 so the value of the fourth term would be 
,,minus 7 but when you simply ask to extend the pattern it's much easier for you to try to see if there's not a relationship between the terms ok it's much quicker okay but if you if you see that you're running against a wall you and you can't find the term determine relationship you're going to consider a position to term relationship alright let's have a look at the first one now the first thing that I always do is I check if the numbers in the pattern is getting smaller or if they are getting bigger which means if it's an increasing function getting bigger or a decreasing function now if you look at this first guy if we put put these numbers on a number line okay they should tune it's like that zero that will be your minus 1 that would be a minus 4 and that would be a minus 7 then you can clearly see that this sequence is a decreasing sequence okay your values are getting smaller and smaller now in a case like that you can consider your relationship from the one term to the 
,,next term to be either a minus or a division these are all operations that would make your values smaller or maybe a root okay so let's have a look now the first thing we will do is let's look from leads to how we would move from 2 to minus 1 okay now from to 2-1 we will subtract three how did I get that so quickly okay so what 
,,I do is I take my second term let me just rewrite them yeah I take my second term and I say turn to a minus term one what is that I go minus one minus two that gives me a minus three let me check for the next one and so on minus four minus minus one so I'm gonna take term 3 minus 2 2 which is minus 4 minus minus 1 remember that 
,,minus and minus will give you a plus so you'll have minus 4 plus 1 which will give you minus 3 again and you'll see the same a class through the next one minus 7 minus minus 4 will also give me minus 3 so here I'm sitting with a common difference of minus 3 we call that a common difference and we can say our common difference is a minus 3 which means that in order to extend our pattern we simply have 2 minus 3 every time we actually saying we're adding a minus 3 every time so what we'll do 
,,is to move on from minus 7 I'll go minus 7 minus 3 and again minus 3 to get to the next term and again minus 3 to get to the next term okay let's see what that will 
,,be minus 7 minus 3 will give me a minus 10 minus 10 minus 3 will give me minus 13 and minus 13 minus 3 will give me minus 16 and those are my next three terms I used the term to term relationship which means I checked how are the terms related to each other right let's look at the next guy they gave us five fifteen forty five 135 is we can clearly see here now all positive numbers so we can clearly see this increasing sequence which means the numbers are getting bigger and bigger so I'm gonna definitely consider addition multiplication and maybe squaring or cubing or something like that in order to make the numbers bigger and bigger so let's have a look how they are relighted 15 and I've got a 45 I'm just gonna work with the first three you actually only need the first three terms let's see if the if they've added something five plus what gives me 15 that's a ten but 15 plus ten again will give me 25 now there's definitely not a difference of ten okay but literally if they didn't maybe so that's not gonna work let's check if they're in maybe multiply about something so let's see five multiplied by what will give me 15 you can also work the opposite way and say 15 divided by five what is that that gives me three let me look at the next guy as well 45 divided by 15 again what is that that is three as 
,,well so what they've done is they've multiplied by three to go from the first to the second term they've actually multiplied by three and to move from the second to 
,,the third term they've also multiplied by three now this value here we call a common ratio it's called a ratio because we're dividing to get to that term the same as the previous one can you remember we subtracted to get to it so that's why it was called a difference so my common ratio which also mikuma or is equal to three year so this differently a term to term relationship year so we can simply go on with that sequence let's move on from 135 and what we going to do is we're going to multiply by three to get the next term and then we're going to again multiply by three to get the next term and we're going to multiply by three to get the next term and these numbers are gonna get a lot 135 multiplied by 3 that will give me 405 multiplied by 3 again will give me 1215 I think and if I take that one again and I multiply that by 3 I should get three thousand six hundred and forty five and that will be my last three terms huge terms our tiffni suggests use your calculator take them okay let's have a look at the last guy okay they gave us here a 1 a 4 and 9 and a 16 ok increasing sequence again so I'm going to check firstly for term to term relationship have they added something from to move from the one to the other or have them maybe multiply it by something to move from the the one term to the next term okay right I'm gonna check first for common difference which means that they add something let me see 4 minus 1 will give me 3 let's check 9 minus 4 gives me 5 and no this is definitely no common difference okay let's check for a common ratio let's check 4 divided by 1 will give me 4 9 divided by 4 is definitely not gonna give me 4 so this is also not a common ratio so my term to term has not been too successful okay I'm gonna try position to turn just check the handwriting cars it's getting worse and worse position to term okay so let's find our positions here let's check this was the first term this is the second term this is the third term and this is a fourth term now you're going to check is there any connection between 1 & 1 2 & 4 3 & 9 & 4 & 16 yes I think that's quite clear I can see that 1 squared 1 squared will give me 1 2 squared will give me 4 3 squared will give me 9 4 squared will give me 16 so what they're doing is they're taking the position of the term and 
,,they squaring it so actually if you would look at the formula of this yeah it will be in squared you take the position every time and you square it okay great so if 
,,they want to you see they've given us 1 4 9 16 so they want the first term now I want that guy so we're gonna take 5 squared for the next term which is 25 six squared for the next term which is 36 and seven squared for the next term which is 49 great that's the rest of our sequence

Number Partens,f4c8izcEX4s,hello graduate children today i'm here to teach you chapter four in your textbook that's directed numbers we can call it directed numbers as well so we'll see what are the basics here what is this one what what you call this one this is a number line so starting point is 0 and then towards the right hand side you get positive numbers towards left hand side you get negative numbers so 0 plus 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4 like that towards this side to the right side minus 1 minus 2 minus 3 to the left side of 0. what about in between in between means any decimals or fractions in between the whole numbers but only we mark the integers half 0.5 is in between 0 and 1. so any fraction or decimal in between the integers now what are these plus 1 plus 1.2 plus 3.5 these are directed numbers there's a direction that's why we use plus or minus so here it's better to write directed numbers in brackets because we can see that whether it's towards positive side or towards negative side now here use plus for addition and subtraction we use minus sign so therefore it is better to write directed numbers in brackets so here minus 3 means to the left side of 0 
,,3 units to the left plus 8 means towards right hand side plus 5 towards right hand side minus 4 towards left hand side so when you want to show directed numbers sign is important and make sure that you put brackets now what are the properties in directed numbers magnitude and the direction so what is magnitude means the size of 
,,the directed number just a number direction means whether it's positive or negative so consider plus 3 what's the magnitude there you take only the number plus 3 that is the distance on the number line from 0 to plus 3 this is towards right hand side plus sign represent the number is in the right hand side to zero consider minus five directed number what's the magnitude there magnitude is five so what's the meaning of that magnitude 5 means starting from 0 to -5 distance from 0 to -5 and minus means the number is in the left hand side to zero write down the magnitude and the direction for given directed numbers plus seven so what's the magnitude 7 what's the direction plus plus means to the right minus 8 magnitude is 8 minus means to the left of 0 plus 4 4 is the magnitude this is to the right and minus 10 10 is the magnitude this is to the left 0 that's not moving so magnitude 0 and what's the direction none not moving left or right minus six means six is the magnitude minus means to the left plus 12 plus 12 means magnitude is 12 and plus means to the right now look at this one numbers with the same magnitude and opposite signs are located in equal distance from zero when you add these the answer is zero now what it means now take this one so here i can start minus 3 minus 2 minus 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 like that minus 3 what it means 0 to minus 3 distance plus 3 means 0 to right hand side distance so these two distances are the same when you add what happens opposite 
,,sides get cancel out and you get 0 if this is plus 7 to get 0 you need to add minus 7. if this is 0 plus 8 is there that means you have to add minus a and if this is minus 10 is there you have to add plus 10 to get 0. so we call it's the additive inverse additive inverse means if you take plus 3 minus 3 is the additive inverse of plus 3. now if you take plus 7 what's the additive inverse that's minus 7 minus 12 what's the additive inverse of minus 12 that's plus 12 when you add these you get zero addition of directed numbers so what we do so plus 2 plus 5 so we can start from plus 2 in grade 7 you did starting with 0. now we can start with plus 2. so plus 2 is there here and adding plus 4 so straight away 4 units from here 1 2 3 4 so the answer you are getting here is the final answer so what is plus 2 plus 4 that's plus 6 so the answer is plus 6. start from plus 2 and move 4 places to the right answer is obtained from the last position on the number line let's take this one 
,,minus 3 so start with -3 plus plus means to the right and plus 4 means you are moving 4 places to the right 1 2 3 4 so you're moving to this side so what's minus 3 plus 4 answer is plus 1 this one negative 2 plus negative 3 so starting from negative 2 and adding negative 3 adding means to the right but you are subtracting here another minus three now again you have to go back to left so another three one two three to the left side so what's the final answer minus 2 adding 3 places to the left so final answer is minus 5. so start from minus 2 and move 3 places to the left answer is obtained from the position on the number line find minus 4 plus 7 so starting from minus 4 plus seven that means moves to the right seven places one two three four five six seven so here to here so what's the final position plus 3 here 2 this is 3 so plus 3 is the answer this one plus seven and minus eight so here plus seven starting point is plus seven adding and here minus eight so minus means you have to move eight places to the left one two three four five six seven eight so this is the final position so what's the answer minus one plus 4 plus minus 7 so starting point is plus 4 plus and minus 7 means moves 7 places to the left so what's the answer 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 so here 2 here so the final position is minus 3 write down the answer at once now all are positive and addition so what you do just add the numbers and put the sign positive both numbers are positive answer is also positive and value is the sum of the two numbers so you can do at once 5 plus 3 8 sine is positive 7 plus 2 9 sine is positive 6 plus 4 10 sine is positive 8 plus 6 fourteen sign is positive nine plus one ten sign is positive and four plus four eight sine is positive write down the answer at once now what happens you get both negatives and addition sign is there so what we do both numbers are negative answer is also negative and the value is the sum of the two numbers if both are negative just add it 3 plus 2 5 but the sign is negative 5 and 3 8 here negative 7 plus 6 13 negative 30 5 and 5 10 that's negative 10 9 plus 2 11 that's negative 11 and four plus four eight that's negative eight write down the answer at once now what happens one is positive and the other one is negative so what we do here addition of directed numbers with opposite signs ignore the sign and take the difference between the two values sine of the answer is always the sign of the larger number so what we do take the difference 7 and 2 difference is 5. and which one is a bigger plus 7 so the answer is plus 5. 6 and 3 difference is 3 positive 6 is the bigger one it's plus 3 10 and 4 what's the difference 6 but large number is negative so negative 6 here 11 and 8 what's the difference 3 large number is positive so you put positive 3 subtraction of directed numbers now you are asked to find out plus 4 minus minus 2 using number line so what's the starting value plus 4 here subtraction is left and minus 2 you need to get the opposite direction so that means plus 2 so 2 places to the right so you get 6 is the answer so we can write plus 4 minus minus 2 is plus 6. this one find minus 3 minus minus 5 using number line so minus 3 is the starting point minus means left subtraction and minus 5 you have to consider the opposite that means five places to the right one two three four five so you get plus two so minus three minus minus five is plus 2. find the answer using number line so starting value is plus 3 minus minus means left here plus 4 so left 4 places 1 2 3 4 so you get this number so what's the answer minus 1. 5 minus minus 7 start with minus 5 okay so these are all positive numbers and here minus is left and another minus means opposite direction seven places to the right one two three four five six seven so you get plus 2 as the answer so make sure that you put brackets so the answer is plus 2. this one plus 4 is the starting point minus plus 6 means 6 places to the left 1 2 3 4 5 6. 6 places to the left the final as is minus 2 so you can write -2 there zero minus minus four what's the starting value zero and here minus and another minus get cancel out so you are moving four places to the right one two three four what's the final answer you get plus four so here also plus four is the answer this one 0 that means starting point is 0 minus plus 5 means moves 5 places to the left 1 2 3 4 5. you get minus 5 so what's the answer minus 5 is the directed number plus 2 minus plus 4 starting value is plus 2. this is all positive and minus to the left 4 units 1 2 three four so here this way so the answer is minus two write down the answer at once now you know what you have to do so here 7 and these all this is positive both positive and the subtraction just subtract 7 minus 5 plus 2 8 minus 4 what's 8 minus 4 plus 4 10 minus 6 you get 4 and this is plus 4 9 and plus 5 difference is 4 and this is plus 4 6 and 4 subtraction you get plus 2 11 and 9 
,,you need to subtract 11 minus 9 2 11 minus 9 is 2 that's plus 2 this side minus 3 and plus 4 now so here difference is 1 and look at this one so you have to add starting from minus 3 move 4 places to the left again so what's the answer 4 and 3 you get 7 that's minus 7 this one starting from minus 5 moves 9 places towards left side 9 plus 5 14 that's minus starting from minus 10 you are moving 12 places again to the left side so you are adding these two numbers so 22 and this is minus 8 and 
,,4 addition is 12 and this is minus because starting value is minus 4 you move 8 places to the left starting point is minus 9 move 11 places to the left that means just add these two numbers starting from minus seven subtract plus eight means moves eight places to the left eight plus seven fifteen that's minus additive inverse we know if it's plus 2 when you add minus 2 to both sides what happens you get plus 2 n minus 2 becomes 0 so you get x equals minus 2 so what's the additive inverse of plus 2 that's minus 2 so minus 2 is the additive inverse of plus 2 addition of additive inverse numbers the answer is 0 so when you add additive inverse you get the answer 0. now we'll see these numbers you are getting 0. how you get 0 when you add additive inverse plus 3 when you add additive inverse of plus 3 that's minus 3 you get 0 minus 2 there when you add plus 2 you get 0 minus 8 when you add plus 8 you get 0 plus 9 when you add minus 9 you get 0 minus 3 additive inverse is plus 3 minus 7 additive inverse of that is plus 7 to get 0 plus 11 additive inverse is minus 11 when you add additive inverse values you get 0 write down the additive inverse of given numbers plus 3 or 3 inverse minus 3 minus 8 plus 8 is the additive inverse 9 is minus 9 minus 6 that means plus 6 plus 11 means minus 11 is the additive inverse minus 1.5 plus 1.5 plus three and a half minus three and a half minus six point three plus six point three and plus seven and a half means minus seven and a half minus 2 1 4 means plus 2 and 1 4 so these are the additive inverse of these numbers now when you have two numbers directed numbers to subtract what you can do you can add the additive inverse and change the question for example if the question is plus 5 minus plus 2 that means you can add the additive inverse of plus 2. so this is same as plus five plus of minus two so both cases you get the same answer so here also plus five and minus two phi minus two is plus three then subtraction means moves two places to the left that is also plus three so subtraction of directed numbers means addition of additive inverse of that number write down the following subtractions as addition of additive inverse and find the answer now how can i write this question plus 7 i can write plus of minus 2 adding these two numbers so what we can do 7 and subtract 2 you get plus 5 plus 6 minus becomes plus additive inverse of minus 5 is plus 5. so you get 6 and 5 addition that's plus 11 plus 6 is there minus becomes plus of the additive inverse that's minus 2 that means 6 minus 2 you get plus minus nine and here additive inverse of minus five is plus five so nine and five addition we take the difference and put the sign of the larger number it's minus 4. this one minus 11 is there addition of additive inverse is minus 3 then minus 11 minus 3 both are the same sign add it and put the minus sign so minus 40. here also you can do the same thing minus 8 adding the additive inverse of minus 4 that's plus 4. so take the difference that's 4 put the sign of the bigger number that's minus 4 minus 6 addition of the additive inverse that's minus 3 both signs are the same so add it and put the sign minus 9 plus 11 addition of the additive inverse that's plus 3 11 plus 3 14 that's plus minus 12 additive inverse of plus 
,,3 is minus 3 both negative so add it that's 15 both negative so you get the answer also negative minus 9 adding of the additive inverse of minus 5 that's plus 5. so 
,,this is the difference because 1 is positive and 1 is negative and they put the sign of the larger numbers you get minus 4 for subtraction write down the addition of additive inverse numbers and find the answer same thing i can write minus as the plus of the additive inverse so you get 11 plus 3 40. now we'll do this one minus 6. plus 3 here you can convert to addition of additive inverse of minus 8 that's plus now these two you can add 8 plus 3 11 11 minus 6 you get 5 that's positive this 
,,one minus 9 plus minus 2 and here convert to addition of the additive inverse that's plus 6. so minus 2n minus 9 minus 11 minus 11 and plus 6 means the difference is 5 the bigger number is minus 11 so you get minus 5 minus 1 plus 8 minus becomes additive inverse of that that's plus 3 and plus plus 2. 8 plus 3 11 11 plus 2 plus 30. this one plus 11 and here convert to positive addition of additive inverse of minus 4 is plus 4 and here also adding the additive inverse of minus 2 is plus 2. now all are positive just add the numbers 11 plus 4 15 15 plus 2 17 multiplication of directed numbers so what we do ignore the sign just multiply the two numbers and 
,,then what you do if both signs are the same answer is positive always if the signs are different you get a negative answer 3 times 2 6 plus plus both signs are the same you get plus 6 2 and 2 4 both pluses plus 4 2 and 1 2 both pluses you get plus so remember same sign you get always positive when you multiply by zero what happens multiplication of directed number by zero is always zero now look at this one multiply the directed numbers 3 times 2 6 and this is plus 2 times 2 4 and this is plus 1 times 2 2 same sign you get plus 0 times plus 2 you get 0. so when you look at this side you see a pattern 6 4 2 0 what are these numbers minus 2 minus 4 and minus 6 will check whether it's true both numbers are not the same now same sign 1 is negative and 1 is positive so the answer is negative so 2 times 1 2 you get negative 2 2 times 2 4 you get negative 4 3 times 2 6 negative 6 because 1 is positive the other one is negative so here you need to remember multiplication of positive 
,,numbers answer is always positive multiplication of positive number with a negative number answer is negative write down the answer once answer is positive when multiply two positive numbers so all these are positive numbers so you get positive answer 5 times 3 50 plus 15. 4 times 3 12. so plus 12 two times six twelve plus twelve seven times two fourteen plus fourteen and four times four sixteen that's plus sixteen one times three three that's plus three eight times two sixteen plus sixteen eleven times two twenty two that's plus six times three eighty that's plus 10 times 440 that's plus find the answer 3 times -2 ignore the sign and here 1 is positive and 1 is negative you get the answer negative this is 4 minus 4 1 times 2 2 this is minus 2. 0 times -2 is 0 now look at this one same sign minus and minus so you 
,,get positive 2 2 times 2 plus 4 because both are negative both are negative you get plus 6 so what's the thing you need to remember multiplication of positive number and a negative number is always a negative answer answer is negative multiplication of two negative numbers the answer is positive write down the answer at once answer is negative and multiply a positive and a negative number now plus as minus here all these 1 is positive the other number is negative so always the answer is negative 3 times 2 6 that's negative 6 3 times 2 6 negative 6 4 times 4 16 negative 16 6 times two twelve that's negative twelve eight times five forty that's negative 
,,forty six times three eighteen that's negative eighteen eight times two sixteen negative sixteen here nine times one nine negative nine four times four sixty that's 
,,negative two times 11 22 that's negative one negative and one positive answer is always negative write down the answer at once answer is positive and multiply two negative numbers in all these both numbers are negative so the final answer is positive three times two six five times one five six times two twelve eight times three 
,,twenty-four nine times two eighteen then 4 times 3 12 5 times 3 15 11 times 1 that's plus 11 10 times 2 20 9 times 3 27 so here both negative means the final answer 
,,is positive write down the answer at once yeah you get combination sometimes positive sometimes negative both negative answer is positive one is negative one is positive answer is negative one is positive one is negative answer is negative so you need to multiply separate 9 times to 80. both negative answer is positive 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative so 10 times 3 30. 11 times 3 33 both negative that means plus one negative one positive answer is negative both negative positive answer one negative one positive answer is negative both negative answer is positive 9 times 4 36 both negative means answer is positive 12 times 224 one negative one positive answer is negative write down the answer at once look at all these questions multiplied by zero when you multiply any number by zero what's the answer 
,,you always get zero so what are these answers all these are zeros because you are multiplying by zero any number with zero is always zero find the value now you can 
,,take 2 at a time and find the answer 4 times 3 12 but it's negative now both negative the answer is positive twelve times five sixty plus one minus four and minus two four times two eight both negative means plus plus say ten minus 3 multiplication 8 times 3 24 1 is plus 1 is negative means you get a negative answer this one minus 9 minus 1 both negative means plus 9 now multiply with 4 9 times 4 36 both positive means the answer also positive minus 5 times 2 you get a negative answer because 1 is positive and the other one is negative multiplied by negative both negative now so you get a positive answer again take 2 at a time 8 times 3 24 both positive one is positive one is negative so first multiply four times four sixteen one remaining four times two eight plus one nine one plus and one negative answer is negative both negative you get a plus answer plus 33 and when you multiply by a negative the answer is a negative one both negative you get plus answer 3 times 2 6. here you can do separately these two 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative 4 times 3 12. now 12 times 6 ignore sign and multiply 6 times 2 12 1 remaining and here 72 is it positive or negative 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative here 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is 12 there minus 12 negative 12. both negative answer is positive 4. now 12 times 4 48 what's the sign one negative one positive answer is negative this one again take two at a time negative both you get positive 10 positive both you get positive 6 now multiply both positive you get positive 60. here both negative negative negative you get positive answer here negative negative positive answer now positive positive multiplication you get positive answer 9 times 4 is 30 6. find the value just multiply by two first two times one two two times three six what's the sign one negative one positive answer is negative multiply by two two times one two two times five ten ten point two is the answer both 
,,negative you get plus sign four times this 4 times 3 12 1 remaining 4 times 1 4 plus 1 5 so 5.2 both positive means answer is positive this one multiplied by 2 6 and 2 1 is negative and 1 is positive answer is negative now we look at division of directed numbers now we know multiplication 5 into plus 2 you get plus 10. now what 
,,happens when you take 10 divided by plus 2 you take this one to this side that becomes division so what's the answer you are getting plus 5 divide the numbers ignoring the sign answer is positive when dividing positive number by a positive number so just ignore the sign 10 divided by 2 you get 5. both positive means answer is also positive write down the answer once 8 divided by 2 is 4 how you decide the sign both positive means positive sign 15 divided by 5 is 3 both positive you get the positive answer 10 divided by 10 1 both positive you get 1. 16 divided by 4 4 you get plus 4 8 divided by 2 that's 4 that is also plus 4. 20 divided by 5 20 divided by 5 is 4 both positive you get positive 4. 16 divided by 8 you get 2 that's plus 2. 30 divided by 10 that's 3 you get plus 3. 40 divided by 10 you get 4 both positive means plus 4. 36 divided by 6 you get 6 both positive so when you divide both positive numbers the answer is positive now this one we know plus into minus 4 is negative 4. and when you take this one to this side negative 25 divided by negative 4 you are getting plus 6. so now look at this question both negative answer is positive answer is positive when dividing negative number by a negative number write down the answer at once both negative numbers all in all these questions both negative numbers when you divide both negative numbers the answer is positive just normal division 8 divided by 2 4 answer is plus because both are negatives 16 divided by 
,,4 4 that's plus 4. 20 divided by 5 you get 4 that's plus 4. 18 divided by 6 you get 3 that's plus 3 12 divided by 2 6 that's plus 6 18 divided by 9 you get 2 that's 
,,plus 2. 20 divided by 10 you get 2. ours is plus 2. 30 divided by 10 that's three answers plus 40 divided by 20 you get plus 2 24 divided by 12 you get plus 2 because both the numbers are negative negative number divided by a negative you get a positive answer now what happens here 1 is negative and 1 is positive so minus 8 and 
,,plus 3 we know that's minus 24 when you take plus 3 to this side that means minus 24 divide by plus 3 you need to get minus now what happens 1 is negative 1 is positive answer is negative answer is negative when dividing negative number by a positive number here also both numbers are negative you get positive 24. when you take this one here minus 6 to this side what happens plus 24 divide by this is plus 24 divide by minus 6 the answer is minus 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is always negative answer is negative when dividing positive number by a negative number so it can be positive first number and the divisor is negative or divisor is positive and the number given is negative final answer is negative write down the answer at once plus and minus so you get negative 12 divided by 4 3 plus and minus 18 divided by 6 is 3 you are getting a negative answer again minus n plus 30 divided by 5 is 6 answer is minus 6 negative positive 28 divided by 7 that's 4 you get negative 4. 27 divided by 9 you get 9 times 3 so this is negative now look at this one 12 divided by 4 you get 3 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative 18 divided by minus 6 1 is positive and 1 is negative answer is negative 30 divided by 5 6 1 is positive and 1 is negative so answer is negative 28 divided by 7 you get 4 1 is positive and 1 is negative answer is negative 27 and 9 you get 3 answer is negative 3 so you need to remember when you get same sign pluses you get positive or either same sign negatives the final answer is positive when you divide here this one one positive and one negative always you get negative answer order is not important you can get negative number divide by a positive still the answer is negative so multiplication of different signs answer is negative so in this case you get negative here you get positive for same sign write down the answer at once now combination so first multiply numbers separately and then decide the sign 7 times 2 40 both pluses answer is plus 6 times 2 12 both minus answer is plus now the division 12 divided by 6 answer is 2 this is minus and plus the sign is negative division again 30 divided by 15 you know that's 2 sign is negative because 1 is negative and 1 is positive 32 divided by 8 you get 4 1 is negative 1 is plus means answer is negative 9 times 3 27 1 is positive and 1 is negative that's minus 16 divided by 4 you get 4 both negative answer is positive 18 divided by 18 you get 1 both negative answer is positive 40 divided by 20 ans is 2. both negative means you get plus 27 divided by 3 you get 9. one negative and one positive you get minus again eight times eight multiplication 64. both negative you get plus now division 64 divided by 8 that's 8 1 positive 1 negative answer is negative 12 times 3 multiplication you get 36 1 positive 1 negative answer is negative 36 divided by 12 you get 3 both negative here you get plus 48 divided by 2 that's 24 1 negative 1 positive answer is negative 8 times 4 32 both negative answer is positive here division negative negative division you get 4 divided by 4 1 both negative means the sign is plus 18 divided by 1 you get 18. both negative that's plus 40 divided by 8 that's 5. one negative 1 positive means you get minus 9 times 3 27 and both positive means answer is positive so that's not hard you can just multiply the numbers and then decide the sign simplify following directed numbers so we can do the numerator first and then the denominator 4 times 3 12 but this is negative because 1 is positive and 1 is negative now 12 divided by 6 is 2 one negative and one positive answer is negative 8 times 4 32 is this plus or minus minus minus both means this is plus 2 times 2 4 1 minus and 1 positive means you get minus 4. now division 32 divided by 4 is 8 plus and minus the answer is minus this one we'll do these two first 5 and 2 10 minus minus becomes plus and then here three times one three one positive one negative is minus three now you can do ten times three 30 but this is negative and divide by negative 30 divided by 3 is 10 both negative means the final answer is positive this one we'll 
,,do these two 8 times 2 16 that's positive and multiplied by a negative value here 6 times 2 12 and you get a negative answer no numerator multiply you get 3 times 6 
,,18 1 remaining 3 times 1 3 plus 1 48 that's negative because 1 is positive and 1 is negative now divide by -12 both negative answer is positive 48 divided by 12 is 4. so you get plus 4 as the answer do this we'll do these two separately 9 times 3 27 that's minus and then 12 times 3 36 that's minus because 1 is negative and 1 is 
,,positive now 27 times 4. 108 that's negative negative that's positive divide by minus 36 the answer is negative 1 is positive 1 is negative how many times are there 
,,36 times what's the answer 3 3 times so you get 3 times 36 is 108 so you get negative 3 as the final this one you can do these two minus 8 and 4 minus 32. multiplied by plus 2 here 4 times 4 16 and this is minus minus plus now numerator separately 32 times 2. that's plus into minus minus 64. divide by plus 16 minus n plus minus 
,,how many 16s are there for sixty-four four so answer is minus four this one 12 times 4 you get 48 that's minus 3 times 2 6 minus minus plus now divide 48 divided by 
,,6 8 but this is minus because 1 is negative well 1 is positive 12 times 8 96 plus into minus that's minus 3 times 2 6 both minus that means plus 6. how many sixes are there divide by six you get one for 36 that's 16. is it positive or negative one is negative one is positive answer is negative these two what is eighteen times three 24 3 times 1 3 plus 2 54 but the answer is negative 6 times 3 18 answer is positive now divide how many 18s are there for 54 3 so the answer is 3 minus and plus 
,,different signs you get negative so the answer is negative 3. here we'll take these two first 4 times 3 plus 12 and then with minus 6. here 18 times 2 you get 36 that's minus 1 is positive 1 is negative now multiply these two 72 12 times 6 but the answer is negative now both negative 72 divided by 36 is 2. both negative means answer is positive now we'll look at example number one find the value of minus 3 plus minus 2 by using the number line so number line is given what's the starting point minus 3 so this is the starting point and then what we do plus minus 2 means 2 places to the left so 2 places to the left means answer is minus 5 review exercise 
,,now we'll take the review exercise find the value of each of the following by using the number line plus 2 and plus 6. so we'll take the number line okay so what's the starting value plus 2 so here i'll take minus 2 minus 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and we'll put 8 here these are pluses that's the number line starting point is plus 2 and 
,,plus 6 means 6 places to the right one two three four five six so what's the answer plus eight plus eight and minus 5 so we'll take the number line again so plus 8 is there so we need 8 i'll mark this one as 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 minus 1. now start from plus 8 and plus minus 5 means moves 5 places to the left so 1 two three four five what's the answer plus three minus two n plus three we'll take it minus two so that means i'll take this one as minus 3 minus 2 minus 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 these are pluses so starting value is minus 2 plus plus 3 means move 3 places to the right 1 2 3 answer is plus 1. this one take the number line and starting value is minus 3 so 
,,you need to check minus three but here minus means moves left so we'll start from here plus one you need to decide what are the numbers you need so here minus 3 is the starting point and here this is left means you need more minus values so four places to the left one two three four answer is minus seven this one plus 4 and minus 6 is there that means towards left side so we'll take plus 4 here starting point is plus 4 6 to the left 1 2 3 4 5 6. so you get minus 2. find the value of each of the following you can do it at once what's the condition both pluses means just add the two numbers 3 plus 2 5 so you get plus 5 now both negative that's also adding two numbers four plus two six you put a negative sign here one is positive one is negative you take the difference five and three difference is two but bigger number is positive you put plus 2 plus and minus take the difference that's 6 bigger number is negative so you put negative 6 here this is additive inverse addition so what's the answer negative 7 and 7 difference is 0. so when you add additive inverse you get 0. these two all positive so that means adding the numbers 5 plus 2 7 7 plus 3 now here all these negative numbers so that means adding negative numbers 3 plus 1 4 4 plus 4 8 what this is negative 8. all these two these two positive and the other one is negative so what is this one plus two plus four you get plus six now you have to take the difference because 1 is positive and 1 is negative so 9 and 6 difference is 3 bigger number is negative so minus 3. here you have to take the difference because 1 is positive and the other one is negative so 5 over 7 minus 2 over 7 that's 3 over 7. so answer is 3 over 7. how you decide the sign the bigger one is this that's positive 1 is positive 1 is negative 2 so take the difference when you subtract you get 8 and here 1. so 1.8 is the answer which one is bigger 5.2 that's negative so the answer also negative here what are these two additive inverse so additive inverse addition is zero example number one find the value of plus 2 minus minus 3 by using the number line so here first look at it plus 2 and minus minus that means you have to move towards right side so starting with plus 2. so we can take plus 2 somewhere here so this is plus 1 0 minus 1 minus 2 plus 3 plus 4 plus 5 plus 6 plus 7 so start with plus 2 here move three places to the right one two three so what's the final answer that's plus five find the value of minus 2 minus plus 3 by using the lambda line so before we mark the numbers just see minus 2 that means starting value is minus 2 moves to the left 3 units so when you are marking the number line we can take i'll take minus 6 minus 5 minus 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 starting with minus 2 moves left by 3 units 1 2 3. so the answer is minus five example number three find the value of minus two minus minus three by using the number line so we'll take the number line now here before we mark the points you have to look at carefully starting point is minus 2 minus minus means you have to move to the right side by 3 units so we can take minus 3 minus 2 minus 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6. these are positive values so starting value is minus two moves three places to the right one two three that's the answer plus one exercise 4.1 find the value by using the number line so we'll take the number line and now how we label you have to look at starting value is plus 4 and minus means you are moving to the left so plus 4 will mark it somewhere here and starting value is plus 4 moving towards left side by 2 units so final answer is plus two take a number line for this now how we label this so here starting point is plus 1 and here minus minus means moves towards right side so we can start from here i'll take plus 1 here plus 2 plus 3 plus 4 plus 5 
,,plus 6 like that and here this is 0 minus 1. so start from plus one and moves two places to the right one two so what's the final answer final answer is plus three this one using number line so we'll take the number line and starting with minus 2 and here minus means moves to the left so we'll start -2 somewhere here it's easy first you decide otherwise you can't put all the numbers so this is plus 1 minus 3 minus 4 minus 5 minus 6 like that starting value is minus 2 3 places to the left one two three so you get minus five this one minus one and minus minus 3 so what you have to do starting with minus and minus minus means moves towards right side so i'll start minus 1 somewhere here these are pluses so starting value is minus 1 moves three places to the right one two three one two three so answer is plus two this one starting value is minus 6 and you have to move towards right side because minus minus towards right side so we'll start from -6 here so starting value is minus 
,,6 5 places to the right 1 2 3 4 5 answer is minus 1 this one starting point is plus 2 minus minus means towards right hand side so i can start with plus 2 here here 
,,plus 1 and 0 starting with 2 and 2 places to the right this is plus 4. example number four find the value of plus two minus minus four so we can use addition of additive inverse i can change the question to adding the additive inverse of minus 4 that's plus 4. now both positive 4 plus 2 addition is plus 6. find the value of minus 5 minus plus 2. so convert this to additive inverse adding the additive inverse of plus 2 that's minus 2 now this is both minus addition so just add it and put the sign so you get minus 7. find the value of minus 7 minus minus 3 so how you do minus 7 is there adding additive inverse of minus 3 is plus 3 now difference 7 and 3 
,,difference is 4 and put the sign of the bigger number that's minus 4. example 7 find the value of minus 12 minus minus 15 minus plus 5. so these two i can convert minus 12 addition of additive inverse of that plus 50 and here also adding additive inverse that's minus 5. now these two take the difference minus 12 and 15 take the 
,,difference you get 3 that's positive now again consider this one now 1 is positive and 1 is minus you take the difference difference is 2 and the bigger number is minus you get minus 2. example eight find the value of plus three fifths minus so you can do the additive inverse of plus one over 5 means minus 1 over 5. now this is 
,,difference so you take 3 over 5 minus 1 over 5 that's 2 over 5 is the difference which one is bigger positive answer is bigger so the answer is plus 2 over 5. example 9 minus five and a half minus plus two so what you do i can rewrite this as adding the additive inverse of plus 2 that's minus 2. so this means both minus now edit 5 and 2 7 and you get 7 and a half both minus means the answer is minus example 10 minus 3.2 minus i can write plus of the additive inverse of plus 1.4 that's minus 1.4 now both negative negative means adding so 3.2 and 1.4 just add it you get 4.6 but both negative means the answer also negative example number 11 find the value of minus 8.4 minus minus i can change it to plus with the additive inverse of minus 2.5 that's plus 2.1 now 1 is negative 1 is positive take the difference 6.3 so which one is the bigger number minus so you put a minus psi exercise 4.2 fill in each cage with the suitable directed number here minus 5. we can convert to additive 
,,inverse of plus 3 that's minus 3. now both negative add the two numbers 5 plus 3 8 so you put minus eight this one convert to additive inverse so this is plus with plus four one is positive one is negative take the difference four and three difference is 1 bigger number is positive plus 1. convert to additive inverse plus 7 plus minus 1 additive inverses plus 1 7 and 1 both positive you get plus 8. this one plus 7 additive inverse of minus 2 that's plus 2 and both pluses 7 plus 2 you get plus 9. find the value of each of the following so 4 you can write this one as adding the additive inverse of this 4 minus 1 you get 3 positive number because the higher number is positive minus 8 plus additive inverse of minus 2 that's plus 2. take the difference 8 and 2 difference is 6 bigger number is minus answer is minus 6 convert to addition plus of additive inverse that's plus 7 take the difference because 1 is negative and 1 is positive so you get 4 bigger number is positive that's plus 4 here also you can start from plus 9 addition of the additive inverse that's plus 6 9 and 6 addition 15 that's plus minus 5 addition of additive inverse plus 5 yeah minus 5 and plus 5 difference is 0 this one adding the additive inverse that's minus 3 so 0 and minus 3 answer is minus 3 here minus 11 addition of additive inverse of plus 4 that's minus 4 both negative so add it so 15 answer is negative this one convert the question plus 2 plus minus 1 adding of the additive inverse that's plus 4 2 minus 1 take the difference you get plus 1. plus 1 and plus 4 you get plus 5 this one i can take minus 5 convert to addition additive inverse of this is minus 2 again convert this one plus with additive inverse that's plus 6. now these two both negative so just add it and put the sign this is plus 6 now 1 is positive and 1 is negative take the difference 7 and 6 difference is 1 bigger number is negative so you get negative 1 this one plus 4 and here adding the additive inverse that's minus 2 again adding the additive inverse that's minus 8. now 4 and 2 take the difference that's 2 that's plus 2. and now again take the difference 8 and 2 difference is 6. bigger number is negative so you put negative six this one four and a half adding the additive inverse of minus 2 that's plus 2 now this means adding these two numbers 4 and 2 6 6 and a half that's positive this one minus 6 and 1 4 is there adding of the additive inverse that's 1 4 plus 1 over now you have to take the difference so we'll take the difference six one fourth minus one fourth so one fourth one fourth get cancel out you get six what's the sign the bigger number is negative so the answer is negative 6 this one plus 15.7 adding the additive inverse that's plus 2.3 now this is addition 15.7 and 2.3 adding 7 plus 3 10 and 6 plus 2 8. so 18.0 so plus 18.0 this one will take first minus 2. adding the additive inverse of plus 3.5 that's minus 3.5 adding 4.5 4.1 now these two both negative that means adding you get 5.5 that's negative and adding plus 4.1 again the difference one is positive one is negative so take the difference you get 1.4 which number is bigger negative number so answer is negative 1.4 this one plus three and a half adding the additive inverse of minus 2 that's plus 2 here also adding additive inverse of this is plus one third now look at all of this all are adding so three plus two five that's the whole part half plus one third what's half plus one third convert to the same denominator lowest common multiple is six three times two so three times one three two times three six so two times one two so you get five over six so what's the final answer 5 and 5 over 6 so that's positive example number one simplify so here multiplication what you do just multiply the two numbers and same sign you get plus multiplication here 6 and 2 12. 1 is positive and 1 is negative answer is negative simplify the following here first one two times five ten one is positive the other one also positive both positive means ansi is positive second one three times two six 1 is negative 1 is positive answer is negative third one 5 times 3 
,,15 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative 15. here 4 times 3 12 12 times 2 24. now we'll decide the sign both negative you get plus again plus with plus answer is plus example number four plus 2.5 into minus 5. just multiply by 5 first 5 times 5 25 5 times 2 10 plus 2 12. so 12.5 how do you decide the sign one is positive one is negative answer is negative here multiplied by 12 first 3.4 multiplied by 12. 10 and 2 4 and 3 2 times 4 8 2 times 3 6. when you add it you get 4 0 8 and here 1 decimal place so 40.8 is the answer but how you decide the sign minus minus both the final answer is positive find the value exercise 4.3 so straight away you can do 5 times 420 both positive means answer is positive 5 times 420 1 is negative 1 is positive answer is negative 10 times 550 both negative answer is positive 7 times 3 21 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative both negative just multiply 1 times 4 4 both negative means you get a positive answer here 11 times 0 when you multiply any number by 0 always you get answer 0 6 times 4 24 1 is negative and 1 is plus answer is negative 12 times 3 you get 36 1 is positive one is negative answer is negative here we'll multiply first two times two four four times five twenty now we'll decide the sign one is negative one is positive answer is negative that's negative and this negative both negative means the answer is plus here 3 times 1 3 3 times 2 6 6 times 5 30 decide the sign negative negative positive here positive negative you get negative now again positive negative means the final answer is negative multiplied by 2 you get 5 both positive answer is positive now here you need to multiply by 20 3 now 20 and 3 times one two two times four eight three times one three three times four twelve when you add it you get ninety four point three now one is positive one is negative means answer is negative example number one now it's division same thing you divide and finally you can put the sign 6 divided by 2 you get 3 both negative you get positive 3 6 and 2 division you get 3 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative this one 15 divided by 5 answer is 3 both 
,,positive you get positive 3 9 divided by 3 is 3 1 is negative 1 is positive you get a negative answer 15 divided by 3 you get 5 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative 9 divided by 3 3 both negative you get positive answer exercise 4.4 find the value of each of the following 10 and 2 division you get 5 plus and plus both 
,,positive means the final answer is positive 12 divided by 4 that's 3 both negative means final answer is positive 15 divided by 3 is 5. 1 is positive and 1 is negative answer is negative here 21 divided by 7 is 3 1 is negative and 1 is positive answer is negative negative 5 divided by 5 5 divided by 5 is 1 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative 1. 20 divided by 4 is 5 both negative means answer is positive now here 8 times 2 16 both positive that's positive now you have to divide by this 16 divided by 4 that's 4. 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative this one we can simplify the denominator first 6 and 2 multiplication that's 12 both negative means you get positive ones now 36 divided by 12 is 3 1 is negative 1 is positive answer is negative do the numerator 5 times 4 20 one negative one positive 
,,answer is negative denominator now 2 and 2 4 both minus means positive 1's now do this one 20 divided by 4 is 5. 1 is negative 1 is positive answer is negative do the numerator 9 times 8 72 both negative means plus answer 4 times 3 12 1 is negative 1 is positive answer is negative 72 divided by 12 you get 6 1 is positive and 1 is negative answer is negative fill in each cage with the suitable directed number answer is negative that means you are getting a plus value so 20 divided by 2 you get 10. so plus 2 because minus n plus the answer is negative 18 and 6. how you get 6 18 divided by 3. now decide the sign this is plus answer is negative that means 
,,you are getting negative 3 division you get 5 that means 10 divided by 2 is 5. now decide the sign this is plus here minus so both should be minus to get plus answer answer is 4 4 divided by 1 is 4 positive and the answer is negative so this should be negative value how we decide this one when you divide this one by 2 you are getting 6. so think about reverse way so if this is 12 here 12 divided by 2 you get 6. how you get 12 from 3 this should be 4 now decide the sign this is minus and minus if it's plus and minus the answer is minus but the answer is given is plus so that means this should be a minus value so minus 4 now this one you are getting minus 28 here plus 7 is there 7 into 4 28 but this is minus means this should be minus 4 now numerator is ok now to get 7 what should be this answer you are getting minus 4 because minus minus plus 28 divided by 4 is 7. now how you get minus 4 there 2 times 2 but this is minus so you have to multiply it by minus 2. so we covered all theory related to directed numbers subtracting a number from another number is the same as adding the additive inverse of the second number to the first number a positive number is obtained when two directed numbers of the same sign are multiplied or divided a negative number is obtained when two directed numbers of opposite signs are multiplied or divided so remember all these properties in directed numbers and practice all the exercises and examples

Number Partens,w-HEaLbb6f4,hello Brady children today I am here to teach you another interesting topic that's square root in your textbook that's chapter eight before we find out square root will see square offer number so what is a square offer number is the value when multiplying a number by itself if you take 7 7 x 7 we can write 7 square you can write as power to a into a a squared or if this is 11 11 times 11 you can write 11 squared or X X into X you can write x squared so this is called square of a number now 
,,look at this one so this is a square one left and one left one marble is there 1 times 1 you get 1 squared 1 squared is 1 look at this one this square to length here width also - that's a square 2 times 2 you get 2 squared that's so what about this one 3 into 3 3 times 3 that's 3 squared 9 4 into 4 so row wise for marbles are there column wise also for marbles are there then 4 times 4 that's 4 squared 16 so square of a number it's called the perfect square number the number of columns in the above figure is equal to the number of rows so these are called perfect square numbers here number of columns into number of rows so that famous square number so perfect square numbers we can say these are square numbers so what are the square numbers 1 4 9 16 like that fill in the blanks you have given the number square of a 
,,number 1 squared what it means 1 times 1 what's the answer one number in the unit's place so this is unit's place that's one toe when you scribe two squared means 2 
,,times 2 then what's the answer for number in the unit's places what about this one 3 squared means 3 into 3 that's 9 number in the unit place is 9 4 squared 4 times 
,,4 that's 16 what's the number in the unit's face 6 this one 5 squared Phi times 5 that's 25 so the unit's place number is 5 6 squared 6 times 6 that means 36 units place is 6 7 squared means 7 times survived that's 49 units place number is 9 8 squared 8 times 8 that's 64 units places oh now we'll find out more numbers 9 9 squared is 9 times 9 that's 81 so what's the unit's place number 110 squared means 10 times 10 that's hundred units places 0:11 squad is 11 times 11 what's 11 times 1100 21 units place is 112 squared 12 times 12 you get hundred forty four units place is 430 13 squared 13 times 13 169 you can check those values then the unit's place is 914 what's 14 times 14 256 we'll check it 14 times 14 multiplied by 10 and multiply by 4 16 5 so 196 196 is that so what's the value here 6 15 times 15 225 units place is 560 16 times 16 will check it to 16 times 16 x 10 + 6 6 times 6 36 6 times 1/6 + 3 9 256 so units places 6 17 times 17 so 177 times 7 49 7 times 1 7 plus 4 11 so nine eight - 289 so units place is nine eighteen times 80 so we'll check x 10 and x 8 8 times 8 64 8 x 1 8 8 plus 6 14 324 units place is 19 times 19 so 190 x 9 
,,9 times 9 81 9 times 1 9 + 8 17 361 and the unit's place is 120 times 20 you get 400 let's see so we did up to 20 all square numbers now look at the unit's place number you get 1 2 3 not there 4 5 6 7 is not there 8 is not there so we look at the previous one is also 2 3 7 8 is not there so what you observe from this by looking 
,,at the table above you can see that the final digit it means units place digit of the square numbers are 0 1 4 5 6 9 if the final digit is one of the digits 2 3 7 8 
,,then it is not a square number so you need to remember this if the last digit is either 2 3 7 8 that means these are not square numbers now look at this one you have given 32 squared and you can look at the last digit to is the unit's place number here 2 squared is 4 so when you square it you get 4 so 2 times 2 equals 4 3 is there 3 times 3 you get 9 what about this one 6 is the unit's place number last digit yeah 6 into 6 36 so your last digit is 6 here 7 is there 7 times 7 49 so what's the last digit here 9 so the digit in wants place of the number that is square is the same as the digit in once place of the square number now we can clearly see that 
,,when you scratch you get the last digit here as the answer select the perfect square numbers from the following digits and underline them so what we observed so far 
,,if the last digit is 2 3 7 8 those are not square numbers so we will look at the last digit 7 is there so that's not a square number here 6 that means it's a square 
,,number here the last digit is 2 that's not a square number 9 is they are that's a square number 4 is okay that's a square number 1 is also okay for a square number 7 7 is not a square number so that means you can't underline that's not a square number eight is also not a square number four is okay that's a square number three is not a square number Gail nine is a square number and one is the square number so when the last digit is two three seven eight those are not square numbers look at this one all the numbers that has final digit as zero one four five six nine are not always square numbers so look at this one this is zero but 200 is not a square number so even this is 999 is not a square number what about this one four is there so 414 is not a square number six is a square number normally but this number 206 is not a square number one is there but 331 is not a square number and here five is there that's also not a square number 150 so following numbers are not square numbers so you need to be careful not only from the last digit you have to check the previous digits as well question number six to denote the square root of number so what's the symbol we use for square root this symbol now what it means this means square root of four square root of what is this means square root of nine this one square root of 25 then if the number is a square root of 8 now this is given how you write as a symbol square root of 16 so you can write this symbol with 16 square root of 16 square root of 80 mine i can write this symbol square root of x here like this inside you can put the number so now you know how to write down the square root symbol find the square root of a number using prime factors now we know what's the square number so the river soft square is called square root now we'll use prime factors to identify the square root so what's 4 for you can divide by 2 again you can't divide by 2 so how can you write down 4 I can write down that's 2 times 2 
,,so 2 times 2 I can write as a squirter 2 squared now the reverse process of square a square root so the square root sign and the square term get cancelled out and you get the original value so 2 times 2 is 4 square root of 4 is 2 so this square root and this symbol get canceled out square root symbol with the square now we look 
,,at 16 how can we write down 16 divided by 2 you get 8 divided by 2 4 divided by 2 2 + / 2 1 so how many powers are there you get two squared and another two squared 
,,now if you want the square root what happens the square of that number get canceled out with this square root and you get 2 times 2 so here Square and square root you get 2 here and here also you get 2 2 times 2 you get 4 you can do the same question in a different way but without prime factors now if you asked to write down prime factors this is the correct method but if it's not you can do 16 you can write you can divide by 4 4 times 4 4 times 1 so you can write as 4 squared 16 is 4 squared now you can see square root N squared term get canceled out you get 4 so you are not getting marks if you asked to write the answer in prime factors you have to do in this way not with the other method both of these methods can be used to find the square root of 6 stick now take this 125 how can we find out the prime factors 
,,divided by 5 and 5 so you can write v square and square root so square root and square term get canceled out you get 5 36 how can we write 36 I'll take 36 here divide by 2 you get 18 divided by 2 9 divided by 3 3 and divide by 3 again so you get two paths 2 squared and 3 squared and when you take the square root what happens you get 2 and 3 so 2 times 3 you get 6 as the square root well you it is better to use a number instead of a number pair / prime factors so here without using this I can write this way as well now here I can take this one as it after this method after writing this one I can write the same thing as this whole thing square so you get 6 squared so 6 squared square root is 6 so either this way or this way you can use to find out the square root value now take hundred so how can we divide hundred divided by to get 50 divided by 2 again 25 divided by 5 you get 5 divided by 5 again you get 1 so you can try to square R and 5 squared and when you are taking square root you can take 2 squared with the square root you get 2 5 squared with the square root you get 5 2 times 5 10 144 divided by 2 2 again / - again - again + 3 + 3 
,,then you take pass what you get you get 2 squared and another 2 squared + 3 square when you take square root 2 2 3 so 2 times 2 4 4 times 3 square root of 144 is 12 
,,find the square root of the following numbers now we're already given pass so have you take the square root you get rid of this square term to here to here and seven so what's the answer two times two four four times seven twenty eight this one already square term is there so you'd get cancel out with the square root symbol so you get three five seven five times three fifteen fifteen times seven hundred this one square terms already they are this becomes 3 3 5 3 times 3 9 9 times 5 45 this 
,,one square root of this one you get 7 & 9 9 times 7 63 all these numbers the square term given so it get cancelled out and you can write 5 and 11 so 55 is the answer here this one 3 squared 5 squared 11 square so 3 5 11 5 times 11 55 55 times 3 15 plus 1/16 265 is the square root value this one square root of this whole thing square so this squared and the square root get cancel out and you get 2 times 3 times 5 so 6 times 5 30 and look at this one square term and square root get canceled out so you get 3 times 7 times 11 so 7 times 11 77 x 3 230 this one square column is already there so square term and this one get canceled out you get seven into eleven that's seventy seven here a and B so when you take the square term out a and B you get a B is the square root of that this one again square terms out there you can take separately to here X from here Y from there so 2x Y is the square root of that expression now look at this one squared terms are they are three a and B you can write three a B as the square root fell you find the square root of the following numbers using prime factors so prime factors means you have to divide and see what are the pairs of numbers 324 you can divide by two one here for 612 that six - again / - you get eight and one all prime numbers you have to take so divided by 3 
,,3 times 2 6 and 7 again divided by 3 9 divided by 3 again 3 and divide by 3 again you get one so how many pairs are there this one this one it's not so you can write 2 squared 3 squared and 3 squared take the square root now what happen square term get canceled out with the square root sign so you get 2 times 3 times 3 so 3 times 3 9 9 times 2 18 so square root of 18 square root of so square root 324 is 18 look at this one 400 divided by two you get 200 divided by 2 again 100 divided by 250 divided by 225 now divided by 5 you get 5 what now pair up the prime factors you get 2 squared 2 squared there and 5 squared and when you take the square root you get 2 times 2 times 5 2 times 2 4 4 times 5 and 20 this one divided by prime numbers divided by 2 288 divided by 2 again 144 you get 72 36 and 18 and 9 divided by 3 you get 3 and 1 when you pair up the prime factors you get 2 squared 2 squared another 2 squared and 3 squared and when you take the square root all the square terms 
,,get cancelled out you get 2 2 2 and 3 2 times 2 4 4 times 2 8 8 times 3 24 is the square root of 576 625 what's the square root well you divide by 5 5 times 1/5 times 2 10 divided by 5 again divided by 5 again and divide by 5 you get 1 so what are the numbers five squared + 5 squared and when you take the square root you get 5 times 5 that's 25 so square root of 625 is 25 now this one 484 using prime factors find the square root divided by 2 divided by 2 again now you can divide by what 1111 is the prime factor 11 times 11 is 121 again divided by 11 you get 1 so what are the prime factors 2 squared + 11 square and take this crowd you can write 2 times 
,,11 as 22 so square root of 484 is 22 this one 900 divided by 2 you get 450 divided by 2 again 225 then divide by 3 7 and 15 that's fine now divide by 3 again 3 times 2 6 + 4 15 that's 5 divided by 5 you get 5 here get one so pair of the factors here you get 2 squared 3 squared + 5 squared and when you take the square root you get 2 3 5 3 times 2 6 6 times 5 30 so square root of 900 is 30 look at this one 361 so we can divide by 19 19 is a prime factor not 2 3 it doesn't work so 90 so 19 when you divide you get 19 there so we will see 19 times 19 9 times 9 81 9 times 1 9 9 plus 8 17 so you get 6 and 3 365 so 19 times 19 so you can write 19 squared and take the square root so this is 19 is the answer for square root 361 and 529 also you can't divide by 2 or 3 like that so when you take 23 you get 23 so 23 times 23 you get 529 so 23 times 2 is 46 46 and you get another 69 69 means 3 so 23 squared so 23 squared and square root you get 23 as the answer by observation find the square root of the following perfect square now we are using a different method by observing so 1 squared is 1 what's the last digit here that's not it here is 1 so square root of 1 means 1 9 squared is 81 now reverse is business what a square root of 81 this is 9 we know 11 squared is 121 square root of 121 is 11 19 squared is 361 
,,square root of 361 is 90 square of 21 is 441 square root of 441 is 20-month now look at the last digit last digit in the answers is number 109 yeah if the last digit of the number to be found in the square root is one last digit is 1 then the last digit of the answer is always 1 or 9 so why this happens we know that 1 times 1 is 109 times 9 you get 81 so the last digit is 1 so what are the possible instances you get last digit 1 as the answer either you can get 1 or 9 so remember this it's 
,,really important when you are finding the square root 1 or 9 you always getting once there look at this one 2 squared is 4 square root of 4 is 2 8 squared is 64 square root of 64 is 8 12 squared is 144 square root of that is 12 here always reverse reverse is this is 18 and rivers of 484 square root is 22 now observe the last digit in the answers either 2 or 8 what about this one in the question always the last digit is 4 if the last digit of the number to be found in the square root is 4 then the last digit of the answer is always either 2 of 8 so why this happens we know 2 times 2 or 8 times 8 we get 64 so now can you see you are getting four either with 208 look at this one five squared is 25 watts the square root of 25 that's funny yeah square off 15 here there's an easy way to find out square terms we know 5 squared is 25 15 squared 15 times 15 when you multiply you will get 225 25 times 25 you will get 625 now look at this pattern when you multiply by last digit fives that means square terms you get always 25 as the last two digits so how do you get the previous one previous one is always multiply this number with the next number how you get to here one times two how you get six here two times three so how do you get here nothing they are that means you don't need to multiply there so then what about 45 squared you get 25 and 4 times 5 you are always multiply the next digit 4 times 5 20 so it becomes 2025 so we'll use that method what is 15 square 225 so square root of 225 is 15 25 squared is 625 square root of 625 is 25 if I use that method 25 3 times 4 12 4225 square root is 35 45 squared 25 comes 4 times 5 20 2025 
,,square root is 45 now observe the last digit if the last digit of the number to be found in the square root is 5 then the last digit of the answer is also yeah always hot this is 5 here it's fine so in this case 5 times 5 25 so you get only with 5 the last digit 5 I'll write this thing now we will take this one observe 6 squared is 36 square root of 36 is 6 14 squared multiplied 14 times 14 that's 4 times 4 16 4 times 1 4 plus 1 596 square root of 196 is 14 then 16 squared 6 so 256 and square root of 256 is 16 24 squared xx + 4 + 16 4 times 2 8 + 1 9 576 square root of 576 is 24 26 squared xx + 6 5 6 times 6 36 6 times 2 12 12 plus 3 15 so you get 676 
,,so square root of 676 is equal to 26 now what you observe if the last digit of the number to be found in the square root is 6 then the last digit of the answer is always 4 or 6 so look at this one 4 or 6 and here the last digit is 6 so what's your observed here that means 4 times 4 you are getting 16 so the last digit is 6 or 6 
,,times 6 36 the last digit is 6 now another example observe what you get 3 squared is 9 square root of 9 is 3 7 square you get 49 and square root of 49 is 7 13 squared you get 169 square root of 169 is 13 reverse of square a square root 17 square multiplied by 77 times 7 49 7 times 1 7 plus 4 11 so you get 289 square root of 289 
,,is 17 23 times 23 what you get for 3 times 3 9 3 times 2 6 529 so 529 square root is equal to 23 now observe what you get if the last digit of the number to be found in the square root is 9 then the last digit of the odds is always through yourself so how you get 9 times 3 times 3 you get 3 times 3 9 or 7 times 7 49 so the last 
,,digit you get 9 either 4 3 or 7 this one 10 squared is 100 square root of 100 is 10 20 squared is 400 square root of 400 is 20 30 squared is 900 square root of 900 days 30 40 squared so you can do 4 times 4 16 1600 square root of thousand 600 days forty 15 to 50 means you can put 5 + 5 25 and put two zeros 2500 square root of that is 50 now if the last digit of the number to be found in the square root is 0 then the last digit of the answer is always 0 yeah observe that 0 here also 0 so 0 times 0 only you are getting 0 now we observed several digits the last digits when you multiply so we are you get 0 only when it's 0 5 only when you get high so 0 & 5 only one digit 0 times 0 0 and 5 times 5 25 so you get 5 there as the last digit we are you get one either one Oh 9 9 times 9 81 where are you get 4 2 times 2 4 or 
,,8 times 8 64 then 6 6 times 6 36 and 4 times 4 16 that's 4 4 or 6 then 9 3 times 3 9 and 7 times 7 49 so you need to know this to find out the square root of a number now we'll try to find out square root of these hundredths places numbers 441 so this is easy so you look at the first one hundredths place number square root of 4 
,,what's that - look at the last digit 1 square root of 1 is 1 so what are the numbers you can get so here square root of 1 is always 1 square root of 4 is 2 so this means 21 times 21 is 441 so you can check whether this is 21 so we'll Steaks multiply 21 times 21 and C 1 times 1 so when you add it you get 441 so the answer is 25 look at this one square root of 9 that's 3 square root of 1 that's 1 so what should be the square root well you 31 you check it 31 times 30 bar 30 and 1 you get 961 so that's correct so I write down this one is 21 this is 31 now this one 169 square root square root of 1 is 1 square root of 9 is 3 so what's the answer 13 you check it 13 times 13 3 times 3 9 3 you get hundred and sixty-nine so that's correct so how you find out the square root of these numbers hundreds places so square root of that and the square root of the unit's place finding square root when the digit in the hundreds place is not a square number now earlier we did square numbers in the hundreds place now it's not a square number five is not a square number so we'll see how we find out the square root square root of five so we take the lowest square number close to five what's the lowest one square root of so so less than five you have to find square root of four is two what is six last digit is six how you get last digit six tell me according to the table either 6 or 4 so 4 or 6 4 times 4 16 6 times 6 36 now it can be either 24 or 26 so we need to check which number is 
,,correct now I'll give you an idea now we know square numbers 25 times 25 is 625 this is less than that 625 so what do you think the number should be less than 25 or 
,,"greater than 25 the number is less here so that means we assume that this is the correct answer we'll check it out 24 times 24 20 and 4 you get 576 and when you take 26 times 26 that should be more than 625 so 20 + 6 6 6 times 6 36 6 times 2 12 12 plus 3 15 so you get 676 now see then a correct number is 24 so square root of 576 is 24 if you know the square numbers you can easily find out the correct value without multiplying all these 625 so what's the lowest square number below 6 less than 6 square root 4 that's 2 what about here we are you get 5 as the last digit only possibility is 5 so what's the answer square root of 625 is 25 so 25 times 25 is 625 this one square root of seven so what's the lowest one square number that's four so square root of four is two where you get four as the last digit what are the possibilities either 2 2 x 2 4 or 8 8 times 8 64 so the numbers are either 22 or 28 now how you identify that which one do you think we know 25 times 25 is 625 this is more than 25,000 784 so definitely the correct answer should be 28 we'll check that one so 28 times 28 28 times 28 20 and eight sixty four and eight times two 16 and 22 784 so that's the correct answer so what's the square root of 784 that's 28 then this one square root of 529 so what's the square number less than that that's "
,,4 square root of 4 is 2 how you get nine as the last digit either 3 or 7 7 times 7 49 or 3 times 3 9 so either you need to get 23 times 23 or 27 times 27 now what's 
,,a method we know 25 squared is 600 25 so this number is less 529 that means the number should be less than 25 so this should be the number we'll check it 23 times 23 3 times 3 9 3 times 2 6 you get 529 so that's the correct answer look at this one square root of 841 so what's the lower square number here less than 8 square root 
,,of 4 that's 2 1 how you get one either from 1 or 9 9 times 9 81 so it can be either 21 or 29 now what do you think what's the closest square number 20 times twenty-four hundred so 841 so 21 is close to 400 very close but this is 841 means definitely this should be this one so we'll check 29 times 29 and here 9 times 9 81 9 times 2 18 and 8 26 so 1 so 841 so that's the correct answer so what is the square root of 841 that's 29 this one square root of 729 so what's the lowest value here less 
,,than 7 square number is square root 4 that's 2 how you get 9 9 you get either 3 3 times 3 9 or 7 times 7 49 7 so what are the two possible numbers either 23 or 27 so which one is suitable we know 25 times 25 is 625 this is more than 625 so that means more than 25 so the correct answer should be 27 so 27 times 27 we'll check it so 27 times 27 20 into 7 you get 45 7 times 7 49 and 7 times 2 14 plus 4 18 so the final answer is 729 so that means the correct answer is 27 so square root of 729 is 27 now look at this one sure that this is not a perfect square now so what you do use the same procedure what's the lowest value yeah seven is there what's the closest square number less than that 4 square root 4 that's 2 9 how do you get 9 either 3 or so 7 times 7 49 so 2 possibilities are there either 23 or 27 now this is not a square number so we need to multiply and show that this is not 749 so 23 times 23 you get 529 so that's not this number 27 times 27 20 and 7 you get 9 12 7 so 129 now see so 149 is not a perfect square number not find the square roots by observing digits what's the value square root of one is one square root of four is twelve so square root of 144 is 12 this one both square numbers hundreds digit as well as the unit's place so square root of one is one square root of nine is three this 125 here 225 this one is not a square number so what's the closest value less than that is one and five where you get five only possibilities five times five you get 
,,25 this one - is there - is not a square number but we take the lowest values lower square number is one and six what are the possibilities to get six either 6 times 6 or 4 times 4 so you need to decide whether this is 14 or 16 now what's the method to 125 for 15 15 squared is 225 now this number is larger than that so definitely this should be 16 this one 289 what's the square root value here less than 2 that's 1 get 1 here 9 you get either 3 3 times 3 or 7 times 7 49 so either 13 or 17 which one is correct what's the closest value we can take 15 15 is 220 five this is more than that so that means therefore neatly this should be seventy square root of 324 what's the lowest value here square number less than 3 that's 1 1 square root is 1/4 what are the possibilities to get 4 2 or what's the other number 8 so the this should be either 12 or 18 which one is suitable we know 15 times 15 is 225 so this is more than that this should be 18 361 lowest value here less than 3 the square root value is 1 square root that's 1 1 how you get one either from 1 or 9 so then 2 possibilities are 11 or 90 how you identify 12 times 12 144 this is more than 
,,"that so definitely this should be now we can check if you are not sure you can check it 19 times 19 you get a team on 9 times 1 9 + 8 17 so 1 so 361 that's 9,400 square root both are yes 4 square root is 2 and 0 square root is 0 this one square root of 4 is 2 square root of 1 is 1 if it's a square number you can straightaway find out the square root value square root of 4 is 2 square root of four is two yeah this is not a square number so you have to take the closest one square root of four is two and nine how you get nine what are the possibilities to get nine either three or seven so 27 or 23 so which one is suitable 25 times 25 is 625 this is less than that so 23 is the correct answer 900 square numbers so square root of 9 is 3 square root of 0 is 0 so 30 is the number look at this question find the area of ABCD square so this is a square so how do you find out the area length into width so nice centimeter square this is another square find the area of PQRS that's 4 times "
,,4 16 square centimeters now we look at the next part it's another square find the area of key element length side is X so what's area X into X that means x squared that's also I think square centimeters because it's not given but to find out the relationship you need to get the same units if the area of the square of klmn is equal to the sum of areas of squares ABCD and PQRS then find the relationship between x squared 9 and 60 so we found out area of K lemon is X square and what's the area of the previous what's the area of the previous two squares 9 and 16 so we can add 9 and 16 so that's the relationship between x squared 9 and 16 according to the above determine the value of x we know x squared is 9 plus 16 you get 20 fun so how do you find X you have to take the reverse of that so square root of 25 so what is square root of 25 that's funny so what's the answer answer is 5 this is in centimeter so five centimeters should be the length of the side find the value of a if a 
,,squared is 6 square plus 8 squared so 6 squared is 36 8 squared is 64 when you add these two you get hundred so how do you find out a square root of 100 square root 
,,of 100 is 10 or you can write 10 squared as 100 and then square root and square term get cancel out this one 5 squared is 25 12 squared is 144 when you add these you get 169 so 169 is 13 Square 13 times 13 when you take the square root you get 13 as the Y value find the square root of the following numbers so we'll write as square terms 4 is 2 squared 9 is 3 square so when you write square term you can write this as 2 times 3 so 2 times 3 is 6 9 you can write 3 squared 25 is 5 square when you take the square root it's 3 & 5 that's 15 36 is 6 squared 49 is 7 squared when you take the square root this is 6 times 7 42 25 is 5 squared 49 is 7 square so when you take the square root this is 5 times 7 35 this one so we write separate in the numerator and the denominator here all our fractions 9 is 3 squared 16 is 4 squared when you take the square root this is 3 n 25 means 5 squared 36 is 6 square when you cancel out this square root bit square term you get 5 over 6 this one 36 is 
,,6 square 25 is 5 squared + 9 is 3 squared when you take the square root this is 6 times 5 over 3 3 times 1 3 times 2 so finally you get 10 as the square root of L square root of 4 is 2 that means 2 square 81 is 9 square and 36 is 6 square when you take the square root you get 2 + 9 here 6 so 3 times 3 3 times 2 so 2 + 2 get cancelled out the final answer is 3 this one you can do here square root of 25 you know that's fine so 4 + 5 9 square root of 9 is 3 you can start from here square root 
,,of 144 12:37 -12 you get 25 square root of 25 is 5 this one you can do separately square root of 16 is 4 square root of 25 is 5 4 + 5 9 square root of 9 or you can write 9 as 3 squared and then what's the square root you get 3 square root of hundred that's 10 square root of 36 that's 6 10 minus 6 for square root of 4 I can write 2 squared and take the square root the answer is 2 now we will look at example 1 in your textbook a square tile is of side length 8 centimeters show that the numerical value of its surface area is a perfect square so this is a square tile with length 8 centimeters so what's the surface area so surface area of a square tile so 8 times 8 so 8 times 8 is the surface area so I'll write down surface area surface area means the upper surface 8 times 8 that's 64 square centimeters and it says sure that the numerical value is a perfect square so how you identify a perfect square so here we can see 8 is the row length this is the column let both are equal so that's why this is a we are number so you can write 64 is a square number square numbers are perfect squares square numbers are both and squares exercise 8.1 represent the square of 5 by an arrangement of dots and write down its value a square of 5 by 5 so this is 1 2 3 4 5 so row length is 5 and the column length is 5 1 2 3 4 5 
,,1 2 3 4 5 another 1 so 5 by 5 so this is square and write down its value so 5 into 5 all together 25 so 5 squared is 25 complete the table given below and answer the questions accordingly number and square of the number so square off the number 1 squared is 1 2 squared 4 3 into 3 3 squared 9 4 times 4 16 5 times 5 25 6 times 6 36 7 times 7 49 8 times 8 64 9 times 9 81 ten times ten hundred eleven times 11 hundred twenty one twelve times twelve hundred forty four thirteen times thirteen hundred sixty-nine and what is 14 times 14 4 times 4 16 4 times 1 4 plus 1 5 196 15 times 15 225 16 times 16 6 times 6 36 6 times 1 6 plus 3 9 256 so what about 17 times 17 7 times 7 49 7 times 1 7 plus 4 11 289 289 so those are the square numbers by adding some pairs of perfect squares in the second row we can obtain another perfect square observe the table and write for such relationships 9 16 25 so that means 3 squared + 4 squared is 5 squared so what is what are the other relationships you 
,,can get identify it's nine and sixteen did 64 can you make 6436 with sixty no hundred hundred is 64 and thirty six so these two you get 100 so that means six squared + 8 squared six squared + 8 squared is 10 square what is 120 144 can you make 144 20 bottles with no 81 with 169 13 you get 144 + 25 please - you get 169 so what are the square numbers 5 squared + 12 squared you get 13 squared now observe now here when you take multiples you can see that so multiple multiplied by 2 you get this multiplied by 3 you can find it other pair 3 times 3 9 3 times 4 12 3 times 5 that should be equal to 15 square so 9 squared is 81 12 squared is 144 when you add it you get to 125 so we need to find another pair but this is not sufficient when you consider multiples if you watch my back for you get 12 square 16 square that should be equal to 20 squared but it's not there but we know 20 squared is 400 we'll check 12 squared is 144 and 16 squared is 256 when you add it you get 400 that's 20 
,,squared question number 3 write down the perfect square between 10 and 20 and the reason for it so square numbers are length into width 5 square so in between 10 and 20 so 3 times 3 9 4 times 4 16 so 4 squared is 16 so what's the reason there we can write number of rows is equal to number of columns this is square second part write down the perfect square between 60 and 70 8 times 8 64 so 64 is a square number here also number of rows is equal to number of columns third one write down the perfect square between 80 and 90 and reason for it 9 times 9 81 that's also number of rows is equal to number of columns how many powerful squats are there between 110 960 so you get 11 times 11 is hundred 21 10 times 700 so more than 10 so 11 times 11 121 12 times 12 144 13 times 1369 only 2 numbers are there question number 4 complete the table given below why's this this is some the perfect square in index form one is one that's one square 1 plus 3 4 that's 2 square 1 plus 3 plus 5 9 that's three square what's the value here 4 4 + 5 9 9 + 7 16 that's 4 squared and here 16 plus 9 25 that's 5 square using the above table right the special feature of the numbers that are obtained when consecutive odd integers starting from 1 are added together so what's the property you are getting square numbers so when you add numbers integers like this these are odd numbers when you add odd numbers you are getting square numbers so you can write adding consecutive odd numbers we get square 
,,square numbers example number one is 272 a perfect square what do you know from the last digit once place when you get two three seven eight these are not perfect square numbers so here you can write last digit is - there are four 272 is not a perfect square excercise 8.2 by considering the digit in the unit's place of each of the numbers given below show that they are not perfect squares so last digit is two last digit is 2 therefore not a perfect square last digit is seven last digit 7 therefore not a perfect square 513 is also not a perfect scrap last digit is 3 not a perfect square question number two give an example of a perfect square which has nine in its units place so how do you get nine in the unit's place you can get three and what are 7 so 7 times 7 49 3 times 3 9 so you can get 13 times 13 or 17 times 17 so you get lost digit 9 so give an example of a perfect square so 13 times 13 you get hundred sixty-nine question number three if the digits in the unit's place 
,,of a whole number is one of zero one four five six or nine then it is a perfect square so with an example that this statement is not always true so we'll take last digit 0 1 4 5 6 9 so we know that 10 is not a perfect square and if we take 1 here 21 is not a perfect square before that's 54 is not a perfect square with 5 they take 150 is also not a perfect square with six 126 is not a perfect square and with nine will put any number 159 it's not a perfect question number four observe the digit in the units place of each number given below and write the digit in the unit's phase of their respective squares so that means 34 squared now four squared is there so what's the last digit 6 because 4 into 4 16 so 6 is the last digit what about this one 68 squared so 8 times 8 64 so 4 is their last digit third one 45 squared so 5 times 5 25 so 5 is the last digit example number one find the value of root 576 using prime factors so we'll do that 576 divide by 2 again 288 divided by 2 again you get 144 divided by 2 72 divided by 2 again 36 divided by 2 18 divided by 2 9 divided by 3 3 here 3 so here take pairs of numbers here you get 2 squared 2 squared another 2 squared and 3 squared when you take the square root what you get square and the square root get canceled out you get 2 times 2 times 2 times 3 2 times 
,,2 4 4 times 2 8 8 times 3 24 so 24 is the square root of this value using prime factors exercise 8.3 find the value of each of the following so square term is there 
,,when you take the square root it get cancelled out and you get 2 times 5 that's 10 this 1 square term is there you can take the square root is 2 times 3 times 5 so 2 times 3 6 6 times 5 30 this one you can write this one as 3 times 5 twice is there that means quarter and then when you take the square root it get cancelled out and you can take 3 times 5 that's 15 this one you can write as 3 squared + 7 squared here when you take the square root you get 3 + 7 21 this one you can write 2 squared 3 squared + another 3 square when you pair up these numbers when you take the square root it get canceled out and you can write 2 times 3 times 3 2 times 3 6 6 times 3 18 find the square root using prime factors so take the number divided by prime numbers look at 72 divided by 2 36 divided by 2 18 divided by 2 again 9 divided by 3 you get 3 so when you pair up the numbers you can write this one as 2 squared another 2 squared and 3 squared when you take the square root you get 2 2 3 4 times twelve is the answer 400 use prime factors / - / - again - again 52 again 25 five again get one now pair up them factors you get 2 squared now the two square are 
,,then 5 squared when you take the square root you get 2 times 2 times 5 4 times 5 20 so square root of 400 is 2900 divide by 2 divide by 2 again divide by 5 divided by 5 and again divide by 3 and 3 so when you pair up the factors you can write as 2 squared 5 squared + 3 square when you take the square root of 900 2 times 5 times 
,,3 10 times 3 30 325 square root rally so take this take 2 and divide 2 times 1 - 6 - 2 times 8 then 3 3 times 2 6 + 7 3 times 9 again divide by 3 you get 1 when you 
,,take pass you get 2 squared 3 squared and another 3 squared when you take the square root you get 2 3 three six times 3:18 is the answer for square root 324 625 625 
,,divided by five 125 divided by five again 25 five again you get five so you get two paths so 5 squared + 5 squared when you take the square root you get five times five that's 25 484 find out the factors 180 divided by two divided by two again divided by three you can't divide by three you can divide by 11 11 times 11 is 121 so 
,,when you pair up this you get 2 squared + 11 squared square root so 2 times 11 that's 22 what is the side length of a square shape parking lot of area 256 so that means finding the square root of that square root of 256 is the side length so we'll check this one is X and this one is X so I can write x squared is 256 so what's X 
,,square root of 256 we'll use prime factors to find out the square root divided by 2 divide by 2 again - again you get 32 16 8 and for another 2 there you get these numbers when you pair up you get 2 squared another to another two one two or three four four paths of choice so when you take the square root you get 2 times 2 times 
,,2 times 2 4 4 times 2 8 8 times 2 16 so what's the length what is the side length 16 metres because this is given in square meters question number 4 the area of a square land is 169 square meters find the length of a side of the land this is also a square we'll put X and X the area X into X is equal to 169 so x squared is 169 how you find X that means square root of 169 so we'll use prime factors to find out the square root divided by 13 13 times 13 is 169 so you can write 13 square when you take the square root that's 13 meters this is an activity complete the table given below by considering the perfect squares you have identified so far and they are square roots perfect squares with digit 1 is given here perfect squares with the digits digit 4 in the unit's place so what are the numbers for 24 you it's not 34 44 50 460 470 480 490 400 4 Oh 100 1424 what is 134 144 is a square now so what's the other number so you have to multiply and see so you need four they are so when you take 324 it's another square number what about another one 484 either another square number now square roots of these perfect squares now find out square roots to 812 so what's the square root of this 324 is 80 what about 484 square root when you find out what's going on root you get 22 now look at the next one perfect squares with the digit 5 in the unit's place so what's the first one you get 20 how do you get another value with digit 5 in the last place 225 is also square number and what is 625 is also a square number now try out some more values thousand 225 is also another square number with last digit 5 and 2025 is also a square now now find the square root of those 25 square root is fine 225 square root is 15 this one is 25 thousand 225 square root what's that 35 and this one is 45 now to the next one last digit - six what's the first number 60 then 36 what's the next 196 then when you count you get 256 what about the next one you get 576 so what are the square root value is there square root of 16 is 4 square root of 36 is 6 what about 196 square root that's 14 256 square root that's 16 times 16 that's 60 what's the square root of 576 you get 20 now perfect squares with the digit 9 what are the numbers 9 and then 49 169 what else you get count and see 289 then what's the next number you get 529 when you take the square roots you get 3 here 7 and 13 for 169 so what's this one 289 23 and what about the square root of 529 that's 29 then perfect squares 
,,with the digit 0 in the unit's place so what's the first number 100 then 400 what is 900 you are getting then thousand six hundred and two thousand five hundred when you take the square root values you get 10 20 times so here 20 30 40 50 so you have to try out all these square numbers so this is then activity for you complete the table given below using the information in 1 to 6 in the above table so here we are asking to look at the values here and identify the pattern but we know what are the numbers getting if the digit in the unit's place of the perfect square 1 4 5 6 9 0 what are the digits in the unit's place of the square root can you remember 0 is definitely 0 only 0 times 0 you get 0 and 5 also only 5 you are getting winded last digit is 5 what about 1 1 you can get 1 times 1 and 9 times 9 81 so that's one day 1 & 9 what about four you can get either 2 or 8 times 8 64 so you get 2 or 8 6 36 or 16 16 means 4 times 4 or 6 times 6 36 9 how you get 3 times 3 9 of 7 times 7 49 so 3 or 7 example number one find square wrote off 961 so we'll use the method we did by looking at the 100 place value and their unit's place so we take square root of 9 that's a square number that's true so once place square root of 1 is 1 so what's the number square root of 960 1 is 31 so 31 times 31 is 961 we can check it 31 times 31 3 with 30 with 1 3 times 1/9 and you get 961 so square root of 961 is equal to 31 example number two so here have you find out square root of 625 so 
,,this is not a square number here in hundreds place so what you do take the number square number less than that what's the square number less than 6 square root of 4 
,,that's 2 5 how do you get 5 as the last digit only with 5 so what's the square root of 625 that's 25 25 times 25 is 625 example number 3 784 so look at the hundredths place value what's the square number less than that 7 is the number 4 is the square number less than so square root of four is two for we are you get for either two or eight you get last digit as for now what are the possibilities you can get either 22 or 28 now how you decide which number is suitable now I told you take a closest value so 25 times 25 it's a square number that's 625 this number is more than that sir so definitely above 25 that should be 28 so we'll check it 28 times 28 that means 20 and 8 so you get 64 8 times 2 16 plus 6 4 8 7 784 so that's the answer so what's the square root of 784 answer is 28 so you are getting the same question in example 3 here I'll use a different method so using multiples of 10 I can write 784 is in between what are the 2 square numbers in between 400 and 900 then what's the square root of 400 that's 20 this one 30 square root of 900 so square root of 784 should be in between 20 and 30 but we know that last digit is four so what are the possibilities of getting for either 208 so the two possible numbers are 22 that's in between in 20 and 30 and 28 so 22 times twenty two or twenty eight times twenty-eight then you can check with the number that we know already 25 times 25 is 625 so this is more than that so definitely this should be 28 so this is another way of finding square root value so 28 times 28 is 784 so what's the square root of 784 that's 28 example number four show that 836 is not a perfect square so how we 
,,identify it's not a perfect square we'll use the same method what's the square number less than this that's square root 4 you get to have you get 6 as the last digit you get 4 or 6 now what are the possibilities you can get you can get either 24 or 26 those are the two possibilities you can get for a square number so we'll multiply and see what's the number you aren't getting so if it's not a perfect square you get different answers here so we multiply and see 24 times 24 and it together 576 and when you multiply 26 times 26 and it together you get 676 now say 836 is not a square number so therefore 836 is not a perfect square exercise 8.4 complete the table given below perfect square numbers are their square root of the perfect square so you can write similar to this one 36 square root is 36 is 6 square and square root and square term get canceled out and you get 6 64 square root is 8 squared and when you take the square root you get 8 121 square root is this is 11 squared the answer is 11 400 square root is 20 squared square root answer is 20 and 900 means square root 900 means 30 squared and when you take the square root that's 30 question number 2 check whether they will give our numbers are perfect squares and find the square root of each number which is a perfect square so here 169 so last digit is 9 so can be a perfect square so square root of 1 means 1 and square root of 9 is 3 so this is 13 square so when you take 13 Square and take the square root you get square root of 169 so what's the square root you get 13 now look at this one last digit is 2 so last digit is 2 means not a perfect square this one 441 we can use square root of this one is 2 square root of 1 is 1 so I can write this one as 21 square so what's the square root of 440 what's the square root of 441 that's square and take the square root that's equal to 21 now what about this one 716 is it a square number we have to check it so 6 you can get either from 6 or 4 and here square root of 7 that's the closest value is square root for and that's to 24 or 26 so we will multiply and see 24 times 24 576 and 26 times 26 676 so that means 716 is not her he is not a perfect square now take these questions 361 so one you can get either from 109 and square root value so the closest value less than 3 is square 
,,root of 1 that's smart so 11 times 11 is 121 19 times 19 will check what is 19 times 19 10 and 9 so you get 9 times 9 81 9 times 1 9 9 plus 8 17 so 361 so how can you write this one as 19 squared so 361 square root is 19 squared square root that's 19 this one 484 square root of 4 is 2 square root of 4 is 2 so that means 22 squared is the square value so 484 is 22 square so what is square root of 484 that's 20 here this one last digit is 2 that means it's not a perfect square this one 529 9 
,,have you get 3 times 3 9 Oh 7 times 7 49 what's the square root value you can take less than 5 square root 4 so square root 4 is 2 so this should be either twenty three or twenty seven will multiply and see 23 times 23 529 so that means this is 23 square then when you want to find the square root that's equal to 23 this one too 
,,is there this is not a perfect square 624 will find 4 how do you get for either by 2 times 2 or 8 times 8 toyatte 6 what's the lowest value for 6 less than 6 that's 
,,square root 4 that's 2 so you can get either twenty two or twenty eight will multiply and see 22 times 22 you get 484 now we'll check with 28 8 times 8 here 8 times 
,,8 64 8 times 2 16 plus 6 6 you get 22 for eight seven 784 so that means 624 is not square numbers question number three the value of square root 324 is a whole number between 15 and 20 find square root of 3 and 24 by observing the last digit okay so what's the last digit for how you get for there 2 times 2 4 or 8 times 8 64 2 or 8 what's the number between 15 and 20 you can get not 12 so only number is 18 so 18 is in between 15 and 20 so we'll see whether 18 times 18 you get 324 18 times 18 8 times 8 64 8 times 1 8 plus 6 14 you get 324 so 18 times 83 is 324 so what's the square root of 324 that's 8625 is a perfect square it's square root is a whole number between 20 and 30 find square root of 625 so we'll observe the NASS digit last digit is 5 that means definitely the number should be with the last digit 5 so in between 20 and thirty only possibility is 25 so we'll check 25 times 25 25 times 25 20 and 5 you get 500 and here 5 times 5 25 5 times 2 10 plus 2 12 so you get 625 so that means what's the square root of 625 that's equal to 25 find the square root of each of the numbers given below by observation you look at the number and see 6 what's the possibility to get 6 what's the possibility to get 6 4 & 6 this one - what's the number less than that square number less than root 2 that's root 1 that's 1 so 14 or 16 now we know 15 times 15 225 this is more than 225 so what's the number should be 16 so 16 times 16 should be 256 so what's the square root of 256 that's 16 this one how do you get one what are the possibilities 1 or 9 and here 4 square root of 4 is 2 so this should be either 21 or 29 now we know 20 times 20 400 so this is close to 400 so we'll check 21 times 21 and see so 21 and 21 you get 441 so the square root of 441 is 21 now look at this one 729 so how you get the last digit is 9 3 times 3 or 7 times 7 now when you take 7 what's the square number lower than 7 that square root 4 that's 2 now you can get either 23 or 27 what's the method how you identify the value we know 25 times 25 is 625 so this number is more than 625 so that means more than 25 means 27 we have to check it 27 times 27 + 6 20 + 7 14 + 5 7 times 7 49 7 times 2 14 + 4 18 you get 729 so what's the square root of 729 that's 27 because you get here 729 361 how you identify how you get one one times 109 times 981 then when you take the first digit what's the square number less than this square root of 1 that's 1 so you are getting either 11 or 19 now how you identify how you identify that 15 times 15 225 so this is more than 15 so this should be 90 so we'll check 19 times 99 times 981 9 times 1 9 Plus 8 17 361 so this is 19 times 91 so square root of 361 is 19 look at this one 841 how you get one either 1 or 9 8 when you take 8 what's the square number less than that 8 square number is 4 4 means square root of 4 2 so what are the possibilities 21 or 29:21 not 29 so we'll check 25 we know 25 times 25 625 but this is more than that so definitely this should be 29 so we'll check with 29 29 times 29 29 580 you get 26 here 840 bar so that's the answer so what's the square root of 841 that's 20 miscellaneous exercise in the given figure ABCD is the square of side length eight given and btrs is a square of side length six and eight EPQ is the square of side length check find the area of the square ABCD so atheria eight times eight that's 64 square centimeters find the area of the square bt RS side length is six 6 times 6 36 square 
,,centimeters find the area of the square 80 PQ that's length 10 10 times 200 find a special relationship between the areas of the three squares observe carefully what can you see 64 plus 36 is 100 what can you say 64 is 8 square a-square plus 6 squared is equal to 10 square so that's the relationship between these areas question 
,,number 2 the value of root 500 cannot be found by using prime factors explain the reason for it we'll check by dividing by prime numbers divided by 2 you get 250 divided by 2 125 then divide by 5 25 divided by 5 this is 5 again divide by 5 you get 1 so when you are trying to pair up the factors here you can't tear up this file so that's why we can't find the square root of 500 using prime factors so we can write square root of 500 is equal to 2 squared 5 squared + 5 so here you can't you can't pair up 5 therefore cannot use Prime functions question number 3 show that 8 squared minus 5 squared is this and show the same relationship for another pair of perfect squares we'll take left hand side 8 squared minus 5 squared simplify 8 squared is 64 5 squared is 25 so you get 9 9 plus 5 14 one remaining so 39 now we'll check right hand side 8 plus 5 and 8 minus 5 so you get 13 times 2 8 5 13 times 3 3 times 3 9 3 times 139 so here left hand side is equal to right hand side so this statement is let me take another example 9 squared minus 5 squared so this should be 9 plus 5 and 9 minus 5 we'll check that 9 squared is 81 20 here 5 squared is 25 so what's the subtraction you get 6 & 3 so 56 what about the right hand side 9 plus 5 49 minus 5 14 times 456 so this is equal to this this is also true so we covered 
,,all theory related to square roots so we obtain a perfect square when we multiply a positive integer by itself if a number is a square of a positive integer then the square root of that number is that positive integer of which is the square the symbol is this and the square root of a perfect square can be found by observing the 
,,last digit of that number when you get to three seven eight it's not a perfect square number the square root of a perfect square can also be found using prime factors so practice all exercises and examples and thorough with finding square root of a number

Number Partens,OZbS9g3B79k,chapter 1 number buttons graded mathematics second video the general term of a number pattern here i have given the first three terms of a number pattern can you use the other terms okay let's see the first term is two second term is four four mean two multiplied by two okay second term was four and four multiplied by two eight 
,,okay then next term should be 8 multiplied by 2 it's 16 16 multiplied by 2 then it's 32 okay i think this is the number pattern of the terms 2 4 8 16 32 and so on one can tell a different number pattern that person think the first term is 2 and the second term is 4 4 is obtained by adding 2 to 2 then it's 4 and the third term was obtained by multiplying the second term by 2 so it's 8 according to the pattern that person thinks that the fourth term should be eight plus two it means it's ten 
,,and the fifth term is obtained by multiplying the fourth term so 10 into 2 it's 20 then that person will obtain another number pattern with the terms 2 4 8 10 20 22 
,,and so on oh god now we have obtained two number patterns so which one is the correct one do you know that so an important fact that can be learned from this is that there can be more than one number pattern having the same first few terms that's why we should use the general term to express a number button general term of a number pattern now we are going to consider about the number pattern with the terms 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 and so on so what is the special name we can use to express this number button yes it's multiples of two or even numbers starting from 2 written in ascending order here i have put the comma sign to separate the terms so the first term t1 is equals to 2. second term t 2 is equals to 4 third term t 3 is equals to 6. likewise n term is equals to tn this is the general term of the number pattern when the end term of a number pattern is written as an algebraic expression in n it is called the general term of the number pattern using the general term the value of any term in the number pattern can be found the general term of the number pattern of multiples of a number now i'm considering about the number pattern with the terms 2 4 6 8 10 12 and so on so this is the even number pattern starting from 2 written in ascending mode at first we should find the common difference of the given 
,,number pattern here i can consider about any term except the first term i'm considering about the term 8 then 8 minus the previous term 6 so 8 minus 6 it's equals to 2 now i'm going to build up the general term of the even number pattern okay in here we are going to use the relationship between the common difference and the his 
,,general difference is 2 and we know the first term t1 is equals to 2 it is the first term so 2 multiplied by 1 it's equals to 2 there's a second term t 2 is equals to 4 2 x 2 it's also four third term two multiplied by three it's equals to six t3 equals six yeah it's correct so t n n term n term should be equal to 2 multiplied by n it's in 2 in so the general term of the even number pattern is 2 n so we can use the general term t n equals 2 n to find any term of this number pattern by substituting suitable values for n into n we can obtain the values of the relevant terms the value of n in the general term of a number pattern should always be a positive integer first one find the 10th term of the even number pattern we know the general term of the even number pattern tn equals to 2 n and in here we should find the 10 term to find the tenth term we should substitute 10 to the term n so t 10 is equals to 2 multiplied by 10 therefore 10 term is equals to 20 second one find the 51st term of the even number pattern we know the general term tn is equals to 2n we should find the 51st term so now i am substituting 51 to the term n so t 51 is equals to 2 x 51 therefore t 51 is equals to 102 which term is 100 of the even number pattern we know the general term tn is equals to 2n here they have given the value of the term it's 100 so we can substitute 100 for tn so 100 is equals to 2n now we should simplify this and find the value of n n is multiplied by two so we should 
,,divide both sides by two hundred divided by two is equals to two n divided by two 100 divided by 2 it's 50 therefore 100 is the 50th term of this number pattern the 
,,general term of the number pattern of the multiples of a number previously we constructed the general term of the even number pattern starting from 2 it's in tn equals 2n here i have tabulated few number patterns and the general term the first number pattern is even number pattern so the general term should be equal to 2 n second number pattern is multiples of three starting from three so the general term tn should be equal to three n third number pattern is multiples of four starting from 
,,4 so the general term tn is equal to 4n fourth number pattern is with the terms 5 10 15 20 25 30 and so on this is the number pattern of multiples of 5 starting from 5 so the general term should be equal to 5 n fifth number pattern is multiples of 7 starting from 7 so the general term tn should be equal to 7 n so this is very simple to identify the general term of multiples of a number first one the general term of the number pattern of the multiples of 3 starting from 3 and written in ascending order is 3n roman number 1 find the 15th term of this number pattern here they have given the general term tn is equal to 3n here we have to find the 15 term so we should substitute 15 to the value of n so t 15 is equals to 3 multiplied by 15 therefore the answer is 45 15 term is 45 roman number 2 which term is 72 of this 
,,number pattern we know the general term is equal to 3 n and they have given the volume of the term it's 72 so 72 is equal to 3n and we should solve this simple equation and find the value of n in here n is multiplied by 3 so we should divide both sides by 3 72 divided by 3 is equal to 24 72 is the 24th term of this number pattern roman number 3 is 80 a term of this number pattern we know the general term is equal to 3 n here the given value is 80 so we should substitute 80 to the value of tn so it is equal to 3 n here n is multiplied by 3 so we should divide both sides by 3. 80 is not divisible by 3 so we will obtain n is equal to 26 and two thirds this is not a positive integer it's a mixed number so 80 cannot be a term of this number pattern do the activity number two to continue the lesson you should watch the

Number Partens,yBPraaPfLSA,hey what do you say we test your logical thinking by solving these ten kids riddles exceptional logical thinking is rare in today's world do you think you have it well let's find out with a couple of brain teasers but don't sigh with relief just yet because these riddles aren't as easy as you might think before we start remember to subscribe to our Channel and turn on notifications now you won't miss any of our new videos okay here we go riddle number one look at this toy here amid carefully in what order will you see the colors from the top view you have 15 seconds to think about it have you prepared your answer yet it's not that hard look at the pyramid carefully again from the top view you'll see the colors in this order dark blue light blue green yellow and red easy-peasy riddle number two a man wrote three words on a glass board but it suddenly fell and shattered into numerous pieces here are some of the pieces with letters on them each of these three groups of letters forms a word can you find out what the words are and find the odd one out think quickly you have only 15 seconds let's look at it together the first set of letters forms the word bacon the second set makes the word cupcake whoo-hoo bacon cupcakes mmm and the third one says love if you chose love as the odd went out you're wrong it's actually bacon because cupcake and love both end with an e we warned you that the riddles weren't easy so keep an eye out no not literally don't take your eye out ill riddle number three let's talk about family now imagine a family with two mothers two daughters one grandmother and one granddaughter the question is simple how many people are in this family count them all in 15 seconds the key to cracking this riddle is remembering that one person isn't always only one thing for example 
,,someone's daughter is also someone else's granddaughter in this particular family there are actually three members a grandmother her daughter and her granddaughter think about it the grandmother is the mother to her daughter while her daughter is the mother to her granddaughter we guess family ties can be really confusing riddle number 4 look at this shape carefully now look at these three shapes that it becomes if you turn it to one side or the other one of these three is again an odd one 
,,out can you spot it time is ticking if you chose shapes see as the odd one out congratulations you passed this test look at it once again the red square here at the 
,,end is missing well shapes a and B are perfectly fine attention is the key riddle number 5 2 5 8 14 and can you figure out what the next number should be and why time to use your logical thinking again the correct answer here is 23 did you guess correctly the pattern is very simple you need to add the first number to the next number and add one after that for example 2 plus 5 is 7 and 7 plus 1 is 8 then 5 plus 8 is 13 and 13 plus 1 is 14 and finally 8 plus 14 is 22 and 22 plus 1 is 23 and just like that riddle number six look at these four letter combinations each of them forms the last name of a famous person your task is simple find out what these last names are and identify the odd one out your 15 seconds start now well let's see whether you crack this riddle the first name is DaVinci the second one is Vivaldi 
,,the third one is Van Gogh and the final one is Rembrandt if you've answered this part right you've probably picked Vivaldi as the odd one out which is right he's the only composer in this list of painters well done riddle number seven there's a shelf of books in a library on this shelf a particular book is fourth from the left and the six from the right knowing this can you figure out how many books there are on this shelf tick-tock if your answer is nine you're right and should give yourself a pat on the back if your arms long enough if the book is the fourth from the left that means there are three books before it and if it's the sixth from the right that means there are five books after it five plus three is eight plus the book itself gives us nine riddle number eight o t t F F s s there should be three more letters in this sequence but what are they use these 15 seconds to crack this riddle the correct answer is much simpler and easier than you probably thought these numbers represent the first letters of the numbers one to ten here we finished on a seven so the next three letters are e 4 8 n 4 9 and T 4 10 simply genius riddle number nine let's throw a bit more math into the mix shall we let's look at these two equations given this information do you have any idea which number should be in the 
,,place of this question mark and why take your time the numbers in these equations symbolize the number of times the straight lines cross the pictures if you look carefully at the first one you'll see nine crossing points while the last picture shows only four and here's your answer riddle number ten here's another number progression for you can you find the mistake here our traditional 15 seconds begin to be fair we couldn't find an answer to this riddle do you have any variants share them

Number Partens,wCtc75zDZkc,learning of ayah hi i'm aya today i'm going to talk about number patterns a number pattern is a series of numbers that follow a particular pattern or sequence number patterns let's find the next two numbers by following each pattern two four six eight ten twelve plus two plus two what is the pattern add two is the pattern glowing or shrinking growing let's try another one 30 27 24 21 18 fifteen minus three minus three what is the pattern subtract three is the pattern growing or shrinking shrinking let's try this one zero one zero one zero one zero one what is the pattern repeating numbers repeating numbers the same grouping over and over again the pattern never changes fill in the missing values inscribe the number pattern 20 25 30 35 40 45 what is the pattern add five twenty-five twenty-two nineteen sixteen thirteen ten what is the pattern subtract 3 24 20 16 12. eight four what is the pattern subtract 4 7 14 21 28 35 42 what is the pattern at seven one two three one two three one two three what is the pattern repeating numbers things to remember number pattern is a list of numbers that follow a certain sequence or pattern going when the numbers are getting bigger shrinking pattern the numbers are getting smaller repeating upon the same number grouping over and over again that's about it for our number patterns for today you can check my other videos about patterns thank you for watching this is i am saying bye bye

Number Partens,1_DSMABQZbk,if you are a student and struggling with
,,math if Math super difficult for you if math comes in your nightmare then
,,you are on a right place because this video is going to change your whole student life
,,after watching this video you will be solving that super easily like Albert
,,Einstein in the next couple of minute I am going to share with you that mindset
,,of every successful mathematician who created history in mathematics that
,,mindset is the key ingredient to solve math like a piece of cake I got 97 out
,,of hundreds in my 12th math exam and now you will also score obove 90 just by
,,learning that mindset which is required to solve any math problem first you have to
,,commit something to your self this is very important without this the video
,,will be a waste for you now allows you to yourself that math is easy for me yes
,,say it again I want to hear you louder more louder no matter who is near to you
,,don't feel shy if you didn't do this you will go back to your old life where math
,,is like a demon so do not care about anybody nobody is going to come and
,,change your life only you can change your life so say this loudly to yourself
,,that math is easy for me I can solve math easily Math is a piece of cake for
,,me why this is important I will give you answer this is
,,important to take off the wrong mindset wrong programming in your mind and
,,filling it with positiveness like Math is easy for you once you really believe
,,in this then you are on a right track it's not pause this video and go in
,,front of a mirror and say this to yourself
,,till you believe this from your within from your deepest heart that math is easy for me then play this video I will be
,,always here so if you are ready completely ready let's begin first I
,,will talk about the most toxic mindset to solve math whenever a math
,,problem comes to the most of the people first they get frightened and say oh my
,,god this question is so big this question is
,,super difficult for me I can never solve this question huh where is the formula
,,how I will solve this what will happen blah blah but you now you won't say this
,,because you just change your mindset and then suddenly they will open a help
,,book in which the solution of that question is already given and they will try to
,,copy the solution from there after that they will cram the solution from there
,,and cramming math is the most worst thing you can do about your math so
,,never cram Math or if they do not find a help book what will they do they will
,,find a similar question in which the solution is given and they will try to
,,do the same in that question and it doesn't matter that done is right or not
,,if the answer is right what you have learnt from that question nothing just cramming
,,copying etc so never do this this will only make your math
,,difficult for you and the more you do this the more you will get stuffed in
,,this because this is like a spider dance so never do this because the question
,,will only increase and cramming will not solve this now the time has come in
,,which I will talk about that mindset I call it the learning + solution
,,oriented mindset in which you focus on learning trying to learn something from
,,the question and you focus on finding the solution of that question by
,,focusing on the problem you have given first let me give you a tip for solving
,,every math problem in your math book first make a list of all the formulas
,,which are going to be used in that particular chapter you are going to
,,solve this is a proven method to solve math problems if you have a list of
,,formulas which can be used in that problem
,,this makes math super easy for you so always before starting a chapter make a
,,list of all the formulas which are going to be used in that chapter for example
,,if you are going to solve trigonometry then make a list of all the formulas
,,which are going to be used in it now you will say that I hardly remember any math
,,formula it is so hard to remember them and I know but no problem with this
,,mindset you will automatically start memorizing all the formulas in your math
,,book without doing any effort if you practice what I say now you have a math
,,problem and a number of formulas to solve that problem now how will you know
,,which formula is right for the problem the answer is to read the problem
,,carefully this is the first and the most important step to solve math problem
,,most people never do this they never read the problem carefully they do this
,,this question is of this chapter they solve it like this I will solve it like
,,this I will copy this oh I didn't got the right answer oh no math is so difficult
,, for me ask yourself do you ever read a math question carefully ever
,,without starting to solve the problem if so first read the question and then
,,you will know that formula automatically which is going to be used in that
,,problem because you have a list of particular formulas which are going to
,,be used in that chapter then do not suddenly start solving the problem first
,,think in your mind how will I get from these value in the question to the one
,,value of the answer I have to use the formulas which I have what to do think
,,use your mind this will make math super interesting it is
,,like solving the puzzle game you have given a puzzle and you have some patterns
,,and some formulas to solve the problem and you have to get to the answer to the
,,goal so how will you solve the problem think in your mind but I have to do what
,,I have to change the values I have to change these numbers to this and then
,,apply this formula make it super interesting in your mind and then start
,,solving the problem lets say you got a wrong answer you try tried again you again got the wrong answer no problem you have to try again
,,always remember Einstein said I am not intelligent I just stay with the problem
,,longer than other people so the longer you will be with  the problem the more
,,chances that you will solve the problem correctly and at last you will get
,,the right answer yess you just solved a math problem on
,,your own without any help book Congrats now you have to open a helpbook and see if
,,your solution is right and learn from your mistake you did in the  previous
,,question basically this is learning learning from your mistakes this will
,,make your brain more sharper now you just solved a math problem on your own
,,what do you think you did ?you made billions of connections in your mind you
,,are using a trial and error method and constantly learning from your tries and
,,by this you will start memorizing formulas easily because you will take up
,,a formula and apply that in your question and this automatically memorizes
,,formulas I tried this and all the math formulas just stamps in my mind if you
,,practice this that you can solve any question in that chapter remember
,,Einstein said imagination is more powerful than knowledge
,,if you don't memorize formulas no matter but you should have a mind which is
,,required to solve that problem a mind which has full of imagination that how
,,you can get to the answer so next time when your teacher give you a homework of
,,a question and try to use this method in this method will math super
,,interesting for you and it will be like playing a videogame and please do not
,,go back to what you were when you open this video because there is no other way
,,to solve math more easy than this there are lots of other videos which tell how
,,to solve math easily how to become a genius etc etc but there is no other way
,,they will give you tips routines etc like I also gave you a routine but
,,you have to stick with something something in this video or in any other
,,video ok so take a simple thing and stick with it like if you say I do not want
,,to do all this from tomorrow just do a simple thing like making a list of all
,,the formulas in your chapter this will change something and you just ask
,,growing so slow and steady wins the race now you know the way the single key to
,,success in mathematics if you follow this getting above 90 is a piece of
,,cake for you now let's get something practical we will take a universal math
,,problem of seven standards so that everybody can understand it and will
,,apply this method to solve that problem if you are a high standard student than
,,see how I will solve that problem and apply the same method in your math problems
,,this will clear this concept to you more so let begin take a look at this simple
,,math question this is the seventh standard math question i took this
,,question so that everybody can understand the mindset better in this
,,question you are asked to find the volume of the cylinder of height five
,,centimeters and radius two cm this this is a cylinder of height 5
,,centimeters and radius 2 centimeters for high standard student just assume this
,,as a demonstration of that mindset I will apply that mindset in this question
,,to find the answer let's say we have a chapter in which we can find two types
,,of questions first is the volume of the cylinder and second is the surface area
,,of cylinders and we have new to all this and we don't know which formula of
,,volume and this formula of surface area so assume that this is happening and now
,,we will apply the method to solve that problem so first step is to read the
,,problem carefully in this problem we have to find the volume of cylinder of
,,height 5 centimeter and radius 2 centimeter for high standard students
,,they will say that all this question is super easy this is of volume formula we have to chunk in these values and finds answer but no this is just a
,,demonstration take it as a demonstration and use the
,,same method in your difficult question so we have these two values first is
,,height and second is radius of cylinder now let us write  first what is the
,,radius of cylinder radius or cylinder equal to 2 cm and height of cylinder is equal to five centimeters so we have
,,these two values and we have to get from these two values to the one value of the
,,volume how do we get there we have to use one formula one formula of the
,,volume we do what we have to do so first we have to know which formulas is of
,,volume at which formula is of surface area so how do we know that see
,,what is the area of circle that means all this what is the area of circle that
,,is PI R square right so we have the area of circle this and if we
,,multiply it by the height which is this then we will have a circle stacked on
,,each other to five centimeter height and then we will have the volume so we know
,,that this formula is of volume and for surface area tell me the parameter of
,,circle that is 2 PI R right and if we have hollow circle stacked on each other
,,to 5 centimeters then we will have the surface area of cylinder so we know that
,,volume of cylinder is this and we will apply this in our question so volume of cylinder so the volume of
,,cylinder which is this formula and we will apply that in our question that is
,,PI R squared H so we first have chunk in the value okay so let's chunk in the
,,value Phi is three point one four multiplied by r square which is 2 and 2 square
,,equal to 4 multiply by h which is height which is 5 centimeter and now this is equal to 62.8 centimeter cube never forget to add the unit after the value in math    
,,this is also very important tip for math so we just read the question carefully
,,knew which formulas to be applied first thought what we have to do and then did it
,,and found the answer and this is how you should always solve a math question hope
,,you enjoyed this video I wish you all the very best for your further math
,,studies in my next video I will share some amazing tips and some cool tricks which
,,will definitely help you to math more easy so subscribe this channel to

Number Partens,dv213FzqkM8,looking on sequences or patterns and rules you may recognize a lot of this what we did last year there's a difference between finding the pattern and finding the rule I have an example up here of triangles being made for toothpicks and we're going to kind of make a t-chart or keep track of how many try or how many toothpicks it 
,,takes to make these triangles okay so the first one I have one triangle how many toothpicks do you count there are three okay the second one I have two triangles but how many toothpicks did it take to make that it took five in your book they kind of the illustrations a little better for three triangles how many toothpicks did it take somebody said seven we count one two three four five six seven and four four triangles we get nine now we could continue this pattern week if we were four five triangles what would be four six four seven four eight in doing so we're trying to find the pattern is there a pattern that occurs what do you notice it looks like 
,,I'm adding two each time so we can say if you remember from last year that we can state it as an x equals now so this one would be next equals now and what +2 can that's stating the pattern now not all patterns have an x equals now there may be a pattern where goes one then it goes two then you add three than yet four okay but what we're looking at now is we're looking at a special pattern which you either add or subtract the same number each time and that can be stated as a next equals now now when you're given a pattern like this I'm going to make a suggestion that's really really huge if you do this it'll make your life so much easier when you're trying to find not just the pattern but the rule I have a sequence of numbers 3 5 7 9 11 same sequence or pattern that we had up here instead of writing going across horizontally let's make them into a t-chart okay what's the end representing the term number first second third and so forth okay I think I have this down later on so let's write let me go down to that one each term has a place three is in the it's the first term so you can kind of call it the first place second term third term and so forth a term or you can call it in okay what's the second term five what's the third term fourth nine and the fifth is 11 okay now we have already found the pattern correct that's going this direction how does each change each time that's the pattern and you notice we add two each time but you know I kind of like shortcuts I kind of like to see if I could find a shortcut so if I want to know what the 20th term was in other words if I have 20 triangles how many toothpicks am I going to need and I sure would like to do it some way other than counting down six seven eight nine ten all the way down so what is it that we're going to find in order to get that shortcut know what that's called Mary I'm going to find the rule now the rule goes from term number to your number okay in other words if I go to the second 
,,what do I do to this to to get if I would I do to three to give a seven what I do to four to get a nine and so forth I want you to think about that just for a minute if you think you've come up with a rule that would apply don't you share with your partner and see if they agree okay where do you noticing crystal she says I've taken my term number times 2 and then adding one let's try it 1 times 2 is plus 1 is 2 times 2 is plus 1 is 3 times 2 is plus 1 is Wow must be working so 20 times 2 is plus 1 would be 41 so my rule that I'm going to refer to is 2n plus 1 where n is my term number the pattern was your next equals now statement now it doesn't always have to be an x equals now statement and the pattern could have been a plus one plus two plus three and then you put dot dot dots syn to that pattern continues and 
,,then we find the rule now did you notice anything about that rule and the pattern that have something in common maybe something you might have a clue about what you 
,,notice Taylor okay the pattern was a 2 so do you think that always your rule might involve a 2 well if it's not there's not a direct connection that's a place to start okay I'm not going to say it always works but it's always a good place to start in other words if I can say to myself okay 1 plus 2 is 3 but not 2 plus 2 doesn't 
,,give me 5 ok that's not going to work so let me try multiplying 1 times 3 is 3 but 2 times 3 isn't 5 okay that's not working so that tells me that's probably a two-step rule it's going to have two steps that take place and we found that did so try using the 2 or taking 2 times your number and then see how far off you are okay so I tried 2 times 1 and I got 2 but I'm still how many away from one away 2 times 2 is 4 by I'm still one away 3 times 2 6 months still 1 away so then that tells me I'm going to take 2 times n plus 1 do you think that always works let's try it write this one down in your handy-dandy and try it see if you can come up with a pattern and the rule 5 8 11 14 and 17 first okay ok your first step is I'm going to transfer it into a t-chart my first term was 5 my second term was 8 and oftentimes they'll be just listed as number so you have to translate that into which term the third term is 11 the fourth term is 14 and the fifth term is what 17 okay the first thing is let's look for our pattern marry what you do to find the pattern okay I'm looking at your numbers and just see what are they doing in other words from here what a might where am I going each time I am adding 3 ok so I can say that that's my pattern to add 3 can I state that in the next equals now yes next equals now plus 
,,three if you couldn't put it in next equals now like let's say it went up one and then went up two then three you would put a plus one comma plus two comma plus three comma dot because you've given enough to show us what the pattern is okay but this clearly is a plus three every time okay now let's take a look at your rule because remember if we find that this happens sometimes that helps us with our rule let's see is there anything I can do directly like one plus four gives you five so it's two plus four eight that's not working is it okay one times five five yes but it's two times five eight okay that doesn't work that's where you need to start you need to look to see is there a direct relationship there isn't so what do you think Jake okay and what was your pattern three so does it have anything to do a three so try this what's 1 times 3 and I'm 2 away from my goal right what's 2 times 3 and I'm 2 away from my goal hmm what's 3 times 3 and I'm 2 away from my goal so we can say that the rule if I put it in here I'm going to have to take 3 times in and then do what to it plus 2 how many had that good so this helps us helps us if I want 
,,to ask okay if I have a hundred terms what would be the hundredth term in this sequence what would I do Michelle 300 which gives you three hundred plus two that's right you get three hundred two so that saves me from having to make that whole long boring list is if I can arrange it and find a rule yes Sean do you always use this I'm saying a lot of times it could be a key there are some times that no that doesn't help you one clue is Sean if you're going to have term one two three four five it works sometimes they have other numbers than one two three four five so then it doesn't always work if they give them to you okay when we get to plotting ordered pairs it oftentimes does not work Sean okay if they're just giving you a set of numbers then you can use the first second third fourth fifth and you put them in that order what's this kind of pattern called this kind of pattern is called an arithmetic sequence the one that we just looked at it's called an arithmetic sequence or pattern an arithmetic sequence is when you add or subtract the same amount to each term it's a special pattern or sequence which you add or subtract the same amount to each term for instance if I have the pattern 1 3 5 7 9 I would be adding 2 each time so this one is an arithmetic sequence if I had the example of 10 6 2 negative 2 negative 6 I'm having to subtract 4 each time therefore it 2 is also an arithmetic sequence now let's take a look at the pattern 4 9 14 19 let's see if there's a pattern and if there is a rule that we can apply for the first thing if you're specially if you're looking for your rule is to set it up using a t-chart okay that's the key if you want if I try to find the rule set it up in a t-chart he'll give a few minutes to work on that okay say I want you to try to find the pattern and then the rule in order to get us so that we know what the twelfth term will be I saw a chord my first term was for my second term is nine third was 14 and fourth was 19 what pattern did you notice occurring Shawn next equals now what are you doing each time just right here how am I going from 4 to 9 what am i doing that's my pattern that's I don't want the rule quite yet we're going to get to the rule I'm sorry I can add 5 thank you sorry Saint this thing in my ear it was even worse my hearing aids don't work up near as well okay I need upgrade of your right you're adding five each time and we show that here okay so that would be our pattern next equals now plus five now take that and try to make a rule out of it and Shawn what did you get huh okay so let's make this an in so I'm going to take five times in and then 
,,one minus one let's see if it'll work then 1 times 5 it's 5 minus 1 is 4 2 times 5 is 10 minus 1 is 9 3 times 5 is 15 minus 1 is 14 it works what happens then when I put a 12 in 4 in 5 times 12 is 16 minus 1 is 59 very good very good it did it did in this case good observation okay any questions on arithmetic sequences
,,
Number Partens,7EmWdysUk0c,a sequence is simply a set of numbers in a particular order or a set of numbers which follow a pattern the most basic example of a sequence is that of counting numbers 1 2 3 4 and so on the numbers follow an increasing pattern the three dots mean the list goes on forever and are referred to as the ellipsis the numbers don't necessarily have to be continuous to be a sequence a list like 0 5 10 15 and so on are also said to be in a sequence what's the pattern here every number is increased by five to get the next number a constant increment of five let's take an example of a sequence which has an increment of two like 1 3 5 7 9 and so on for your exams there are just two things you need to know about any sequence first how do you find the nth term of a sequence and second how do you define the sequence what do I mean when I say the nth term say I asked you the 31st term of the sequence you have no time to write all the 31 terms to find that out we need to have a formula and yes we have one it is the first term plus n minus 1 times D ft is the first term and is the term number so if we want to find the 31st term we just substitute 31 in place of n and D is called the difference between any two continuous terms it's called the common difference it's extremely simple to derive this formula but you don't 
,,really need to know it for your exams so don't dwell too much over it in this example as the first term is 1 and the common difference is 2 the nth term will be 1 plus n minus 1 times 2 how do we define a particular sequence we just solve this for the expanding this gives us 2 n minus 2 and we add the 1 this gives us 2 n minus 1 here n takes the value of all natural numbers don't forget n is the term number if we call this sequence s the first term of the sequence will be written as s 1 to 
,,find the first term all we do is substitute 1 in place of n we get 2 times 1 minus 1 and 2 minus 1 gives us 1 now with this formula try foiling the ninth and the 21st term of the sequence the 9th term will be 2 times 9 minus 1 which equals 17 and the 21st term will be 2 times 21 minus 1 which equals 41 41 is the 21st term of the sequence so to define the sequence we just use the nth term formula and substitute the values of the first term and the common difference we will look at a couple of sequence examples in the next part of the session you

Number Partens,TsFLRXw5lKY,hello grade 8 children today I'm here to teach you chapter 3 in your textbook that's angles this is a geometry lesson we'll see what are the basics related to angers what is an angle so angle is formed by two line segments from one center point so if we take this point oh oh a OB are the two lines so here we can say Oh a and OB 
,,pass from the center point oh oh is the vertex point we call this is the vertex point and it is fixed and Oh a and OB ah raise angle is what is the angle form we can write two ways we can start from a a OB so this is how we write a OB and we put a hatch above representing that o is the angle or we can start from the other side B or a so we can write like this or if it's one angle we can write down just a anger this is also possible so when you take this diagram you get two line segments and a fixed point so we can define angle as a rotation so how we can define an angle as a rotation rotation of a line segment what is the line if you take this one Oh a is the line segment around the point oh it's called the anger so when you rotate here to here you get an anger so this is the angle created and this is clockwise we are rotating clockwise from a units off angles what are the measurements we use we used degrees how we represent degrees so we put a small 0 so here superscript of 
,,0 so if this is 30 degrees we put 30 and put a small 0 here so this means 30 degrees so you need tough measurement used for measuring and angle is decrease symbol for degrees is a small circle in the superscript so if you take the circle the entire circle so how many degrees is that so 360 so entire circle is recognized as 360 degrees so here can you see the degree sign 360 degrees starting angle at always zero because this is not rotating so here starting angle is zero degrees now we'll rotate half of a circle so this is the fixed line and starting from the fixed point or 1/4 of a circle we know the full circle is 360 so 360 and 1/4 of that what's the angle you'll get 90 degrees so this is 90 degrees normally we represent this angle as ur a square like this so that means this is 90 degrees then rotation of half of a circle so here to here is half of 360 so you get 180 degrees what about this one 3/4 so when you divide the circle into 4 parts this is starting from here 3/4 of a circle full circle is 360 3/4 of that 3/4 of 360 what's the value for x this 990 times 3 270 so this is 270 decrease so what are the types of angles that we need 
,,to learn so first one is acute angles what is that cute angle so the angle in between 0 and 90 degrees so less than 90 degrees and above 0 degrees is called acute angle right angle so right angle is 90 degrees so we represent using a square like this then obtuse means the angle is more than 90 degrees so here if this is 90 degrees this is more than 90 degrees and less than 180 degrees so we call it as obtuse angles what is straight angle means if the angle is 180 and this is a straight line so GFP is a straight line if it's a straight line we call this angle is a straight angle 180 degrees and you need to know another type of angle that's reflex angle 
,,reflex angle is angle above 180 so this is 180 line above 180 and below 360 so this is the 360 degree line so you can get either this type of angle oh yeah more than 270 also possible so this is up to here that's 270 so this angle is more than 270 as well so these two are called reflex angles or cheese and angles what are just and angles so angles e OB and b or c or c OB b or c adjacent angles in the above diagram so what are the properties in adjacent angles common arm is there so two these two angles this is the common arm one fixed line is there so that's Oh big you need to get a common vertex point so this is the vertex file so what's the vertex here Oh Oh vertex point and angle situated in opposite sides of the common so common arm is here so this sandal is anti-clockwise and this angle is clockwise so angle 
,,situated bow in both sides so these are the three properties satisfied for adjacent angles now identify in this diagram what are adjacent angles look at this o P lie when you take Opie line that's the common arm from here there's an anger anti-clockwise what's the angle P o our reflex angle P you are this is the reflex angle Modell's 180 and less than 360 and what's the other angle this is clockwise measured this angle P or Q so P or Q and P or our reflex angle ah adjacent angles with common arm o P so what's the fixed point here or is the vertex point look at this one identify what's the common arm and what are the two adjacent angles so when you look at this diagram we can see this is the common arm o our common arm and what are the two angles from this this is one q or r QR or you can write R Rho Q and what's the other one this one so we can write P or our reflex angle so these are the two adjacent angles in this diagram what's the common now we can see common arm is o Q and what are the two angles this one here measured anti-clockwise p or q p oq' angle and what's the other angle Q or are these are adjacent angles with common arm or 
,,Q and what's the vertex point vertex point is o what are complementary angles two pairs of adjacent angles add up to 90 degrees we call those are complementary angle now take a look at these two this angle is 60 degrees and this is 30 degrees so what is 60 degree angle plus 30 degree angle you get 90 degree so the sum is 90 degree so we can say a Obi angle and P or a angle ah complementary angles because the sum of the two angles is equal to 90 degrees write down the complementary angle to 
,,the given angles thirty's there how you find out the other girl 90-30 that's 60 degrees 50 if one angle is 50 what's the other complementary angle you subtract 50 from 90 you get 40 degrees 85 90 minus 85 that's 5 degrees 24 90 minus 24 you get 66 degrees 36 90 minus 36 but you get you get 54 90 minus 36 and what about 3 degrees 90 minus 3 degrees you get 87 so these are complementary angles look at this one ninety degrees and zero are not complementary angles zero angle does not exist so don't take 90 and zero those are not complementary angles complementary adjacent angles so complementary means add up to 90 what are adjacent angles adjacent angles you need to have a fixed point vertex point comma Nam and the two angles to ated on both sides of the common Nam now look at this diagram you can see when you add a abd angle and DBC angle what's the sum this angle and this angle you can see is 90 degrees so that means these two angles are complementary now why this is complementary adjacent angles so when you take this diagram this is the common arm and this is the vertex point and this angle measured this way anti-clockwise this angle measured clockwise so the two angles on both sides of the common are so these are complementary adjacent angles supplementary adjacent angles supplementary means the sum of two angles add up to 180 now look at these two C B a or ABC and abd so what are the two angles 110 l70 so when you add it you're getting hundred eighty so we call two angles equal to 180 are supplementary angles and these are also adjacent when you take this common arm a B so when you take this slide on top of this line you're getting an angle like this so this is the BD lie so you can see Oh a is the common ah and this angle measured anti-clockwise this angle measured clockwise and this is the fixed point B so two angles equal to 180 are the supplementary angles and you can say a b c and a BD we are supplementary adjacent angles because when you take it together you get adjacent angles as well write down the supplementary angle to the given angles so what's the condition the sum is equal to 180 if 40 is the angle 180 minus 40 is the other supplementary angles that's 140 8500 80-85 mercy angle 5 and 1 remaining so that's 995 60 degrees 180 minus 60 that's 120 degrees 75 watts the supplementary angle 180 minus 75 you get Conrad 5 117 so subtract 117 from 180 63 degrees 29 you get all these are angles this is 29 so subtract you get one here and here subtract from 181 there and this is three so five 151 so these are the supplementary angles so what are supplementary angles the angle sum is 180 supplementary adjacent angles means we did that before so the sum is 180 as well as the two angles are adjacent now look at this guy Group abd is haunted DBC is 70 so when you add it you get 180 decrease so these are supplementary adjacent angles because when you take this is the common arm BD and the common vertex vertex is B and 
,,the two angles measured both sides those are the three properties for an adjacent angle now we look at what our vertically opposite angles now look at this one a B is a lie and C D is another line straight lines so intersect these two lines at O this is the intersection point so you get four angles there one two three four four 
,,angles and here's shaded once what are shaded ones e OC and the other one B OD a pair of vertically opposite angles so here this is one angle and this is the other vertically opposite angles now when you look at other way around this is also vertically opposite angle so what are the other unshaded Part A or D aug angle and be your C angle these are another pair of vertically opposite angles so how we get vertically opposite angles when you get any two straight lines intersecting each other 
,,now two lines are there pql SR so identify a pair of vertically opposite angles in the above diagram we can say this and this our vertically opposite angle so here P o R and s o Q angles are vertically opposite angles what are the other two this angle with this angle so you can write P o s angel' and Q o our angle is also vertically opposite angles so you get two pairs of vertically opposite angles now one angle is given eighty degrees a OD anger so what's a or C angle we know C D is a straight line so what's the angle so if this is straight line this is a straight angle 180 so 180 minus 80 a OC angle is 100 a or D angle is 80 and also this is a straight line a B is a straight line so what's this angle this angle that's B or D angle B your J angle is also 180 so I can write a OD angle plus D B or D angle it's 180 
,,so this is also 100 degrees so this is hundred that's B oh t angle so I can write B or D angle is hundred degrees now look at carefully this and this what can you say a oh D that's a or c a.o c and b or g angles we know that these are vertically opposite angles and also they are equal so remember the two vertically opposite angles now I can write a Oh C and B or D vertically opposite angles are equal similarly what can you say about the other one this is 80 this is also 80 so we found out this is also 80 so what's that B oh see anger so similarly I can write a OD and be your C angles are equal that's 80 degrees so we can say vertically opposite angles 
,,are equal this diagram identify vertically opposite angles that I equal POS POS is here what's the other vertically opposite angle this one Q or R if you take P or P o R naught P Q R this is P or R P o R is equal to this angle so that's Q or s so these two are vertically opposite angles find the values of a B and C what can you 
,,say about a angle can you see this is a straight line so a is 180 minus 100 because this is a straight angle so what's the answer eighty degrees then what you know about C angle E and C both are equal because those are vertically opposite angles so is 80 that means C is also 80 vertically opposite angles then what about B B and 
,,100 these are two vertically opposite angles so we can say B is also 100 degrees because of vertically opposite angles this diagram find the values of P Q R this is 
,,70 so this is a straight angle so what's be 180 minus 70 that's hundred check so we can write that's because of straight angle then you can write P is equal to R so 
,,this is hundred ten because of vertically opposite angles seventy and Q is also vertically opposite angles so Q is equal to 70 these two are because of vertically opposite angles now we look at angers around a point so the fixed point here is o so when you take from here around this point we know that the sum of angles add up to 360 degrees so here we can write all these angles so what are the angles X Y Z and this sandal is a all these angles add up to 360 degrees so when you get a point make sure that the sum of angles add up to 360 degrees find a and B so this is the fixed point so this is also around a point so how can we find out a now when you take this line this is a straight line this is 90 given here to here straight angle here to here straight angle because this is a straight line so what's a is 180 minus 90 degrees because this is given as 90 degrees so that's 90 but we know the angles around a point is 360 so what's big B is 360 minus all three angles so here what are the three angles 90 a is 90 and 100 so when you add it you get 280 degrees 280 degrees is the other three angles so what is B 360 minus 280 so what's the value 
,,8 so B is 80 degrees look at this one this is a point so we can consider angles around a point to find out the value of a 60 plus 80 plus 80 what's the sum 220 and all the angles add up to 360 so what's a it is 360 minus 220 what's the answer answer is hundred forty degrees find the value of x here what can you say about this one this is a straight line so what's this angle straight angle so X plus X plus X is 180 because of straight angle then X plus X plus X is 3x is 180 divided by three 
,,you get the value of x so x equals 60 degrees you have given several angles and identify types of angles so acute means the angle less than 90 degrees 30 degrees is 
,,then an acute angle what are the other angles less than 90 55 68 84 forty-eight loser accurate right angle means 90-degree angle obtuse obtuse means more than 90 less than hundred eighty degrees hundred twenty hundred forty 170 hundred twelve what is less than hundred eighty visa more than 180 straight angle means equals two hundred and eighty so I can take 180 degree n then what are reflex angles reflex angles are more than 180 and less than 360 so 270 195 200 and 318 those are the reflex 
,,angles you have given several angles and you are asked to write down pair of complementary angles complementary means the sum add up to 90 degrees what are the angles add up to 90 degrees look at 70 and 20 at up to 90 degrees so you can write a b c and k l so these are complementary angles add up to 90 degrees and write down the pair of supplementary angles what are supplementary means add up to 180 this sand that's 150 plus 30 you get 180 so x y z and c d e are supplementary angles because these are add up 280 identify the type of angles so what is this angle less than 90 degrees acute angle this one more than 90 degrees obtuse this one also less than 90 degrees acute and we look at some more angles this is more than 90 degrees less than 180 no twos angle this one yeah 90 degrees so what you call for 90 degrees right angle this one 180 straight angle this one more than 180 what you call that reflex this is also more than 180 so that's also reflex this is 90 degrees so what is 90 means right angle this is two straight lines intersect at one point so what are these two vertically opposite angles find X in this diagram we know this is a straight line and this is add up to 180 so 2x plus X plus 60 is hundred eighty now take 60 to the other side that means subtract first we'll add these two to X and X becomes 3x and subtract 60 from both sides you get 3x equals 180 minus 60 degrees left 180 minus 60 means 123 X 620 means divide this by 3 you get x equals 40 degrees I'm glad 20 divided by 3 so X is 40 degrees find X in this diagram this is mentioned this is 90 degrees so 2x plus x equals 90 degrees what are those complementary 
,,2 X plus X is 3x equals 90 degrees divide this by 3 you get x equals 30 90 divided by 3 find ABC can you see this one and this one vertically opposite angle so a equals 85 you can write down what the reason vertically opposite angles then B equals what when you take this straight line B equals 180 minus 85 so B equals 180 minus 
,,85 because of straight angle so subtract you get 5 and 9 so 95 is the B value now what is C B and C are vertically opposite angles so we can say see also 95 because 
,,of vertically opposite angles a bee is a straight line find ABC so I'll put a bee here a bee is a straight line fine ABC now when you take this three angles a plus 3a plus two ways hundred eighty that's a straight angle so add it together 3 + 2 5 + 1 this becomes 6 8 equals 180 when you divide by 6 you can get there a value so you get a equals 30 degrees now we'll look at this one this side lower side here what can you say about 4 a and B that's also straight angles so before that we'll find out for a is 34 times 30 is 4 that's 120 degrees now what can you say about these two angles these are straight angles so for a and B straight angles so 180 minus 
,,4 is equal to B so you can't just subtract 180 minus 120 that's 60 degrees because these two are straight angles look at this one find y when x equals hundred check 
,,so this is given hundred and ten what's the Y value we know this is straight line so Y is hundred eighty minus hundred check so that's 70 degrees find y when x equals 150 if this is 150 what's the relationship 180 minus 150 is why so that becomes thirty and then here find X when y equals forty same thing happens X is equal to again 180 minus the Y value now why is for T you get hundred forty degrees find X when y equals fifty these two are straight angles so you can subtract from 180 so you get 130 there this one this is a fixed point what's 50 and 30 and you shown is 80 this is 80 80 plus two x two x three X is equal to write it here these three angles add up to two x two x three exist have an X and this is equal to what is this 180 degrees so all together is 7x and this is 50 and 30 80 all together what's equal 
,,to this is equal to hundred eighty or 360 this is a point 360 degrees so angle at a point angle around a point so what is 7x 360 minus 80 degrees so you can subtract you get 280 so 7x equals 280 so what's what's the value divided by 7 to get the x value so X is equal to 40 degrees so make sure this is a point so angle sum of a point is 360 look at this one it's given a OD AOC b OC the sum is 260 find the values of all four angles so what's this Stanga BOJ angle so b OD angle is 360 it's minus 260 because this is a point and sum of angles around a point is 360 so 360 minus 260 you get hundred decrease that's for B or D then what can you say B or D angle and this angle AOC angle both are equal vertically opposite angles so you can write a OC is equal to 100 degrees so this is hundred this is hundred then how can you find out be your C anger we know a B is a straight line this is 100 so this becomes 180 minus 100 that's 80 degrees now Bo say is 80 means a OD is also 80 degrees that's vertically opposite angles look at this one a B and C D are straight lines intersect at oh this is a fixed point find the value of x what can you say about this angle and this angle these two are equal vertically opposite angles so X and X 2x is equal to 80 degrees so how we find out X divide by 2 so X is equal to 40 degrees find a from this diagram we can first add 60 and 40 is 100 hundred degrees so for a is what this is a straight angle so for a equals 180 minus 100 that's 80 degrees so how you find out a divided by 4 so a equals 20 degrees look at this diagram and find out what's the value of a this is a point so we can add all these angles add up to 360 so 5 + 2 7 7 + 3 10 10 plus 2 12 a is 360 so what's a divided by a equals 30 decrease find X here this is a straight angle X plus 30 plus X plus 20 and 
,,60 and up to 180 now I'd like terms x + X becomes 2 X 30 plus 20 50 50 plus 60 hundred ten now how we find out X so 2x equals subtract 180 from subtract 110 from 180 you get 70 degrees is 2x divide by 2 what you get X is equal to 35 70 divided by 2 is 35 find ABC PQR all these angles this is a straight angle so a is 180 minus 70 so hundred check what's B P is 70 because this and this both are vertically opposite angles B is 70 vertically opposite angles see a and C vertically opposite angles so C is equal to 110 that's vertical same reason this side this is also another point two straight lines are there so straight away you can write P equals 180 minus 150 that's 30 degrees because of straight angle then q q 150 both are vertically opposite angles so Q is 150 vertically opposite angles and what's our R and P both are equal those are vertically opposite angles so our a same as P that's 30 degrees the reason is the same vertically opposite angles a B and C D are straight lines find ABC this is 90 degrees so what's 90 plus 60 on Brad 50 so what's a because this is a straight angle a is 180 minus 150 that's 30 degrees so what's the reason straight angle what's the B value we is 60 degrees what's the reason vertically opposite angles then let's see what can you say about si si is these two lines so this and this a with 90 vota vertically opposite angles so a plus 90 so 90 plus 30 you get 120 vertically opposite angles now we will look at the review exercise so we covered about obtuse acute reflex angles and complementary and what is supplementary angles and vertically opposite angles so now we will see how we can apply those properties in the exercises look at the first question copy the two groups a and B given below and join them appropriately 135 which type of angle it says obtuse angle 90 is right angle 180 is a straight angle 35 is acute angle 245 is reflex angle more than 180 and 990 also reflex angle and 280 also reflex angles by considering the given figure find the magnitude of each of the angles given below and cried the type of each angle a OB a OB is 90 degrees what's the anchor right angle C or D C 
,,OD given that that's 40 degrees that's a acute angle B OD which one is B OD b o T that's also 90 degrees that's a right angle and B or C this angle so how can we find out vo C 90 minus 40 90 minus 40 is 50 degrees so that's an acute angle AOC 90 Plus this so this is 50 we found so a oh C is equal to 90 plus 50 so what is ninety 
,,plus fifteen hundred forty degrees a OD so a OD is a straight line so 180 that's straight angle look at this one draw the following angles using a protractor and name them so first one is PQ R so what we do we take the ruler and draw a straight line okay and then what we do we take a point P we take the point Q because you have 
,,to draw the angle PQR now take the protractor what we do we keep it on top of the point Q and measure the angle so what's the angle sixty degrees from here anti-clockwise we can mark the point so this is the point here 60 degrees so you can move this and draw the line passes through this point and this point so I can draw the line like this so that's P QR 60 degree angle so this is 60 degrees now look at this one ABC is 90 degrees so how we draw the 90 degree angle draw a line and then you 
,,can mark the angle here B angle so we'll take any point B now we can measure 90 degrees so take the ruler not the ruler protractor and keep the protractor on top of 
,,point B and Misha here you have to keep it properly this one on top of this line so something like this yes still not okay so here make sure that you keep them okay 
,,so here now it's correct so keep on top of the line now mark the point 90 degrees from here so this is the mark and you can draw the line now take the ruler connect 
,,this point and this point that's 90 degree and so this is 90 degree angle so you need to label this this is a B C so ABC is 90 degrees 130 degrees so what you do take a line and draw the line there and you need to mark a point so we'll take this point is there this so why now we need to measure 130 degrees so take the protractor keep on top of the line and here on this point zero point on Y now from here you have to measure that's hundred thirty so here to here this is 130 mark take the projector away and now you can take the ruler and connect this point with this one then what's the angle XYZ so we can mark this is X Y Z and this is 130 degrees this way is 130 degrees 48 degrees so how we draw 48 so take the ruler and then Mark a point will mark L so this is the point we have to mark that's angle then 48 degrees 
,,take the protractor keep on top of this and mark 48 degrees so 48 is here 40 and in between 50 and here so this is 48 now you can connect these two points with a ruler so mark it and then connect label the two points K and K L M angle is 48 degrees question number four as shown in the figure draw two straight line segments a B and C D such that they intersect each other at Oh make sure the magnitude of each of the angles AOC that's this angle C or B this one and B or G this one and a or D so all four angles we need to mission and write them down what is the value of AOC and c OB with first measured using the protractor take the protractor keep on top of this line and you can measure this part so here in your protractor you can measure from this way as well my one you only from this side so I have to subtract this 
,,value from 180 so 180 minus 140 so here to here is 40 degrees so I can write a or C angle is 40 degrees then boc angle or c OB angle i can measure from here that's 144 you you can measure from both sides zero is here as well as zero is here so look at carefully and measure the correct way so c OB is an obtuse angle that's hundred forty now a OC with measured co b b OD so how do you do B or D B or D is this way so we need to keep the protractor this way so this way and we can measure here to here that's 40 degrees b OD is 40 degrees here to here you can measure so 180 minus 40 or i can get straight away hundred forty-four a OD angle a OG is hundred forty degrees now what is the value of AOC plus Co be these two AOC is 40 degrees C or B is 140 so when you add these two what you get hundred eighty degrees so those two are 180 degrees are the two angles AOC and b OD equal to each other AOC forty B or D is also forty so these two are equal these two I call what are they vertically opposite angles so we can write they are equal example number one calculate the compliment of 38 what is complement means the sum is 90 degrees so complement angle 
,,is 90 minus 38 subtract you get 2 here and fast so 52 degrees is the complement angle if ABC is 48 PQR is 66 KLM is 42 and XYZ is 24 name the pairs of complementary 
,,angles among these angles so complimentary means 90 degrees find out what are the angles add up to 90 look at these two 48 plus 40 to 90 degree so you can say ABC and KL m complementary what is 66 and 24 at dancing 66 and 2490 so those are complementary so you can write P Q R and what's the other one 24 XYZ these also complementary angles example three explain whether the powers of angles given in the figure are supplementary angles so what's the condition for supplementary the angles add up to 180 so we'll check 62 plus 180 underneath so that means a OC + PQ are supplementary look at these 253 and 170 what's the sum 117 so not add up to 180 so you can write not supplementary angles exercise 3.1 copy and complete the complement of 60s but its complement of 60 90 minus 60 degrees supplementary of 60 180 minus 1620 
,,the complement of 75 90 minus 75 so what's the anger 15 degrees supplement of 75 180 minus 75 now so hundred five degrees the complement of 25 is 90 minus 25 it's a 
,,65 degrees supplement of 25 180 minus 25 hundred fifty-five degrees what's the complement of one degree 90 minus 189 degrees what is supplementary of one degrees that's hundred seventy-nine 180 minus one from among the angles ABC PQR KLM BOC mnl TEF select and write down two pairs of complementary angles and two pairs of supplementary angles so with first two complementary angles what are complementary add up to 90 degrees so we can take these two 72 and 80 90 degrees so BOC and ABC what is check 75 with 1575 and 1596 you are so those are complementary now we'll look at supplementary angles so hundred sixty-five and fifty what's the sum 165 and 1580 so supplementary means the angles add up to 180 so you can write k l m and p q r those are supplementary so what is 108 and 7280 so you get em in L angle + 108 and ABC ABC angle so these are supplementary angles question number three according to the figure given here what is the sum of B or C and C EOG first we'll find B or C vo 
,,C is 25 C OG C or D is given 65 so what's the sum add it together you get 10 and 9 so 90 degrees what is the complement of B or C so B or C and C or D are complementary angle so if it's B or C what's the other angle C or C what is the magnitude of a or G what is that a gee is this whole thing 20 plus 25 plus 65 what's the sum hundred tip what is the sum of a ood that's hundred ten and goe 70 so that's hundred eighty degrees what is the supplement of do e do en e yo D add up to 180 means those are supplementary angles so what's the supplement of D or e that's a or T what is the complement of do a D or E so do II what's a compliment 70 is there so 90 minus 70 that's 20 degrees now what is the anger so you need to find out a 20 degree angle that's complement of D or e so what's that 20 degree angle is a or b so you can write this is same as a oh yeah so that's the complement of do a 4 question right two pairs of complementary angles in the given figure complimentary means add up to 90 degrees so we can take this angle so two angles are there CD B angle plus or we can say plus B D anger it's 90 degrees the sum of two angles add up to 90 degrees so those are complementary angles what's the other one we can take here these two a b d angle and DB c angle that's add up to 90 degrees that's also complementary ax the straight line segments a b and c d intersect at oh right four pairs of supplementary angles in the figure supplementary means add up two hundred and eighty 
,,so look at that 80 plus hundred is 180 so i can write c oh a angle and a or d that's 180 because 80 and 100 that's supplementary then when you take other way rock a 
,,OD + d OB also 180 this way also supplementary now when you take C D line D OB angle + b OC angle that's also hundred eighty degrees and the last pair is when you take a beeline be your C angle and see o angle that's also hundred eighty degrees right two pairs of complementary angles according to the information marked in the given figure complementary means add up to 90 degrees so what are those yeah these 2 P X cube angle and q XR that's 90 degrees and also can you see that's why this is 
,,also 90 so we can write Q X R and R X that's also 90 degrees copy these statements in your exercise book and please tick in front of the correct statements and wrong mark in the front of the incorrect statements the complement of an acute angle is an acute angle 90 - a small angle so definitely it's an acute angle so this is correct the complement of an acute angle is an obtuse angle so cannot be more than 90 degrees because complement means 90 degrees so this is wrong the supplement an obtuse angle is an obtuse angle supplement means 180 so obtuse angle is in between 90 and 180 and it cannot be exceed 180 so that's wrong the supplement of an acute angle is an obtuse angle yes because if this is less than 90 180 minus that angle definitely you get an obtuse angle so the supplement of an acute angle is an obtuse angle that's correct example 1 explain whether the pairs of angles denoted by a B in the figures given below are pairs of adjacent angles so what are the conditions for adjacent angles there should be a common arm now look at this one okay Q are common and is there a fixed-point vertex point this is Q and this is r so no common vertex so these two are not adjacent angles so you need to check all three properties to satisfy four adjacent angles explain whether the pairs of angles denoted by a 
,,and B in the figures given below are pairs of adjacent angles yeah common vertex is there that's P is there a common arm here B P P see here a PN PD so no come on um so therefore a and B not adjacent angles example one explain whether the pairs of angles denoted by a B in the figures given below are pairs of adjacent angles so check B is this one and a is here here to here common vertex is o is there a common arm so these two are the lines and here this is the other line okay common arm you can take as Oh a now check whether these two angles on both sides of the way this is also measured this way this is also measured same way so these are not adjacent angles so you can write down measured angles on the same side of a common arm so therefore a and B are not budgets and angles example two in the given figure PR is 
,,a straight line segment find the magnitude of PQ s PQ s PQ R is a straight line so what is PQ s hundred eighty minus 45 because this is a straight angle and subtract 5 so this is 5 335 degrees example 3 find the magnitude of a or P so how we can find this is a straight line a B is a straight line so we can say this is a straight angle so what's the condition for a straight angle that's 180 so 2 X plus 3 X plus 50 degrees is equal to 180 because this is a straight angle 2x and 3x becomes 5x 
,,and take 50 to the other side subtract 50 from both sides you get 5x equals 180 minus 50 that's 130 so divide by 5 you get so X is equal to 5 times 2 10 for 30 that's 6 so 26 degrees exercise 3.2 write whether the pairs of angles marked as a and B in each figure is a pair of adjacent angles so what can you say about this Oh L is common Oh is the vertex point and this angle measured this way this is measured this way so angles on both sides so what can you say a and B are adjacent angles this one what's the common our vertex is okay so P is the vertex here we'll take this is the common ah Oh a not away P a is the common um let this angle measure this way this angle measured this way so on both sides so you can write a UH a and B measured both ways so that means a and B are adjacent triangles this diagram this is a 
,,and this is B here common arm is MX it means the fixed point that's vertex point but to this common arm this is measured same on the same side and be measured on the same side so not adjacent not adjacent angles if PQ is a straight line segments in each figure given below find the magnitude of the angle marked by an initiator so this is a straight line so what's x straight away you can write that's 180 minus 120 60 degrees what's the reason because of straight angle this one PQ is a straight line so what is a a is hundred eighty minus 68 because of straight angle 112 this one PQ is a straight line so what's T 180 minus 95 because of straight angle so 85 decrease when you look at this one how can we find out the X letter P Q is a straight line so you can write 40 plus 90 plus X is 180 40 plus 90 130 so what's X X is 180 minus hundred 30 that's equal to 50 degrees this one PQ is a straight line so we can write E Plus E Plus E is 180 so 3 a equals 180 equals 180 divided by 3 that's 60 degrees question number 3 in the figure if a B is a straight line segment find the magnitude of a og a og is 2x so a B is a straight line so what can you say 
,,about these three angles add up 280 because these three are on a straight line straight to X and X 3 X subtract 90 from both sides you get 3x is 180 minus 90 that's 
,,90 degrees so how can we find out X divided by 3 you get 2x equals 30 degrees so what's a or D D is 2x so 2 times 30 60 degrees PQ is a straight line segment according to the information marked in the figure find the magnitude of P or s POS is 3x so we'll first find X we can see 3x plus 2x plus 80 is 180 degrees because of straight 3x and 2x becomes 5x subtract 80 from both sides you get 100 divided by 5 you get x value is 20 now you have X value what's the P or s Sanga P OS is 3x 3 times 20 that's 60 degrees and part two it says find the magnitude of s o Q so Q is 80 plus 2 times X 2 times 20 so according to Bodmin you have to do multiplication first 
,,2 times 20 is 40 40 plus 80 120 degrees question number five conclude whether p oq' in each of the given figures is a straight line so we'll add NC 130 plus 50 you get 180 that means straight angle so Pete Oh Q or P or Q is a straight line this one we led 139 and 42 181 so that's not equal to 180 so you can write P or Q is not a straight line looks like it's straight but when you calculate the values it's not a straight line well I don't see this one 5588 37 180 so that means P or Q is a straight line this 145 plus 113 plus 22 that's also 180 so we can say P Oh Q is a straight example number one find the magnitude of the angle marked as a OD that's X in the given v so this is a point so we have to think about angles around the point so what's the sum of angles around the point that's 360 so what's 120 last 130 plus 90 you get here nine plus three twelve fourteen one remaining so three three hundred forty so we can write find X as 360 minus 340 because and girl around a point 
,,is 360 degrees so x equals 20 degrees example two APB is 150 DP see hundred so find B PC B P C is three X so we need to solve for X first so we know this is a fixed 
,,point and 150 and 101st you get 250 then we can write 2x plus 3x plus 250 is equal to 360 because angle around a point now solve 2x and 3x becomes 5x subtract 250 from both sides what you get you get 110 divided by 5 both sides you get x equals 5 times 2 10 5 times 2 10 so x equals 22 degree now we need to find out B PC anger so what's B PC angle is 3 X 3 times 22 you get 66 decrease exercise 3.3 find the value of x so this is a point so you can find the sum of all angles that's add up to 360 so first we will take 130 plus 160 you get 290 then X plus 290 is 360 around a point no subtract 290 from both sides you get what's the value 70 degrees for X find the value of a this is the point so we can say a plus 50 is 360 and go around a point so what's a subtract 50 from both sides you get 310 that's a reflex angle find the value of a so this is the point you can add all together a plus E Plus E Plus E is 360 for a equals 360 divide both sides by 4 you get a equals 90 degrees find the magnitude of APC APC is the whole angle so what's the value APC here this is also a PC this is also a PC so how you identify which one if it's a PC reflex angle this is this one more than 180 this is just the AP C angle so a PC angle is 360 minus these two value sum of these two values so 90 and 120 that's 210 so you subtract 210 from there so you get hundred 50 decrease so if it's a PC just the angle that can be obtuse angle a PC reflex means more than 180 degrees find the magnitude of SOR SOR is 3x so we'll first find X 110 plus 80 you get 190 then 2x and 3x plus 190 is 360 because this is angle around a point so 5x plus 190 is 360 subtract 190 
,,from 360 what you get 16 so you get 7 and 1 so 5 sequels 170 divided by five thirty four degrees for X this is folks then how can we find out it's so our angle that's three x three x 34 three times 4 12 three times 3 9 plus one tip so hundred two degrees a B is a straight line if APR is 150 so this is given 150 find the magnitude of Q P B QP b is this angle so how we find out we can first find out these two angles and then subtract from this one you get the other angle now it's given a B is a straight line so what is this angle this angle this is 180 so I can write 150 plus x equals 180 because of straight angle and x equals subtract 150 you get 30 degrees for X now we found out X is this angle that's 30 now we need to find out this so what is B PQ or q PB angle is 180 minus 2x because this is also a straight angle now substitute 180 minus 2 times the t-bog mas according to bot mas multiplication first 180 minus 60 you get hundred twenty is the this angle QP be example number one find the magnitude of each angle around the point P in the given figure we are XY + KL a straight line segments so what can you say about this Sanga LP why angle is also 135 vertically opposite angles then what's this angle so this is a straight angle because L K is a straight line so you can write find x PL angle is 180 minus 135 that's straight angle 45 degrees that's x PL so x PL and KP y angles are vertically opposite angles so these two are equal so you can write that's 45 find the magnitude of each of the angles marked by an English letter in the figures given below ABCDEF a straight lines what are these two X is 43 vertically opposite angles we know that vertically opposite angles are equal this one what can you say about this one if you take this line and this line 130 is equal to this one so X plus 30 is 130 how can we find X subtract 30 from both sides that's equal to 100 degrees so here what's the reason vertically opposite angles okay these two are straight line what can you say about this and this a plus a is 135 vertically opposite angles are equal so 2a equals 135 divided by 2a inker 2 times 6 12 and 2 times 7 14 and 
,,one remaining means 67 point five degrees for a look at this one a B and C D are straight lines so this is equal to this one so we can write 90 plus 6 equals 125 so 
,,you can write down the razor vertically opposite angles subtract 90 from 125 to get X so you get 35 degrees this one what can you say about a B and C D yeah this angle is equal to this sang so what can you say straight to me B is 55 degrees vertically opposite angles then if you take the other two lines this one and this one this whole angle is equal to this whole angle so what can you say about 55 plus a is equal to 65 plus B B is 55 now add it together 120 so a equals subtract 55 from that you get 65 degrees for a now we found a and B what C see you can find out using straight angles so a plus B plus C is a straight line under an 80 what's a 65 what's B 55 now subtract these two angles you get the C well so what's the sum of these two 65 and 55 hundred-twenty so subtract 120 you get 60 degrees for C value so all of these angers we've found using vertically opposite angles here and this one straight angle find the values of the angles denoted by x y and z in the given figure b by BD x c are straight lines and ABC and AC b are a pair of complementary angles what is the magnitude of ABC first we'll find out XYZ here this and this vertically opposite angles so we can straight away write x equals 90 then Y is 58 same reason Z how can we find C C is 180 minus 58 because of straight angle subtraction 122 so Z is 122 so we found X Y C now they're asking to find out ABC but it's given ABC and ACB it says supplementary not supplemented complementary complementary means 90 degrees ABC you'll find out which angle ABC and AC B AC B angle that's why ACB is y so y plus ABC angle that's given 90 degrees we know the Y value so we can find out them ABC value 90 minus the Y value what's y 58 degrees subtract you get 32 degrees so because this is complementary so we covered all theory related to angles so we did the sum of pair of acute angles is 90 then we call these are complementary angles if the sum is equal to 180 that's supplementary angles an acute angle which needs to be added to a given acute angle for the sum of the two angles to be 90 is called a complementary and a pair of angles which have a common arc and a common vertex and are located on either side of the common arm is called pair of adjacent angles and the sum of angles located around a point on one side of a straight line is 180 and angles around up point is 360 and what's the other one we learned vertically opposite angles created by the intersection of two straight lines are equal to each other so practice all these exercises and examples and thorough with the angles listen

Number Partens,x2HZ8apKcVE,hello grade 9 students today I'm going to start mathematics relevant to your textbook so what's the first unit in your textbook that's called number patterns so the 
,,knowledge you gain from this unit you need for grade 10 and 11 lessons as well so we'll try to understand this listen with numbers okay we'll take this number pattern 5 5 so this is a number pattern every number of this number badness sorry so here we can see that every number so same number here look at the next button 3 6 9 what can you see how you get 6 from 3 we need to add trick have you get 9 from 6 adding 3 12 same as that 9 plus 3 you get 12 so the first number of the number pattern is 3 all the numbers they're after are obtained by adding 3 to the previous number look at the third button 7 11 15 1923 so how you get 11 from 7 we need to add 4 to that 11 plus 4 you get 15 15 plus 4 19 so the first number of this number pattern is 7 and all the numbers they're after are obtained by adding 4 to the previous number let's take this number pattern 5 10 20 40 80 now not like adding here here we multiply 5 times 2 you get 2 10 times 2 you get 20 20 times 2 you get 40 so the first number of the number pattern is 5 and all the numbers they are after obtained by multiplying the previous number by 2 in this one 1 3 6 10 15 try to find out the pattern there 1 plus 2 you get 3 3 plus 3 you are getting 6 so how you get 10 so how you get 2 6 plus 4 10 plus 5 you are getting 15 so what are these numbers can 
,,you remember these are called triangular numbers so you can make triangles with 1 first number 3 second number second number third number you get 6 fault number is 10 so these are triangular numbers so this is also number packing now there are several number patterns given here identify the pattern 1 1 1 3 times 2 3 times 3 3 times so what's the next number 4 3 times so you get 4 4 4 continuing here another thing you need to understand what is this 3 dots means this number pattern continues so here 1 2 3 1 2 3 repeating so what's in example 1 2 3 again this one fractions what's the pattern numerator you get once what about the denominator 2 3 3 + 1 you get 4 4 plus 1 5 so the next number you get 1 over 7 1 over 8 1 over 9 this one look at the numerator numerator increases by 1 1 + 1 2 2 + 1 3 so what's the next number 6 yeah then the denominator starting from 2 to 3 4 adding 1 again so 6 + 1 7 also we can identify by looking at the numerator and the denominator denominator is 1 more than the numerator so if this is 6 the next number should be 7 so if the numerator is 7 what's the denominator here that's 8 now we'll take this number patent you have given 3 numbers 2 4 8 okay try to identify a pattern one student can say okay so the next number is 16 yeah the one is 32 how 2 times 2 4 4 times 2 8 8 times 2 16 and 16 times 2 32 so this pattern is obtained by multiplying the previous number by 2 but you can create another one let's take this button 2 4 8 14 now what's the pattern there 2 plus 2 you get 4 4 plus 4 you get 8 8 plus 6 14 14 plus 8 you get 22 so what's the number pattern they're adding 2 to the first number but adding 4 to the second number adding 6 to the third number so therefore you can create so many number patterns so when you get 3 numbers it's difficult to identify one particular pattern so you can create several patterns so when you are getting a number pattern it's important to get more than three numbers so from only three numbers it's difficult to identify the number pad let's take this 1 3 7 11 15 19 now identify the patterns now you are learning or not there are new term these are numbers in their number pattern so we call these are terms in this number pattern first term is three second term is seven and third term is 11 so we can use the symbol T because we are taking term so the first letter of this word T we are using hot term number so T 1 means the first term and here remember we are writing 1 as a subscript T 2 is the second number so what is T 5 T 5 is the fifth number so 1 2 3 4 5 that's 19 in mathematics we use sequence for number patterns in grade 10 11 you will learn another term that's called progression but remember number patterns it's same as sequence take this 1 12 15 18 21 24 27 write down the following terms using 
,,the given sequence T 1 means faster so you can write first term s 12 T 2 second term that's 15 T 3 is the third term that's 80 now identify fourth fifth and sixth terms what's the fourth one one two three four 21 one two three four five twenty four and sixth term 27 take this example write down the following terms using the given sequence so write down what stevewall first term is 7 second term 14 third term 28 fourth term 5650 M 112 and sixth term 224 now look at eleventh question so you have given other way round T 1 is 20 T 2 is 25 so with this terms you can write down the sequence T 1 so starting from first number 20 what's the second term 25 what's the third term 30 35 40 45 so how many terms are given six terms are given but if this is continuing we can put three dots there look at this one observe this a sequence you can get the next number by adding 3 7 plus 3 you get 10 10 plus 3 you get 13 13 plus 3 16 and 16 plus 3 9 so here you can clearly see how you get 10 from 
,,the first term add 3 how you get the third term from second one adding 3 so what do you call this number this is called the common difference so remember another new term you are learning what's that common difference take this example 9 15 21 27 and 33 now see the common difference now how you get 15 from 9 so how you do that you can subtract take the next term subtract the previous term so 15 minus 9 you get 6 then the next one 21 minus 15 again you get 6 27-21 again 6 here 33 minus 27 you are getting 6 so what's the common difference common difference is 6 so how do you get the common difference you can take any term and subtract the previous term but you can't take the first term why we don't have a previous term so that's why we say any term except first term minus the previous term so remember this formula to find out the common difference now take this one find the common difference of the following sequences so you can take any two numbers so we'll take the first two 
,,so what's the common difference 15 minus 7 what's that eight this one you can take these two 20-16 get plus 4 as the common difference this one if you take these two 27 minus 30 now now the bigger number is negative so what's the answer you get minus 3 is the common difference this one now you get negative numbers when you have 
,,negative numbers tape brackets to subtract now we'll take these two so how can we write now negative 35 minus negative 40 then negative 35 is their negative x negative what you get negative x negative is positive positive 40 so 40 minus 35 you get five so when there are negative numbers use brackets to subtract numbers again you get negative numbers so which one we can take these to do that - 27 - minus 30 so what's the answer - 27 minus minus plus and you get 30 30 - 27 you get 3 this one 
,,when you take these 2 minus 30 minus minus 9 so here you get minus 13 plus 9 so what's the answer - 4 because the bigger number is negative now you get fractions so 
,,when you get fractions try to find out the easiest two numbers to subtract which one is easy here if you take this or this it's easy now to subtract we'll take these 2 6 and 1/2 minus 5 so you can first subtract whole numbers 6 minus 5 you get 1 and you get this half one and a half or 1.5 so when you take this one it's difficult to subtract so try to get the easiest to to subtract the numbers so in this one which one is the easiest yeah when you take these two it's easy to subtract so I take these two three and two-thirds minus 3 so 3 minus 3 you get 0 so you get only 2/3 at the common difference this one which one is the easiest please 2 9 and 3/4 minus 9 you get 3/4 as the common difference give the first five terms of the sequences given below so you have given the first term and the common difference of starting from in Luverne here adding 4 to that 11 plus 4 15 15 plus 4 1919 plus 4 23 23 plus 4 27 and then you can put three dots here next one first term is 8 starting from 8 common difference is 8 that means adding 8 to that multiples of 8 8 plus 8 16 16 plus 8 24 24 plus 8 thirty-two thirty-two plus eight forty one two three four five put three dots to represent that it's continuing next one first term is 20 starting from 20 common differences 7 20 plus 7 27 27 plus 7 34 34 plus 7 41 41 plus 7 40 it this one common difference is now negative five that means subtracting five starting from forty forty minus five thirty five thirty five minus five thirty thirty minus five twenty five and twenty five minus five you get twenty this one starting from a negative number negative thirty and the common difference is plus so you can write separately and find out the numbers negative thirty plus three the difference is twenty seven and this is bigger negative number is bigger so you put negative 27 negative twenty-seven plus three the difference is twenty four and this is minus negative 24 plus three negative twenty one negative 21 plus three you get negative 18 and then you have already five terms so you can't continue this sequence now you get fractions starting from two and a half adding one and a half two and 
,,a half plus one and a half you can add harvest half and half 1 1 plus 1/2 2 plus 2 4 4 plus two and a half 4 plus 2 6 and then you get another half then six and a half plus two and a half you get 6 plus 2 8 and this half and half you get 1 so you get 9 plus 2 and a half 9 plus 2 11 eleven and a half one two three four five this 
,,one you get a negative number and the common difference is minus 4 that means subtracting four starting from minus 24 subtract 4 minus 24 minus 4 minus twenty eight 
,,minus twenty eight minus four minus 32 minus 32 minus four minus 36 minus 36 minus four you get minus 40 one two three four five next one you get litters you use the same procedure starting from X adding 3x plus three is the second term now add three again so you can add three to this number three and three you get 6 so X plus 6 again another 3 6 plus 3 9 1 2 3 4 we need another term 9 plus 3 now the common difference is X and starting with 7 so 7 plus X is the second one now adding X to this X like terms we can add 7 plus X plus 6 you get 7 plus 2x now add again another X 7 + 2 X + 8 X you get 7 plus 3 X 1 2 or 3 4 we need another that becomes 4 X now in this one both common difference than the first term ah letters starting with a what's the next one e adding to that in plastic kurta another day he + 2 D because D and another day becomes 2 D fourth to a + 3 d + v charm a + 4 D write down the term belongs to unknown letters of the sequences below so you have given several terms and in between you asked to find out the letters now if you can identify the common river difference from here 12 16 12 plus 4 is 16 that means adding 4 to the previous number so what's say 16 plus 4 you get 20 now here 20 plus 4 24 and 24 plus 4 you get 28 s look at this one how you identify the common difference these two 
,,consecutive numbers are given you can get the common difference 29 minus 26 that's plus 3 adding 3 so starting from 20 20 plus 3 23 so X is 23 so how we find by you 
,,can take this 129 plus 3 you get 32 as Y this one these two terms are known you can start from here 12 and 15 15 minus 12 is 3 so that means adding 3 is the sequence so what you do here to get B you have to subtract because we are following the other way not right with right side so right side this is adding so what about left side subtracting 3 so 12 minus 3 you get 9 4 be 9 minus 3 you get 6 4 hey this one you need P and Q so we can start from here what's the common difference 25-19 so what's 25-19 you get 6 you get 6 so that means you are adding 6 to 31 31 plus 6 you get 37 for P 37 plus 6 43 Oh cute in this example here these three metals are unknown yeah we can start from here so what's the common difference 25 - 30 so you get negative 5 that means subtracting 5 is the common difference so what you do to the 
,,other side so if when you need left side numbers you need to do the opposite thing so add 5 to that 330 plus 5 35 35 + 5 you get 40 40 plus 5 you get 40 this one you get fractions so which one is the easiest step now we have to take these two because these two numbers are given so you can find out that common difference so common differ five minus three and a half so what we can do so you can do five - three - two - half one and a half so adding one and a half to five five plus one and a half you get six Anna so if you can't do that once you write here five plus one and a half you get six and a half six and a half plus one and a half again six and a half plus one and a half you can do 6 plus 1 7 half and half you get 1 7 plus 1 8 then here eight plus one half nine and a half given nine and a half plus one and a half nine and a half plus one and a half a half you get one nine plus one 10 10 and a half this one you get decimals you do the same thing subtract these two to get the common difference 5 minus 5 minus 3.5 so you can subtract in a column and what's the answer you get one point five so that means one point five is the common difference so adding one point five two five you get six point five for a six point five plus one point five six and one seven five point five point five you get one so 7 plus one-eighth in this one how can we identify the common difference from these two so 40 minus 35 so you get five there so in order to get XY we need to subtract 
,,do the opposite thing 35 minus 5 you get 30 that's why 30 minus not negative 5 you get 25 for X but how you get Z you are adding 5 40 plus 5 45 now here fractions look at the numerator numerators are the same that's 1 so 4 M or n numerator is y 2 plus 1 you get 3 so what's same 3 plus 1 you get 4 here 4 plus 1 5 5 plus 1 6 here 
,,for the denominator this one you get fractions again but look at the pattern you have to do separately numerator 1 3 5 these are odd numbers adding 2 to the previous number 1 plus 2 we get 3 3 plus 2 5 so what's it what's a 3 5 plus 2 you get 7 7 plus 2 you get 9 as the numerator now identify the denominator 1 4 9 what are those square our numbers square numbers means we can make square starting from 1 what's the other square number so what's the other square Arnim you get nice so remember 
,,Square our numbers 1 4 9 what's the next square number 4 times 4 16 5 times 5 25 so here nine over twenty five and seven 60 this one you get two terms we look at the first term 2 4 6 what's the next number these are even numbers - these are even numbers 2 4 6 8 here then this number becomes 8 + + 2 10 now how we identify the next number we can do this way as well 3 5 7 and you get 9 odd numbers here 9 + 2 you know oh when you look at one term 2 & 3 if you know the first term the second term is always adding one to the previous number so you can use that pattern as well first you far you can find 8 8 plus 1 look at 9 then 10 here and then what's the next number 10 plus now we'll see how we can find out the generator look at this sequence 7 10 13 16 19 right on the 48th term of this sequence so if we are using the previous method so what we have to do we have to add the common difference and till you get 48 term you have to write down so do you think it's possible it's not possible so we are trying to find out the general term first and then you can find out any term so we will see how we can do that so first we can find out the common difference we'll take these two so 10 minus 7 you get common difference as 3 so what we do we are trying to find out multiples of the common difference and see how much we need to add to get the auditor so we'll take the first term first term is 7 so how you get 7 from 7 you don't need to add anything so what's the multiple of 3 there so 3 times 0 3 times 0 is 0 0 plus 7 you get the first term when you look at the second term that's 10 so you have the first term server so you need nother 3 to 
,,get 7 you need nother three to get 10 so what's the multiple of 3 you need 3 times 1 that's 3 then this correct number 13 you have already 7 you need nother 6 to get 13 3 times 2 16 how you get 7 plus 3 times 3 9 9 plus 7 16 19 starting from server you need to add 3 times 4 that's 12 plus 7 you get 19 so we are trying to find out multiples of this number so what's the pattern you are getting first term first multiple is 0 1 less than that 2 becomes 1 here 3 becomes 2 4 becomes 3 all these this one is 1 less than the term number so if I ask how will get the inter so it's easy to find out the nth term by looking at this pattern so we'll look at the pattern we got T 1 number of multiples of 3 is 0 T 2 we got 1 T 3 we got to t 4 we got 3 1 less than the term now then what then what about 10th term how many multiples we have to take less than 1 so that's nice if this is 20 you need to add 90 multiples of 3 3:56 so what's the number you need to add 55 times 3 to the first n1 less than that so that becomes n minus 1 therefore the number of multiples is 1 less than the term number so how can you write down this 3 times n minus now expand brackets 3 times n 3 n 3 times minus 1 minus 3 so what's the nth term 7 minus 3 you get 4 4 plus 3 in so this is called the generator for any number you can apply no we know the general term how can we find out the 48 term we can easily substitute N equals 48 and get that huh so now it's easy no need to write down the terms till you get 48 term so you can find the generator now we'll take this one you have given a sequence and ask you to find out the generator so what's the first thing you need to do take the common difference 12 minus 5 you get 7 so 7 is the common difference so what you do you write down the first term that's fine and see how many multiples of sevens you need to add to get the term first term is 5 we need to add 0 multiples of 7 here we need to add 1 here 2 3 and if this is n n minus 1 always 1 less than the term number then when you multiply you get 7 n minus 7 now you see you can simplify by minus 7 is minus 2 so 7 n minus 2 is the general term so when you know 
,,the general term you can find out any term by substituting 1 2 3 like that positive whole numbers so when you plug one which term you are getting you are getting faster 2 is second term 5 means filter 10 mins texture so when you have the general term you can find any term this question find the general term of the sequence find 
,,the common difference 15 minus 11 you get 4 so how can you find out the generator you can't write down the first term and add multiples of 4 this becomes 4 times 0 4 times 1/4 times 2 times 3 and the 10th term is 4 times 9 then what about in term 4 times n minus 1 now we expand brackets 11 plus 4 n minus 4 you get 11 minus 4 is 
,,7 7 plus 4 and needs their children now we'll see whether we are getting that number so you can double check this when you plug one here 7 plus 4 you get 11 that's the first term then when you plug 5 we'll see 1 2 3 4 5 t 5 that means 7 + 4 n is the general term we'll plug 4 times 5 n is 5 now 4 times 5 20 20 plus 7 is 27 1 2 3 
,,4 5 5th term is 27 that means your general term is correct so you have to double chickens whether your simplification is correct we take this one find the general term of the sequence first thing find the common difference 20-9 you get 11 as the common difference so how we find out the general term first term is 9 that means 9 plus 11 into 0 what's the next one 9 plus 11 into 1 9 plus 11 into 2 for the third term and fourth term is 11 into trick now temperature 9 plus 11 into 9 then what about emptor 9 plus 11 into n minus 1 always 1 less than the term number now expand brackets you get 9 plus 11 n minus 9 minus 11 so 9 minus 11 minus 2 so you get 11 n minus 2 other general term take 5th term and see 1 2 3 4 5 we have to check where the fifth term is 53 so we'll take T 5 and C 11 times 5 minus 2 55 minus 2 you get 53 so the fifth term is 53 that means your general term is correct this one find the general term of the sequence this one you can take any two consecutive numbers 
,,that get the common difference so you can take these two any other two consecutive numbers I'll take 28-30 28-30 you get minus 2 as the common difference then what's the next step first term is 30 you are adding how many multiples of - two for the first one - two times zero second one minus two times one third one minus 2 times 
,,2 here minus 2 times 3 always multiples are 1 less than the term number now tenth term can you write minus 2 times nice what about extra - 2 times n minus 1 I'll put a multiplication sign here n minus 1 then expand brackets 30 minus 2 times n minus 2 n minus 2 n minus 1 when you multiply you get plus 2 so 30 + 2 32 minus 2 n now we'll check whether this is correct 1 2 3 4 5 so you don't need to check all these the fifth term you can check any term I'll take tea for Fulcher 32 minus 2 times 
,,4 32 minus 8 you get 24 1 2 3 4 that's 24 that means the general term is correct next one now you try to do find the common difference and write down in terms of multiples and decide the common difference we can take these two 45 minus 48 that becomes minus 3 then first term is adding 0 multiples of minus 3 second term one multiple of minus 3 third one multiples of 2 here third one you have to take multiples of minus 3 as two fourth one and what about in N means minus 3 times n - what now open brackets minus 3 times in you get minus 3n no multiply minus 3 times minus 1 you get plus 3 so 48 plus 3 you get 51 minus 3n now we'll check whether this term is correct we can take 1 2 3 4 5 you take the fifth one and ct5 the general term is 51 minus 3 in in is 5 now simplify when you subtract 15 you get 36 so you are getting 36 so that means the Childre term is correct find the general term of the sequence 39 33 like that so same procedure take the difference 33 - 39 you get a negative number now write down the first term is 39 so you are adding multiples of negative sixes here we add 0 multiple 1 2 & 3 by observing that you can straight away write down in term that's in minus 1 then when you multiply these two what you get 39 minus 6 times n minus 6 M minus 6 and minus 1 you get plus 6 you get 45 minus 6 n 
,,as a general term in stir now we'll check with 5th term or any term 1 2 3 4 5 fifth term is 55 we see whether we are getting 55 we'll see whether we are getting 15 45 minus 6 times 5 45 minus 30 you are getting 15 so the fifth term is 50 the term is correct now you get decimals but you are following the same method find the common difference there what's the common difference take the difference here 6.5 - 5.3 so what you get 1.2 so if you can't subtract and just write separately and subtract 5 minus 3 is 2 6 minus 5 1 you get 1 point 2 as a common difference now the first term is 5.3 then you are adding multiples of one point choose one point two times zero here one point two times one why we are adding like this we know that multiples of these are always one less than the term number if this is in this is in minus one here sometimes you don't need to write down the multiplication sign brackets means that's multiplication we can expand brackets five point three plus one point two times in one point to win this one you get minus one point two so what's the number five point three minus one point two you get four point one now we'll check with a number we'll take three T 3 and C 4 point 1 plus 1 point 2 times 3 so 4 point 1 3 times 2 6 3 times 1 3 so when you add decimals you get 6 + 1 7 4 + 3 7 so you are getting seven point seven so the third term is seven point seven so your general term is correct now you get fractions here look at the common difference and 
,,see which one is the easiest to find you can take either this or this so we will take four and a half - three four - three one and here you get another half so one and a half is the common difference now first term first term is three and you are adding multiples of this so it's easy to take not as a mixed number as a be proper 
,,fraction so what is 1 and 1/2 2 times 1/2 plus 1/3 over 2 is the improper fraction so it's easy to simplify numbers so multiples of 3 over 2 this is 0 multiples of that that's 1 2 here and the fourth term that becomes 3 and for the nth term you get in - why now simplify you get 3 here multiply these 2 you get 3 n over 2 minus 3 
,,over 2 now you can write this one as 1 point 5 it's easy rather than writing in fractions we can write this as a decimal 3 over 2 is 1 point 5 so 3 plus or minus there that's - this is 3 over 2 minus 1 3 over 2 so 3 minus 1.5 you get one point 5 so 1 point 5 plus 3 in over 2 is the general term now we'll take the fourth term 1 2 3 4 we'll take the fifth it's easy so t5 1.5 plus 3 in over to a nice five debt so we'll substitute fiber three over two times five one point five here fifteen over to what is 15 over to seven point fun so you'll get nine one two three four five fifth term is nice now look at this question find a general term of the sequence - 
,,60 - 57-54 so what's the first step you have to take that common difference now take the common difference we'll take these two - 57 minus minus 60 so what minus minus becomes plus so minus 57 plus 60 so what you get you get three so I write here this is three then what's the first term minus 60 so first term is minus 60 so you 
,,write minus 60 and then write out multiples of three so multiples of three here this becomes 0 1 2 this is 3 and what happens for the nth term minus 60 plus 3 into n minus 1 so what you do you open brackets you get minus 63 times n becomes 3 n 3 times minus 3 minus 3 then minus 60 + - 3 you - 63 plus 3 now we'll check whether this term is correct we can take 50 so we'll find T 5 and C 5th term is minus 63 plus 3 times 5 so minus 63 plus 15 so what you get so here 8 + 4 - 48 1 2 3 4 5 so you are getting minus 48 that means the general term is correct we can find the general term using another method so now I'll teach you an easy way to get the general term without writing all these multiples take this one find the general term of the sequence so what we do here we first take the common difference so 16 minus 12 you get then what you do you write down the multiples of 4 below that 4 times 1 4 8 12 these are the multiples of 4 then what you do we can subtract these two term 12 minus 4 you get 8 16 - 8 8 20 minus 12 so when you subtract you can see you get the same number then you can use this number and the common difference to write down the generator so what's the general term here 4 times n that means 4 is the common difference and we are taking 4 times N and here we write down the number you are getting so what's the value for n plus 8 so what we do here in the square you can write down the common difference and here what you get here number either need to add or subtract to get the first term so in this case this is plus 8 so adding 8 here so it's easy rather than writing down all the multiples you can write this way and subtract we'll take another example take this one nine fifteen twenty one twenty seven thirty three now we need to find out the generator so what's the first step take the difference so we will take the difference here are 15 minus nine you get six now what we do write down the multiples of 6 so here below these are multiples of so 6 times 1 6 12 like that then what is the next step we subtract 9 minus 6 we get 3 15 minus 12 3 all these numbers you are getting 3 that means you need to add 
,,3 to get the term so here this is 3 here and what's the common difference here and you get 6n plus 3 as the chandra tough and if you want to check whether this is correct you can check with any term 1 2 3 4 5 we'll see t 5 6 times 5 plus 3 so 30 plus 3 you get 33 1 2 3 4 5 that means our general term is correct now take this example you have given 45:41 like that so what's the first thing you have to do you have to take the difference so we'll take these two 41 minus 45 because number is negative you get negative 4 is their common difference so what we do here we write down the multiples of negative 4 negative 4 times 1 negative 4 negative 4 times 2 negative 8 so these are the multiples then subtract when you subtract make sure you put brackets 45 minus minus 4 so what you get 45 plus 4 that's 49 41 plus 8 you get 49 so here you get 49 when you subtract the two terms so have you write down the general term now you know then common difference if is negative 4 and the number you need to add here is 49 so we can write down the general term as minus 4n plus 49 we'll check again whether this is correct we'll take the fifth term and ct5 that means minus 4 times 5 plus 49 you get minus 20 plus 49 49 minus 20 you get 29 is this correct 1 2 3 4 5 that means 29 so our general term is correct we'll take this one again similar procedure take the common difference and down all the multiples regarding to the common difference and they subtract we take these 227 minus 30 so you get negative 3 multiples of negative 3 so all the multiples of negative trees are there then what you do we subtract 30 minus negative 3 so what you get this becomes plus 33 now take the next one 27 minus minus 6 so you get 27 plus 6 that's 27 plus 6 is 33 that means you need to add 33 to the number so what's the term you are getting you get in with this commerce difference so minus 3n plus 33 so that's the general term now check it with any number that you like we take 3 T 3 and C minus 3 times 3 plus 33 so what you get 3 times 3 9 plus 33 what you get for here and 24 not - that's plus 24 so 1 2 3 so that's correct now this is easier than previous 
,,method again same procedure take the common difference right down the multiples of the common difference and then subtract and see what the number you have to add to get the term so common difference we can take these two - 40 - - 45 so this becomes minus 40 plus 45 that's now multiples of 5 5 10 15 like that and then subtract minus 45 minus 1 you get minus 50 minus 40 minus 10 you get minus 50 again so when you a subtract you get minus 50 is the number now we are subtracting 50 to get the 
,,term so here these two are - 50 s we are getting and how we write down the general term the common difference is 5 so 5 n minus 50 now we'll check with a number now 
,,we'll check whether it is correct so substitute 3 for that we'll check with the culture so T 3 so 5 times 3 minus 50 that's 15 minus 50 what's the answer 35 and this is minus 1 2 3 that's minus 35 that means the general term is correct now this is the second method to find out the generator there's a nother simpler way to find out that generator so we'll discuss that one next okay so what we do here first step is the same you calculate the common difference so take any two consecutive terms and find out the common difference 16 minus 12 you get then what you do you take the common difference multiplied by n what you get for inter and when you substitute 1 what you get 4 times 1/4 so you can check with this term how many we need to add or subtract your first term is 12 and this one is 4 what's the number you'd need to add to get 12 4 plus 8 is 12 so what's the number you have to add you have to add 8 to that so that's the number you need to add so what you do here first take the common difference and then you write down within 4 in here when you substitute 1/4 times 1/4 with that number you can see what's the number you need to add or subtract here what's the difference you need to get 12 and here you got four you need nother 8 so that number you are adding so what's the general charm straightaway you can write the general term is 4 in +8 so this is really easy try to learn this method you can easily find out the general chat so now we'll check with the number t3 Kutta 4 times 3 plus 8 12 plus 8 20 our getting trying to yeah the third term is 20 so that means our general term is correct now we'll use that method to find out the general term here what's the common difference 21 minus 16 what's the value 5 plus 5 they multiply by n you get 5 in then what you do you substitute 1 for n you get high and you compare is number with fire what's the number you need to add to get 16 with 5 so what you do you take the difference it's easy to take the difference and see what's the number you need to add 16 minus 5 you are getting another so you need to add 11 to that so what's the general term you are writing 5 in plus 11 now we'll check with curta 5 times 3 plus 11 15 plus 11 you get 26 yeah this is correct so you are getting third term as 26 now try to find out the general term using the easiest way find the common difference take the subtraction 11 minus 4 you get 7 then what's the number you need to subtract so what you do when you substitute 1 for 7 in you get 7 so how you get 4 from 7 so how you do that take this number and subtract so 4 minus 7 is minus 3 so how can you write down the generator so 7 in minus 3 here so we are subtracting 3 we can check with v rt5 and see it's better to check because if you make a mistake and when you get a wrong general term the whole thing is wrong so you can't proceed after that so it's better always check with a number so T 5 7 times 5 minus 3 35 minus 3 you get 32 so what's the fifth time one two three four five 32 is there so this is correct take this one how we find out the common difference take any two you take these two 29 minus 23 you get six so six is the common difference so what's the term we need to subtract from the first term how we find out so the term is 6l we substitute 1 6 times 1 you get 6 so 
,,this number and this number so this is 17 minus 6 so what's the number we need to add you need to add 11 to that so what's the general term we can write down 6 is a 
,,common difference so 6 n plus you know by now we'll check with numbers when you substitute 3 we take 3 6 times 3 plus 11 18 plus 11 so what you get 29 so the third term is 29 that means the general term is correct now this question 30 27 24 like that same step find the common difference so take the common difference 27 minus 30 
,,you get minus 3 then you need to find out this number that you need to subtract the common difference is minus 3 so we multiply by it when you take the first term substitute my 1 you get minus 3 now see the difference between that 30 minus minus 3 so what's the number we need this is tip last three you need to add turkey three to that so what's the general term minus 3n plus 33 now we'll check with the number one two three four five krypter T 5 minus 3 times 5 plus 33 minus 15 plus 33 plus 
,,18 so one two three four five so the fifth term is 18 that means your general term is this minus 3n plus 33 so same procedure you can do it really fast take the common difference that's minus 10 then what's the number we need to add check with minus 10 and when you substitute 1 you get minus check take the difference between the first 60 minus minus 10 that means 60 plus 10 you need 72 add so what's the general term minus 10 n plus 70 it's good to check where they are general term is correct so we'll take 5th term T 5 minus 10 x 5 + 7 t minus fifty plus seventy 70 minus 50 you get 20 one two three four five so their fifth term is 20 check this example 
,,you get - numbers so make sure that you put brackets minus 16 minus minus 18 so you get plus 18 their last row is the common difference then how you find out the number you need to add or subtract so you can check with the faster so two times in and the first term is 2 and you are taking minus 18 and - - the difference between these two so you need minus 20 to add that means actually we are subtracting 20 so what's the general term 2 and minus 20 check with a number 52 times 5 minus 20 10 minus 20 you get minus 10 1 2 3 4 5 so you are getting minus 10 now we'll try to find out general term and using the general term how we can find out any other term so what's the procedure so you have given the general term first so far we did questions with numbers given and you are asked to find out the children now the reverse process general term is given and you asked to find out the terms first part right the first three terms of the sequence how you do that so how you get first term substitute and equals 1 second term n equals 2 so we can easily by substituting numbers for n you can find out any term so here 7 times 1 7 7 minus 3 you get 4 as the first term second term you substitute 2 there 7 times 2 14 14 minus 3 in ever third one substitute 3 7 times 3 21 - 3 18 is a kurta so what are the three terms 4 11 and 18 and then how you find out the common difference you can't take any two terms and take the difference I take these two 11 minus 4 you get 7 as a common difference now the third part find the 10th term of the sequence so what you do basically substitute 10 if you want in plus 1 term substitute n plus 1 so we'll do these three parts so what's the term 7 n minus 3 so we'll take the sequence and find out the 10th term so general term is 7 in minus 3 so how do you get the 10th term that's t10 so 1 times 10 minus 3 70 minus 3 what you get you get 67 as the 10th term then what about n plus 1 term instead of n you can substitute n plus 1 so then we write here 2 n plus 1 here so server instead of n I can plug n plus 1 and then open brackets like at 7 n plus 7 minus 3 what's the answer 7 n plus 4 is the n plus 1 term and the last part is different what's the last part which term is equal to hundred thirty-seven so the nth term is given 137 so we need to find out which term so you're using the reverse process so TN equals now 137 but we know T any 7 + -3 that's equal 237 this is just solving linear equations so how do you do that when you have a number like this have you get rid of this minus 3 you need to add 3 to both sides then what's the next step you get 7 in now this is multiplication how you get 
,,rid of this 7 there we need to divide by 7 when you divide by 7 you are getting in equals 20 so when the nth term is given you can form an equation and solve now similar question to that you have given the interim as 11 minus 7 in and you asked to write down the first three terms common difference 11th term in - month chairman which term is equal to minus 129 now through the first three first part in equals one when you substitute in equals one you get the first 11 minus 7 that's four second term substitute 2 for M 11 minus 14 minus 330 substitute 3 11 -21 you get - him as the Curt now how do you find out the common difference you take the difference between any two consecutive terms so here what are the 3 times 4 minus 3 minus 10 now have you find out the common differences you take the difference between these 2 - 3 - 4 you get yes seven as a common difference now the third step is to find out the 11th term 11th tell you substitute 11 for n so what's the term expression 11 
,,minus 7 in substitute 11 they are 11 times 7 is 77 when you subtract you get minus 66 as the eleventh term then next part in minus one term so what you do substitute in minus 1 instead of n so the general term is minus 11 minus 7 and substitute in minus 1 instead of now expand brackets minus Silvernail minus into minus becomes plus 7 so what's the term you know 1 plus 7 is 18 minus 7 now the last part which term is equal to minus hundred twenty-nine so that means nth term is given so in term is 100 minus 129 and the general term is this so solve the wave equation so what's the first step subtract 11 then you get minus 7 in here and what's the number here you get minus hundred forty to get in you need to divide by minus 7 yeah - - get cancel out and you get plus and is equal to here also minus minus plus hundred forty divided by seven you get 20 now similar to that one another question now the general term is 3n minus 12 so write down the first three terms substitute one two three so substitute one here you get three minus 12 that's minus nine substitute two foil and you get second term as minus six now do the third to substitute three 9 
,,minus 12 you get minus three so how do you find out the common difference so what are the three terms minus nine minus six minus three now you can't take any two consecutive numbers and find out the common difference so a common difference is equal to if you take these two minus six minus minus nine minus six plus nine nine minus six you get three so the common difference is three so how you do the third part find a term in equals eight n plus 1 M equals n plus one so what's the comment what's the general term three and minus 12 now we'll find out the eighth term so what you do eighth term you substitute in equals eight so what's the generator 3n minus twelve substitute eight we are it's what you get 24 minus 12 you get twelve as the eighth term then in plus one term so substitute n plus 1 instead of when you multiply you get trillion plus three minus 2/3 n - that's the n+ want to now which term is equal to 33 means the end term is given 33 and you are asked to find out in so solve the equation and find out n so 3n minus 12 so you need to add 12 to get rid of this minus 12 what you get you get 45 so this 12 get cancelled out you get 3n and what's the next step you can divide this by 3 so N equals 15 3 times 1 3 1 remaining and for 15 that's fun so N equals 15 what it means the fifteenth term is 33 this one the general term is given 3n plus 7 you are asked to find out the 10th term so substitute M equals 10 3 times 10 30 30 plus 7 37 is the tenth term now this question is different sure that 41 is not a term in this sequence so we'll check what happens so we'll substitute TN is for tomorrow and see what you get for L so 3n 
,,plus 7 is 41 so subtract 7 from both sides you get 3n equals 34 so when you divide by 3 what you get n you get 1 here 1 and 1 remaining so you get 11 and 1/3 so in is the term number can you get 11 and third there's no meaning to that so in should be positive whole numbers so that means this 41 is not in their sequence so as the number of terms cannot be a fraction value 41 is not in the sequence now show that 123 is not in the sequence so similar way we can check with this 123 so what do you do to solve this you subtract 10 then when you subtract 10 you get 7 in here what you get here 3 113 so N equals 100 and 13/7 443 7 times 1 7 4 remaining 443 how 
,,many sevens are there 7 times 4 7 times 6 so 113 divided by 7 7 times 1 7 4 43 that's 6 42 and 1 remaining so you get 16 and 1/7 so this is a fraction and 123 is not in the sequence so we can write down as n is a fraction contra and 23 is not in the sequence now we try to solve problems word problems using the general term now we'll look at this example it says leiana saves 12 rupees 17 rupees and 22 rupees on the first second and third day respectively find the amount saved on the first five days find the common difference and the amount saved on empty and twentieth day like that so what we can do we can create a sequence and see the generator using the general term we can find out these words so what's the first step we need to find out the first five terms so first term is 12 how you get 17 adding five 17 to 22 adding fiber gain so that means the common difference is 5 so 22 plus 5 what you get 27 rupees that's the fourth day and 50 27 plus 5 that's 32 rupees so those are 
,,the five terms and find out the common difference you can easily find out already you have taken these two and found that's fun so 17 minus 12 or any term that's fine so the common difference is fine find the amount saved on the entity that means two general term so we will see how we can find out the general term common difference is 5 so 5 times 1 that's 5 and we take the difference between these two that's 7 that means we need to add 7 so what's the general term general term is 5 in not 
,,7 so this number comes here and this number so 5 in plus 7 is the general term so what's the fourth question it says what's the amount saved on 20th day so that means n equals 20 so substitute 20 there so the general term is 5 in plus 7 substitute 20 you get one hundred and seven rupees father one hundred plus seven so you get hundred seven rupees on the 20th day now the next part which day she saved 157 rupees so that means the nth term is 157 so we can plug hundred fifty seven for enter man solve the equation so this first subtract seven and then you get 150 is fiving so what you do you divide by five so you get 30 yes so what it means that means she saved Liana save one hundred fifty seven rupees on the 30th day now take this word problem it says one of the cyclist rides 15 kilo meters on the first day 18 kilometres on the second day and twenty one on the third day and continue this for ten days increasing free kilometres each day so what it means straightaway they have given the common difference is three because that's the increasing amount every day so how we find out the first five days the distance travel for the first five days 
,,so you can start from fifteen fifteen plus three eighteen eighteen plus three twenty one twenty one plus three twenty four twenty four plus three twenty seven and how you find out the common difference already given there but we can use the difference and show that that's equal to three so I'll take first two 18 minus fifteen that's plus three fourth part third part find the distance traveled on end-state that means temperature so how we find out the general term using this so three N and when you substitute n you get three so the difference between three and the first so what is 15 minus 3 you get 12 so that's the amount we need to add so the common difference is 3 and you need to add 12 so what's the general term 3n plus 12 now we find out the 9th day distance trout so what you do substitute 9 for n so the general term is 3n plus 12 and substitute 9 for that 9 times 3 27 plus 12 you get 39 so 9th day travel 39 kilometres now the fifth one find the distance traveled on the last day how can we find out their last day read the question and see how can we find out the last day this is a 10 day program so what's the last day T 10 so N equals 10 then so 3n plus 12 is the nth term last day means N equals 10 substitute 10 fun and 30 plus 12 30 plus 12 42 kilometres on the last day this question you have given a sequence and several terms in the middle has removed here we don't know the numbers there find the first three terms that has already removed from the sequence so how we find out the numbers already removed first we can find out the difference so 10-7 you can see that's adding three so what's the first number removed 16 plus 3 1919 plus 3 22 22 plus 325 so they are asking for the first three terms that has already removed from the sequence so this is the sequence now then the find the common difference is the same you can use the previous one ten minus seven that's three there and how you do enter in terms for the removed numbers so remove numbers means you can stop you can't start from server so you have to start from nineteen that's your sequence now so starting from nineteen the common difference is three so how you find out the general term the common difference is three so you get three yen and how you'll find out the difference so the first term is nineteen and when you substitute one for the first term 3 times 1/3 so 19 minus 3 you get 16 so that means we need to add 16 to get the answer so I can write T and equals 3 n plus 16 for the integer then forth but find the last term that has removed from the sequence how you find our last term here we know this number now how you find out the last term so we know these numbers or subtract 3 40 the last term is 40 minus 3 so you get 37 is the number removed in the last place fifth part which term is that 
,,number in the sequence so we have a sequence now starting from 19 the common difference is 3 and the last term we found that's 37 so they are asking which term so TN is equal to 3n plus 16 last term is 37 and see what's the M value so subtract 16 first you get 21 is equal to 3n n equals 21 divided by 3 that's 7 so that means the last term is the seventh term of the removed sequence now we look at example 1 in your textbook so we covered all the theory related to number patterns and we'll see how we can do examples and exercises in this one the nth term is given you asked to find out the first three terms so what you do in term is 2n plus 3 when M equals 1 you can find out the first term so T 1 equals 2 times 1 plus 3 that's 2 + 3 5 in V equals 2 you can get the second term 2 times 2 plus 3 4 plus 3 is 7 M equals 3 you get the third term 2 times 3 plus 3 6 + 3 9 so first three terms 5 7 9 now we look at the second one you are asked to find out the 20th - so how you do xx done 
,,that means T 20 M equals 20 so 2 times 20 plus 3 2 times 20 40 40 plus 3 you get 43 third part which term is equal to hundred twenty three so we'll substitute 2 TN that's 2n plus 3 this is hundred twenty three equals 2n plus 3 now subtract three from both sides and then you get 2 in here 120 divided by 2 you get n so you get 60 
,,so 60 term is hundred twenty three and the last part you asked to find out n plus 1 term so what you do you substitute in plus 1 for n 2 times n plus 1 plus 3 open brackets you get to win plus 2 Plus 3 that means 2 n plus 5/2 plus 3 you get fat so what's the N plus 1 term 2n plus 5 example number 2 so the general term is 56 minus 4n and you asked to write down first stratum so say similar to the first one substitute 1 2 3 so T N equals 56 minus 4n B equals 1 you get T 1 substitute 1 there so I'll do it here 56 minus 4 that's 52 n equals 2 you get T to 56 minus 4 times 2 so you get 56 minus 8 you get 48 at the second term n equals 3 56 minus 4 times 3 you get 56 minus 12 that's the answer 44 is the third term now the second part it says find the 12th term so T 12 56 minus 4 times 12 instead of game you can plug 12 
,,so 56 minus 48 that's 12 times 4 subtract you get 8 as the 12th term now third ward sure that zero is a term of this number pattern so in term is given zero so we'll see what's the end value so zero is equal to 56 minus for it now how you solve this you can subtract 56 from both sides minus 4n you get minus 4 and equals minus 56 divided by minus 4 you get N equals minus minus get cancel out you get 1 for 16 that's 4 so n is 14 n is a whole number so that means 0 is in the sequence so we can write in is therefore zero is in the sequence when you get a fraction that means it's not a it's not in the sequence but here this is not a fraction so you get 0 is in the sequence last part show that 18 is not a term so you need to get a fraction value for n so we'll check that out we do the fourth one 18 so we'll substitute 18 and see 56 minus 4 is subtract 56 from both sides you get minus four N equals subtract this 56 minus 18 you get 16 and 38 and this is negative 38 now try to divide by 4 minus 4 what you get N equals 4 times 8 4 times 9 36 and two remaining that's 2 over 4 so 9 and a half that means a fraction is there so that means 18 is not in the sequence so you have to write down n is a fraction therefore 18 is not in the sequence now take exercise 1.1 complete the table so you have given the general term of the number planner and you're asked to find out n equals 1 2 & 3 and first three terms of the number pattern so just substitute 1 here 2 for n 3 4 and to get 
,,the third term so we'll do that the sequence is this so 2 times n that means 2 times 1 + 1 2 + 5 7 take this sequence 2 times 1 there no other way around 20 - 2 you 
,,get 18 15 minus 4 times 1 50 minus 4 you get 4635 minus 130 now we'll take the second term this one 5 n minus 1 so substitute 2 for n minus 1 5 times 2 10 10 minus 1 9 this one to N N equals 2 plus 5 4 + 5 9 next 120 minus 2 times 2 20 minus 4 you get 1650 minus 4 times 250 minus 8 you get 42 35 minus 2 you get 33 now look at the third term substitute 3 for n 5 times 3 minus 1 15 minus 140 next one 2 times 2 n plus Phi 2 times 3 plus 5 6 Plus 5 11 and this 120 minus 2 times 3 that means 20 
,,minus 6 you get 1450 minus 4 times 350 minus 12 38 the next one 35 minus 3 you get 32 now what are the numbers in the sequence in the second one four nine fourteen third one seven nine eleven this one 18 16 14 4 2 6 42 and 38 here and the last one 34 33 question number two the general term of a number patent is for in minus three right the first three terms find the 12th term which term is equal to 97 and sure that 75 is not a term of this number path so we'll do the first one first three terms means substitute and equals one that's why N equals two you get the second term eight minus three that's five N equals three substitute 3 for n twelve minus three nice so what are the first three terms you get one five in second part fine the 12th term that means you need T 12 substitute 12 4 n 4 times 12 minus 3 so 48 minus 3 you get 45 as the 12th term third one which term is equal to 97 so that means in term is 97 and we need to find out n so what's the term 4 and minus 3 now what's the first step to get rid of this minus 3 add 3 to both sides so you get 4 in here and here 100 100 divided by 4 you get in that's twenty fourth part sure that 75 is not inner term sure that 75 is not a term of the sequence okay so we'll substitute 75 for nth term and see when you add 3 you get 78 with 44 now / for both sides n equals 4 times 1/4 for 38 how many Falls are there 4 times 9 36 so two remaining so you get 2 over 4 so 19 and a half 204 means half so this is a fraction so as in 
,,is a fraction 75 is not in the sequence question number three again you have given it number patent with general term seven n plus one you asked to find out the first three terms so we'll do substituting in equals one that's first term so you get 7 plus 1 is 8 and equals 2 you get the second term so 14 plus 150 N equals 3 21 plus 122 so the first three numbers are 8 15 and 22 and find the fifth term that means N equals 5 so T 5 so 7 times 5 plus 135 plus 136 or fifth term is 36 and third one which term is equal to 36 so in term is given 36 yards to find out n now we'll solve the trainee equation so subtract 1 from both sides and then you get 35 is equal to 7 8 divide both sides by 7 you get five so N equals five that means 5th term is 36 fourth one right the n plus 1 term so how you find out n plus 1 term substitute n plus 1 for n so 730 n plus 1 term is 7 into n plus 1 here you don't need to put multiplication sign because brackets are there plus 1 now open brackets 7 in plus 7 plus 1 you get 7 Plus 8 is the n plus 1 term fourth question you have given a general term 50 minus 7 n you asked to write down the first three terms tenth term 
,,n plus 1 remember last one sure that the terms which come after the seventh term are negative numbers so we can substitute N equals 1 to get the first term you get 50 minus 7 43 M equals 2 to get the second term 50 minus 14 so what's 50 minus 40 you get 36 in equals 350 minus 7 times 350 minus 21 when you subtract you get 29 and the second part how you do the 10th term that means t10 so substitute N equals 10 50 - 70 that means minus 20 is the answer for temperature third part you asked to 
,,find out n plus 1 term substitute n plus 1 for 50 minus 7 times n plus 1 open brackets now - 17 minus 7 so 50 minus 7 you get 40 3-7 Hey now the last part so all the negative numbers after seven so what's the term after seven eight one so you can suck ct8 and t89 and see whether you get negative numbers so we'll substitute 8 here 8 when you substitute to the general term what you get 50-50 6-6 when you take 9 50 minus 7 times 9 so 50 minus 63 you get minus 13 so we can see after 7th term all the terms are negative so therefore we can write down after 7th all terms are negative why it happens here when you substitute 7 you get 49 that's below 50 but when you substitute bigger numbers you get more negative part and the result is also negative now look at example 1 given that the sequence with first four terms 1590 23 and 27 as a common difference let us find an expression for the nth term so TN we need to find out so what's the method we write down the terms and then we calculate the common difference what's the common difference when you take this 119 minus 15 that's so the common difference is 4 so you take multiples of 4 4 times 1/4 4 times 2 8 4 times 3 12 4 times 4 16 then what's the next step you subtract subtract these two 15 minus 4 what you get yellow 19-8 11 23 minus 12 you get 2 same value 
,,so this number means the number you need to add so what's the nth term TN equals the common difference is 4 so that means 4 in in the first part and then we need to 
,,add 11 to that so you can check whether your general term is correct by substituting n equals 3 we do t3 3 times 4 plus 11 so 12 plus 11 you get 23 1 2 3 so the 23 is there so that means your general term is correct example number 2 you have given four terms 10 7 4 1 and you asked to find out T and that's the general term so we'll find out write down the terms and then find out the common difference take any to 7 minus J you get minus 3 o find out multiples of minus 3 so minus 3 times 1 minus 3 minus 3 times 2 minus 6 minus 9 minus now we need to subtract these two 10 minus minus 3 is what you get 10 plus 3 that's 37 minus minus 6 so you get 13 when you subtract so this is the number we need to add to get the general term so what's the general term G M equals the difference is minus 3 so you get minus 3 n plus 13 
,,now check we'll check with 4 1 2 3 4 when you substitute 4 here 4 times 3 negative 12 negative 12 plus 13 you get 1 so that means correct exercise 1.2 you have given a table with several sequences and you are asked to find out the difference between two successive terms that means the common difference and what's the third column the number whose multiples are used to develop the pattern so multiple of that that's the same as the common difference so we'll take any two term here 17 minus 10 that's 7 so what's the multiple so you need 7 now take the third one which one is easy to subtract this way is easy 5 and 1/2 minus 4 so you get 1 and 1/2 so same here so you get 1 and 1/2 all it's easy to write as a improper fraction so 1 and 1/2 me is 3 over this one take any 2 I'll take this one seventeen minus 20 that's minus 3 so this is also minus 3 this 145 minus 50 so you get minus 5 so minus 5 this was 0.8 minus 0.5 you get point point question number 2 complete the table in relation to the number pattern 10 17 24 31 you're asked to write down fill these gaps terms are divided and this is integer so we can write this is T n so we'll find out 
,,the inch how you write down this one so how will get 10 from server 7 times 1 is 7 so you need to add 3 to get 7 times 2 14 14 and 17 differences 3 so how do you write this one third term so I can write 7 times 3 and then 3 7 times 3 21 21 plus 3 24 this is 4th charm 7 times 4 and adding 3 now in term how you write you can write 7 times look at the pattern if this is for you take 4 if this is n you need to take so I'll multiply first seven times n plus 3 so when you simplify you get 7 in last 3 so that's the in term formula now this is different to normal pattern because already given this is 7 times Worrell and you asked to find out the patterns now we will take question number 3 find the general term of each of the number patterns given below so we'll take the first one 1 4 7 10 so what's the easiest way we can 
,,find out the general term we find out the common difference you take these two 4-1 you get three then here the common difference is three so you need three when you 
,,substitute one for in that's tricky so we need to find out the amount we need to add or subtract to get one so one minus three take the difference between the first 
,,value and there this one so 1 minus 3 is minus 2 now straight away we can find out the general term so what's the general term then the common difference is 3 so 3 n minus 2 so this is subtracting 2 together so now we can check in equals 4 4 times 3 12 12 minus 2 T so that means correct we do Part B 1 7 13 90 find out find out common difference so common differences take any two terms and subtract seven minus one you get six then 6n is the term and when you substitute 1/6 times 1/6 and you 
,,are taking the difference between that term with the first term 1 minus 6 is minus 5 so how can we write down the end term T N equals 6 n minus 5 now substitute and 
,,see if this is 4th - 4 times 6 24 24 minus 5 you get 90 so that fourth term is 19 we'll take part c9 17 25 33 common difference is 17 minus 9 8 then the term is a 10 when you substitute 1 8 times 1 is 8 so we take the difference with the first 9 minus 8 is what so that means we need to add one general term means a 10 plus 1 will roughly check when this is 4 4 times 8 is 32 32 plus 133 now Part D for 10 16 22 what's the common difference there 10 minus 4 is 6 then you need 6 when you substitute 1 for that 6 times 1 6 so you take the difference with the first 4 minus 6 is minus 2 that means the general term is 6 in minus 2 no chick with 3 3 times 6 18 18 minus 2 16 so the third term is 16 party 22:19 16 13 find the common difference 19-22 19-22 is minus 3 so we need to take minus 3n and when you substitute N equals 
,,1 you get minus 3 so we have to take the difference with the first 22 minus minus 3 you get 22 plus 3 that's 25 so what's the general term T N equals minus 3 n plus 
,,"25 so you can check with 3 3 times 3 9 25 minus 9 but you get 25 minus 9 you get 16 so the general term is correct now take the other part we'll do it here 2220 1860 what's the common difference 20-22 get - - then you need - to weigh when you substitute 1 minus 2 times 1 - trouble so you take the difference with the first 22 - minus 2 you get 22 + 2 that's 24 so what's in term minus 2n + 24 now check whether this is correct substitute 4 for x - 8 - 8 + 24 that's 16 so the general term is correct example number 1 a long-distance runner trains every day on the first day he runs 500 meters and on each day thereafter he runs 100 meters more than on the previous day so this is a word problem so here first term is 500 and here what's this value 100 more every day means that's the common difference so how can we find out first three values starting from hundred so what's the first part right separately the distances he runs on the first three days so first day that's t1 that's given 500 what about second day you need to add 100 to that 500 plus hundred you get 600 so what's the third day value 600 plus hundred that's 700 then part to find the general term for the distance he runs on the empty in terms of it so what's the easiest way to find out the general term so we can find out the general term using the common difference is hundred that's hundred in to find out whether to add a number or subtract we do 100 times one that's hundred and take the difference with the first value five hundred minus hundred is four hundred so that means we need to add four hundred to that so when n V equals three three times one hundred three hundred three hundred plus 400 you get seven hundred so this is the end so part three it says find the distance he runs on the 20th day so that means T twenty hundred times twenty there we substitute n equals twenty so 2,000 plus 400 is 2400 kilo meters or meters here it's meters own 2400 meters on which day does he run three kilometres so this is in kilometres and the sequence is in meters so we need to convert it so how many meters for three kilometres that's three thousand so we can substitute three thousand is the integer and we can find out using the general to 100 in plus four hundred subtract 400 from both sides you get hundred a is equal to 2600 so what's M divided by 100 means moving decimal place two places to left so you get 26 is the inter so that means 26 day he runs three kilometres exercise one point three a pattern created by using matchsticks is shown below complete the table in relation to the pattern given below so they are calculating total number of matchsticks so you have to count the number it's given for the second one and you need to do other diagrams 1 2 3 4 what about the third one 1 2 3 4 here it's easy to count this way row wise 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 what about this one 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 find the number of matchsticks needed to create the 20th figure so that means we need to find out the general term so we'll see what are the numbers for 914 94 914 90 so what's the common difference common difference is 9 minus 4 that's fine then we take five men and when you substitute one that's fun then we take the difference with the first four minus five that's minus one "
,,so how can you write down the inter five n minus one we'll check with 4 4 times 5 20 20 minus 190 so this is the general term so how we can answer the first part xx 
,,term means T 20 so substitute 24 in five times twenty hundred hundred minus one that's 99 219 matchsticks are required to create which figure of this pattern so you 
,,asked to find out in term is given as 219 and asked you to find out in that's five in minus one add one to both sides you get cancelled out and remain five when this is 220 when you divide by five what you get for em five times 420 420 again that's 444 so to create the forty fourth term you need 219 matchsticks part three show that one matchstick remains after creating a figure of the pattern by using the maximum number of matchsticks from 75 matchsticks so we'll see when it's 75 what happens five n minus one add one to both sides what happens here you get five in and seventy six divided by 5 you get 5 times 1 5 2 remaining 26 you get five so 26 minus 
,,25 you get 1 so the remainder is 1 so n is 15 and you get remainder so that's what it says when you take 75 matchsticks you get remainder 1 question number 2 a worker cuts pieces of rods of different lengths from iron rods which are 5 meter in length in order to build a gate by welding pieces together the length of the shortest 
,,piece of iron rod that is cut is 15 centimeters all the other pieces are cut such that the difference in length between two successive pieces which are cut is 10 centimeters so what it means this is the common difference right the length of the shortest three pieces cut by the worker so the shortest one is 15 what's the next one 10 more than that 15 plus 10 25 25 plus 10 35 so those are the three shortest let's then the second part find the length of the 20th piece so to get that you need the Chandra so how do you get the general term so T n we can write straightaway the difference is 10 means you get 10 in to find out this number we don't know whether it is plus or minus we take when this is 10 then substitute n equals 1 that's 10 do it here and take the difference with 50 15 minus change that's fine so you need 
,,to and 5 to get the tough so you can check it by adding three substituting 3 3 times 10 30 30 plus 5 35 so that means general term is correct and you asked to find out the 20th piece that's t 20 10 times 20 plus 5 you get 205 as a third part show that a 5 meter long rod will not be sufficient to cut the 50th peace when arranged 
,,in ascending order order of the length this is the 50th piece so how we find out that the length of the Y is 5 meters design centimeter so you need to convert 5 meters to centimeters that's 500 centimeters the whole length and we'll check what's the length of the 50th piece that means T 15 10 into 50 plus 5 so 505 505 now this is in centimeters the length of the whole pie is 5 meters means 500 centimeters so here we need another 5 meters to cut the fiftieth piece so therefore we can write down we need so we can show that 505 minus 500 is 5 centimeters so that means we need 5 centimeter more so that means 5 meat is not enough to cut 50th piece so here this is not enough we'll take the third question on the day that their school celebrated annual savings they asked me and in dunya start saving money by putting hundred each into their respective savings boxes after that they put money into their saline boxes once a week so what is - yes me an Indonesian so saving hundred rupees 
,,and after that they put money into the saving box once a week on the same day of the week that they started saving money so same day every week s me put Chen rupees 
,,and in the nil foot fire of peace and you're asking to find out how much just yes me have in her saving box in the 5th week so we can start with this so 100 rupees already there so we can find out the fifth step so first we ten rupees so second week 20 so like that 5th week so that's ten times five so 50 rupees saving and initially hundred so what's the total 100 plus 50 so hundred fifty rupees second part how much does in dunya have in her savings box in the tenth week so each week five rupees so what's the amount for tenth week so ten times five that's also fifty rupees but initially hundred rupees invested so hundred plus 50 you get hundred third part at the end of fifty weeks both of them open they're saving boxes and check the amount that each has saved how much more money has yes been saved than in dunya in 
,,the 50th week so how can you find out the 50th week saving so you can find out the general term or without the general term you can do that this is 50th week if you 
,,take yes me saved in the 50th term that means hundred plus ten times fifty plus five hundred you get 600 what about in dunya hundred plus fire rupees each week into 
,,50 so hundred plus 250 that's 350 so what's the difference so you can write out the difference is 600 minus 350 so you get two hundred and fifty rupees so that means yes me save two hundred and fifty more than in dunya after 50th week fourth question the seeds in an outer stadium are arranged for a drama in 15 rows according to 
,,a pattern with a common difference such that the first row consists of nine seats second one twelve and the third one fifteen etc how many seats are there in total in the first five rows so we'll find out the other two what's the difference there your you need to add three so 12 plus three 15 15 plus three 18 18 plus 3 21 1 2 3 
,,4 5 so that means they are asking the total number of seats so we need to add all these together 9 plus 12 plus 15 plus 18 plus 21 add it together we let this way 12 9 15 18 21 so you get 9 plus 1 10 18 18 plus 2 20 25 two remaining 4 5 6 7 so altogether 75 seats a-- they are in total - how many seats are there in the 15th row so that means you have to find out t 15 so we can find out the chain rule so how we find out the general term the common difference is 3 so you get 3 yen and see what you need to add so when you plug 1 that's 3 so 9 minus 3 you get 6 so that means you need to add 6 to get the general term we'll check it when you substitute 3 3 times 3 9 9 + 6 15 that's correct then say 15 is you substitute 15 for n 3 times 5 is 45 plus 6 fifty-one seeds are their third par showed that the tenth row has four 
,,times the number of seats in the first row according to this pattern so we'll check the number of seeds in tenth row t10 that's three times ten plus six 36 so the tenth term is 36 what's the first term nine so we can see 9 times 4 is 36 that means 4 times the first row when you take that tenth row so we can write 36 is nine times so there are four four times bigger fourth pot which row consists of 51 seats so the nth term is given 51 so TN equals 3 n plus 6 this is given 51 3 n plus 6 subtract 6 from both sides you get 3n equals 45 when you divide by 3 you get N equals 15 so that means 15th row you get 50 bar seats miscellaneous exercise question number 1 the general terms of few number patterns are given below for each number pattern right the first three terms find the 20th term and n minus 1 term you take the first one first 3 it's 4 3 n minus 1 N equals 1 I'll put T 1 3 times 1 minus 5/3 minus 5 you get 2 in the equals - tea - 3 times 2 - 5 6 minus 5 is 1 M equals 3 that's 3 3 3 times 3 minus 5 9 minus 5 is 4 and the 20th term that means N equals 20 this is part two this is part one T 20 that's 3 times 20 - fun so 60 minus 5 you get 
,,55 and the last part in minus 1 so T and minus 1 equals 3 times n minus 1 minus 5 when you multiply these two what you get 3 n minus 3 minus 5 that means 3n minus 8 
,,now we will do for the next sequence that's 6 n plus 5 do be here 6 n plus 5 so we have to do all these parts for the second one so in equals 1 t 1 6 times 1 plus 5 
,,6 + 5 11 in the equals 2 that's T 2 6 times 2 plus 5 12 plus 5 is 17 and M equals 3 that's 3 3 6 times 3 plus 5 18 classifiers 23 and then you need N equals 20 that's the second part T 20 so 6 times 20 plus 120 + 5 that's hundred 20 funds then when N equals n minus 1 we need T - one is six times n minus 1 plus Phi open brackets 
,,6 and minus 6 plus 5 you get 6 in - we take the path tree 6 + -5 substitute and equals 1 to get the first term 6 minus 5 is 1 M equals 2 you get the second term 12 minus 5 is 7 M equals 3 you get the third term 18 minus 5 is 30 and T 20 when N equals 20 you get and equals 20 that's t26 times 20 minus 500 20 minus 5 is equal to 150 now we'll find out in minus 1/2 T n minus 1 is 6 into n minus 1 minus 5 so you get 6 n minus 6 minus 5 6 n minus 11 for n minus 1 find the general term of each number pattern given below given that each has and now each has a common difference so we'll do the first one identify the common difference what's the common difference there we can take any two difference this is easy no 9 minus 5 that's 4 how do you find out the general term for when is there when you're substitute n equals 1/4 times 1/4 you take the difference with the first term minus 3 minus 4 you get minus 7 so that means the general term means for n minus 7 always check whether this is correct so substitute 3 4 times 3 12 12 minus 7 you get 5 so third term is fun and this one Part B in second part 0 4 8 12 what's the common difference 4 minus 0 that's so find out the gender Cho you take win when you substitute for and take the difference with 0 0 minus 4 you get minus 4 now what's the general term you get food in minus 4 and just check with the number if this is 3 4 times 3 12 12 minus 4 you get 8 so the third term is each part 3 you get fractions there so what's the common difference there so which one is easy to subtract I can use these Jodha two and a half - two you get half then what's the term half in or in / - half any same as n over two so we need to find out the first one n equals one that's half so take the difference between the first term at that number you get one so that means we 
,,need to add one so the general term is 1/2 in + check with the number if this is 3 3 over 2 means 1.5 one and a half one and a half and one you get two and a half not four what's the common difference common difference is you can take these two three - zero that's three now to get the general term you take three in when you substitute N equals 1 that's 3 so take the difference with - 6 minus 6 minus 3 you get minus 9 so what's the general term 3 n minus 9 check with the number 3 3 times 3 9 9 - 9 you get zero so that's correct question number three show that the general term of the number pattern this one with the common difference is 6 8 - n okay so the general term you have to show this one so how we can find out so the first term is 42 second term 36 like that what's the common difference common differences subtract the two so it's easy to subtract this way thirty minus thirty-six you get minus 6 then when you take minus six in substitute N equals 1 you get minus six so take the difference with 42 that's the first term minus and minus six so what you get 42 plus 6 42 plus 6 is 48 so the general term is minus 6 n plus 48 substitute 3 and C 3 times 8 is minus 18 48 minus 18 you get 30 so third term is 30 that's correct now we have to show this is this one so can you see the positive term in the first here 48 I can write 48 minus 6 in rearrange the terms and then yeah 6 taken out so fact 2 6 is common for both because 48 is 6 times 8 so I can't take 6 out and write this is 8 minus question number 4 auditor is employed in a private company his first monthly salary is 25 thousand rupees from the beginning of the second year 
,,"onwards he receives an annual salary increment of 2,400 per month first part how much is his monthly salary at the beginning of the second year right separately with occurs monthly salary during the first three years write an expression for the salary in the nth term and find auditors monthly salary in the fifth year so we need "
,,"to to identify the common difference here it says the first monthly salary is 25 thousand and then increment is always 2400 so common difference is given two thousand four hundred so how can we find out the value for the second year that's t2 so two thousand five twenty five thousand plus two thousand four hundred you get four hundred here seven twenty seven thousand four hundred rupees second part right separately you details monthly salary during the first three years so first year twenty five thousand so second yeah twenty-seven thousand four hundred what's the third year third year you need to add another two thousand four hundred so two thousand twenty seven thousand four hundred at 2400 you get twenty nine thousand twenty nine thousand eight hundred so these are the three your salary part three write an expression for is sorry for the end here until means T n how can you find out TN the first value is twenty five thousand and the common difference is 2400 so you get two thousand four hundred in and how can you find out the number you need to add or subtract substitute one there so you get 2,400 and subtract from 25,000 so 25,000 - "
,,"2,400 so what's the difference you get 6 plus 4 10 one remaining this is 3 and 2 here so 22600 that means we need to add 22600 to that now we can have to check it so when you substitute 2 here please we'll see whether you are getting this number so when you substitute 2 2 times this you get forty four thousand eight hundred plus twenty two thousand six hundred zero zero four and seven so we are getting the second term so that means the general term is correct now take the fourth part find auditors monthly salary in the fifth year so you need to substitute M equals five so N equals five substitute five here so t five equals twenty four thousand not twenty four thousand two thousand four hundred into five plus twenty two thousand six hundred so what's the value so here is zero zero twenty two remaining 10 plus 2 12 "
,,twelve thousand plus twenty two thousand six hundred you get six here 2 + 2 4 + 3 so 34 thousand six hundred rupees that's the fifth year salary so in this lesson we discussed all concepts related to number patterns so we discussed how you can find out the common difference common difference we can take any term except the first term minus the previous term and then we found out how to find out the integer and then I showed you an easy way to find out the generator so by practicing this concept you can master the keys concept in number patterns and next time we'll come with the second chapter
,,
Number Partens,CT9iX5osAs4,hello grade 8 children today I am here with another new topic we'll see what's the topic about you have done numbers two plus three and a half minus five oh you have done point three plus 95 so all these are with numbers so we call this is number theory then you have done straight lines circles squares parallel lines and angles 
,,all are these geometry what about letters what are these two x plus three Y minus five plus three X letters and numbers combination we call that algebra so today we 
,,are doing about algebra so what's the topic chapter five algebraic expression so we'll find out what are the terms involved in this uni and what are the concepts look at this one the price of a coconut is 48 rupees the distance from Colombo to Gul is hundred kilometers there are 31 days in the month of January Ravinder gets 80 points in mathematics course so what are they is 48 130 180 what are those those are numbers if I ask you a question what's the height of a student in grade 8 class so we can't give a specific value usually the height of the students in the class will be different from one another so therefore we need to define a term called variable so what's variable changing values of height as it is not a fixed number so when you don't get a fixed number when the value is changing we call those are variables we use algebraic terms or expressions to denote changing values so we'll take height as a letter so we use algebraic expression like x today not changing values any letter this one profit varies from one day to another day from Nima's three-wheeler so it's changing all the time it can be named as I'll put a receipt a so what's a it's a variable because it's changing all the time this one radius of three circles are three centimetres four centimetres and five centimetres respectively when we consider radius of the circle we can take this one is R that's a variable we can use a letter so what's the R value we can write R equals three centimeters R equals four centimeters that our equals five centimeters so what's the variable they are our that's the radius of the circle this one city does a bias certain number 
,,"of string hoppers to sell in his boutique every day if we do not know the number exactly can show it as another variable we'll take simple B where B is an unknown set we don't know exactly the amount of string hoppers that city dancer buys look at this one in the figure above shows three containers of the same size all three containers contain an equal amount of liquid it can be considered as what you can use another letter H because it is an unknown constant because we don't know exactly what's the water level is so here what's the variable H height of water so lowercase letters such as a b c or you can put X Y Z so any simple lowercase letters we can use to represent variables so it can be an unknown constant or a variable look at this one the daily income of poachers fruit shop can be stated as X so what is X they are jail income he saved his income by 2,000 rupees a day find the remaining amount of money what's the total income X he's saving to thousand rupees each day so what's the remaining amount you can write in terms of X X is the total value daily income subtract 2000 so the remaining amount is X minus 2000 so this is an algebraic expression so what are the terms terms in this algebraic expression we can write x an mm so those are called terms of algebraic expression so what are the terms "
,,you learn now you learned about variable and we can use simple letters for variables and the next term is terms of an algebraic expression look at this one the price of a coconut is extra base the price of 8 coconut so what you do you have to multiply by 8 so one coconut is x and x 8 so what's the value you get 8x rupees so what are the terms you can say 8x is an algebraic term and the number in front of the letter here X is the variable the number in front of the letter is called coefficient so what's the coefficient in this term 8 8 is the coefficient of the algebraic term we learned about variables terms and coefficient now look at this one combination of algebraic terms 5x plus 3y minus 4z that's called algebraic expression so what are these 5 x 3y minus 4 are the algebraic terms and what about this one the number in front of the letter what you call that coefficients coefficients and terms the width of the rectangle is X its length is 7 its length is 7 meters more than the rich right the algebraic expression for the length so how can we write down length 7 more than that ex-mo more means in maths plus addition X plus 7 is the length so what's the algebraic expression for length X plus 7 if the length of the rectangle is wild now they have given this one is y if this one is y write down the algebraic expression for width we know the width is 7 meters less than the length so we can write by -7 if you take length as Y that's Y minus 7 is the weight the price 
,,of a pen is extra pays the cost of a pencil is why rupees the price of a book is 0 please so what about price of three prints one is X and 3 you have to multiply by 
,,3 3 X 3 times X you don't need to write down the multiplication sign you can write 3x price of 4 pencils one pencil is why 4 pencils for y price of several books one book is zero Peas seven books 7z give the cost of buying all the above in the form of an algebraic expression so the total cost we can add it together 3x plus 4y plus 7c that's an algebraic expression write the terms of this algebraic expression so you have given an algebraic expression what are the terms 3x for bi and 7z coefficient of 3 X we know what is coefficient means the number in front of the letter that's 3 coefficient of 4y what's the number in front that's four coefficient of 77 is the coefficient there build algebraic expression for the following statements we'll try to write in terms of letters you can take these letters given add 7 to the double of X what if double means 2 times X so adding 7 to double of X means 2x 2x plus 7 subtract 6 from the 3 times of X but if three times means 3x 3x and you have to subtract 6 subtract 3 from the sum of x and y sum of x and y means the addition X plus 1 and subtract 3 divided by y how you divide we can write x over 1 divide X by y and subtract from seven so that turns that you have to subtract from seven that means seven - so we'll write seven minus x over Y not X over Y minus 7 because from 7 you have to subtract this amount divided the multiplication of a and B multiplication of a and B by 3 means a B divided by 3 divided the multiplication of 
,,a and B by 3 and subtract from 10 from 10 means 10 minus this value filling the gaps in the following table algebraic expressions are there as you break terms so you have to write down only algebraic terms so what are the algebraic terms 7 x + 3 by what's the coefficient 7 & 3 what are the I do break terms here 6a + 3 B here you don't write down these constants algebraic terms means only terms with letters what are the coefficients 6 & 3 here Excel why hyphens are 1 and 1 in this one 3 a coefficient is 3 this one - 3 X + 7 5 coefficients are -3 here and so this one you get a fraction but here this is an algebraic term 2x over 3 you can write X in the numerator and 3 by over 5 also an algebraic term then what's the coefficient you have to take the whole thing the fraction 2/3 three fits this one this is an algebraic term 5x over 7 and minus 2y over 3 so what's the coefficient there five over seven is the coefficient of x term and minus two-thirds is the coefficient of weiter look at this question the cost of an arranges extra pays the cost of an apple is y rupees the cost of a mango is zero peas build algebraic expressions for the following price of two oranges and five mangoes oranges is X so 2x plus because this is both together five mangoes one mango easy five mangoes 5z price of two mangoes and seven apples two mangoes is to Z and seven apples Apple is why rupee so 7 y cost of six oranges and eight apples six oranges one orange is X plus six six and eight apples one Apple is why that's eight why price of five oranges seven apples and three mangos five oranges that's 5 X 7 apples 7 y then 3 mangoes 3z question number five cost of one orange one apple and two mangoes one Apple is why and one orange is X and two mangoes - Z - look at this one right down the algebraic expression for the total cost to buy three kilos of sugar two kilos of Thailand five kilos of flour we are one kilo of each product is a rupees be rupees and C rupees respectively so what are the values total cost we need three kilos of sugar so sugar is a so three a five kilos then two kilos of Dar Daly's be rupees to be and five kilos of flour flour is C rupees of five C next one one kilo of red dollies extra peas and one kilo of yellow dollies why rupees write down an algebraic expression for the extra mounts pen for buying five kilos of yellow da then three kilos of red that means the price is high when you buy five kilos of yellow da so what's the difference five 
,,kilos of yellow doll yellow one is by rupees 5 i- three kilos of red on red dollies extra piece per kilo so 3x so the difference is this well the capacity of a bucket days M liters and bucket B is in liters you need to use 12 buckets of a and eight buckets of B at once to fill a tank what is the capacity of the track so what's the total amount of a buckets yeah 12 a buckets so M liters are there so 12 M then what about from B buckets so need eight buckets of B each bucket contained in liters so eight and so the capacity of the tank is 12 m + 8 in the father's age in one of the families years the age of the mother is beers the daughter's age is Sears give the sum of ages of the father and mother in the form of an algebraic expression fathers ages a mother's ages B so the total is a plastic give the sum of the age of the mother and daughter in the form of an algebraic expression mother's age is B daughters ages the total of the ages of the father mother and dot all three of them a plus B plus C write the sum of the total age of the three above after 10 years in the form of an algebraic expression so we have to add 10 for each value 10 and 
,,10 and 10 for all three people that means 30 so the total value is a plus B plus C plus 30 so after 10 years this is the total value manufacturers men extra piece to make a table the manufacturer made a profit of twice as much as the cost price and sold it to a retailer the retailer solely to the consumer with a profit of by rupees right the profit of the manufacturer in the form of an algebraic expression so how can you write down an algebraic expression manufacture a spend X to make a table that's the cost value the manufacturer made a profit of twice as much as the cost price so what's the profit to X so write the profit of the manufacturer in the form of an algebraic expression err so that's 2x give the selling price of the table by the manufacturer in the form of an algebraic expression so the profit is 2x and the cost price is X so what's the selling price X plus 2x when you add it that's 3x so that's the selling price right the selling price of the retailer to the consumer in the form of an algebraic expression now the retailer sold it to the consumer with a profit of Y rupees so this is the price this retailer bought that means 3 X and he keeps by rupee profit so you have to add Y so this is the selling price of the retailer to the consumer the shape shown in the above is a square and a rectangle made out of matchsticks give the perimeter of the square in the form of an algebraic expression one side is given X for sides and there X plus X plus X plus X 
,,what's the perimeter for X give the perimeter of the rectangle in the form of an algebraic expression how you find out the perimeter you have to add all these lengths so a plus 2b plus a plus 2b a and a you are getting 2 a 2b and 2b when you add 2 plus 2 4 that's 4 B give the full length of the matchsticks used to construct the 
,,above images in the form of an algebraic expression so total length so length for the squares for X and length for this one is 2a plus 4b subtract the total length of the matchsticks used to make the square from the total length of the matchsticks used to make the rectangle in an algebraic expression so you have to subtract the 
,,lengths of matchsticks used to make the square from this one so what's the total here two way plus 4b and subtract the lengths for this one that's 4x look at this one give the perimeter of the equilateral triangle in the form of an algebraic expression equilateral means all sides I equal a and a n a what's the perimeter 3a right the perimeter of the write angular triangle in the form of an algebraic expression so just add all the lengths together we'll do that X plus X plus 2 plus X plus 1 
,,now you can simplify like terms you can add X X X 3x 2 & 1 that's right the total perimeter of the above diagrams in the form of an algebraic expression so this is the perimeter of the write angular triangle and is the parameter for the equilateral triangle so add it together 3 E + 3 X + 3 multiplying an algebraic expression by 
,,a number so we'll see how we can multiply the algebraic expression by a number width of the rectangle is X this is the width and the length is 1 determine the perimeter of the rectangle x + y + X + 1 so you can write down 2 times X plus y of x + alright separately x + y X plus y when you simplify you get 2 x + 2 I now I want to 
,,just separate these two parts this part separately and this part separately what's the length of this part when you separate this what's the length of this one x + y you get the same length here X + 1 so double of this x + y so length of one part is X plus y length of 2 parts you multiply by 2 so 2 times X plus 1 but we took the same diagram finding perimeter fully and taking separately you have to get the same answer so in both methods the perimeter of the same figure is equal so we can write down 2 x + y is equal to two x plus 2y now look at this one when there's a number in front you are multiplying both these X terms by two so when X plus y is x to both the terms x + y x - so now we observe when there's a number in front of an algebraic expression you have to multiply all terms with that number a box contains 
,,a red glass balls and B blue glass balls determine the total number of glass balls in such high boxes number of total ass balls in a box was that a plus B number of 
,,total glass balls in five boxes you have to multiply 5 times a plus B then number of red colored balls in a box separately there are a red color glass balls so number of red color balls in a box is a number of red glass balls in five boxes that's five B multiplied by five if you take separately blue ones how many blue ones are there be blue ones for five boxes you get five be blue ones in five boxes so what can you say about this one the total the total is now we can write total is 5 a + 5 
,,B the answer received in either of the two methods should be equal so in this case five times a plus B is equal to 5 a plus 5b now look at this one when you multiply by the constant each term you get this one remove the brackets of the following algebraic expressions now we can use that knowledge you gain from the previous two questions there's a number in front this is a minus B is the algebraic expression so what you do multiply the first term as shown by the first arrow so this is the first arrow multiply this value here 3 times a 3 and then multiply the second term as shown by the second arrow I'll put numbers this is one red one pink one is 1 and 
,,the other color I'll take blue so this one multiply this one that's two three times minus B minus 3b now we'll follow that multiply and give me the answer this one with this you get 5x this one with this five times minus y minus five now try first this one seven times m 7m then this one seven times n plus seven ten times P 10 P 
,,plus 10 times Q 10 Q here the arrows are used to show the order to multiply so here always first one we can take first one and this is the SEC and why remove the brackets using arrows now now you can do that I mean there's a number in front of the algebraic expression you have to multiply all terms in the algebraic expression inside the bracket by the outside number yes with this this with this 3 into X 3 X 3 into 2 y + 6 1 now do this 1 7 into a 7 a 7 into minus 4 B that means minus 28 eleven times tu-22m 11 times n 11 4 times 3 P 4 times 3 12 P 4 times minus 2q so that's minus 8q this one 6 times X 6 X 6 times minus 11 by minus 66 1 8 times 3 24h 8 x k8 now look at this one you get three terms but same thing you have to multiply each and every term by the outside number this one three times five a 15 a three times to be six be three times c plus 3 C now do that four times X for X for x - y - y 4 times 7 that's + 28 8 times 2 16 a 8 times 7 56 be 8 times C that's 8 say look 
,,at this one 2 times X - x - x - 7 y minus 14y 2 times 3 z 6z 4 times P 4 P 4 times minus 3q - 12 Q 4 times 2r 8 11 times M 11 M 11 times 3 n 33 and 11 times 2 11 times 2 22 with l22 multiplying an algebraic expression by a negative number so now there's a negative number in front so we'll practice first with negative minus 3 times a minus 3 minus 3 times B minus 3 B negative into positive always you get a negative answer negative 5 times X negative 5x negative 5 into negative Y now negative into negative positive plus 5 minus 1 into 3 minus 3 minus 1 into minus 2 B plus 2 B minus into plus minus and here 5 times 2 10 2 times 2 4 that's plus because minus into minus plus and you get B here 2 times 7 here - into plus minus 14 C now you know how to multiply so plus into plus plus plus into minus minus minus into plus minus and minus into minus plus now we'll remove the brackets so you need to first multiply the first one when this number minus 3 a minus 3 times B minus 3b minus 
,,5 X and here so minus 5x minus 5 minus y you get plus 5i we did that minus 3 a and here minus 3 a you get here - nothing means 1 so this is like 1 minus 1 into 3 a minus 3 minus 1 into minus 2 B that's plus 2b this one this one minus 2 times 3 a what's the value minus 2 times 3a minus 6a this one - two - 2b plus 4b and here - two times seven you get minus 14c remove the brackets now so use arrows to multiply minus 3x minus - plus 6y this one when you multiply minus - plus 3 times 2 6 minus 
,,3 times minus 7 plus 20 months what this one you have to multiply all three terms minus 5 a minus - plus 5 times 4 20 get be your minus 5 times C minus 5 see this one multiply minus 8 times a minus 8 a - eight - seven be multiplication + 56 8 times 7 56 B question number 5 - 7 into minus X plus 7 X minus 7 into 2 y minus 14y - 7 into minus c plus 7z here minus 11 times 2 X minus 22 X minus 11 times -3 plus 33 yeah do all these multiplications try 4 times X 4 X 4 times minus 7y minus 28 y 4 
,,times 5 20 minus 3 times a minus 3 minus minus plus 21 B minus in 2 plus minus 24 6 here minus 11 times 2 minus 22 X here minus minus plus 11 times 3 plus 33 Y here 
,,you get minus 22 this one multiply minus 6 times 2 minus 12 minus 6 minus 7 plus 42 and minus 6 and minus 5 plus 13 this one minus 10 into minus 3 plus 30 minus 10 times chobe - 20 B and minus 10 times sake - 10 see what about this one - 4 times 3 H minus 12 which minus 4 times minus 4 plus 16 K minus 4 times minus 4 plus 60 now we're do multiplying an algebraic term by another algebraic term earlier we multiply by a constant now multiplying by an algebraic term 3x + 4 y how we multiply 3x 
,,times 4 1 so what we do we multiply that numbers first 3 times 4 12 and then x + y so without writing we can write without writing multiplication sign 12x what this 
,,one multiplication 7b into foil we can multiply separately the number 7 times 4 and then be a 7 times 4 28 be a it is better to write down then letters in order 28 a B but this is not wrong VA is okay but it's better it is good to write the letters in English at alphabetical order this 1 minus 3 by minus 5 X so we can multiply minus 3 and minus 5 first and then Y and X minus 3 times minus 5 plus 15 y X you can write 15 X Y to a times 7 B now we'll multiply at once 2 times 7 14 a into B a B 
,,you can write at once 3 X into 5 y 3 times 5 15 X into y X Y now there's a bracket minus sign minus 7 times 3 minus 21 a times B a B this one Phi times -3 minus 15 M times n m in here minus 4 times minus 3 plus 12 a and B you can write a B for x minus seven minus twenty eight Y into X Y X or what's the better one x1 multiplication of an algebraic expression by an algebraic term find the area of the following two rectangles separately so what's the area of the rectangle this one is length into breadth or length into width so area of the rectangle is any times X so what's that the X what's the area of the other rectangle length is B width or break is X B times X VX sum of areas you can just add it a X plus B X now when you combine the two rectangles now you are getting a big rectangle two rectangles are merged in the above diagram what's the length of this rectangle length is a here B here a plus B what's the area of the rectangle now length is a plus B and the with operate is 
,,X so X into a plus B as same rectangles are merged areas are equal now what's the area we got before a X plus B X so we can write a X plus B X is same as X into a plus B now sick how do you get this one so when you multiply the expression here can you see you get a X plus B X it is required to multiply all the terms inside brackets given by the outside term remove the brackets using arrows first one is this second one is this a 2 X a X a into - why - a why B into X BX be in 2 - 3 y - 3 B by C into a see a or a see C into 7 B 7 BC so here you can write AC as well is C + 7 BC when you remove brackets using an arrow first draw an arrow and write it then draw the next arrow and write it we'll do that separately X into a exhale Oh a X X into minus B minus BX X into 2 C 2 CX of XE y into p YP y into 2q minus 2 Q minus 2 y qi qi y into our are Y now try into p a p a into 3 q 3 a key a into for our for a 2 a into X 2x - 3 y that is -6 a why this 1 3 b into m 3b 3b into 4 12 B 5 a into 2 X 10 X 5 a into minus 3y minus 15 a why here - -5 a into z5 a 0 minus 3 into X minus 3 X minus into - now you get plus 6 a 1 plus 6 a expand brackets without using arrows no will do without arrows 3p into x 3p x 3p into minus 2 y minus 6 P for a into 2 where 8 a 4 into minus 3n minus 12 a in this one minus 4 into X minus 4 a X minus 4 times minus 3/12 a y minus 11 8 into 2 B minus 22 a be minus 11 a into minus 3 C you get plus 33 a see this one 7 a mintue l 7m n 7m into 428 look at this diagram area of the entire rectangle length is X with this a so what's the area a times X shaded area now can you see this square with length a a into a or we can write a square area of the unshaded part so you have to subtract total area that's a X minus the shaded area e squared sum of two algebraic expressions when you are adding you have to consider like terms so like terms only you can add or subtract when you consider these two terms what can you do you can add a terms with a 2a and 
,,3a you can add and then 3b and 5b separately so what do you get 5a + 5 + 3 8 at the time of addition or subtraction you have to add or subtract the like terms remove brackets and simplify taking like terms so first you have to multiply and then simplify here without arrows we'll do 2 times X 2 X 2 times y - 1 and then you have to add this 3x so I'd like terms 2x + 3 X you get 5x + 2 y right as it is here five times a five wave hi x minus B 5 B and plus seven B is there five way you can add 
,,separately yeah - five plus seven what's the value plus two so take the difference and put the sign of the bigger number plus two that's me here multiply by 4 8 X 4 
,,times y 4y now what are the like terms 8 XL minus 5x that's 3x plus 4 here you have to multiply both these terms here 3 times X 3 X 3 times y 3 by here 2 times X 2 X 2 times y 2 now add the like terms 3x + 2 X you get 5 X 3 y + 2 y you get high five do it separately 2 times a 2 a 2 times -3 b -6 b plus 5 times a highway by x - Oh Big Ten now I'd like terms - and five seven that's seven minus six and ten take the difference + OB this one seven times - 14 X 7 times y 7y this one three times X minus three x + -3 y add the like terms 14 -3 11 X 7 - 3 + 4 y this one 3 x - 6 a 3 times 5 15 b + 7 e + 10 B what are the like terms a terms 6 + 7:30 15 minus 10 plus 5 so 5 b minus 5 times 7 -35 a minus 5 times -3 plus 15 plus 40 a now like terms add 40 - 35 5 a + 15 subtraction of two algebraic expressions you have to do the same thing right the first algebraic expression in brackets right the second algebraic expression in another brackets remove both brackets and simplify three-year you nothing means just multiply by one yeah - is there so that means this is minus 1 multiplied by minus 1 minus 1 times a minus a minus 1 times minus 2 B you get plus 2 B now like terms added 3 and minus a 2 a 4 B plus 2 B you get 6 this one subtract this from this so that means you have to write this one first 12x plus 7 1 so here just multiply by one 12x plus 7 1 minus this means open brackets with minus 1 minus 1 times 7 minus 7x minus 1 times minus 2 plus 2 I like terms you get 12 minus 7 5 x 7 + 2 9 5 subtract 2x minus 3 from this so from means first this one so 6x + 7 when there's a minus sign change the sign minus 2x and minus minus becomes plus 3 like term 6 and minus 2 4 X 7 + 3 that's 10 subtract this value from this so first you write here so 3p plus 8q - open brackets with minus 1 - P last - q + + 7 3 
,,p + - b - p8 q + 2 Q thank you and our terms you get only this one so that's 7 simplify so that here multiply and first open brackets and then simplify 4 times a 4 4 times -3 minus 12 minus 2 times a minus 2 a minus 2 x - 7 + 14 now like terms that for a and minus 2 a 2 a minus 12 and plus 14 you get plus 2 open brackets first 5x - 5 minus 3 times X minus 3 X minus 3 and minus 2 you get 6 y 5x + 3 X 2 X - 5 I + + 6 Y you get Y this one has a minus 2 in front so when you are multiplying be careful - 2 times 3 - 6 Z minus 2 and minus plus plus times foil the Savoy here you get minus 8b add like terms minus 6a + 4 you get minus 2 a 4 B and minus a 2 B minus 4 B this one Phi P into 2 Q 10 PQ or QP 5 P into 4 20 P here - 3 P into Q minus 3 P Q minus 3 P into 2 minus 6 peace now these are two like terms 10 P Q minus 3 P Q you get 7 PQ 20 P minus 6 P you get plus 14 substituting the values in the edge break expression so now we will see how we can find out the expression with substituting values so what's the first one determine the value of 5 a plus 4 when a equals 3 so substitute a equals 3 there so what happens five times three plus four so 
,,what's five times three 15 15 plus four you get 19 look at this expression seven A plus 2 B now you get two letters so substitute these two values equals three and B equals three so 7 M plus 2 B is the expression so we'll substitute 7 times is 3 7 times 3 plus 2 times B equals 3 so 7 times 3 21 2 times 3 6 21 plus 6 27 look at this one now you get three unknown letters 5 a 2 B 7 C values are given a equals 5 B equals 3 and C equals -2 substitute 5 into a is 5 2 times 3 and say x minus 2 so 
,,minus 7 x minus 2 5 times 5 25 minus 2 times 3 minus 6 and here minus minus becomes positive seven times 2 plus 14 now simplify 25 minus 6 you get 19 19 plus 14 33 determine the value of the following expressions when x equals 2 and y equals minus 3 we substitute 8 times X is 2 y equals minus 3/8 times 2 16 5 times minus 3 minus 15 16 minus 15 you get 1 here 12 times 2 minus 3 times minus 3 12 times 2 24 minus into minus plus 2 so 3 times 3 9 9 plus 4 13 so you get 33 now look at this one so same values you have to plug what are the values x equals 2 and y equals -3 9 mean 2 2 plus XY means X into y so 2 into minus 3 y equals minus 3 9 times 2 18 minus 6 you get 12 2 times X X is 2 5 times minus 3 plus 11 2 times 2 4 minus 15 plus 11 so 4 minus 15 you get minus 11 minus 11 and plus 11 you get 0 this one 4 times X 
,,X is 2 2 times minus 3 plus 8 4 times 2 8 minus 6 plus 8 8 minus 6 2 2 plus 8 10 here X is 2 y is minus 3 plus 2 minus 7 times minus 3 2 times minus 3 minus 6 here plus 2 is they are already according to Bodnar's you have to multiply first minus into minus plus 21 minus 6 plus 2 minus 4 minus 4 plus 21 you get 17 determine the value of the following algebraic expressions when a equals 3 and B equals 5 so what you do first first we'll open brackets and then substitute 3 times 2 6 6 8 3 times 3 you get 9 so 9 B now substitute after you multiply now substitute the value 6 times 3 9 times 5 because B equals 5 and a equals 3 6 times 3 18 9 times 5 45 what's the addition 63 in this one you have given the same question we'll try in a different way earlier we multiplied and then simplify now we'll do we'll simplify inside brackets and then multiply by three so three is there two times a is 3 B equals 5 now simplify inside 3 times 2 6 3 times 5 15 3 times 6 plus 15 21 now multiply 3 and 21 3 times 1 3 3 times 2 6 so you are getting the same answer get the same as if simplify inside brackets or without removing bracket so you can do any method first you can multiply and simplify and then substitute or simplify inside the brackets and then multiply by the outside number remove the brackets and substitute the values so first remove the brackets 7 a plus 14 B substitute the values 7 times 3 plus 14 times 5 say 1 times 3 21 here 5 times 425 times 1 5 and 7 add it you get 91 
,,this one 4 times 3 12 a and 8 B substitute the values of 12 times 3 minus 8 times fun now simplify 12 times 3 36 8 times 5 40 36 minus 40 you get minus here 11 times 2 22 a plus 11b so 22 times a 3 because 566 plus 55 hundred twenty-one this one 9 times 3 27 a 9 x -2 18 B now multiply 27 times 3 and 18 times fun 3 times 7 21 two remaining 3 times 2 6 plus 2 81 minus 5 times 8 44 remaining so you get 90 81 minus 90 you get minus 9 determine the value when a equals 3 B equals -2 and C equals 
,,1 so just substitute the values 2 times 3 7 x minus 2 make sure you put brackets when you get negative numbers 3 times 1/6 minus minus plus 14 plus 3 so 6 plus 3 9 9 plus 14 23 this one 5 times 3/2 x minus 2 and 4 into 1 15 minus 4 plus 4 minus 4 plus 4 get canceled out you get 15 11 x equals 3 B equals -2 and C equals 1 according to what must do the multiplication first 11 times 3 33 minus 2 times minus 2 plus 4 and you get minus 3/4 minus 3/1 33 plus 130 in this one first simplify and then substitute values of the following algebraic expressions when a equals 5 because 3 and C equals -2 so you have given this expression so what you do first open brackets 2 where 2 B 3 B 3 C then what you do simplify the terms add the like terms to a you have to write as it is 2b and 3b becomes Phi B and 3c here now substitute the values equals 5 B equals 3 and C equals -2 2 times 5 10 5 times 3 15 minus 60 so but you get 10 minus 6 4 4 plus 15 19 this one first open brackets 3 a 3 times minus B minus 3 B 4 times B 4 B 4 times C minus 4 C here because there's a negative sign now I'd like terms 3-year you can't simplify minus 3 and plus 4 that's plus 1 B or B minus 4 C now substitute the values 3 a means multiplication 3 times a 3 times 5 B is 3 4 times minus 2 first multiplication according to but must 5 times 3 15 minus 4 minus 2 plus 8 so you get 8 plus 3 11 11 and 15 you get 26 this one first open brackets 3a plus 3b here to be and -2 C 5 C 5 a so each one you have to multiply by the outside number now like terms 3a and 5a 8 a 3 B and plus 2 B 5 B -2 C + + 5 C plus 3 C now multiply 8 times a what's the value for a a 5 3 minus 2 I'll write down here equals 5 B equals minus 3 B is 3 and C equals -2 C equals -2 so a is 5 B 3 C minus 2 8 times 5 14 15 here and -6 15 minus 6 you get 9 9 plus 40 49 this one 7 a 7 B minus 7 C and then plus 2a minus 2b minus 2 C when you multiply by 2 add like terms 7 + + 2 9 e 7 B and minus 2b + 5 b minus 7 and minus 2 minus 9 see now my tip life is five B's tricky and C is minus 2/9 times 5 45 five times three 15 and minus minus becomes plus nine times two eighteen now add all together 1018 one remaining five six seven so 78 is the answer this one you get fractions but same procedure just substitute the values for a eight over be sixteen over C so now substitute equals 2 so 4 over 2 8 / BBS for 16 over C C is 8 now you have to simplify first 4 divide by 2 you get 2 8 divided by 4 you get 2 16 divided by 8 you get 2 2 + 2 + 2 6 this one substitute the values a equals 2 2 divided by 2 B is 4 4 divided by 4 C equals 8 8 divided by 8 simplify division first 2 divided by 2 is 1 4 divided by 4 is 1 8 divided by 8 is 1 1 plus 1 plus 1 you get 3 this one substitute a B means a times B 2 times 4 plus BC means B times that's 4 times C means 8 minus C times a C is 8 and a equals to 8 32 16 so 32 minus 16 is 16 16 and 8 addition you get 24 now we will look at remove exercise complete the table given below algebraic expression is given unknown term of the algebraic expression coefficient of the unknown term terms of the algebraic expression and final column is mathematical operations in the order they appear in the algebraic expression so first of all what's the unknown letter X coefficient is the number in front of the letter that's three and these are called algebraic terms and what is the operation plus and multiplication is three times X now we look at the next one what's the letter here Y what's the coefficient of that term to what are the algebraic terms to Y and 4 and what's the operation first multiplication and then addition next one what's the algebraic letter B coefficient 4 and terms for P and minus hundred and the operation for times P that means multiply and then subtract this one P is the letter coefficient nothing means one terms PN minus 10 and what are the operations used 1 times P times and then - what's the later here in coefficient is + 3 terms 3 n n minus 7 and operation first multiply and then subtract question number two the length of a table is two meters more than its breadth write an algebraic expression for the length of the table by taking its breath as V when you take this table B is the bread length is 2 meters more than its brick so what's the expression B plus 2 back to write

,,the amount for all these items from 500 so that's the balance that now being received exercise 5.1 there are three members in a family the ages of the mother the father and the son are given in X Y Z respectively using this information construct algebraic expressions for the sum of their ages mother x your ages of the mother x father Y and son Z so that's the total bar to the sum of the ages after five years so we have to add five for each one 5 Plus 5 Plus 5 15 so X plus y plus Z that's 50 part 3 the difference between the ages of the father and the son father is y and son is Z the Y minus C and the sum of the ages of the mother and the father when the son was born so when the Sun was born means now Z years before C years before means we have to subtract C from X as well as Y so X mother's age now see as before you have to subtract see what's father's age then Y and subtract C and when you simplify that you get X plus y minus C minus C means 1 and 1 minus 2z question number 
,,2 the price of a newspaper was P rupees if the price increased by Phi rupees construct algebraic expressions for the new price of the newspaper earlier be now increased by five P plus five second part the price of two newspapers after the increase in price so what's the value after increase P plus five and for two newspapers you have to multiply by two so we'll simplify this 2 times P this is same as 2 P plus five you can expand and simplify 2 P plus J part 3 the profit gain from a newspaper with the new price so what's the selling price the new price is this 2 P plus 10 and what's the cost cost price is Q rupees so you have to subtract Q them part for the profit gate from 10 copies if our rupees is spent for the distribution of each copy in addition to the printing cost now you have to find out the profit gain from 10 copies now we'll find out for one copy this is the profit and this one is the profit you have to subtract Q from the new price that's the profit for one newspaper now we have to consider 10 newspapers 10 newspapers is this much and then you have to subtract R is this spent for the distribution of each copy so to distribute 10 copies that's 10 are V liters of what is stored in a tank peel it is a water flows out and Q liters of water flows into the tank for our so we'll just mark it so this is the tank think about this is the tank V is there P liters of water flows out P liters flows out and quli it as a water flows into so inside that's cuba per 
,,our construct an algebraic expression for the volume of water in the tank after three hours so this is for one number what's the amount of water amount of water is equal to so here V is already there and you are adding Q amount of water per hour and removing P amount of water from the tank so this is the amount of water in one other so what's the amount of water in three hours so here V is a fixed value Sophie is already there so in three hours you are adding 3q and removing three feet this is for one Nava and this is for three hours so the answer is V Plus 3 Q minus 3p liters question number 4 there are 700 seats in an auditorium X number of first-class tickets which are thousand so we'll write down all together 700 X number of first-class tickets each thousand rupees why number of second class tickets which are 
,,500 each and Z number of third class tickets which are 300 inch were used issued for a drama construct algebraic expressions for the total number of tickets issued first was the total number of tickets X tickets here Y here and Z number of tickets that's X plus y plus C the number of seats which are not occupied all together 700 seats are there when you subtract X plus y plus C you get the seats that are not occupied third one the income from the show tickets X tickets first class so you get thousand X from that Y tickets second class with 500 rupees 500 y and C number of tickets third class 300 Z that's the income and fourth part the remaining amount 
,,"when half the income generated from the issue tickets and 100,000 is paid to the producer of the drama okay so here this is the income from their tickets the remaining amount when half the income generated half the income generated is you have to divide this by two so half the income is what half of that so thousand divided by I'll write down first thousand X plus 500 y plus 300 Z divided by 2 half of it so what's that 500 X 500 divided by 2 255 and 150 Z that's the half of the income half "
,,"of the income generated from the issued tickets and 100,000 is paid to the producer of the drum so the half the amount is this much 100,000 rupees also he needs to pay to the producer so what's the remaining amount you can't write remaining amount please so when it comes to half given means half remaining so this much of money is there and you have to subtract 100 100,000 rupees from that example number one simplify so there's a constant term in front so you have to multiply so without arrows we'll try 2 times a 2 a 2 times B 2 B 3 times 3 X 9 X 3 times y 3 y 3 times 4 12 X 3 times 7 minus 7 minus 21 8 times 8 64 y 8 times 7 56 X + 8 x q8q exercise five-point to fill in the blanks so expand brackets multiplied with the in front of number inside all the terms 2 times X 2 X 2 times 7 14 5 times 6 31 5 times a by this 8 times 4 32 given 8 x - y - 8 y this one 6 times X 6 6 and the other one is - 6 y 3 times X 3 X this is done and 3 times Z 3 Z + 3 x - 5 - 50 question number 2 simplify 5 times a 5 a pi times 4 27 times X 7 X 7 times 5 35 6 x - 12 X 6 times 4 2004 times 4 16 say 4 times 7 28 pi times y 5 by minus 5 times 2 check 3 times 3 9 minus 3x 2 times M 2 m 2 times n - n - x - 4 p 4 times X 4 times y 28 2 times X 2 X 2 x - 4 y -2 cuba question number 3 the daily wages of a person is extra piece and overtime payment for an hour is y rupees if he did 2 hours of overtime on each of the 5 days he worked write an algebraic expression for his salary for the 5 days with overtime payments okay read it carefully and try to get it the daily wages of a person is X over time payment for an hour is y if he did 2 hours of overtime work on each of the five days he worked every day two of us extra write an algebraic expression for his salary for the 5 days with overtime payment so what's the five day salary normal salary is X daily that means 5 days 5 X plus overtime payment every day Y rupees for one hour 2 hours daily so 2y 5 days 2 y times 5 that's 10 Y bar "
,,to do to the loan he has taken 150 is deducted from his daily wages construct an algebraic expression for the emoti receives in hand for the five days and simplified so what's the amount a floor for five days everyday 150 rupees so five days 150 times fun what's that pi times 0 25 750 rupees so when you deduct that amount what's the amount received in head ammount in hand this is the total income 5x plus 10y and he needs to pay a 750 for the Lord so this is the amounting hat a teacher bought three gift passes for three students who came first in the third term test each parcel contained five books two pens write an algebraic expression for the price of one such parcel by taking the price of a book is a rupees and the price of the pen is B rupees so what's the price of one parcel one book is a rupees so five books 
,,are there five e one pen is B rupees two pens are there are two part to write the total price of all three gift parcels as an algebraic expression and simplify it so for three parcels you have to multiply this by three now simplify x 3 3 times 5 15 and 3 times 2 6 so this is the amount for three parcels question number five on a packet of tea the mass of the tea is mentioned as P grams and the mass of the packet as cue grams obtain an algebraic expression for the mass of 20 such packets and simplified so what's the total mass for one packet total mass is P grams for T and Q for the packet that's the total mass for one packet so 20 packets are there so 
,,for 20 packets you have to multiply this by 20 so when you simplify you get 20 P plus 20 Q part to the above 20 packets are packed in a box which is of mass tigran's so 20 such packets so this one full set in a box obtain an algebraic expression for 12 such boxes and simplified okay if if you take one box what's the mass of one 
,,box this value and there's extra t grams for the box that's for one box there are twelve such boxes so for twelve boxes you have to multiply this by twelve x - 2 x - 4 - x so 240p x 2 same thing 240 q + 12 example number two simplify now you get negative numbers in front so negative 2 times a negative 2 a negative two x plus 6 negative 12 here minus 5 times 6 minus 30 minus into minus plus you get 5x this one nothing they are means this is just like 1 minus x 2 where minus 2m minus into minus plus 3 this one minus 4 times 2 minus 8x minus 4 times 3 minus 12 1 minus 4 times minus 2 plus 8 see exercise 5.3 simplify minus 3 times X minus 3 X minus 15 minus 4 X minus two x plus 1 minus 2 minus 8 minus 2 X minus 6 EI minus into minus plus 36 yes this is like 1 minus X minus 5 this is also like 1 here minus 1 into X minus X minus into minus plus so plus this 1 minus 2 times 8 minus 16 minus 2 times X minus 2 X minus 2 y 6 times 3 18 but this is minus minus 6 times minus 2 plus 12 and then minus 18 again here 1 is there - into a - C - into - c-plus see here you get 3 X minus 3 times 6 minus 18 minus into minus plus 3 times 2 6 minus 3 x + 3 B you get minus 9b first one done - 3 X and here - 3 times 4 minus 12 minus 3x is there minus into minus plus 12 here - 2 y is there - 2 times 2 minus 4 and this one -

,,by a number each term of the algebraic expression needs to be multiplied by the number that is the coefficient of each algebraic term should be multiplied by the given number and simplify so make sure that you multiply by the coefficient when multiplying an algebraic term by an algebraic term there our coefficients are much like first and then the unknowns are multiplied when multiplying an algebraic expression by an algebraic term every algebraic term of the algebraic expression needs to be multiplied by the given algebraic term by substituting values for the unknown terms of an algebraic expression we obtain a numerical value for the algebraic expression so when you are simplifying either you can simplify brackets first and then multiply or expand brackets and then substitute the values so practice all these questions examples and exercise and thorough with algebraic expressions

Number Partens,XxPw1uieViU,hello grade 8 children today I'm here to teach you a geometry lesson with you that's chapter 2 perimeter so what is perimeter so we'll take figures like this what's 
,,this one a triangle circle a square so these are called closed plane figures when you take one place you can go round and come to the same position in this one also 
,,you can start from any place and come to the same position so we call these a plane closed figures or closed plane figures then what about these figures these are open plane figures so we are finding perimeter perimeter of closed plane figures so what is perimeter means the outer distance of a closed plane figure so when you start from here any place you can come to the same position here so you take the total distance so we'll see what are the properties in perimeter and we'll take several plane figures in this lesson so perimeter is the total length of the boundary of a closed rectilinear plane figure is called the perimeter of the figure units of perimeter what are the units so this is about a length so we use measurements as length so what are the measurements we use for length millimeter centimeter meter and 
,,kilometer so what's the relationship between these measurements so you know when you take the small ruler so one centimeter is equal to ten millimeters and when you 
,,take the meter ruler you can divide into hundred parts that means 100 centimeter is 1 meter then if you take kilometers that's thousand meters is equal to one kilometer now select the appropriate units according to the size of the figure so if you want to measure a smaller length you take some times millimeter centimeters a bigger length meters so when you take distance of a rod or something bigger ones we use kilometres so you need to know which one to choose now what's the shape a square 
,,square means all sides are equal and this is four-sided figure each angle is 90 degrees so if you want to find out the perimeter of this figure so we start from one 
,,place go round and come to the same posture so what's the perimeter of this square if the length of one side is L so it's easy we take letters for words like length 
,,we can take L letter perimeter we can take peel it so if one side is L so starting from here L plus L plus L plus L so these are like terms you can add L for times when you are adding you get full L so what's the perimeter of the square if you know one side is L for L so we can use this formula to find out the perimeter of a square we'll use that one in this question find the perimeter of a square with length 12 now we know L is 12 we need to find out P P stands for perimeter so we can use 
,,the formula for L that means 4 times L L is 12 4 times 12 you get 48 what's the unit that's centi meters look at the second question find the perimeter of a square plot of land where one side is 20 meters now L is 20 at least 20 P we need to find so you can use the formula for L 4 times 20 that's 80 what's the unit meter so we can put 80 meters this one find the perimeter of a square board with side lengths to 0.3 meters so L is 2.3 PE we need to find use the formula for L 4 times 2.3 how we multiply 4 times 3 12 one remaining and 4 times 2 8 + 1 9 that's in meters so nine point two meters the perimeter of a square shape land is 48 meters find the length of one side now the other way around giver so perimeter is given P is given 48 and you're asked to find out L so we can find length of one side that's L is the total perimeter is 48 how you find one side you have to divide by four because P equals four L if you want to find L you divide by four to get n so P divided by four 48 divided by 4 you get the length of one side four times 1/4 and here to 12 meters the perimeter of a square cardboard is 88.8 centimeters find the length of one side again how you find out length of one side I can write L equals P over 4 P is given 88.8 centimeters and you need to find out so P is 88.8 divided by 4 so you get twenty two point two centimeters for length off one side look at this one find the length of one side of a square where the perimeter is 64 point four same thing P is given 64 point four and you are asked to find out the lid so a length of one side is P 64 point four divided by four have you divide four times one for two remaining four twenty four that's four times six twenty four and four times 1/4 so you get this is in sin T meters now what's this shape this is called a rectangle so pair of opposite sides are equal so we called the longer length longer side we called along the side as left shorter man as brick so L stands for length and B stands for bread or sometimes we call wick so how we find out the perimeter of a rectangle now starting from this place L plus B plus L plus B L plus B plus L plus B you can add like terms too well plus 2b now we see that two is common so you can take it out and inside I can write L plus B so I can explain this one as if you separate these 
,,two lengths what you get yeah I want to find out the length of this part that's L plus V I get two parts like that so L plus B here and L plus B this side so twice of that twice of L plus B so you can use this formula to find out the perimeter of a rectangle look at this one find the perimeter of a rectangular plot of 18 meters 
,,long and 14 meters wide so that means L is 18 B is 14 and you're asked to find the perimeter so what's the formula two times L plus B substitute L is 18 B is 42 times at these 2 8 plus 4 12 and 32 when you multiply you get 64 meters find the perimeter of the rectangle which is 24 meters long and 18 meters wide 24 is L breakfast 
,,18 and perimeter you need to find you can use the formula now substitute 24 plus 18 add these 2 8 plus 4 12 1 remaining 3 plus 1 4 2 times 42 84 but the unit meters 
,,look at this one find the perimeter of the rectangle with the length of 12 point 7 at least 12 point 7 and a width of 9.2 so what's the formula 2 L plus b2 times L twelve point seven and nine point two just add the decimal values it's easy to write in a column and add 7 plus 2 9 9 plus 2 11 so twenty one point nine so two times 
,,twenty one point nine have you multiplied ignore the decimal and first x - 2 times 9 18 one remaining 2 times 1/2 plus 1/3 2 times 2 4 then one decimal place you have to keep so I can keep here so forty three point eight meters a rectangular flowerbed is 7.2 meters long and three point four meters wide find the parameter L is the longer side seven point two why breath with me the width three point four P is the parameter we need to find so what's the formula two times length plus breadth two times here seven point two plus three point four add it together seven point two and three point four when you add it you get ten point six ten point six times two here brackets means multiplication two times six twelve one remaining so here two times one two so put a decimal point here and you are getting twenty one point two meters as the perimeter of this rectangular flowerbed the length of a rectangular piece of land is three times its width so if it's X this should be 3x find its length and breadth if the perimeter is 88 so what we can write in this 3x B is X so we need to find out the perimeter so use the formula P equals 2 times L plus B so parameter is given 88 so I can write this is 88 so here I can substitute 88 here so 2 times L is 3 X I break this X now like terms add 2 times 3 X plus X is 4 X is 88 
,,4 times 2 8 8 X equals 88 how can we find out X you divide by 8 so X is equal to 88 divided by 8 that's in a van meters so X is 11 meter so you ask to find its length and brick so what's length length is 3 X that means 3 times 11 33 what's the breath breath is equal to X that's 11 meters the length of a rectangular piece of land is 4 times its width find its length and breadth if the perimeter is 400 meters now if breadth is X this is 4 times that means 4x what's the perimeter 400 that's given so now you can use the form in a perimeter is equal to 2 times L plus B here this side we can write because this is the unknown side X we need to find 2 times 4 
,,"X plus X is 400 for X and X you get 5 X 2 times 5x 402 times 5 is 10 X is 400 divided by 10 you can get X so x equals 40 now X is 40 means what's the length length is 4 X that means 4 times 40 that's 160 centimeters no 160 meters breath is X that's 40 meters look at this one how many square float eyes with a side length 40 centimeters are required to fit a rectangular flow that is 12 meters and 6 meters what now we'll look at the length side what's the length 12 meters now the length of one side of a tile is given in centimeters so this is in meters so what's the first thing you can convert to the same unit we'll convert meters to centimeters length is 12 meters convert to centimeters there you need to multiply by 100 100 times 12 1,200 centimeters the number of floor tiles required for the length side if you keep tires this way only lengths side how many tiles we need the length of a tile is 40 centimeters so we need to divide by 40 take the length in centimeters divided by "
,,one side of the tire for you get thirty tiles along this side you need what about with now now you need to fit this way the width is 6 meters convert to centimeters 
,,this is 600 multiplied by hundred now how many tiles along the width you need 600 divided by 40 40 is the length of one tire you get 60 divided by 4 is 15 tiles we need this way so this way we need 15 tiles now what's the total number of tiles you need you need here this side 30 this side 15 30 times 15 so multiply by 3 putting 
,,0 3 times 5 15 3 times 1/3 plus 1/4 all together 450 tiles you need now this is one method of finding number of tiles but you can use another method what's the second method by finding the area of a tile so you can find the area of the flow and area of fun tile and divide now in this case you can use this but if it's a circular 
,,tile or something you can't use the area method because that's not fitting exactly with the flow you get gaps there so make sure that this way is easy to do for any 
,,type of tile this one how many square flow tiles with a side length 20 are required to fit a rectangular flow that is 10 meters long and 4 meters wide similar question so what's the length they are 10 meters convert to centimeters because the tie length is in centimeters so multiply by 100 you get thousand centimeters so what's 
,,the number of ties required for the length side you take the limp divided by length off one tile that's 20 you get 50 tiles you need what's the width 4 meters convert to centimeters that's 400 centimeters so how many tiles required for which side take the length divided by length of one tile that's 400 so you get 20 tiles you need so this way length side how many tiles 50 tiles and here 20 tiles so altogether you need fifty times twenty so thousand tiles you need for this flow this question find the breadth of the rectangle if the perimeter is 120 and the length is 36 and you need to be what's the formula perimeter of a rectangle tone times L plus B is equal to P now substitute to 36 plus B we need to find out B P is hundred 20 so divide the whole equation by 2 you get 36 plus B is equal to 120 divided by 2 you get 60 now how you find B subtract 36 from both sides so subtract 36 60 minus 36 so what's 60 minus 36 4 and your 4 5 6 24 is the answer what's the answer with units 24 meters so that's the breadth of this rectangle look at this question if the perimeter of a rectangle with a length 48 meters is hundred forty meters find its width so length is 48 perimeter is 140 you are asked to find B so you know the formula 2 into L plus B is P now substitute to 48 is L plus B is equal 240 divide the whole equation by 2 to get cancel out you get 48 plus B equals 70 140 divided by 2 now how we find B subtract 40 8 from both sides so subtraction means you subtract 48 here so 70-48 you get 22 the unit is meters so 22 meters for breath this question find the length of a rectangular board with width of 22 now with this given 22 and the perimeter is 140 you asked to find it let's now use the formula here 140 this is 2 times L is unknown B is 22 divide the whole equation by 2 to get cancel out you 
,,get L plus 22 is equal to 70 now take away 22 from both sides l equals 70 minus 22 that's 48 48 meters is the answer for length you can write here also 48 this question a rectangular frame of Y is formed by a square as shown above find it's one side length so rectangular frame this one you can create a square from this so you asked to find out the length of one side of this square so X is the length now we need to find out the perimeter because this is a wire around this rectangle so what's the perimeter of the rectangle you can find out using the formula so we know length is 48 breadth is 12 so substitute 2 times 48 plus 12 2 times 60 so 120 is the perimeter of the rectangle so that is equal to the perimeter of the square as well so length of one side is perimeter divided by 4 because all the inside the equal 4x 
,,is the perimeter of this square so divide by 4 you and find length of one side X that's thirty hundred twenty divided by four that's thirty what's the unit centimetres equilateral triangles so we did perimeter of a square perimeter of a rectangle now this is equilateral triangle what is equilateral means all sides are equal if this is a this is also a this is also a and what's the other property in equilateral triangle each angle is 60 degrees now we will find out the perimeter of this equilateral triangle start from one place go around a plus a plus a so what's that like terms Eddie sure you get three a so what's the perimeter of an equilateral triangle you can take one side and multiply by three find the length of one side of the triangle by dividing the perimeter of an equilateral triangle by three you can get 
,,one side so a equals P divided by three look at the question here this is an equilateral triangle with length eight centimeters so you asked to find the perimeter so what's the perimeter you can use the formula 3 L 3 times 8 that's 24 centimeters this question find the perimeter of an equilateral triangle which is 11 meters in length three-year is the formula L means given 11 so 3 times 11 that's 33 meters find the perimeter of an equilateral triangle which is eleven point three centimeter 
,,in length so this is an equilateral triangle you can use P equals three times L three times eleven point three three times 3 9 3 times 1/3 3 times 1/3 that's in centimeters find the length of one side of an equilateral triangle where its perimeters 30.6 now other vira so what you have to do you have to divide by three so P is given so how do you find L P divided by 3 so substitute 30 point six divided by three one zero two so ten point two centimeters is the length of one side of an equilateral triangle find the length of one side of an equilateral triangle where its perimeter is forty eight point nine so perimeter is given 48 point now that's three L 
,,so three l equals P forty eight point nine is three L how can we find out L divide this by three so you get L equals divided by this tree if you can't divide like this you can take separately and divide three times 1/3 18 that's six nine so here you have to keep the decimal place first and 4/9 that's 3 3 times 3 9 0 so 16.3 so length of one side is sixteen point three centimeters now this is any triangle so what you call this scalene all sides are different means scalene triangle what's the other type of triangle isosceles also the isosceles means two sides are equal so this is scaling one side is a the other side is B and the other one is C so how we 
,,find out the perimeter of the scalene triangle just add the three lengths a plus B plus C now we'll take this example a scalene triangle is given and you asked to find the perimeter so just add 9 plus 12 plus 7 9 plus 2 11 11 plus 7 18 and with this 2 that's 28 centimeters is the perimeter of this scalene triangle find the perimeter of the triangle whose sides are 12 10 and 9 so perimeter is just a plus B plus C adding all three lengths 12 plus 10 plus 9 what's the answer 11 and one two three so 31 centimeters find the perimeter of the triangle in which the sides are 20 point three eighteen point four and sixteen point seven so how do you find out the 
,,perimeter just add the three values if you can't add it it's better to write in a column and at say 1 + 3 10 14 1 remaining 8 + 6 14 + 1 51 remaining 3 4 5 so fifty 
,,five point four fifty five point four centimeters is the perimeter of this scaling triangle this one parameter is given that's 90 you are asked to find out one leg we can find these two 30 plus 27 is 57 now 57 plus x equals 90 I'll write x plus 57 is 90 because the perimeter is given as 90 so X is take 57 away that means subtract 57 from both sides 90 minus 57 so you get three one remaining six and here 333 centimeters is the x value what is this triangle I told you two sides are equal isosceles triangle perimeter of the triangle below is 34 centimeters find X so make a formula X plus X plus 10 that's the total distance in this triangle that's called perimeter that's equal to 34 X onyx becomes 2x now subtract 10 from both sides 2x equals 34 minus 10 when you subtract you get 24 is 2 X divided by 2 both sides X is 
,,equal to 12 so length of X is 12 centimeters if the perimeter of the triangle below is 45 centimeters fine lengths of each side of the triangle 3 X 2 X 4 X what's the ID sure that's the perimeter that's 45 like terms at 4 plus 2 6 +3 9 X equals 45 divided by 9 you can find out X so X is equal to 5 if x equals 5 what's this one so we'll take this one as so ABC triangle so a B is 3 X B C is 4 X and C a 2 X so a B is 3 times X X is 5 that's 15 centimeters BC 4 X 4 times 5 thats 20 centimeters 
,,and this one is C a 2 X 2 times 5 10 centimeters find the perimeter of the quadrilateral below this is quadrilateral means four-sided plane figure so how do you find out the perimeter when you start from one point you can go around and take the total distance that's called the perimeter so we can find out just adding all these numbers 8 plus 7 plus 9 plus 11 11 plus 9 20 28 plus 7 you get 35 centimeters this is also a quadrilateral what you call that trapezium if the these two lines are parallel we call that's a trapezium find the perimeter of the trapezium below yeah these lengths are equal if this is 8 this is also 8 this is also 8 we'll just add all the lengths 8 plus 8 plus 8 plus 12 12 plus 8 20 20 plus 16 36 centimeter is the unit this one similar to that one this is X X X find the value of x if the perimeter of the trapezium is 53 so we can write down X plus X plus X 3 X 3 X is equal to what 3 X plus 20 all right down 3x plus 20 is the perimeter now perimeter is given 
,,as 53 so what can you do subtract 20 from both sides you get 3x so 53 minus 20 you get 33 so 3x is equal to 33 have you find X you divided by 3x is equal to 11 so what's the unit centi meters look at this question a hundred and twenty centimeter long wire was cut into two equal pieces and she arc between our cheese and sujud from there argit made an equilateral triangle and Sujit made a square find the side length of the collateral triangle and the side length of the square so what's the total length of the wire 120 so what is one piece it's equally divided into two parts so 120 divided by 2 is 1 5 thats 20 centimeters so our jig has 16 120 divided by 
,,2 that 60 centimeters so a jet has 60 centimeters and Sujit also has 60 centimeter wire so how you find out one side of the equilateral triangle we know all sides are equal you know the perimeter 60 divided by 3 you get one side of the equilateral triangle that's 20 centimeters how can we find out the length of one side of a square square you get both sides equal sides so you have to divide by four so 60 divided by four you get 15 centimeter is the length of one side of a square now we will look at perimeter of composite closed rectilinear plain figures so combination of two or more figures what are the figures we did we did square rectangle triangle equilateral scalene to find out the perimeter now we look at this one two squares with side lengths eight combined and make a rectangle shown below fine its perimeter now if you take these two separately what's the parameter perimeter this one is one side is 8 so 40 times 8 here also 4 times 8 so 4 times 8 plus 4 times 8 so 32 plus 32 64 centimeters you are getting if you take separately these two squares when combining squares one side or laps with another side what happens this side and this side or laps and it's the inside length of the rectangle now if you want the perimeter of the new figure you can't take this net so outer length means this one so when combining squares one side overlap with another side so what's the perimeter of the rectangle how many eighths are there now one two three four five six now earlier eight now two sides overlapped and it's in the tangle so you can't take those two sites so we can check it so we'll see how many eighths are there 1 2 3 4 5 6 
,,so 8 times 6 48 centimeters so that combined figure has 48 centimeter as the perimeter of that rectangle find the perimeter of joint site formed by joining three squares that are 8 centimeters in length all sides are 8 centimeters now this is the combined figure there are 4 sides in one square we know that there are 4 sides total number of sites for three squares 4 times 3 that's 12 12 sides are there number of joint sides touching each other now if you take this one that's this one 1 and here half here half here another one so 2 this one 3 4 this square and this side 4 so 4 let's overlap and these are inside the figure so you can't take four lengths number of joint sides touching each other is for now so perimeter of the composite figure now how many sides all together earlier 12 sides four sides inside now 12 minus 4 8 8 times 8 but we'll check that out with finding lengths outside starting from one place how many eighths are there 1 2 three four five six seven and this half and this half eight so we can say eight times eight 64 centimeters is the perimeter of the combined figure shown in the figure are two identical cards of six centimeters length and three centimeter with they combined and formed a large rectangle find the perimeter of the rectangle so this is the combined figure the two sides shown by the dotted lines are located inside the image so here this side overlaps with this one now find the perimeter so we'll take outer length of this one so how many threes are there 1 2 3 times 2 how many Sixers are there 1 2 3 4 6 times 4 3 times 2 6 6 times 4 24 24 plus 6 30 centimeters is the perimeter of this combined frikkin find the perimeter of the figure below 2 sides of the 3 centimeter are located inside the figure yeah this one is overlap so we can't take that length so how we find out the perimeter so we'll take outer length how many threes are there 1 2 3 4 3 times 4 how many 6 is 1 2 3 six times three now add it 3 times 4 12 6 times 3 18 you get 30 30 centimeter is the perimeter of the combined shape find the perimeter of the figure below it's given one and a half and one and a half is three so we'll start from this point how many sixes are there 1 2 3 6 times 3 how many threes are there 1 2 3 and these two another one for 3 times 4 so 6 times 3 18 3 times 4 12 when you add it together you get 30 centimeters as the perimeter of the combined figure so I can highlight this is one and a half and be a happy took as one unit that's 3 centimeter unit find the perimeter of the figures which is aligned with the square and rectangle shown below this is a square with length 4 rectangle length 8 and breadth 4 centimeters so they combine and you can't take the inside length for pairing it only outside boundary so we'll take how many sides are 4 yeah 4 1 2 3 & 4 so 4 times 4 and what about 8 1 2 8 times 2 so 4 times 4 16 8 times 2 16 you get 32 centimeters further perimeter of the combined figure look at this combined figure two sides four centimeter are located inside the figure so this side overlaps so that's inside we can't take it now we'll find out the perimeter of this figure we'll start four centimeter sides one two three four five and we'll take these two separately so four times four then eight one only one so 8 times 1 + 2 x2 + 2 you can write 2 times 2 now add it all sides are taken 2018 - 1 8 + 4 so you get 32 centimeter as the perimeter of the combined figure this one here 2 sides 4 centimeter long I located inside this one you can take it now take the outer length 4 centimeter ones 4 1 2 3 4 5 6 6 times 4 and 1 8 centimeter long length times 1/6 times 4 24 + 8 you get 32 centimeters as the perimeter of the combined figure find the perimeter of the joint triangle and the rectangle shown below so these two sides over laughs and this is inside so you can't take that length so we'll check out a length 1 2 3 3 times 4 centimeter length and 8 1 to 2 times 8 4 times 3 12 and 16 you get 28 centimeter as a parameter of the combined figure this one find the perimeter of the figure formed by combining four triangles of sight four centimeters to a 
,,square so you can't take these four sides that's inside so we check outside length all lengths are 4 centimeter so we'll count how many fours are there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 4 times 8 32 so the perimeter is 32 centimeters this one find the perimeter of the combined figure you can't take this one that's inside how many 12 are there 1 + 2 + 3 3 times 2 then how many Force 1 to 4 times then what is this slap now look at carefully this total length is 12 and this height is 4 so what's this length 12 
,,minus 4 12 minus 4 is 8 you get 8 centimeter length for this one so you need to add that length here now we took all sides did we take all sides no yeah we missed one length 1/2 yeah this is 3 so we'll multiply 4 times 3 here now it's correct so 3 times 12 36 4 times 3 12 and 8 and 12 plus 8 20 and this is 56 centimeters this one to trapeziums together find the perimeter so don't take inside land only outside length you have to take 4 perimeter so how many 6 centimeter legs are there 1 2 3 
,,4 4 times 6 how many 10 legs are there 10 centimeter length 1 2 so 6 times 4 24 plus 20 you get 44 centimeters using square and triangle the following figure is formed find the perimeter so this is the combined one so don't take the inside let so how we find out the perimeter how many fours are there 1 two three four four four and then five point six is this set four times four 16 plus five point six and it together you get point 6 and 6 plus 5 6 plus 5 11 and so twenty one point six centimeters now two rectangles and one square perimeter of the rectangle so this is length is 8 and breadth is 4 so 2 times 8 plus 4 2 times 12 24 perimeter of the square 
,,4 times 4 16 centimeters now we'll see find the perimeter of the combined figure back now combine all three shapes so you are not getting these two inside lens now so how we find out the perimeter you can find out how many fours are there 1 2 three oh five six seven eight eight four and how many eighths are there one to two times eight now add it together eight times for 32 and 16 you get 48 centimeters so 48 centimeter is the perimeter this one again same length a 10-4 so this is 8 and this is 4 now in this one we can't take this part this part the inside let's we'll find out outside length how many fours are there one two three four five six seven eight eight fours how many eighths are there one and two now we can add it two times eight 32 and 16 48 centimeter this is the perimeter of this combined figure perimeter of the rectangle here 8 is length and breadth is 3 so what's the perimeter 2 times L plus B 2 times 8 plus 3 11 so 22 centimeters is the perimeter of this rectangle de la Vega is formed using three rectangles above so same rectangles before now when you combine all together you get inside length so you can't take these ones 
,,so what's the outer length outer length will count how many threes the breadth is 3 centimeters 1 2 3 4 4 times 3 how many eighths 1 2 2 times 8 now how we find out 
,,this length total length is 8 and this is 3 8 minus 3 this is 5 and here also so 5 & 5 that's twice then we missed one length here these two get one and another two 
,,eights so altogether four so I'll erase this one and write for this one should be 4 4 times 8 4 times 3 12 32 and 10 you get 4 here and 554 centimeters is the perimeter of this combined figure what is this shape one two three four five six six sided plane figure hexagon so find the perimeter one side of this figure is four so parameter is full into 6 because 6 sides are there 24 centimeters now look at the perimeter of the combined figure so combining three hexagons but nothing happens nothing overlap so you can take 24 times 3 so 24 times 3 is the perimeter of this combined one so just attached from here only so not overlapping sides so 3 times 4 12 1 remaining 3 times 2 6 plus 1 7 so 72 centimeter is the perimeter of this combined figure now in this one how many sides come by here two sides one from this one and one from another to another to another to another - so how many sides overlap 2 4 6 8 10 sides overlap earlier how many sides were there 6 times 3 6 times 3 hexagons 6 times 3 80 now 4 if you take separately 6 times for 24 and 10 sides overlap actually you are getting 14 sites we'll check that out so it's better to always take 
,,outer lengths now we will see how many fours are there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 so 14 sides are correct so either you can use this method or this method but 
,,I think better to take outer length and find the perimeter four times for 16 and 4 times 1/4 plus 156 centimeter is their combined parameter find the perimeter here 
,,so what are the lengths given here if you take this one fourteen point one four fourteen point one four so fourteen point one four times two then what are the other 
,,lengths twenty another twenty twenty times two and here are ten and ten totus now don't take these two inside lengths you can't take four perimeter now multiply 2 times 4 8 2 times 1/2 again 8 and 2 20 times 2 42 times 10 20 so when you add it together you get fine to wait there and 8 4 plus 2 6 6 plus 2 8 so 88.2 8 centimeters 
,,look at this one now you get a circle part as well find the length of the circle if the perimeter is 40 now we know that perimeter is 50 centimeters given length of 
,,two lines 14 and 14 14 times 2 that 28 centimeters now how can we find out the circle length length of this pot we call that an arc arc length length of the circle is 50 minus 28 so here I'll write 28 here so this one is length of the circle is 50 minus 28 that's 22 centimeters now look at this one as shown in the figure above the boundary of 400 meter long flow path find the length of the two circles so the whole thing is 400 meters so this is 90 meters this is 90 meters so what's the perimeter given 400 meters so length of both sidelines this line is 90 this is also 92 times 90 that's 180 meters so length of the circular area so this one and this becomes the perimeter - the two lengths so perimeter is 400 - 180 you get 220 meters is the length of circular paths this one and this one so that's the length we are not taking these two this one the perimeter of the given figure is 70 point 4 find the length of a smaller semicircle we are lengths of bigger circle which is thirty 
,,point two so this part is thirty point two centimeters given we are asked to find the smaller one so this one is same as this one because this side is equal to this 
,,one so what's the perimeter given 70 point four and what's the length of large semicircle 30 point two lengths of small semicircle is you have to subtract the two values so seven two point four minus thirty point to do it here seventy point four thirty point to subtraction you get here forty point two this is in centimeters now 
,,the length of one of the smallest semicircle so this is two semicircles is this much so what about one semicircle you have to divide this by two you get twenty point one centimeter is the length of one semicircle find the perimeter of a smaller semicircle when the perimeter of the compound figure is ninety point six so all three sides are equal means this is equal to this one is equal to this one all lengths of semicircles are equal so perimeter is given 90 point six centimeters so what's the length of one of the smaller semicircle you have to divide this by three because parameter means three lengths we are not considering inside let's so take ninety 
,,point six divided by three it's one length thirty point two centimeters is their length off one semicircle now we will look at review exercise find the perimeter of 
,,each of the figures given below so this is an equilateral triangle one length is five centimeters so what's the perimeter perimeter is five times three that's 15 centimeters this is isosceles triangle this is six and this is six as well so what's the perimeter here 6 plus 6 plus 4 10 10 plus 6 16 centimeters this one is a scalene triangle just active since 5 plus 6 plus 7 7 plus 5 12 12 plus 6 18 centimeters this is a square one length is 6 so what's the perimeter 4 times 6 because there are 4 equal sides in a square so 24 centimeters this is the rectangle opposite sides are equal so what's the formula 2 times L plus B length and breadth so two times length is 10 breath this for 2 times 14 you get 28 centimeters what's a shape here trapezium this is 5 this is also 5 so what's the perimeter perimeter is add all the lids 5 + 6 + 5 + 8 10 18 + 6 24 centimeters question number 2 the perimeter of a square shape wall tile is 160 so the perimeter is 160 how many such tiles are needed for one lengthwise row of a wall of length 4 meters if the tires are to be fixed without any gaps between them so what's the length of the wall is equal to 4 meters multiply by 100 you get 400 centimeters now we'll find out one side of a tile one side of a tile because the perimeter is given hundred 60 divided by 4 you get one side of a child then you can find how many tiles needed you know them twice number of tiles needed length twice 400 divided by 40 so you need ten tiles for this way question number three if the perimeter of the rectangular shaped paddy field of length forty meters this is 40 meters and we don't know the breadth but the perimeter is given 130 so parameter is given 130 length is 40 and you need to find out the breath use the formula P equals 2 times L plus B perimeter is 132 times 40 plus B 
,,divide both sides by 2 let's get canceled out under 30 divided by 2 65 then subtract 40 from both sides you get B equals 65 minus 40 that's 25 meters question number 4 the length of a rectangular shaped wall tile is greater than its breadth by 10 centimeters if the breadth of the tile is 15 fine its perimeter so what's the length length is 10 centimeter more than the brick so length is 15 plus 10 that's 25 centimeters breadth is given 15 centimeters and you asked to find out that parameter 
,,so formula is 2 times L plus B 2 L is 25 B is 15 when you add it together 2 times 40 80 centimeters is the perimeter question number 5 there are two pieces of wire of length 6 two centimeters each amali makes an equilateral triangle by bending one of these pieces of wire son Domini makes a square find the length of side of equilateral triangle made by amali and find the length of the side of the square made by Sun Domini so there are two pieces of wire so the length of the wire is 60 centimeter each so if this is equilateral triangle you get three sides so what's the length of one side of an equilateral triangle 60 divided by three that is 20 centimeters now we'll look at the square square has four sides equal sides so what's the length of a square 60 divided by four so 15 centimeters question number six the length and breadth of a rectangular shape flowerbed are seven meters L three meters how many square shaped bricks of length 25 centimeter each are needed to place one row of bricks around the flower bed without any space left between the bricks so around this flowerbed seven meters and three meters now we'll see lengthwise how many bricks are needed so this is Lindt is 7 meters convert to centimeters you get 700 centimeters so number of bricks lengths twice so here one brick is 25 centimeter long so 700 divided by 25 so 25 times 254 200 so you would get 8 so 28 bricks lengthwise then how many bricks needed for this side number of bricks for bread side 300 is the length divided by 25 what's that 25 and 450 that's 2 but we know when you are taking the tiles here how many tiles on up here yeah 2 tiles overlap yeah so that means you have to take you have to subtract how many times one two three four tiles you have to subtract after you taking the total length so we'll take that so if 
,,you take number of a bread side this so actually if we take out these two how many ties are there you need 10 tiles so we'll find out the total number of trials needed twenty-eight this way and twenty-eight this way as well and here you have to subtract two from here to from there so actual one is 20 minus 2 and 20 minus 2 there what's the total so 10 10 20 30 40 50 60 60 plus 16 you get 76 all together the total number of tiles needed around this is 76 so this is one method we found using 
,,perimeter seven plus three this one but you need to subtract for a number of tiles because that's overlapping each other if you take the perimeter what's the second 
,,method you can do perimeter of this figure is 700 plus 300 into 2 2 times L plus B so what's that mm is the total length then divide by 4 divide by the length of the tire 25 so you can find number of tiles is equal to u divided by 25 and then you have to subtract again for from that let's see what you get 25 times a 80 minus 4 76 this way also you get the same of tax question number seven the length of a rectangular shape playground is twice its breadth if the perimeter of the playground is 360 meters fine its length L its breadth so we'll put X from X for bread and twice 2x for length and it's 2x and B is X now use the formula 2 times L plus B is P 2 
,,times 2x plus x equals 360 divided by 2 2 X and X becomes 3x 360 divided by 2 180 so divide this by 3 you get x equals 60 so X is the length of the size of the brick so what's the unit so this is bread 60 meters and what's the length then length is 2 times of 60 120 meters example number one calculate the perimeter of each of the figures below so these are all combined figures so rectangle and a equilateral triangle combined together and you ask to find the perimeter so when you take the perimeter you are taking only outer lengths so we'll take the first one how many sevens are there 1 to 2 times 7 how many trees are there 1 2 3 so 1 times 2 14 and 9 23 centimeters this one we take 6 6 1 only 1 6 if you take 8 1 2 2 weights then how many force 1 2 2 4 and then you get 10 6 plus 8 times 2 16 4 times 2 8 and 10 add 
,,it together 12 1 remaining so here 6 + 6 12 12 plus 8 22 remaining 2 3 4 40 centimeters part three so you need to find out the perimeter of the figure so we will find out separately gh gh is high five centimeters a B what's the length yeah total length is 5 this is 2 Phi minus 2 3 so divided equally so this is one and a half and one and a half so what's a B 1 then 1/2 or 1.5 so we can dry find out five minus two divided by two so one and a half or 1.5 will write 2 times a B this I do know now 2 times a B a B is 1 point 5 multiplied by 2 you get 3 centimeters so this is 3 centimeters so what's the perimeter 5 this one yeah we will see how many fives are there 1 2 3 3 5 so I multiply this by 3 5 3 times then 2 1 2 3 then 1 and 1/2 and one and a half we get 3 that's all so you can multiply 15 and 324 this is in centimeter so very meeting is 24 centimeters exercise to 0.1 calculate the perimeter of each of the figures given below so we'll see how many sides are there with five centimeter length 1 2 3 4 5 5 times 5 25 centimeters is the parameter this one 1 to 2 times 5 7 1 to 2 times 7 10 plus 14 that's 24 centimeters look at this figure combination of 2 rectangles so what's the perimeter you take 6 lengths 1 2 3 3 times 6 when it comes to 2 1 2 & 3 2 times 3 and then you need to find out this length so how do you find out that length 6 minus 2 you get 4 centimeters so you need to add four there 6 into 3 18 6 plus 4 10 and 18 that's 28 centimeters now look at this 
,,one this is a good question you have given this side for this one 5 so this is a rectangle and now the rectangle we don't know the lengths okay think about this one 
,,this length and this length when you add what you get the total length for so take this length and move it up so you get here this left move it there what you get this is same as a rectangle so length is five breakfast for so what's the perimeter perimeter is two times four plus five two times nine 18 centimeters this one we let all limbs yeah this is also similar to the previous question if you move this one up actually this is a rectangle and you get extra two let's but we'll add it together this is 12 this is 10 and this is 10 10 times 2 4 4 4 that's 12 and this 4 and this 4 you get another 8 when you add it 12 12 24 24 20 and 8 so you get 52 centimeters take this one here this is 11 here can you see this length is equal to this length so this is 8 now we can find out the perimeter perimeter is equal to 11 plus 8 and another 8 2 times 8 five and four now add it together eleven plus 16 plus five and four sixteen one remaining two three so 36 centimeters for the parameter this figure all lengths are given so this is given and which side not given here this is 90 degrees means this is four and this is for same length this is like a rectangle so all lengths we know this is 5 this is also hot now we'll find out the perimeter 15 and this is 15 15 times 2 how many fours are there 1 2 3 4 4 times how many fives are there 1 2 now what about this one this length this is equal to this given 6 now we'll find out the length 6 1 2 3 4 4 times 6 now add it together 30:16 10 and 24 one remaining here 4 5 6 7 8 80 centimeters this is a trapezium you have given all let's hear this is same as this one this is thirteen point four now you can find the forum Peter thirteen point four two times this is twelve thirteen and five here multiply two times four eight six and two twenty six point eight plus here this is 3 plus 2 5 5 5 10 and 30 so add it together you get point eight and six with five fifty six point eight that's in meters question number two a figure of a 
,,gate with two panels is given here calculate the perimeter of the gate so we need to find out the perimeter of the gate this is equal this is 3 this is 3 this is 4 this one is four now we'll find out 3 twice three times 2 4 twice and 2.5 and 2.5 twice so what's the perimeter six eight two point five times two you get five fourteen plus five nineteen the unit is meters look at this one a figure of an entrance structure constructed to welcome the students of grade one to a school is given with its measurements find the minimum length of the ribbon required to fix around the entrance structure so basically that means perimeter of this figure you get carefully this is one this is one so this is three so what's this 1 1 + 1 2 2 + 3 then this is 1 meter this is also 1 and what is this side this is 3 so this is 3 3 now we'll find the perimeter you can add how many ones are there 1 2 3 4 4 times 1 how many threes 1 2 3 4 5 and this is 5 this one is 5 now add 4 plus 15 plus 5 you get 
,,24 meters so the length of the ribbon required is 24 meters this question a figure offer net use to construct a solid is shown here calculate its perimeter so all sides I equals six so parameter means outer length how many sixes are there 1 2 3 4 5 6 6 into 6 that's 36 centimeters this one a section of a courtyard constructed with square shaped flow tiles of length 40 centimeter each is shown in the figure find the perimeter of this section so perimeter means outer length so one tile is 40 
,,centimeters so this one is 40 so we'll see how many forties are there so B equals very meet one two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 24 times 40 0 4 times 4 64 times 2 8 + 1 9 so this is in centimeters so perimeter of this section is 960 centimeters look at question number 6 if the perimeter of a wall hanging composed of a square shaped wooden lamina and an equilateral triangular shaped wooden lamina with base equal to a side of the square is hundred 60 centimeters so the whole parameter is Rancic's T so all these sides are equal because this base is same as the length of this square so equal sides there are how many sides 1 2 3 4 5 5 sides are there so the perimeter is hundred 60 so what's the first question calculate the length of a side of the square shape wooden lamina that means all together five sides are there so length of the square is 160 divided by five you get 32 centimeters then calculate the perimeter of the equilateral triangular shape wooden lamina so they're asking only the perimeter of this one so three times of that so perimeter of the equilateral triangle only three times one side is 32 3 times 32 96 centimeters look at this one question number seven what is the least of the parameters of the composite plane figures that can be made with two rectangles of length six and breadth for so when you take two rectangles either you can combine like this with the bread side so six six four four oh what's the other way you can combine with the Landsat now they are asking least of the Perim a parameter least of the parameter means the lowest value so we what do you think which one you need to get the lowest value breath is normally smaller than the length so here when you take length side inside you get the parameter least so this shape is the correct one but if you can't figure it out we'll calculate and see so what's the perimeter of this figure so you can't take this one parameter we can find to force two times four and one two three four four times six but you get 8 and 24 32 centimeters this one this is six four four four and six what's the perimeter here two times six and how many fours are there 4 4 times 2 times 6 12 and 16 28 so we can see that this is the least valid the lowest value out of this so this 
,,is the least parameter so least parameter parameter is 28 centimeters freshener made a composite figure form with 4 rectangles of length 8 and breadth 4 centimeters 
,,each and a square of side length 4 square of side length 4 so this one it's shown here calculate the perimeter of the figure so perimeter only the outer length it's 
,,a perimeter is equal to we'll see how many eighths are there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 8 times 8 how many Falls 1 2 3 for now edit 64 last 68 so you get 80 centimeters for the perimeter of this figure question number 9 every morning be newly walks twice around the path shown in the figure find the total distance she walks around the park 
,,each day so twice of that so find the perimeter and multiply by two now can you see this is a rectangular shape figure so when you move this length here and this length here what you get you get her rectangular shape figure so find the perimeter using two times length is 705 with these 475 two times addition of these two ten eight eleven two times zero 2 times 8 16 2 times 1/2 plus 1/3 2 so this is the perimeter of this figure but be newly box twice around so you have to multiply by 2 so total distance is 2 times this 0 12 7 and 4 so this is in meters 4720 so we covered all theory related to perimeter so we found perimeter of square rectangle triangle 
,,scalene isosceles and equilateral and then we did composite figures beining two or more figures together so when you're finding perimeter so the perimeter of the combined figure is not the same as the perimeter of separate figures and also when calculating the perimeter of a composite rectilinear plane figure only the lengths of the straight line segments by which it is bounded should be added not the inside length so make sure when you take a combined figure you add all outer lengths

Number Partens,dAgfnK528RA,"Hi and welcome to Math Antics. Today were gonna talk about an important math concept called Order of Operations. Order of Operations is just a set of math rules that tell you which math operations (like addition or multiplication) to do first. Now you might be wondering (especially if youre a teenager), Why do I need RULES to tell me which operations to do first?  Cant I just do them in any order I want? Well, thats a really good questions! And to answer it, were going to give two TOTALLY different people the SAME math problem to solve. The problem is: 2 + 5  4 Hmmm I like addition better than multiplication, so Im gonna do that first! Lets "
,,"see 2 + 5 gives us 7.  And then I just multiply that 7 by the 4 and I get 28. That was easy!  But youd better not copy my answer! Uh, dont worry Im not gonna copy your answer, cuz I want the RIGHT answer! And I prefer multiplying, so Im going to do THAT first. Lets see 4  5 = 20, and THEN Ill add the 2 which gives me 22 for a final answer. What makes you think THATS the right answer?  All my calculations were correct. I even checked it with a calculator! Pfffff - the only calculator I need is right up here! And the correct answer is boop, boop, boop boop, boop. 22! Okay, so which one of these guys do you think is right?  Neither one made any mistakes with the calculations. They just did the operations in a different order and got DIFFERENT answers! Well since there were no mistakes, in a way, they were BOTH right! But math would be a VERY confusing subject if there were different answers to the same problem. And thats where Order of Operations can help us out. "
,,"The Order of Operations Rules are a way for us all to agree on the order that you should do math operations in. And if we always do operations in the same order, then well always get the same answer. So now that you know WHY we need Order of Operations rules, lets find out what those rules are. Therere basically four of them "
,,"and they go something like this: FIRST: do operation in parentheses and brackets NEXT: do exponents THEN: do multiplication and division LAST: do addition and subtraction Lets take a closer look at each one of these rules, and see some examples where they will help us. First on the list was:  do operations in parentheses and brackets. Now in case you havent seen parentheses or brackets used in math before, let me briefly explain how they work. Parentheses are just these symbols that curve forwards and backwards, and theyre used in pairs like this. And when we put numbers and operators in between them, it forms a group. Its almost like the parentheses form a package to hold whatever math stuff we put inside them. And brackets work exactly the same way as parentheses. They just have a different shape that looks "
,,"a little more boxy, but they mean exactly the same thing. So parentheses and brackets are used to group things together, and our rules tell us to do any operations inside these groups FIRST. For example, have a look at this problem: 10  (4 + 5) It has 3 numbers and 2 operations: multiplication and addition. But 2 of the numbers and the addition symbol are inside parentheses. That means that they form a group and we need to do that part of the problem first. 4 + 5 = 9, so the part inside the parentheses can just be replaced with the simplified value 9. Oh and once you do the math thats inside parentheses and get a single number like this, you usually dont need to show the parentheses anymore. Now that the parentheses are gone, we just have one operation left to do. We multiply 10  9 and that gives us 90 as our final answer. So parentheses can really help you know what part of a problem youre supposed to do first. But what if you get a problem that has more than one set of parentheses, like this:   (5 ? 3) + (6  2) Fortunately, it doesnt matter which set of parentheses you do first. You just need to do everything thats inside the "
,,"parentheses BEFORE you do anything that's NOT inside parentheses. In other words, we need to simplify BOTH of our parentheses groups before we can do this addition IN-BETWEEN them. The first group (5 ? 3) simplifies to 2, and the second group (6  2) simplifies to 12. Now we can do the last operation and add the values that we got from simplifying: 2 + 12 = 14 Okay, now that we know we always do operation in parentheses or brackets FIRST, lets take a closer look at the second rule that says the next thing we do is exponents. Now if you havent seen exponents before, theyre just a way of writing repeated multiplication. For example, the repeated multiplication 4  4 can be written in a shorter form as 4 multiplied twice. And 4  4  4 can be written as 4 multiplied 3 times, and 4  4  4  4 can be written as 4 multiplied 4 times.  get the idea? This small number is called an exponent (or power). It just tells you how many times to multiply the bigger number together. So after we take care of any parentheses, simplifying any exponents becomes the next highest priority. For example in this problem, we have to simplify the exponent BEFORE we can do the other multiplication. The exponent is telling us to multiply 5 together twice.  So 5 times 5 is 25. And after we do that, THEN we multiply the result by 3.  So 25 times 3 is 75. Oh, and one thing I should point out sometimes youll get a problem that has exponents inside of parentheses, like this problem. And you may wonder, How can I get rid of the parentheses BEFORE I do the exponent? You might think that if you simplify the exponent first, youre breaking the rules. But the truth is that by doing whatever operations are inside the parentheses, you ARE doing the parentheses first. The parentheses really just tell you where to start. So in this problem, first we do 3 to the power of 2, which means 3  3 which is 9. Then the part inside the parentheses is 9  4, which equals 36. And once the parentheses are gone, we add 36 + 6 and get 42 as our final answer. Alright, now were gonna look at the last two rules together. These two rules are really important because they deal with the most common math operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication & division. And the rules tell us that we need to do multiplication and "
,,"division BEFORE we do addition and subtraction. To see how these rules work, lets look at a few quick examples that use those basic operations. First lett try this "
,,"one:  2 + 5 + 4  Ah Ha! Does this look familiar? Yep, its the one we gave to my two friends earlier. And now that we have our rules, we see that we have to do the "
,,"multiplication before the addition. 5  4 = 20 and THEN we add the 2, which gives us 22 so the second guy WAS right! [Sarcastically] What a surprise! Now lets try "
,,"this one:  3  5 ? 1 Our rules tell us that multiplication is higher on the list than subtraction, so we do 3  5 first. That gives us 15, and THEN we subtract the 1 which leaves 14 as our final answer. Heres one with division and subtraction: 20 ? 10  5 And since division has a higher priority, we do the 10 divided by 5 first, which equals 2. And then we subtract 2 from 20 and get 18 as our final answer. And heres another problem: 12  6 + 5 Again, our rules say to do the division before addition, so 12 divided by 6 equals 2 and then we add the 5 to get 7. And heres one last problem: 40  4  5 Which do we do first? the multiplication or the division?  Our rules dont tell us. Well, thats because multiplication and division are TIED for priority or importance.  So are addition and subtraction. And THATS "
,,"the reason we need an extra part at the end of each of these rule that says from left to right If you have a problem that has BOTH multiplication AND division, then youre supposed to work it from left to right. Thats because in some cases, you can get a different answers if you go from right to left. For example, in this problem, if you work from right to left (the wrong way) you would do the 4  5 first and get 20. And then 40 divided by 20 equals 2. But if you go from left to right, you would do 40 divided by 4 first, which is 10, and then 10 times 5 equals 50. Wow! The direction we went made a BIG difference. So whenever you have a problem that "
,,"has a mixture of multiplication and division OR a mixture of addition and subtraction, you know to do the operations in order from left to right. Alright, were just about done, but lets have one more look at all four of our rules before you start practicing with the exercises. The Order of Operations rules say: FIRST: do operation in parentheses and brackets NEXT: do exponents THEN: do multiplication and division (from left to right) LAST: do addition and subtraction (from left to right) "

Number Partens,aWhI8gysfVY,okay so now we will be looking at numeric patterns and geometric patterns cool so over here we have a numeric pattern so they ask us write down the rule which gives 
,,the relationship between P and T in each of the following so we need to find out what the rule is over here remember the rule is what's gonna give us a relationship 
,,between P and T so if we can look at our p value 0 we have 1 2 3 4 our T values were 3 6 9 and 12 what is the relationship between all of these numbers of year to the corresponding T value these p-values have the relationship that is common with the T values so how we look at that is we're gonna see here that we have 1 as our first p value and T our first T value is 3 so what can we do to one to get our three over here well if we look at it very simply we can say that we gain two times by three right so if we times by 3 we get three right so if we now begin to check with our other values as well so we can check 2 times 3 we get 6 right and you can see 
,,it is the right value over here that's the T value now if we times 3 by 3 what do we get our T value of 9 yes we do and 3 times 4 by 3 do we get our T value of 12 yes we do so we know that the common relationship here is timesing our p value by 3 so the way we will write this rule is T is equal to P times 3 or you can write it as therapy that just means that because there's no space in between yeah that'd be times in theory and P together cool so that is the rule for this numeric pattern over here if you move on over here we can see it says values are 1 2 3 & 6 these are P values and then we have negative 3 and negative 2 negative 1 & 2 so how are we gonna find the roof of this once again let's sort of the first value how can we get to negative 3 so you could say we can times 1 by negative 3 okay let's go that first so we times 1 by negative 3 and we get negative 3 as our T value so what we have to do is we want our next term now we go 2 times negative 3 3 times 2 by negative 3 do we get negative 2 no we don't so what else can we do to one to get negative 3 look at Ryan minus 4 so if we minus 4 from 1 we get negative 3 moving on next time we have to check 2 minus 4 that's 2 - forgive us our T value of negative 2 yes it does if you're looking at 3 and we - 4 do we get negative 1 yes we do and then for last check 6 minus 4 we get 2 which is our T value straight away we can see what the rule is going to be so we know that the rule is T is equal to P minus 4 cool so that will be our rule which shows the relationship between P and T for this numeric example over here so now in these examples they want us to find the value for P and T in each of the given number sequences so we're going to try and identify the pattern that is being used or the general rule that's being used over here to find out the values of P and T so if we look at the first example we can see 11 and 22 so what did I do to 11 to get 22 I could have x by 2 or they could have added 11 
,,so I mean look at that is we're gonna see okay I'm 55 on this end of year so obviously P and T have to fall in between 55 and 22 so we know that if we're gonna times 22 by 2 we can get 44 which is really too close to 55 which means we can put two values in between so immediately we have to see that we are adding living in this case so if we add 11 we get 22 so we know that then our p value our p value is going to be equal to 33 and our T value if we add 11 to 33 we get 44 cool and then we're gonna look at our next example here we can see that how did they get to four from one another they get to seven from four we can see straight away they just adding three so obviously we're going to add 3 to 7 to get our p value so our p-value is going to be equal to 10 and our T value is going to be equal to 13 so that was this example was 7 plus 3 and this one was 10 plus 3 I hope that all makes sense so now we move on to our last example now in this example they say record the number of dots in each array in a table the terminal diagram pattern means the terminal mount of dots in the twenty-fifth array if the pattern is continued so the first thing I ask us to do is record the number of dots in each array in the table so we can see we have a 1 a 2 and a 3 so we need to put in 1 2 & 3 so that's the first row second row third row the first array is 4 dots the second array as a tots and third row has 12 dots so we've successfully recorded our values into a table right so what ask us to do next determine the diagram pattern so we're going to try and find out what is the pattern of ear so it's cool our top row in values ok and in the bottom just a number of dots right so these gonna be in values so how do we get from 1 to 4 how do we get from 2 to 8 and 3 to 12 so if you look at that very quickly we 
,,can see that 3 times 1 by 4 we get 4 3 times 2 by 4 we get 8 movie times 3 before we're 12 so straightaway we now rule is going to be our array number times 4 so how can we write that another way we can write our rules out is by saying TM which is going to be the start of the rule so we can write en is equal to so we remember we've called our array numbers in so ultimately we gonna say we times an n by 4 because 1 will be putting in the place of n so we have 4 in that is our so TN is equal 
,,to 4 times n so basically means if we're gonna substitute in do wanna find out how much is in a right to be in a say term two is equal to four times two so you can see array number two is term two as well so we try and find out what their number two is I will say term 2 is equal to 4 times 2 which gives us 8 as you can see this 
,,confirms the rule is correct as we get out eight of them so the next part stays hence the term amount of dogs in the twenty-fifth array if the pattern is continued so we know that our array is our n value right so 25 is gonna be our new in value so don't find out what term 25 is so we'll say term 25 it's gonna be equal to 4 now 
,,remember we said n was 25 that's why that T in has done the T 25 so we can substitute in 25 now so if T 25 is equal to 4 times 25 therefore our T 25 is equal to 100 
,,so that's how much dots will be in the 20-footer thank you very much for joining us this is the end of our video lesson thank you very much

Number Partens,flXVRy1hjf4,hello grade 8 children today I am here to teach you mathematics relevant to your textbook so what's the first unit in your textbook that's called number patterns so 
,,this is an interesting topic and we'll create number patterns using numbers so let's take 1 2 3 what are those those are digits so here we call these are counting numbers as well counting numbers so one two three like that we can't write all numbers so that's why we put three dots after this so if any pattern if you can't write 
,,it all you have to put three dots we can create different number patterns from these counting numbers so let's take different patterns check the first one one three 
,,five seven nine what are those we call these are odd numbers numbers less than ten only if you take odd numbers you have to write down 11 13 like that but this is the number set less than check so that's why here we put curly brackets and write down 1 1 3 5 7 9 so here you can't see 3 dots this is not continuing now we can find 
,,a next term by adding 2 to the previous so here how do you get 3 from 1 we can add 2 3 plus 2 you get 5 5 + 2 7 7 + 2 9 so since the exact number of terms in this number pattern can be specified therefore it is a finite number time so here certain numbers are there so remember this term finite number pad tick the same thing 1 3 
,,5 7 9 odd numbers less than 10 in this number pattern what's the first term the first number in the number pattern we call the first term so in this one what's the first term second term is 3 third term five fourth term seven and fifth term is now let's take these numbers 2 4 6 8 10 12 what are those those are even numbers so we can divide these numbers by 2 the remainder is 0 so here you see two three dots that means this number pattern continues what you call that that's called in finite 
,,number pattern so what's the first term in this sequence or number buggy that's 2 the second term is 4 36 4 8 and the fifth term so you know how to identify terms in the number pad and what are the two words you learn finite number pattern L in finite number pattern let's take this one 5 8 11 14 17 so when you take two numbers next to each other what do you call that consecutive term so here 5 & 8 are consecutive terms when you take 8 and 11 those are also consecutive terms so you can take 
,,any 2 you can take any two terms next to each other those are called consecutive terms so 14 and 17 also consecutive terms so we'll take that one and see the pattern how you get a it from five we need to add three 8 plus 3 you get 11 11 plus 3 14 14 plus 370 so how can we find out this number so you can take any two terms consecutive terms in the number pattern if you take this is the next term and the one before that that's called previous term we can take the difference so how do you get 
,,this number 11 minus 8 or 8 minus 5 so what you call that number common difference so you are learning another term that's common difference how you get the common difference you need two consecutive terms and take the difference when you are taking the difference don't subtract 5 minus 8 that's wrong so next term minus the previous term so we'll do that so you can either take 8 minus 5 Oh 11 minus 8 you are getting same answer or 14 minus 11 or 17-14 so that's how we find out the common difference let's take this one find the common difference of the following number pattern's now you know we can take the difference between two consecutive terms so you can take any two numbers so I'll take these two then what's the difference 16 minus 12 you get this one what's the common difference these two 36 minus 30 that's six when you take these two twenty minus ten that's ten look at this question write down the first five terms of the following number patterns you have given the first term and the common differences you can start from the first seven common difference is three means you need to add three to the previous term 7 + 3 10 10 plus 3 13 13 plus 3 16 16 plus 3 19 one two three four five and you can put three dots to show that it is continuing next one first term is 14 then common difference is plus four means adding four to the previous one four plus 14 plus 480 18 plus four 22 22 plus four 26 26 plus four 30 next one first term six and common difference six so that means multiples of six so starting from 6 6 plus 6 12 12 plus 6 18 18 plus 6 24 24 plus 6/13 this one first term is 12 and the common difference is eight at eight to that 12 plus 8 20 20 plus eight twenty eight twenty eight plus eight 36 36 Plus eight forty four one two three four five can put three dots after that look at this one right down the next two terms of the following sequences so you need to identify the pattern 712 so what's the common difference 12 minus 7 adding fine so that means in this number pattern the common difference is +5 so that means add 5 to that 27 plus 5 32 32 + 5 30 silver this one identify the common difference first you get server last 7 so what you do 41 is the last term so you add 7 to that you get 48 48 plus 750 this one what's the common difference how do you get 12 from 9 adding 3 let me you can start from here 21 plus three twenty four twenty four plus three twenty seven this Molly plus five 16 plus five you get 20 bar then you can 
,,start from here 36 plus five 41 41 plus five 46 this one have you get thirty from twenty four adding six to that so that means 48 plus 6 54 54 plus six that's 60 this one following number pattern is created multiplied the previous term by 2 now this is multiplication 2 times 2 you get 4 4 times 2 8 8 times 2 16 16 times 2 32 so 
,,this is the number pattern so I can write this one starting from 2 4 8 16 32 now look at this 1 2 4 8 10 20 a different number pattern following number pattern is created first added to and then multiplied by 2 so added to 2 plus 2 you get 4 times 2 8 then adding 2 8 plus 2 10 10 times 2 20 so this is also another number pattern so 2 4 8 10 20 now look at these so first 3 terms are the same but fourth term and fifth term those are different so from these two patterns we observed even though the first 3 terms are the same can create different number patterns so same for three terms but you can create different number pants now look at this one added 3 to the previous term 3 plus 3 you get 6 6 plus 3 9 9 plus 3 12 12 plus 3 15 so here what are the numbers three six nine twelve fifteen now first three terms are the same 369 but this is 18 and 21 so how can you create that pattern first multiplied by two and then added three multiplied by two you get six then added 3 6 plus 3 9 then multiplied by 2 again 9 times 2 18 18 plus 3 21 so this one is 3 6 9 18 21 so first three terms are the same but you can create different number patterns fill in the blanks to generate different number patterns so what can we do hi plus 5 10 10 plus 5 15 that means adding 5 15 20 25 30 look at this one you can do another partner we can do multiply by 2 and add 5 5 times 2 10 10 plus 5 15 and what's the next number 15 times 2 30 30 plus 5 35 35 times 2 you get 70 this one 7 14 21 multiples of server so that means adding 7 to that so 21 plus seven twenty eight twenty eight plus seven 35 35 plus 7 42 now create another number pattern different one see first three terms try to create another one this one I can do multiply by 2 and then add 7 multiplied by 2 first and then at 7 so multiply by 221 times 242 add seven more T naught now again x - 2 times 9 18 so 2 times 9 18 2 times 4 8 + 1 98 now we'll discuss what is general term of the number pattern take this number pattern two four six eight ten twelve means even numbers so you want to write down the general term of the multiples of two now we'll try to do that so term number term and pattern okay what's the first term in this sequence or number pattern that's how can I write down two I can write 1 times 2 or 2 times 1 second term second term is 4 
,,try to write down number 4 - x - third term 6 what's the pattern I can write this one as 2 times 3/4 1 8 2 times 4 now see your pattern 10th term I need no tense term so 10th term is what 2 times 10 by looking at the pattern we can get 2 times 10 because first term is 2 times 1 second term is 2 times 2 so temp term 2 times 10 that's 20 then what about nth term n means any term I can write 2 times N or when you write without this multiplication I can write - so what's the enter to win we call this as general term so nth term is the general term of the number pattern so what you can write for multiples of Oh general term is 2 what are the numbers for n you have to start from one n equals 1 first term in equals 2 second term so likewise when you substitute in values we can find out any term so you need general term to find out the terms now what are these numbers 3 6 9 12 15 18 multiples of 3 write down the general term of the multiples of 3 so we'll try to do the same thing like before first term first term is 3 what's the pattern I can write 3 times second term is 6 3 times 2 this number and this one is the same third one 9 3 times 3/4 1 
,,12 3 times 4 then what about temperature I can write 3 times 10 that becomes 30 and what about the general term nth term three times in oh I can write down three so 
,,what's the general term of multiples of 3 is 3 and so I can write down this one as 3 n so we found out the general pattern for multiples of 2 that's 2 it general term for multiples of 3 that's 3 n now this one feel the table below by observing the previous pattern multiples of 2 2 multiples of three general term is 3/8 can you identify then what about multiples of four that's foreign so you saw the patent two three four what about multiples are fired five multiples of 7 this is 7 in multiples of chain chain in and multiples of 11 obviously that's a lemon now the reverse process finding terms using general term if you know the general term how can we find out these terms so in this example first three terms first three terms means N equals one N equals two and in equals three so what you do take the general term substitute one for first term that's three to get the second term you substitute n equal to 3 times 2 6 when N equals 3 you get the third term so that's what about tenth term general term is trillion so tenth term is 3 times 10 that's previous question which tell me 60 now the end term is given 60 and you are asked to find out what's the end value so what you do we equate general term is trillion and that's equal to 60 then how you solve this you can divide this by 3 to get in so 60 divided by 3 what you get n equals 60 divided by 3 you get 20 so 20th term is 60 or in other words we can say 20 multiple of 3 is 60 now the general term is given as 5 in you are asked to find out for three terms 11th term and which term is 75 so what you do for the first three you substitute N equals 1 you get the first term N equals 2 
,,you get the second term M equals 3 you get the good so 5 10 15 are the first three terms and then 11th term next one you are asked to find out the 11th term so how we find out the LMR term substitute 11 so 5 times 11 you get 55 so 11th term is 55 this one the third part which term is 75 means nth term is given 75 so you equate in term is 5 in general term that's equal to 75 so how you find out n divided by 5 75 divided by 5 you get 15 so 15 multiple of 5 is 75 this one you have given the general term is 11 find the 10th term so how you find out the 10th term substitute 10 for and 10th term is equal to 11 times 10 hundred 10 next 120th term so what you 
,,do substitute N equals 20 general term is 11 and that's given and you asked to find out the 20th term substitute in s 20 multiplied by 2 you get 22 put 1 0 220 this 
,,one the third part which term is 121 now the reverse process you'd have given the in term you also find out the in value and the fourth part also same way you asked 
,,to find out which term is 77 so we'll do that substitute then to get n you divide by 11 get 11 for it so 11th term is 121 what about 77 when you divide by 11 you get in ass so so seventh term is 77 fill in the blanks now you have given different number patterns and you asked to write down the first term and the change Roger so observe the first one four eight twelve sixteen multiples of four that means addition multiples are four that means adding four what's the first term for what's the general term for em then 9 18 27 36 multiples of 9 starting from 9 9 18 27 36 so what's the general term 9 in 1 2 3 4 this is also number pattern but you're adding 1 
,,to that so what's the general term starting from 1 we can write 1 in 8 16 24 those are multiples of 8 starting from 8 so the general term is a 10 identify this multiples of 12 starting from 12 you can write 12 in 1 3 5 7 9 11 find the general term for odd numbers what are even numbers 2 4 6 8 so we found out the general pattern 
,,for even numbers multiples of 2 what's that that's 2 in now we'll try to find out the general term for odd numbers what's the first term if it's even numbers what's 
,,the first term but in our pattern the first term is 1 so what can you see you have to subtract 1 to get this one second term even numbers when you consider the second term is 4 but in this one that's 3 how you get 3 from 4 4 minus 1 third term for the even pattern six this one five you can subtract and get five one from the term fourth term is eight for even numbers in this one seven 8 minus 1 is 7 tenth term you get 2 times 10 20 odd numbers what's the 10th term one less than that so we observed a pattern one less than that so I can write 20 minus 1 that's 19 xx - 2 times 20 that's 40 but we know that's this is 1 less than that this is 39 so what's the general term we found out general term for even numbers that's 2 in so what's the pattern 2 n minus 1 so we can straightaway find out the general term for odd numbers that's 2 n minus 1 we can get odd numbers by subtracting 1 from all even numbers so remember now what's the general term for odd numbers 2 n minus 1 using that now we'll try to find our 23rd odd number to do that you need to know the general term so what's the general term for numbers 2 n minus 1 if you want twenty third term you substitute N equals 23 so 2 times 23 minus 1 so what's that you get 46 minus 1 forty hi 45th so what it means here 23rd odd number is 45 find the 36th odd number so what's the general term for numbers to win - what if you want 36 substitute 36 for in 2 times 6 12 1 remaining 2 times 3 6 + 1 7 72 minus 1 you get 71 36th odd number is 71 find the 18th odd number so what's the general term 2 n minus 1 18 term you substitute 18 for 2 times 8 16 1 remaining so 36 minus 1 you get 35 18th odd number is 35 which odd number 33 now the reverse process we know the general term is 2n minus 1 for numbers so we can substitute to win minus 1 is equal to 33 now 
,,is that linear equation simple algebraic equation you know already how to solve that so what you do you can get rid of this minus 1 by you can get rid of this minus 
,,one by adding 133 plus one so what you get here 34 is equal to two it to get em you can divide this by two so when you do that you can get n m equals 2 times 1 2 4 14 that's 7 so 17th odd number is 33 which odd number is 81 now you need to get the general term so what's general term general term is 2 n minus 1 now that's equal to 81 now solve that equation Advan first to get rid of this minus 1 you get 82 is equal to 2 in then you need to divide this by 2 to get n N equals 41 so 41 or term 
,,is 81 which odd term is 17 same thing take the general term equal to 70 get rid of this minus 1 that means adding 1 you get 18 is equal to 2 in then divide by 2 what you get you get 9/9 odd number is 17 now you need to know what R square are numbers so look at this diagram starting from 1 then 2 rows and 2 columns you can create a square so two times two that's four then three rows and three columns you can create the next square number four rows and four columns you can get their next one 
,,now we'll try to find out the general term for square numbers here is the pattern of circles forming squares which lengths and widths are the same what's the first term that's one second term for we'll try to write down the pattern first term I can write one times one second terms I can write 2 times two third term nine that's three times three if it's eight eighth term I can write by looking at this pattern eight times eight what's that 69 tell nine times nine that's 81 then what about enter this should be n times in so n times n you can write down as in squared so what's the general term for square numbers you can take as in squared now using the general term of the square number can you find the tenth square number so what's the generator in squared 10th term means we substitute check ten square are same as ten times ten you get hundred so tenth square number is 100 this one find the 12 square how you do take the general term n squared and it's not stood 12 12 times 12 that's unread 44 so 12 square number is 144 find the 15 square number write down the general term substitute 15 15 times 15 is 225 so 15 square number is 225 now we'll 
,,take triangular numbers look at the picture for starting from 1 you need 3 circles to create the next triangle what about the other one you need 6 circles to create 
,,the next triangular number next 1/4 110 to create the fourth triangular number so what's the first term first term is 1 second term is 3 third term 6 fourth term 10 
,,what about fifth term can you see the pattern right like this this is one how can you get three I can write 1 plus 2 6 1 plus 2 Plus 3 you get 6 10 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus 4 then what about fifth number 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus 4 plus 5 sum of numbers up to 5 so what's the number that means adding 5 to the previous term 10 plus five you get 15 as a fifth term of the triangular numbers now we can find out this one using a method now we'll take this one if you want adding one up to four when you take first and the last you can get one plus four you can get five to plus three you can get high so when you pair up the numbers like this you can get five in two methods either 2 plus 3 or 1 plus 4 so we can easily find out this as 5 is the number when you add you are getting 2 times of that so 5 times 2 that's 10 so this is the 
,,fourth triangular number so if you want fourth you add 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus 4 how we get the number this is the easiest way to do pair up the numbers like this and then see how many times you are getting the number so in the number is 5 and 2 times you are getting that's 10 we'll take another one if you want 8 triangular number 
,,you have to add 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus like that up to 8 when you pair up like this 1 plus h you get 9 2 plus 7 9 3 plus 6 9 4 + 5 9 how many times you are getting nine one two three four four times you're getting nine so what's the number 36 so eight triangular number is 36 now 10th triangular number what you do 1 plus 2 plus up 
,,to 10 so when you pair up how many sets you can get think about a pattern now previous one we got 4 into 9 is equal to 36 4 is yeah how many digits are there eight 8/2 so we can think about this is 8 divided by 2 you get 4 what about 9 9 you are getting think about first and last 1 plus 8 you did not so we'll try to use that pattern in the next one what's the total 1 plus 10 you are getting 11 2 plus 9 also 11 so how many Elevens you can you will get we can see 10 numbers that they are 10 divided by 2 5 times you are getting 11 so 5 times 11 oh I can write 5 as 10 divided by 2 and how you get 11 first and the last one 1 plus J now can you see the pattern 11 is obtained by adding the first term and the last term the following are 5 such terms so how you create that 10 divided by 2 now what is 10 number of terms and this is the first term and this is the last / - I can rewrite this as this 10 times 10 plus 1 is 11 over 2 so what's the formula you can find the number of terms multiplied by first and the last term addition divided by two so we'll try to apply this formula to find out any triangular number take this one one two eight eight triangular number what's the pattern again we found from the previous one number of terms into first Plus last divided by 2 number of terms 8 divided by 2 and x first 
,,and last one plus 8 again i can write 8 times 9/2 so when you simplify what you get 2 times 1/2 times 4 36 1 2 20 mins xx triangular number so I can write 20 divided by 2 here x 1 plus 20 this is same as 20 into 21 divided by 2 when you simplify you get 210 this one 50th triangular number 50 numbers are they are and divided by 2 1 plus 50 50 times 51 divided by 2 you get 25 times 50 baht so multiplication 25 times 51 means first multiply by 20 and then 5 2 times 1 is 2 and 2 times 5 ten high times 1/5 and 5 times 5 25 so when you add it you get thousand 275 now you need to find out the generator so what's the pattern if there are n digits in the next number is one more than that n plus 1 if the previous number is in you're adding 1 to that n plus 1 divided by 2 so what's the general term for the triangular number 
,,n times n plus 1 divided by 2 here you don't need to write down multiplication side brackets also ok but if you think that this is not talking you can write as in times n plus 1 divided by 2 so we'll try to find out any triangular number using the chain rule to find the 10th triangular number so what's the general term for triangular numbers in times in plus 1/2 now if you want 10th one you substitute 10 10 is n 10 plus 1 over 2 so 10 times 11 over 2 that becomes 50 so general term is n into n plus 1 over 2 for triangular numbers find the 20th triangular number so general term ending to n plus 1/2 so you need xx that means in equals 20 so 20 into 20 plus 125 so you get 10 times 21 210 find the fortieth triangular number you need the general term n into n plus 1 divided by 2 when this is 40 so 14 241 over 2 divided by 2 you get 20 that means multiply by 2 and put a 0 2 times 1 to 2 times 4 8 44th triangular number same as before to take the general term and substitute 44 now substitute 44 44 into 45 44 + 1 then x 22 so 45 x 22 you get 900 plus 45 945 so 945 is the 44th triangular number find xxx triangular number general term so the triangular numbers are n into n plus 1 divided by 2 so if this is xxx triangular number substitute N equals 30 fifteen times 31 so 31 into 15 10 and 5 multiply by 1 and then multiply by 5 add it together you get 465 is the 30th triangular number find the hundredths triangular number general term is n into n plus 1 divided by 2 in this hundred substitute hundred here you get 50 times hundred one so put 0 and x 5050 is the hundredth triangular number 1 + 2 + 3 up to 15 from this sequence which triangular number do you get we observe the pattern 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 fourth triangular number 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 v triangular number so if this is up to 15 this is 15th triangular number up to 28 adding 1 + 2 + 3 up to 20 so what is the triangular number that's xx from this sequence which triangular number one up to 27 so that's 27th triangular this one up to 19 so this is 19th triangular find the sixteenth triangular number if the fifteenth triangular number is 120 so we know the pattern fourth triangular number 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus 4 then to get the fifth one you have to add 5 to that now 16 1 you need so fifteenth one is 120 so how do you get the 16th one 
,,"from 15th one you need to add which number either 15 or 16 you have to add 16 to that so 120 plus 16 you get 136 this one find the 21st triangular number if the 20th one is given 210 you are asked to find out 21st one so which number you need to add 210 plus 21 so that's one here 3 2 231 find the 10th triangular number the 9th triangular number is 55 it's a similar way ninth one is 55 and you are asked to find out the tenth one so how do you do ad turn to that get 65 find the 80th triangular number if the 79th one is given as 3,240 have you get that adding 80 to that so at eighty three thousand three hundred twenty that's the 80th triangular number now we'll try to find out pattern in between square our numbers and the triangular numbers so what are these 1 3 6 10 15 21 are triangular numbers let's take 1 + 3 is 4 so 4 is the square number that's the second square number and here 3 plus 6 you get 9 that's the third square number what about this one 6 + 10 you get 16 so what's that that's the fourth square number I can write this one is 2 squared second square number third square number 3 squared 16 is 4 square number now try to identify "
,,a pattern what's one that's the first triangular number so if I put a symbol like this is first triangle enough 3 is the second triangular number so when you add these two you are getting second square number I put a square to represent the word square what about this one second triangular number and this is third triangular number you are getting third square number find out a relationship this is third triangular number this is fourth triangular number you are getting fourth square number have you seen the pattern 3 4 3 + 1 4 2 + 1 3 1 + 2 2 2 consecutive triangular numbers when you add you get this square number so last square number if this is 4 this is fourth square number if this is 3 this is third square number and this this is 2 this is second square number so what's the pattern when you take any triangular number twenty first triangular number plus twenty second triangular number what you get we get 20 second square number now we'll use that pattern to identify this 
,,one fifth triangular number and sixth triangular number what you get what's the pattern you get sixth square number so you can write what's this number here six square then what about tenth one and eleventh triangle you are getting xi square number you can write 10 1 plus xi 1 you get xi square Arnim 21st and the 22nd but you get 21st triangular number and 22nd triangular number you get 22nd square number 20 or we can write in numbers 22nd square 33rd triangular number and 34th triangular number you are getting 34th square you can do this is 33 33rd triangular number and 34th triangular number you are getting thirty fourth square no so that's the relationship between triangular numbers and the square numbers now we will look at example number 1 in your textbook write the terms of each of the following number patterns the number pattern of the prime numbers between 1 and 17 written in ascending order so what are prime numbers only divisible by 1 and itself what's the lowest prime number 2 so you can write down to then what's the next prime number 3 5 7 11 13 14 15 16 then 17 but can we write down 17 it says in between in between means between means 1 and 17 not included so you can't write 17 there so ascending order means lowest to highest second one the number pattern of the odd number starting from one written in ascending order just the odd numbers 1 3 5 7 11 13 all numbers so what we do we have to put three dots to represent this is continuing third one the 
,,number pattern starting from 1 and followed by the terms two and one written alternatively so as to when one separately starting from one and followed by the terms so starting from one followed by the terms two and one written alternately 2 1 2 look again 1 2 so that's another number pad so we can put three dots to represent this is continuing exercise 1.1 fill in the blanks in the number pattern 1 3 5 7 9 what's the first term 1 second term is 3/4 - 1 2 3 4 that's seven in the number pattern 4 8 12 16 20 multiples of 4 the first term is 4 second term that's 8 and the third term is 12 question number two write the terms of each of the following number 
,,patterns the number pattern of the even numbers between one and nine written in ascending order so what's the first number even numbers 2 4 6 8 10 10 you can write because this is in between these 1 & 9 so this is in ascending order so that's up to this point next one the number pattern of the multiples of 6 from 6 to 36 written in ascending order so multiples of 6 to 36 means you can write 36 as well 6 times 2 12 6 times 3 18 24 6 times 5 30 6 times 6 36 the number pattern of the even numbers greater than 7 written in ascending order greater than 7 means above 7 so what's the lowest even number 8 starting from 8 you can write 8 10 12 like that so this is continuing with 3 dots the number pattern of the prime number starting from 2 written in ascending order so starting from 2 what are the prime numbers 2 3 5 7 like that this is not ending in finite number pattern so you can put three dots question number three copy the below given statements in your exercise book and mark the correct statements with a correct or incorrect symbol we'll take the first one the terms of a number patent have to be in ascending order tick ten eight six like that that's not in ascending order that's descending order that's also a number pattern so the first one is wrong because no need to be always in ascending order second one the terms of a number patent have to be different from each other no because five five five this is also number pattern so no need to be different to each other so here this is also wrong third one if the tenth term of two number patterns are different then the two number patterns are different to each other so think about you have two number sets number patterns tenth term here you got five hundred something here the tenth term is two hundred so different so different means the two 
,,number patterns are different so it says if the tenth term of two number patterns are different then the two number patterns are different so that's true example number one consider number pattern of the multiples of two starting from two written in ascending order so when you write down the number pattern this is two four six eight like that multiples of to find 11th term so what's the general term we know multiples of two the general term is two ends then using the general term you can answer these questions eleventh term so have you find out the 11th term substitute 11 for you get 2200 third term 2 times 103 you get 206 then the last part find which term is hot so 128 of this number pattern that means we know the general term is to win that's given as 728 so how we find out in divide this by to say 128 divided 
,,by 2 2 times 3 6 6 4 12 and 4 for 8 360 fourth term that's multiple of 2 is 728 example number 2 the general term of the number pattern of the multiples of 3 starting from 3 and written in ascending order is 3 so already given so we can write down 3 6 9 12 like that so nth term is given or the general term is 3 in first part find the 13th term so I will find out the 13th term substitute 13 in 9 so 39 then part to find which term is 87 so 87 is equal to three yen so how do you find out n divided by three so in so I'll rewrite this in other way rock three and means eighty-seven divided by 3 you get in eighty seven divided by three twenty ninth term is 87 in other words twenty nine multiple of three is 87 example number three in the number pattern of the multiples of four starting from four and written in ascending order with general term for so general term is given for then what's the chapter tenth term means and B equals can write substitute and nickel step four times 10 that means what part two what is the 11th term so 11th term just substitute in equals 11 four times 11 you get 44 which term is hundred so this is continuation so this is about multiples of four four which term is 100 so in this one in term is given for n means given 100 divided by four to get and when you divide by 4 you get 25 so 
,,25 fifth multiples of 4 is 100 is 43 a term of this number pattern what are the reasons for your answer okay we'll check whether 43 in this number pattern for N equals 43 you divide by four what happens you get ten yeah one and here nothing and three remaining out of four you're getting a fraction for n what is n means number of terms can you get a fraction for a number of terms you can't get a fraction so that's why so 43 is not in the number pattern so here we can write in either fraction there are 4 43 is not in this exercise 1.2 copy the table given below and complete it number pattern first term and the generator so what's the first term here hi these are multiples of 5 so what's the general term 5 in multiples of 2 that's 2 with multiples of 3 3 multiple of ten that's ten named this is 10 20 multiples of 10 
,,starting from 10 you can write 10 in 8 16 24 32 multiples of 8 starting from a twister this is 8 n these are multiples of 7 starting from 7 7 and what about this one multiples of 12 starting from 12 that's 12 in and 1 2 3 4 multiples of once so starting from 1 this is 1 in oh you can write without one just in question number to 
,,write the number pattern of the multiples of 5 between three and thirty-three written in ascending order so starting from three to 33 in between so what's the first 
,,multiple of five five five times to 10 five times three 15 20 25 30 35 but you can't write 35 this should be in between 3 and 33 so up to this point so this is a finite number partner question number three in the number pattern 11 22 33 of the multiples of 11 starting from 11 and written in descending order what is the general term we already know the general term is 11 and what is the 9th term you substitute in equals nice 11 times 9 that's 99 which term is 121 now we know the general term 11 M equals 120 1 when you divide by 11 you get N equals 11 11th multiple of 11 is 125 fourth one in the number pattern 9 18 27 36 of the multiples of 9 starting from 9 and written in ascending order what is the general term now you already know multiples of 9 the general term is 9 end what is the element job substitute in equals 1199 third part which term is 217 e now we know the general term is 9 in equate to 270 so when you divide by 9 what you get xxx term is 270 question number five in the number pattern with general term hundred in so you have given general term as hundred what is the eleventh term so 11th term means you're substituting in equals eleven hundred times you never you get 1100 part two which term is 500 that means 100 N equals 500 when you divide by hundred you get fifth term is 500 question number six what is the smallest multiple of three larger than 100 which term is it in the number pattern of the multiples of three starting from three okay so larger than 100 101 check whether it's divisible divided by 3 3 times 3 9 4 11 you can't you can't divide by 3 102 3 times 3 9 12 12 is divisible by 3 so what's the lowest number multiple of 3 after 100 that's 102 which term is it in the number pattern of the multiples of 3 starting from 3 so 3 6 9 like that they are asking which term is 102 so that means we know these are multiples of 3 what's the general term 3 n so we can equate 3n equals 102 so what's a divided by 3 you get 34 so 34 multiple of 3 is hundred - question number 7 what's the nth term that's basically general term of the pattern of the even numbers greater than 1 but less than 200 greater than 
,,1 what's the lowest multiple of 2 that's 2 for each like that what's the largest number less than 200 you can't write 200 so one before that 198 this is in ascending order smallest to largest the smallest value of n is 1 we know n V equals 1 you get the first what is its largest value that means you are that means you need to find the value of n 498 so we can write 2 N equals hundred ninety-eight divided by 2 so that means 99th term is 198 question number eight it has been estimated that in a country having a population of 2 million people the population will increase by 2 million every 25 years estimate the population of the country in 200 years so first thing we need to find out how many years are there how many steps are there for 200 years so every 25 years it's increasing so find out how many times it's changing 200 divided by 25 is 8 so that means 8 times it's changing so starting from 2 million so I'll write millions here so starting from 2 after first 25 years this becomes 4 million adding 2 million every 25 years so they're asking if this is 200 years not the population if this is 200 years that means if this is 200 years that means 8 times this is increasing so that means 8 turn 8 term of this sequence so after 50 years this becomes 6 million so this is the sequence we know these are multiples of 2 so what's the general term that's 2 when so you need 8 term what's the eighth term 2 times 8 that's 16 so these are in millions so we can write 16 million 
,,people after 200 years example number four in the pattern of the odd numbers starting from one what is the general term so one three five seven what are those odd numbers we found out even numbers the pattern is 2n odd numbers you can get it from subtracting one from even numbers so what's the general term of odd numbers - in - 
,,we'll do the second part part 2 what is the 72nd term so we know the general term is 2 n minus 1 so 70 second term is n V equals 72 so substitute you get 2 times 72 
,,minus 1/2 times 2 for 2 times 7 14 minus 1 you get 143 so 70 second term is 143 third part which term is 51 this is about odd number so general term is 2 n minus 1 that's equal to 55 add 1 to get rid of this one and then you get 2n equals 52 divided by 2 you get 2 times 2 4 4 12 that's six twenty sixth term is 51 exercise 1.3 in the pattern of the odd numbers starting from one and written in ascending order what is the twelfth term so what are the numbers 1 3 5 those are the odd numbers what's the general term for numbers we know that general term is 2 and minus 1 you can use that general term you are asked to find out 12th term 12 term means you substitute 12 in and you get 23 for that and what's the fifteenth term 15 term you substitute N equals 15 30 minus 1 you get 29 part 3 which term is 89 is all about odd numbers so we can write down n star is 89 add 1 you get 90 equals to n divided by 2 you get 90 divided by 2 45 part 4 which term is the greatest odd number less than 
,,100 what's the odd number greatest or number 99 so 99 is the largest or number less than 100 question number 2 find the value of the sum of the 34th term of the pattern of the even number starting from two and the 34th term of the pattern of the odd number starting from what so there are two patterns here what's the first pattern even numbers so starting from two so two four six like that so you are taking thirty fourth term of the even number and the thirty fourth term of them odd numbers 
,,what are numbers one for what are numbers one three five seven so they asking thirty fourth after odd number as well and first you need to find out thirty fourth term separately I'll take the total because you need the sum okay so we know the general term of the even numbers is to it then which term you need thirty fourth term N equals 34 you get sixty eight in this sequence odd numbers what's the general term one less they're even numbers to win minus one so what's thirty fourth term of that two times 34 minus 1 you get 67 now they asking what's the sum of these two values so 68 plus sixty seven hundred thirty-five exercise 1.4 what is the 10th term of the square number pattern starting from 1 and written in ascending order can you remember the general term of a square number general term of square numbers N squared now they asking temperature so starting from here you have to always look at the starting point so 1/4 like that so when you take the square numbers 1 squared 2 
,,squared 4 3 squared 9 so what's the 10th term 10th term you substitute 10 10 squared means 10 times 10 hundred question number two what is the tenth term of the triangular number pattern starting from one and written in ascending order so what are triangular numbers 1 plus 2 3 3 plus 3 6 6 plus 4 10 10 plus 5 15 and what's the general term of triangular numbers we found that general term for triangular numbers are in n plus 1 over 2 now we need till term 10th triangular number substitute 10 for n 10 times 10 plus 1 divided by 2 or you can write 10 times 11 divided by 2 2 times 5 11 times 5 is 55 question number 3 a certain number greater than 1 less than 50 which is a term of the square number pattern starting from 1 so 1 2 squared is 4 so like wise this is less than 50 and written this is in green and written in 
,,ascending order is also a term of the triangular number pattern starting from 1 and written in ascending order so in triangular numbers 1 1 plus 2 3 3 plus 3 6 like 
,,that 10 15 these are triangular numbers so one term is in both number partners what is this term so they are asking what is this term we know what's the general term of square numbers we know that's N squared what's the general term of triangular number in n plus 1 divided by 2 if one number in both number patterns these two are equal so we can take N squared is equal to in n plus 1 over 2 now what can I do I can multiply both sides by 2 to get cancel out I get 2 N squared is equal to expand brackets you get N squared n into n n squared n into 1 that's plus N when you take this term to this side 2 N squared minus n square what you get these are like terms I can ride to n square minus N squared is equal to n so N squared is equal to n so I can divide this by n you get N equals 1 so only number belongs to both is N 
,,equals 1 so we can write N equals 1 is there term belongs to both of these number factors square number as well as a triangular number question number 3 a certain number greater than 1 and less than 50 which is a term of the square number pattern starting from 1 L written in ascending order is also a term of the triangular number pattern starting from 1 and written in ascending order so we'll take square numbers first starting from 1 for 2 squared 9 16 4 squared 5 squared 25 6 squared 36 7 
,,squared 49 because up to 49 because this is less than 50 if you take triangular numbers when you take triangular numbers starting from 1 1 plus 2 3 3 plus 3 you get 
,,6 6 plus 4 10 10 plus 55 15 15 plus 6 21:21 plus seven twenty eight twenty eight plus eight 36 36 Plus 9 45 and 45 plus ten 55 you can't write 55 because this is less than 50 so these are the square numbers and these are the triangular numbers and they asking one number is there in both sequence greater than one so don't consider one day are other than one there's another number which numbers in both sequence 36 so 36 is the term in both number patterns which square number is it one two three four five six six square number which triangular number is it one two three four five six seven eight eight triangular question number four the sum of the fourteenth and fifteen terms of the triangular number pattern starting from one is a square number show that this statement is true and find which term it is of the square 
,,number pad fourteen and fifteen triangular numbers and this is the sum can you remember the pattern we observed first triangular number and the second triangular number is equal to the second square number if you take eight one and ninth number of the triangular numbers the sum is equal to the ninth square number now they're asking fourteenth triangular number and the fifteenth triangular number is which one fifteen square number so when you take this one this is the square number you get 15 square number so is this statement correct the sum of two triangular numbers these are consecutive two triangular numbers that's equal to a square number so the statement is true can dried statement is true and find the term it is of the square number pattern find which term so which term is that fifteen square question number five write the total number of triangles in each figure in order and see whether you can identify the pattern the pattern of the total number of triangles in the figures in the the given order is identical to the pattern of triangular numbers starting from one L written in ascending order find the total number of triangles in the eighth figure that is drawn according to this pattern so we need to find out how many triangles are there first diagram how many triangles are there just one triangle this one one two and we can take the bigger one that's three this one one two three four five six what about this one first we'll count small numbers small triangles one two three four if you take two at a time one two three so 4 plus 3 7 and then 7 8 9 and the bigger one that's 10 so these are the number of triangles inside these diagrams the pattern of the total number of triangles in the figure in the given order is identical to the pattern of the triangular number starting from 1 and written in ascending order so we found out these are triangular numbers find the total number of triangles in the eighth figure so we'll see what's the total number of triangles so we can find out that term we already know in into n plus 1/2 if you want the a trigger so that means eighth term in equals 8 8 times 8 + 1 9 divided by 2 2 times 1/2 times 4 that means 36 so you can write there are 36 triangles in the eighth trigger question number 6 sigh uni buys a till and start saving money by putting 1 rupee into it on the first day so 1 so 1 rupee first day on the second day she puts 2 rupees so second day she puts 2 rupees means the total is 2 plus 
,,1 333 rupees so increasing 3 plus 3 6 and so how much money is in the till by the end of the tenth day now what's this button these are triangular numbers 1 3 6 next day 4 rupees 6 plus 4 10 so these are triangular numbers you can apply the general term so what's the general term of triangular numbers and mean 2n plus 1 divided 
,,by 2 now they ask what's the value and of 10th day so 10th term turn into 11 divided by 2 divided by 2 you get 55 that means 55 rupees in the 1030 so siren approached 55 rupees in the tank miscellaneous exercise in the pattern of the odd number starting from 1 commencing from the first term if the first two terms then the first 
,,three terms then the first four terms are added and continued accordingly a special type of numbers is obtained what is the special name given to these numbers find 
,,the number that is obtained if 15 of these terms are added in order to in order starting from the first term so read it carefully in the pattern of the odd number starting from 1 1 3 5 like that 7 commencing from the first term if the first two terms first is 1 first 2 terms what's the addition of first 2 terms you get for first 3 terms five five plus three eight eight plus one nice first four terms nine plus seven 16 what you get what are these numbers these are square numbers so what is the special name for this these are square numbers find the number that is obtained if 15 of these terms I added that means you're asking to find out the fifteenth - 
,,so 15th term you can use the general term so general term of the square numbers is equal to N squared the fifteenth term is 15 squared that means 15 times 15 220 question number two milk things brought to a shop to be sold were arranged on a rack in the following manner ten teens on the lowest shelf and every other shelf having 
,,one chin less than the number on the shelf below one ting on the top most shop so one next one adding so two three like that what's the lowest one that's ten things 
,,so this is like a triangle okay be right this way first shelf one second shelf two teens third shelf three teens like that last shelf the bottom shelf that's ten find a number of milk tins that were brought to the shop so that means adding all these numbers so what's the sum you can add 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus 4 plus 5 plus 6 plus 
,,seven plus eight plus nine plus ten can you remember what's the pattern there this is like one to ten addition that means this is like tenth trying unit number finding tenth triangular number so without adding up to ten you can just do this is tenth triangular number what's the generator general term of the triangular number is 
,,n into n plus one Oh - it's a substitute ten ten into eleven divided by 2 you get fifty five tins are there by two all the milk tins on the four topmost shelves were sold within two weeks find the number of milk tins that were sold so first four means 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus 4 that means fourth triangular number will substitute to 
,,the formula in equals 4 4 times 5 divided by 2 you get 10 so this is the number of teens sold within two weeks so what's the so they're asking the number of milk teens that were sold so number number of teens sold is question number three what is the sum of the integers from 1 to 31 - like that they are asking what's the sum of 
,,all digits up to 30 so we know 1 + 2 + 3 up to 30 is the 30th triangular number general term of the triangular number is n into n plus 1 divided by 2 now substitute 
,,30 there what you get divided by 2 you get 15 times 31 multiply 30 1 times 15 multiply 10 and 5 you get 5 times 1 5 5 times 3 15 465 so sum of all digits 1 - 30 is 465 so we covered all theory related to number patterns let's your first unit we'll see what we did so we did an expression in in obtain for the intern how to find out the general term and then we did always in should be a positive whole number starting from 1 you can't get fraction 4 in then the next one general term of multiples of 2 you got to win general term of odd numbers subtract 1 from that that's 2n minus 1 general term of square numbers that's N squared finally we did general term 
,,of triangular numbers that's n into n plus 1 over 2 and also we observed another thing when you add two consecutive triangular numbers you will get a square number if it's first one and second one addition of triangular numbers you get second square number eight one and ninth one triangular numbers you get nine square not so remember all these and practice with all exercises and examples when you practice you can master in number patterns

Number Partens,wfAyddSr9_w,patterns patterns are created when figures shapes objects etc are arranged in a particular order and repeated over and over again we all must have seen the different kinds of patterns in our daily life like on clothes bedsheets sari borders Garland's etc look at the bracelet we have a square circle triangle square circle triangle and so on this is called a pattern as it is repeating itself look we got the pattern now let us try making few more patterns look at this bag of flashcards each card has a pattern of dots look we have arranged few cards according to the increasing order of the dots starting with a card with two dots three dots for dots five dots kid let us follow the same pattern and find out the next four cards yes correct the next card will be with six dots then seven dots then eight dots and lastly nine dots kids isn't it interesting we can find pattern in letters too now observe the given pattern and write the next four letters we can see that letter E and letter B are placed alternatively this becomes our pattern so the next letter will be letter A then letter B then again letter A and lastly letter B did you know we find patterns in numbers also let's see how starting with number two when we skip count by twos we get four six eight denne 12 14 and 16 now observe the given pattern and 
,,write the next four numbers look at the pattern carefully what can you observe correct on subtracting four from 40 we get 36 which is the next number now again on subtracting four from 36 we get the next number that is 32 we see that in each step the numbers are reducing by 4 hence by using this number pattern we can find the next four numbers so we get the four numbers as 28 24 20 and 16 wasn't it fun learning about patterns

Number Partens,Jd0Hzyc1SMk,today let us revise and understand more about Roman numerals we know that the ancient Romans used letters to write numbers even today the building date on monuments 
,,and public buildings is marked in Roman numerals and we also use Roman numerals in clocks and watches here are the letters used to write the numbers the symbol I is 
,,"equal to 1 V is equal to 5 X is equal to 10 n is equal to 50 C is equal to 100 D is equal to 500 and M is equal to 1000 we need to remember three rules while writing the Roman numerals one rule of repetition - rule of addition 3 rule of subtraction let us learn each rule one by one rule one rule of repetition one when a symbol is repeated twice or thrice its value is multiplied by two or three respectively for example M is equal to 1000 M M is equal to 1000 multiplied by 2 is equal to 2,000 m m M is equal to 1,000 multiplied by three is equal to 3000 to symbol I X C and M can be repeated three times at maximum for example we can write 1 as I - as I I and 3 as i i i in roman system but we cannot write 4 as i i i i 3 the symbols v l and d are never repeated that is symbols for 550 and 510 not be repeated this means "
,,that we do not write the number 10 by repeating v but as x now let us look at the second rule rule 2 rule of addition if a symbol of smaller value is written to the 
,,right of a symbol of higher value we add the smaller value to the greater value let us consider X I X has a value of 10 I has a value of 1 so the hindu-arabic number for this Roman number is 11 finally we have the third rule rule 3 rule of subtraction 1 if a symbol of smaller value is to the left of a symbol of higher value we subtract the smaller value from the higher value for example let us take the number X see X has the value of 10 and 3 has a value of 100 so X C will be 100 minus 10 is equal to 92 the symbols V L and D cannot be subtracted from any number for example 95 cannot be written as 100 minus 5 is equal to V CE 95 should be written as 90 
,,"plus 5 is equal to X C v 3i x and C are used to subtract there are just six combinations IV is equal to 5 minus 1 is equal to 4 I X is equal to 10 minus 1 is equal to 9 X L is equal to 50 minus 10 is equal to 40 X C is equal to 100 minus 10 is equal to 90 C D is equal to 500 minus 100 is equal to 400 C M is equal to 1,000 minus "
,,100 is equal to 900 now if larger Roman numerals are given how do we read and write them look at example 1 what is M cm x XX i equal to keeping in mind the rules explained earlier we first write this number in two thousands hundreds tens and ones as M plus cm plus X xx plus I in order to solve it further now let us write down the values of the respective numerals the value of M is equal to one thousand cm is 1000 minus 100 which is equal to 900 X X X is 10 plus 10 plus 10 which is equal to 
,,30 and lastly the value of I is equal to one on adding one thousand plus 900 plus 30 plus one we get the answer as 1931 now let us look at another example right 3817 in Roman numeral we first write the number 3817 in expanded notation as three thousand plus 800 plus ten plus seven now write the Roman numeral values of each that 
,,is 3000 as mmm 800 as d si si si 10 as X and 7 as V I I which is equal to M mm d si si si x/v aye aye Wow it was so much fun to learn Roman numerals

Number Partens,gmR6R910Wjc,welcome to the Roman Empire Wow it is so big and beautiful Hey look who's that she is Fabia a girl from the Roman Empire hi friends I am so excited to tell you about the Roman numerals you all use digits zero one two three four five six seven eight and nine to build bigger numbers but in ancient Rome we used letters called Roman numerals to name numbers you still use Roman numerals mostly for clocks and dates three of the letters used are I V and X come I will show you how these three letters are used to write the numbers 1 to 20 in Roman numerals one is written as I the letter AI means one - is written as I I it means 1+1 3 is written as aye-aye-aye it means 1 plus 1 plus 1 poor is written as I V it means 5-1 five is written as V letter V means five six is written as V I it means five plus one seven is written as V I I it means five plus two eight is written as V I I I it means five plus three 9 is written as I X it means 10-1 next is the number 10 10 is written with single 
,,X X means number 10 eleven is written as X I it means ten plus 112 is written as X I I it means ten plus two 13 is written as X I I I it means 10 plus 3 14 is written as X I V it means 10 plus 4 next is 15 it is written as X V it means 10 plus 5 16 is written as X V I it means 10 plus 6 17 is written as X V I I it means 10 plus 
,,7 18 is written as X V I I I it means 10 Plus 8 19 is written as X I X it means 10 plus 9 20 is written as X X it means 10 plus 10 now let us read study and write the following standard numbers and there Roman numerals we have already seen how the letters I V and X are used to write the Roman numerals now we will use one more letter to write slightly bigger numbers the letter is L look at this chart it shows us how the numbers 10 20 30 40 and 50 are written we have already learned the Roman numerals from 1 to 20 let us look at the number 30 it is written as X X X it means 10 plus 10 plus 10 next is number 40 it is written as X L it means 50 minus 10 lastly number 50 it is written with a single L the letter L means 50 let us see how to write Roman numerals look at the number 38 - right 38 we need 30 and 8 so we write 30 as X X X and 8 as V aye-aye-aye therefore 38 is written as X X X V aye-aye-aye now let us look at one more example look at number 44 - right 44 we need 40 and 
,,4 so we write 40 as Excel and pour as I V so 44 is written as Excel I be I hope you had fun learning about the Roman numerals and how to write them with me I know I 
,,certainly enjoyed myself all the best

Number Partens,41eVMYPCWTQ,today let us learn prime and composite numbers before we begin let us understand what do we mean by natural numbers the set of numbers 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and so on are 
,,called natural numbers natural numbers can be divided into prime numbers and composite numbers before we proceed ahead remember that any given number will always have one and itself as its factors now let us start with prime numbers look at the examples the factors of 3 are 1 and 3 the factors of 11 are 1 and 11 the factors of 17 are 1 and 17 all these numbers have only two factors one and the number itself such numbers are called prime numbers thus prime numbers are natural numbers that have only two factors one and the number itself composite numbers look at the examples the factors of 6 are 1 2 3 & 6 the factors of 14 are 1 2 7 and 14 the factors of 20 are 1 2 5 10 and 20 all the above numbers have more than two factors these numbers are called composite numbers thus composite numbers are natural numbers that have more than two factors remember these points one is neither prime nor composite as it has only one factor two is the smallest and the only even prime number three is the smallest odd prime number now why don't you list all the prime and composite numbers from 1 to 100

Number Partens,Z5ISJUxKOpk,degrees of comparison an adjective of quality changes its form when it is used to compare one noun with another it is called the degree of comparison of an adjective there are three degrees of comparison the positive degree the comparative degree the superlative degree the positive degree is used to refer to one object person or place without making any comparison for example she has a big house the comparative degree refers to a greater degree of adjectives as compared to the positive degree it is used to compare two objects people or places for example her house is bigger than my house the superlative degree refers to the greatest degree of adjectives it is used to compare more than two objects people or places for example his house is the biggest of all in order to form comparative and superlative degrees of adjectives remember the following rules we add ER and est to most one or two syllable words that end in consonants for example dull duller dullest when the positive ends in E we add only R and s T to the adjective for example large larger largest when the positive ends in consonant + y we drop the Y and add ier and iest for example lucky luckier luckiest when the positive is a word of one syllable that ends in vowel + consonant we double the ending consonant and then add ER and est for example red redder reddest when the positive is long that is is a word of two or more syllables we add more and most before the adjective to form comparative and superlative degrees for example useful more useful most useful there are some objectives that do not form the comparators and superlatives from their positives they have irregular degrees of comparison for example good better best we use than with a comparative degree use the with a superlative degree for example Mohan is shorter than Ricky Phalguni is the shortest girl in her class

Number Partens,k6G-MBQQ_co,today let us learn rounding numbers in many instances exact numbers are not necessary or even desirable at such times approximations are given this is when rounding 
,,a number helps us let us look at an example to understand it in a better way 19600 18 students from Delhi attended a football coaching camp while 17300 students from Mumbai attended the camp now here we can round these figures to the nearest thousand and see twenty thousand students from Delhi attended the camp while seventeen thousand students from Mumbai attended the camp we round up numbers to get the estimated length expenses distance etc and even to find the estimated sum difference product and quotient first let me teach you rounding numbers to the nearest thousand look at the given number to round this number to the nearest thousand we need to follow two simple steps step one look at the digit to the right of the thousands place if this digit is five or more than five then add one to the digit in the thousands place here the digit is 7 which we know is greater than five therefore eight changes to nine step to change all the digits to the right of the thousands place to zero so the rounded up number is four lakh thirty-nine thousand now let us look at another example round 35 lack 30 1461 to the nearest thousand first look at the digit to the right of the thousands place which is four here now as for is smaller than five we leave the digit in the thousands place as it is therefore one remains 
,,as one itself next change all the digits to the right of the thousands place to zero yes we got the answer 35 lakh thirty one thousand now let us see rounding a number to any given place we can round a number to any given place that is tens hundredths ten thousands and so on by following the same steps as mentioned for the thousands place let us take 14 lakh fifty four thousand six hundred fifty-eight and then round this number to different given places let us start with the tenth place here the digit to the right of five is eight which is greater than five so we add one to five change all the digits to the right of the tens place to zero so the rounded up number is 14 lakh fifty four thousand six hundred sixty next is the hundredths place here the digit to the right of six is five as the rule is that if the digit is 5 or more than 5 we have to add 1 to the digit in the place being rounded up hence we add 1 to 6 change all the digits to the right of the hundredths place to 0 
,,"so the rounded up number is 14 lakh 50 4,700 when the number is rounded to the nearest thousand we get 14 lakh 55,000 when the number is rounded to the nearest 10,000 we get 14 lakh 50,000 when the number is rounded to the nearest lakh we get 15 lakh and finally when it is rounded to the nearest 10 lakh we get 10 lakh so kids remember these two points and it would be easy for you to get the estimated values if the digit to the right of the given place is 5 or more than 5 then add 1 to the digit in the given place and if the digit is less than five leave the digit in the given place as it is"

Number Partens,JYgHgM9dB1E,syllables a syllable is a complete word or a part of a word with one vowel sound for example frog the vowel heard in a syllable could be from one or more vowel letters for example boat sometimes the letter by makes a vowel sound for example cry butterfly the number of vowels heard in a word equals the number of syllables in the 
,,word for example string nights are one syllable words where only one vowel sound can be heard Rapp kits and 10 miss are two syllable words where two vowel sounds are heard a word can have a closed syllable or an open syllable or both a closed syllable ends in a consonant or a consonant blend the vowel sound is mostly short for example cap splash an open syllable ends in a vowel or letter or letters making a vowel sound the vowel sound is mostly long for example shoe spy a long vowel mostly 
,,says its own name when a syllable ends in a silent e the vowel in the syllable has a long sound for example glide snake you

Number Partens,-3k8ptUqICA,did I gents I hope you guys are doing role and that you're managing during this lockdown period I'm driving the parents up for whoa I thought I just put a short lesson together of this number pattern section that is also in your textbooks there might be a few areas that you're not too sure about hopefully this all are not those 
,,issues and help you to completely understand there are a few things in the section that are pretty simple that I'm sure you guys already know how to do so I can spend too much time on that I'm going to be focusing more on the work concerning the general rule and number patterns okay so let's get started this will be familiar to 
,,you because this is from your textbook in the section of there are a few things first of all identify pattern or relationship between consecutive terms in order to extend the pattern that's the easy part make a general rule about the pattern with which you can find consecutive terms that's what I'm going to be focusing on the most now and work with geometric patterns links quite wrong with the previous one okay so a few examples of identifying the pattern and extending it here you can see we have all of terms er particular terms get these are called terms and they have positions as well one two three four five six you see there that are going up bar - 
,,maybe term is going up by two so he's heading to every term so the next number of the 14 will be 14 plus 2 which is 16 and just show another yeah we've clearly yeah 
,,we have another pattern goes from 3 to 7 to 11 to 15 so it's pretty clear that it's going up up for every time so to get the next term off the 15 you add 4 we'll get 19 and then you're off the 19 you add for gang and get to any needed 3 etc third one is a little bit different because it's not additional subtraction all we have multiplication so you go from 1 to 3 you have to multiply by 3 from 3 to 9 you multiple three and nine to 27 lost power 3 so to go from 27 to the next term you have to multiply by 3 and you'll get 81 you know do the same with 81 to get to the next term if you want to yeah we just have a pattern involving shapes so yeah we have these to be shapes here and you see going to be adding to here going from 1 1 tone 1 squared - 3 squeeze you have to add 2 or 3 squares to 6 squares you have to add 3 
,,so you added to you at a 3 thanks oh I ain't going to add 4 you see over here then the one after that before we going to add 5 ok yeah we just have some fractions makes a little bit more interesting we see the numerator numerator adding 1 every time we have - 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 the denominator starting with F 3 and adding before every time so as it shows you add 1 to the numerator every time and then add 4 to the denominator okay I'm not going to go too much into this next one yeah it's just exercise 1 yeah identify the relationship between the consecutive terms I write down the next to turn that is the easy part it's not that hard to identify a pattern and the until you determine the consecutive terms I'm pretty sure you guys are able to do this on your own and if you're stuck weasel in the night okay so the more challenging part is finding the general rule for pattern but I'm going to explain it to you and I'm pretty sure you get it do you cookie if you haven't done so already okay so the general rule for number patterns it shows the relationship between the term at its position than the sequence we often refer to the true as T in or the in - so we'll you'll see a few symbols here and I will explain what those symbols mean because I do have a specific meaning so when when we do number patterns one of the most common ones we refined our ones with a constant difference between the terms so most of the ones we've looked at already have that type of sequence so if the sequence IV a go from 2 to 7 for 7 to 12 and 12 to 17 in other words you're adding far every time so that is your constant difference okay constant because it's the same thank you Tom so adding 5 every time so what do these symbols mean here T is abandoned one is representing the position so it's the value of the first two this one is the value of the second to the value of the third value of the fourth term in which we see over here in represents the position but like I said here that's in usually so that position is the first one but T is the value if you understand that it'll really help you a lot going forward and don't only get confused between the two so here what they're saying is the value of the fourth one minus the value of the third one is equal to the value of the third one minus the value of the second one which is equal to the value of the second one - that ideally the first one gives you far this is the wildest rating that they have a constant difference but you don't you know that you won't be lost that sort of question or to write that out on a test that's just a way of showing you at the constant difference is 5 ok so 
,,let's do an example here we have sequence 3 270 11 to 15 determine the general rule of the sequence from si the general rule that's another way of writing it in symbolic form ok the general rule so how do we do that like we sort of the previous example you look for a constant difference so what is the difference between each turn and is it constant in this case it is we have we are adding for every time and by the way constant difference isn't always addition it can be subtraction so if this is written the other way around 15 11 7 3 then our constant difference wouldn't beat plus 4 between minus 4 okay let's deal with the first question before we get to regions adding 4 that is your constant difference so remember you'll general over here TN is equal to 4 n minus 1 that's your answer but you will you're going to start off with the difference the difference is full okay so you're right down to write down 4 that's it that's all you need right done and then it's always going to 
,,be 4 times in so it's always going to do the constant difference Tom's in now what is in in is the position so you can pick any one of these as long as you write substitute the position and then so let's take the first position now this is the first term so this position is 1 so you put full Tom's 1 what is for Tomba 1/4 but with a value of the first position is multiple the value of the first position is 3 so you put 3 in there so you've got like a little equation wrong so 3 equals 4 so what unless you do to this 4 because 3 doesn't equal 4 3 equals 4 minus 1 so this minus 1 over here you need to work out it is not going to be given to you it's not always going to be minus 1 sometimes when you plus 2 u plus 5 or minus 6 it can be anything the point is you get this value by applying the method that I just explained so let's recap the first thing you do if you get asked to determine the general find the constant difference the constant difference in this case is full so you're right down to four okay and then four times in so you pick any position I usually pick one so four times one okay but then you write the value you have to write the value of that position on this side of the equal sign TN remember T stands for the value so you've got three here equals four now you need to do something to this four times one to get it to equal the side of the equals R otherwise this equal sign means nothing and that equals means that's the same so you've got three equals full and then it's going to have to be minus one to be current or a chance all right that makes sense what letter to Ward's on is just not find the 58 turn in the pattern using the general rule is the next question so 58th turn that's its position we need to find the value of that to so we remove position must go in the place of in because in represent position so then you're going to write 58 in ins place so you will have to say four times 58 minus one and that is going to give you your value of this of the X term which is 231 so the value or the 58th term is 231 but they can also ask you the other way around like this which term in the sequence has a value of 30 on so now you don't put that 39 in the in position because in represent position this is a value so you have to put it in T's places so you have to put it in this on this side okay so if we scroll down you'll see four n minus one equals 39 so that means if you take that one away that means you have to add one to the side so you get four in equals 40 now what Tom's full gives you 40 because that's what ins position is 4 times 10 gives you 14 so in equals 10 what does that mean what does it mean of in is 10 that means the position of this value is thin so they said which term in the sequence has a value of 59 so we know that the 10th term in this sequence will have the value of 39 this saves you Tom you don't have to write out the sequence until you get to the 10th term does that make sense because we can ask you much bigger numbers that are going to take you very long to add out the sequence in order to get you the 10th term or whatever term it is here's another example that we're gonna have a look at given the sequence determine the general rule so you see this is a common question well what is the first thing we need to do I 
,,put it above you have to look for the constant difference what is the constant difference here to go from negative 2 to negative 5 and from negative 5 to negative anything from negative a to negative 11 you have to subtract 3 you subtract 3 from the negative 2 you get negative 5 etc so that is a constant difference negative 3 so you write down negative 3 Tom's 1 that would be the position the so if your first if you choose your first position where negative 3 time to 1 but the first positions value over there is negative 2 a negative 3 times 1 equals negative 3 not negative 2 so what do we need to do to negative 3 to get it to the end of T we have to add 1 so that answers our question yet so T end will equal negative 3 in plus 1 now can use that general rule to answer the questions that follow and here's a lovely 
,,exercise which you guys can do that will help you to apply the list of the defender guarding general rule yeah they give you the general rule already so that's not too bad they've given it they've given it to you're ready and you need to determine the first three terms so let's have a look at this tricky if you put the first term would be position one so you put one in the inter-basin can we call it a substitution like when you substitute someone on the sports would you replace them so you 
,,replace their in with one that'll give you one plus two which will give you the value of the first term which is three then you substitute 2 in a for the second term so two plus two is four and then for the third term you three plus two is five so you get it was three four and five and you do the same for all of these to get the value in first three terms to determine the hundreth term you put a hundred in here a hundred plus two it's going to be a hundred and two for question two point one okay I know I've gone through this change by quickly image it's quite difficult sometimes to explain without writing on that on a whiteboard to you what I'm thinking but gentlemen you're and feel free to ask me any questions in the comment section of this video or you are walking to send me a private message and I'll get back to you right over this

Number Partens,f4c8izcEX4s,hello graduate children today i'm here to teach you chapter four in your textbook that's directed numbers we can call it directed numbers as well so we'll see what are the basics here what is this one what what you call this one this is a number line so starting point is 0 and then towards the right hand side you get positive numbers towards left hand side you get negative numbers so 0 plus 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4 like that towards this side to the right side minus 1 minus 2 minus 3 to the left side of 0. what about in between in between means any decimals or fractions in between the whole numbers but only we mark the integers half 0.5 is in between 0 and 1. so any fraction or decimal in between the integers now what are these plus 1 plus 1.2 plus 3.5 these are directed numbers there's a direction that's why we use plus or minus so here it's better to write directed numbers in brackets because we can see that whether it's towards positive side or towards negative side now here use plus for addition and subtraction we use minus sign so therefore it is better to write directed numbers in brackets so here minus 3 means to the left side of 0 
,,3 units to the left plus 8 means towards right hand side plus 5 towards right hand side minus 4 towards left hand side so when you want to show directed numbers sign is important and make sure that you put brackets now what are the properties in directed numbers magnitude and the direction so what is magnitude means the size of 
,,the directed number just a number direction means whether it's positive or negative so consider plus 3 what's the magnitude there you take only the number plus 3 that is the distance on the number line from 0 to plus 3 this is towards right hand side plus sign represent the number is in the right hand side to zero consider minus five directed number what's the magnitude there magnitude is five so what's the meaning of that magnitude 5 means starting from 0 to -5 distance from 0 to -5 and minus means the number is in the left hand side to zero write down the magnitude and the direction for given directed numbers plus seven so what's the magnitude 7 what's the direction plus plus means to the right minus 8 magnitude is 8 minus means to the left of 0 plus 4 4 is the magnitude this is to the right and minus 10 10 is the magnitude this is to the left 0 that's not moving so magnitude 0 and what's the direction none not moving left or right minus six means six is the magnitude minus means to the left plus 12 plus 12 means magnitude is 12 and plus means to the right now look at this one numbers with the same magnitude and opposite signs are located in equal distance from zero when you add these the answer is zero now what it means now take this one so here i can start minus 3 minus 2 minus 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 like that minus 3 what it means 0 to minus 3 distance plus 3 means 0 to right hand side distance so these two distances are the same when you add what happens opposite 
,,sides get cancel out and you get 0 if this is plus 7 to get 0 you need to add minus 7. if this is 0 plus 8 is there that means you have to add minus a and if this is minus 10 is there you have to add plus 10 to get 0. so we call it's the additive inverse additive inverse means if you take plus 3 minus 3 is the additive inverse of plus 3. now if you take plus 7 what's the additive inverse that's minus 7 minus 12 what's the additive inverse of minus 12 that's plus 12 when you add these you get zero addition of directed numbers so what we do so plus 2 plus 5 so we can start from plus 2 in grade 7 you did starting with 0. now we can start with plus 2. so plus 2 is there here and adding plus 4 so straight away 4 units from here 1 2 3 4 so the answer you are getting here is the final answer so what is plus 2 plus 4 that's plus 6 so the answer is plus 6. start from plus 2 and move 4 places to the right answer is obtained from the last position on the number line let's take this one 
,,minus 3 so start with -3 plus plus means to the right and plus 4 means you are moving 4 places to the right 1 2 3 4 so you're moving to this side so what's minus 3 plus 4 answer is plus 1 this one negative 2 plus negative 3 so starting from negative 2 and adding negative 3 adding means to the right but you are subtracting here another minus three now again you have to go back to left so another three one two three to the left side so what's the final answer minus 2 adding 3 places to the left so final answer is minus 5. so start from minus 2 and move 3 places to the left answer is obtained from the position on the number line find minus 4 plus 7 so starting from minus 4 plus seven that means moves to the right seven places one two three four five six seven so here to here so what's the final position plus 3 here 2 this is 3 so plus 3 is the answer this one plus seven and minus eight so here plus seven starting point is plus seven adding and here minus eight so minus means you have to move eight places to the left one two three four five six seven eight so this is the final position so what's the answer minus one plus 4 plus minus 7 so starting point is plus 4 plus and minus 7 means moves 7 places to the left so what's the answer 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 so here 2 here so the final position is minus 3 write down the answer at once now all are positive and addition so what you do just add the numbers and put the sign positive both numbers are positive answer is also positive and value is the sum of the two numbers so you can do at once 5 plus 3 8 sine is positive 7 plus 2 9 sine is positive 6 plus 4 10 sine is positive 8 plus 6 fourteen sign is positive nine plus one ten sign is positive and four plus four eight sine is positive write down the answer at once now what happens you get both negatives and addition sign is there so what we do both numbers are negative answer is also negative and the value is the sum of the two numbers if both are negative just add it 3 plus 2 5 but the sign is negative 5 and 3 8 here negative 7 plus 6 13 negative 30 5 and 5 10 that's negative 10 9 plus 2 11 that's negative 11 and four plus four eight that's negative eight write down the answer at once now what happens one is positive and the other one is negative so what we do here addition of directed numbers with opposite signs ignore the sign and take the difference between the two values sine of the answer is always the sign of the larger number so what we do take the difference 7 and 2 difference is 5. and which one is a bigger plus 7 so the answer is plus 5. 6 and 3 difference is 3 positive 6 is the bigger one it's plus 3 10 and 4 what's the difference 6 but large number is negative so negative 6 here 11 and 8 what's the difference 3 large number is positive so you put positive 3 subtraction of directed numbers now you are asked to find out plus 4 minus minus 2 using number line so what's the starting value plus 4 here subtraction is left and minus 2 you need to get the opposite direction so that means plus 2 so 2 places to the right so you get 6 is the answer so we can write plus 4 minus minus 2 is plus 6. this one find minus 3 minus minus 5 using number line so minus 3 is the starting point minus means left subtraction and minus 5 you have to consider the opposite that means five places to the right one two three four five so you get plus two so minus three minus minus five is plus 2. find the answer using number line so starting value is plus 3 minus minus means left here plus 4 so left 4 places 1 2 3 4 so you get this number so what's the answer minus 1. 5 minus minus 7 start with minus 5 okay so these are all positive numbers and here minus is left and another minus means opposite direction seven places to the right one two three four five six seven so you get plus 2 as the answer so make sure that you put brackets so the answer is plus 2. this one plus 4 is the starting point minus plus 6 means 6 places to the left 1 2 3 4 5 6. 6 places to the left the final as is minus 2 so you can write -2 there zero minus minus four what's the starting value zero and here minus and another minus get cancel out so you are moving four places to the right one two three four what's the final answer you get plus four so here also plus four is the answer this one 0 that means starting point is 0 minus plus 5 means moves 5 places to the left 1 2 3 4 5. you get minus 5 so what's the answer minus 5 is the directed number plus 2 minus plus 4 starting value is plus 2. this is all positive and minus to the left 4 units 1 2 three four so here this way so the answer is minus two write down the answer at once now you know what you have to do so here 7 and these all this is positive both positive and the subtraction just subtract 7 minus 5 plus 2 8 minus 4 what's 8 minus 4 plus 4 10 minus 6 you get 4 and this is plus 4 9 and plus 5 difference is 4 and this is plus 4 6 and 4 subtraction you get plus 2 11 and 9 
,,you need to subtract 11 minus 9 2 11 minus 9 is 2 that's plus 2 this side minus 3 and plus 4 now so here difference is 1 and look at this one so you have to add starting from minus 3 move 4 places to the left again so what's the answer 4 and 3 you get 7 that's minus 7 this one starting from minus 5 moves 9 places towards left side 9 plus 5 14 that's minus starting from minus 10 you are moving 12 places again to the left side so you are adding these two numbers so 22 and this is minus 8 and 
,,4 addition is 12 and this is minus because starting value is minus 4 you move 8 places to the left starting point is minus 9 move 11 places to the left that means just add these two numbers starting from minus seven subtract plus eight means moves eight places to the left eight plus seven fifteen that's minus additive inverse we know if it's plus 2 when you add minus 2 to both sides what happens you get plus 2 n minus 2 becomes 0 so you get x equals minus 2 so what's the additive inverse of plus 2 that's minus 2 so minus 2 is the additive inverse of plus 2 addition of additive inverse numbers the answer is 0 so when you add additive inverse you get the answer 0. now we'll see these numbers you are getting 0. how you get 0 when you add additive inverse plus 3 when you add additive inverse of plus 3 that's minus 3 you get 0 minus 2 there when you add plus 2 you get 0 minus 8 when you add plus 8 you get 0 plus 9 when you add minus 9 you get 0 minus 3 additive inverse is plus 3 minus 7 additive inverse of that is plus 7 to get 0 plus 11 additive inverse is minus 11 when you add additive inverse values you get 0 write down the additive inverse of given numbers plus 3 or 3 inverse minus 3 minus 8 plus 8 is the additive inverse 9 is minus 9 minus 6 that means plus 6 plus 11 means minus 11 is the additive inverse minus 1.5 plus 1.5 plus three and a half minus three and a half minus six point three plus six point three and plus seven and a half means minus seven and a half minus 2 1 4 means plus 2 and 1 4 so these are the additive inverse of these numbers now when you have two numbers directed numbers to subtract what you can do you can add the additive inverse and change the question for example if the question is plus 5 minus plus 2 that means you can add the additive inverse of plus 2. so this is same as plus five plus of minus two so both cases you get the same answer so here also plus five and minus two phi minus two is plus three then subtraction means moves two places to the left that is also plus three so subtraction of directed numbers means addition of additive inverse of that number write down the following subtractions as addition of additive inverse and find the answer now how can i write this question plus 7 i can write plus of minus 2 adding these two numbers so what we can do 7 and subtract 2 you get plus 5 plus 6 minus becomes plus additive inverse of minus 5 is plus 5. so you get 6 and 5 addition that's plus 11 plus 6 is there minus becomes plus of the additive inverse that's minus 2 that means 6 minus 2 you get plus minus nine and here additive inverse of minus five is plus five so nine and five addition we take the difference and put the sign of the larger number it's minus 4. this one minus 11 is there addition of additive inverse is minus 3 then minus 11 minus 3 both are the same sign add it and put the minus sign so minus 40. here also you can do the same thing minus 8 adding the additive inverse of minus 4 that's plus 4. so take the difference that's 4 put the sign of the bigger number that's minus 4 minus 6 addition of the additive inverse that's minus 3 both signs are the same so add it and put the sign minus 9 plus 11 addition of the additive inverse that's plus 3 11 plus 3 14 that's plus minus 12 additive inverse of plus 
,,3 is minus 3 both negative so add it that's 15 both negative so you get the answer also negative minus 9 adding of the additive inverse of minus 5 that's plus 5. so 
,,this is the difference because 1 is positive and 1 is negative and they put the sign of the larger numbers you get minus 4 for subtraction write down the addition of additive inverse numbers and find the answer same thing i can write minus as the plus of the additive inverse so you get 11 plus 3 40. now we'll do this one minus 6. plus 3 here you can convert to addition of additive inverse of minus 8 that's plus now these two you can add 8 plus 3 11 11 minus 6 you get 5 that's positive this 
,,one minus 9 plus minus 2 and here convert to addition of the additive inverse that's plus 6. so minus 2n minus 9 minus 11 minus 11 and plus 6 means the difference is 5 the bigger number is minus 11 so you get minus 5 minus 1 plus 8 minus becomes additive inverse of that that's plus 3 and plus plus 2. 8 plus 3 11 11 plus 2 plus 30. this one plus 11 and here convert to positive addition of additive inverse of minus 4 is plus 4 and here also adding the additive inverse of minus 2 is plus 2. now all are positive just add the numbers 11 plus 4 15 15 plus 2 17 multiplication of directed numbers so what we do ignore the sign just multiply the two numbers and 
,,then what you do if both signs are the same answer is positive always if the signs are different you get a negative answer 3 times 2 6 plus plus both signs are the same you get plus 6 2 and 2 4 both pluses plus 4 2 and 1 2 both pluses you get plus so remember same sign you get always positive when you multiply by zero what happens multiplication of directed number by zero is always zero now look at this one multiply the directed numbers 3 times 2 6 and this is plus 2 times 2 4 and this is plus 1 times 2 2 same sign you get plus 0 times plus 2 you get 0. so when you look at this side you see a pattern 6 4 2 0 what are these numbers minus 2 minus 4 and minus 6 will check whether it's true both numbers are not the same now same sign 1 is negative and 1 is positive so the answer is negative so 2 times 1 2 you get negative 2 2 times 2 4 you get negative 4 3 times 2 6 negative 6 because 1 is positive the other one is negative so here you need to remember multiplication of positive 
,,numbers answer is always positive multiplication of positive number with a negative number answer is negative write down the answer once answer is positive when multiply two positive numbers so all these are positive numbers so you get positive answer 5 times 3 50 plus 15. 4 times 3 12. so plus 12 two times six twelve plus twelve seven times two fourteen plus fourteen and four times four sixteen that's plus sixteen one times three three that's plus three eight times two sixteen plus sixteen eleven times two twenty two that's plus six times three eighty that's plus 10 times 440 that's plus find the answer 3 times -2 ignore the sign and here 1 is positive and 1 is negative you get the answer negative this is 4 minus 4 1 times 2 2 this is minus 2. 0 times -2 is 0 now look at this one same sign minus and minus so you 
,,get positive 2 2 times 2 plus 4 because both are negative both are negative you get plus 6 so what's the thing you need to remember multiplication of positive number and a negative number is always a negative answer answer is negative multiplication of two negative numbers the answer is positive write down the answer at once answer is negative and multiply a positive and a negative number now plus as minus here all these 1 is positive the other number is negative so always the answer is negative 3 times 2 6 that's negative 6 3 times 2 6 negative 6 4 times 4 16 negative 16 6 times two twelve that's negative twelve eight times five forty that's negative 
,,forty six times three eighteen that's negative eighteen eight times two sixteen negative sixteen here nine times one nine negative nine four times four sixty that's 
,,negative two times 11 22 that's negative one negative and one positive answer is always negative write down the answer at once answer is positive and multiply two negative numbers in all these both numbers are negative so the final answer is positive three times two six five times one five six times two twelve eight times three 
,,twenty-four nine times two eighteen then 4 times 3 12 5 times 3 15 11 times 1 that's plus 11 10 times 2 20 9 times 3 27 so here both negative means the final answer 
,,is positive write down the answer at once yeah you get combination sometimes positive sometimes negative both negative answer is positive one is negative one is positive answer is negative one is positive one is negative answer is negative so you need to multiply separate 9 times to 80. both negative answer is positive 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative so 10 times 3 30. 11 times 3 33 both negative that means plus one negative one positive answer is negative both negative positive answer one negative one positive answer is negative both negative answer is positive 9 times 4 36 both negative means answer is positive 12 times 224 one negative one positive answer is negative write down the answer at once look at all these questions multiplied by zero when you multiply any number by zero what's the answer 
,,you always get zero so what are these answers all these are zeros because you are multiplying by zero any number with zero is always zero find the value now you can 
,,take 2 at a time and find the answer 4 times 3 12 but it's negative now both negative the answer is positive twelve times five sixty plus one minus four and minus two four times two eight both negative means plus plus say ten minus 3 multiplication 8 times 3 24 1 is plus 1 is negative means you get a negative answer this one minus 9 minus 1 both negative means plus 9 now multiply with 4 9 times 4 36 both positive means the answer also positive minus 5 times 2 you get a negative answer because 1 is positive and the other one is negative multiplied by negative both negative now so you get a positive answer again take 2 at a time 8 times 3 24 both positive one is positive one is negative so first multiply four times four sixteen one remaining four times two eight plus one nine one plus and one negative answer is negative both negative you get a plus answer plus 33 and when you multiply by a negative the answer is a negative one both negative you get plus answer 3 times 2 6. here you can do separately these two 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative 4 times 3 12. now 12 times 6 ignore sign and multiply 6 times 2 12 1 remaining and here 72 is it positive or negative 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative here 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is 12 there minus 12 negative 12. both negative answer is positive 4. now 12 times 4 48 what's the sign one negative one positive answer is negative this one again take two at a time negative both you get positive 10 positive both you get positive 6 now multiply both positive you get positive 60. here both negative negative negative you get positive answer here negative negative positive answer now positive positive multiplication you get positive answer 9 times 4 is 30 6. find the value just multiply by two first two times one two two times three six what's the sign one negative one positive answer is negative multiply by two two times one two two times five ten ten point two is the answer both 
,,negative you get plus sign four times this 4 times 3 12 1 remaining 4 times 1 4 plus 1 5 so 5.2 both positive means answer is positive this one multiplied by 2 6 and 2 1 is negative and 1 is positive answer is negative now we look at division of directed numbers now we know multiplication 5 into plus 2 you get plus 10. now what 
,,happens when you take 10 divided by plus 2 you take this one to this side that becomes division so what's the answer you are getting plus 5 divide the numbers ignoring the sign answer is positive when dividing positive number by a positive number so just ignore the sign 10 divided by 2 you get 5. both positive means answer is also positive write down the answer once 8 divided by 2 is 4 how you decide the sign both positive means positive sign 15 divided by 5 is 3 both positive you get the positive answer 10 divided by 10 1 both positive you get 1. 16 divided by 4 4 you get plus 4 8 divided by 2 that's 4 that is also plus 4. 20 divided by 5 20 divided by 5 is 4 both positive you get positive 4. 16 divided by 8 you get 2 that's plus 2. 30 divided by 10 that's 3 you get plus 3. 40 divided by 10 you get 4 both positive means plus 4. 36 divided by 6 you get 6 both positive so when you divide both positive numbers the answer is positive now this one we know plus into minus 4 is negative 4. and when you take this one to this side negative 25 divided by negative 4 you are getting plus 6. so now look at this question both negative answer is positive answer is positive when dividing negative number by a negative number write down the answer at once both negative numbers all in all these questions both negative numbers when you divide both negative numbers the answer is positive just normal division 8 divided by 2 4 answer is plus because both are negatives 16 divided by 
,,4 4 that's plus 4. 20 divided by 5 you get 4 that's plus 4. 18 divided by 6 you get 3 that's plus 3 12 divided by 2 6 that's plus 6 18 divided by 9 you get 2 that's 
,,plus 2. 20 divided by 10 you get 2. ours is plus 2. 30 divided by 10 that's three answers plus 40 divided by 20 you get plus 2 24 divided by 12 you get plus 2 because both the numbers are negative negative number divided by a negative you get a positive answer now what happens here 1 is negative and 1 is positive so minus 8 and 
,,plus 3 we know that's minus 24 when you take plus 3 to this side that means minus 24 divide by plus 3 you need to get minus now what happens 1 is negative 1 is positive answer is negative answer is negative when dividing negative number by a positive number here also both numbers are negative you get positive 24. when you take this one here minus 6 to this side what happens plus 24 divide by this is plus 24 divide by minus 6 the answer is minus 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is always negative answer is negative when dividing positive number by a negative number so it can be positive first number and the divisor is negative or divisor is positive and the number given is negative final answer is negative write down the answer at once plus and minus so you get negative 12 divided by 4 3 plus and minus 18 divided by 6 is 3 you are getting a negative answer again minus n plus 30 divided by 5 is 6 answer is minus 6 negative positive 28 divided by 7 that's 4 you get negative 4. 27 divided by 9 you get 9 times 3 so this is negative now look at this one 12 divided by 4 you get 3 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative 18 divided by minus 6 1 is positive and 1 is negative answer is negative 30 divided by 5 6 1 is positive and 1 is negative so answer is negative 28 divided by 7 you get 4 1 is positive and 1 is negative answer is negative 27 and 9 you get 3 answer is negative 3 so you need to remember when you get same sign pluses you get positive or either same sign negatives the final answer is positive when you divide here this one one positive and one negative always you get negative answer order is not important you can get negative number divide by a positive still the answer is negative so multiplication of different signs answer is negative so in this case you get negative here you get positive for same sign write down the answer at once now combination so first multiply numbers separately and then decide the sign 7 times 2 40 both pluses answer is plus 6 times 2 12 both minus answer is plus now the division 12 divided by 6 answer is 2 this is minus and plus the sign is negative division again 30 divided by 15 you know that's 2 sign is negative because 1 is negative and 1 is positive 32 divided by 8 you get 4 1 is negative 1 is plus means answer is negative 9 times 3 27 1 is positive and 1 is negative that's minus 16 divided by 4 you get 4 both negative answer is positive 18 divided by 18 you get 1 both negative answer is positive 40 divided by 20 ans is 2. both negative means you get plus 27 divided by 3 you get 9. one negative and one positive you get minus again eight times eight multiplication 64. both negative you get plus now division 64 divided by 8 that's 8 1 positive 1 negative answer is negative 12 times 3 multiplication you get 36 1 positive 1 negative answer is negative 36 divided by 12 you get 3 both negative here you get plus 48 divided by 2 that's 24 1 negative 1 positive answer is negative 8 times 4 32 both negative answer is positive here division negative negative division you get 4 divided by 4 1 both negative means the sign is plus 18 divided by 1 you get 18. both negative that's plus 40 divided by 8 that's 5. one negative 1 positive means you get minus 9 times 3 27 and both positive means answer is positive so that's not hard you can just multiply the numbers and then decide the sign simplify following directed numbers so we can do the numerator first and then the denominator 4 times 3 12 but this is negative because 1 is positive and 1 is negative now 12 divided by 6 is 2 one negative and one positive answer is negative 8 times 4 32 is this plus or minus minus minus both means this is plus 2 times 2 4 1 minus and 1 positive means you get minus 4. now division 32 divided by 4 is 8 plus and minus the answer is minus this one we'll do these two first 5 and 2 10 minus minus becomes plus and then here three times one three one positive one negative is minus three now you can do ten times three 30 but this is negative and divide by negative 30 divided by 3 is 10 both negative means the final answer is positive this one we'll 
,,do these two 8 times 2 16 that's positive and multiplied by a negative value here 6 times 2 12 and you get a negative answer no numerator multiply you get 3 times 6 
,,18 1 remaining 3 times 1 3 plus 1 48 that's negative because 1 is positive and 1 is negative now divide by -12 both negative answer is positive 48 divided by 12 is 4. so you get plus 4 as the answer do this we'll do these two separately 9 times 3 27 that's minus and then 12 times 3 36 that's minus because 1 is negative and 1 is 
,,positive now 27 times 4. 108 that's negative negative that's positive divide by minus 36 the answer is negative 1 is positive 1 is negative how many times are there 
,,36 times what's the answer 3 3 times so you get 3 times 36 is 108 so you get negative 3 as the final this one you can do these two minus 8 and 4 minus 32. multiplied by plus 2 here 4 times 4 16 and this is minus minus plus now numerator separately 32 times 2. that's plus into minus minus 64. divide by plus 16 minus n plus minus 
,,how many 16s are there for sixty-four four so answer is minus four this one 12 times 4 you get 48 that's minus 3 times 2 6 minus minus plus now divide 48 divided by 
,,6 8 but this is minus because 1 is negative well 1 is positive 12 times 8 96 plus into minus that's minus 3 times 2 6 both minus that means plus 6. how many sixes are there divide by six you get one for 36 that's 16. is it positive or negative one is negative one is positive answer is negative these two what is eighteen times three 24 3 times 1 3 plus 2 54 but the answer is negative 6 times 3 18 answer is positive now divide how many 18s are there for 54 3 so the answer is 3 minus and plus 
,,different signs you get negative so the answer is negative 3. here we'll take these two first 4 times 3 plus 12 and then with minus 6. here 18 times 2 you get 36 that's minus 1 is positive 1 is negative now multiply these two 72 12 times 6 but the answer is negative now both negative 72 divided by 36 is 2. both negative means answer is positive now we'll look at example number one find the value of minus 3 plus minus 2 by using the number line so number line is given what's the starting point minus 3 so this is the starting point and then what we do plus minus 2 means 2 places to the left so 2 places to the left means answer is minus 5 review exercise 
,,now we'll take the review exercise find the value of each of the following by using the number line plus 2 and plus 6. so we'll take the number line okay so what's the starting value plus 2 so here i'll take minus 2 minus 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and we'll put 8 here these are pluses that's the number line starting point is plus 2 and 
,,plus 6 means 6 places to the right one two three four five six so what's the answer plus eight plus eight and minus 5 so we'll take the number line again so plus 8 is there so we need 8 i'll mark this one as 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 minus 1. now start from plus 8 and plus minus 5 means moves 5 places to the left so 1 two three four five what's the answer plus three minus two n plus three we'll take it minus two so that means i'll take this one as minus 3 minus 2 minus 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 these are pluses so starting value is minus 2 plus plus 3 means move 3 places to the right 1 2 3 answer is plus 1. this one take the number line and starting value is minus 3 so 
,,you need to check minus three but here minus means moves left so we'll start from here plus one you need to decide what are the numbers you need so here minus 3 is the starting point and here this is left means you need more minus values so four places to the left one two three four answer is minus seven this one plus 4 and minus 6 is there that means towards left side so we'll take plus 4 here starting point is plus 4 6 to the left 1 2 3 4 5 6. so you get minus 2. find the value of each of the following you can do it at once what's the condition both pluses means just add the two numbers 3 plus 2 5 so you get plus 5 now both negative that's also adding two numbers four plus two six you put a negative sign here one is positive one is negative you take the difference five and three difference is two but bigger number is positive you put plus 2 plus and minus take the difference that's 6 bigger number is negative so you put negative 6 here this is additive inverse addition so what's the answer negative 7 and 7 difference is 0. so when you add additive inverse you get 0. these two all positive so that means adding the numbers 5 plus 2 7 7 plus 3 now here all these negative numbers so that means adding negative numbers 3 plus 1 4 4 plus 4 8 what this is negative 8. all these two these two positive and the other one is negative so what is this one plus two plus four you get plus six now you have to take the difference because 1 is positive and 1 is negative so 9 and 6 difference is 3 bigger number is negative so minus 3. here you have to take the difference because 1 is positive and the other one is negative so 5 over 7 minus 2 over 7 that's 3 over 7. so answer is 3 over 7. how you decide the sign the bigger one is this that's positive 1 is positive 1 is negative 2 so take the difference when you subtract you get 8 and here 1. so 1.8 is the answer which one is bigger 5.2 that's negative so the answer also negative here what are these two additive inverse so additive inverse addition is zero example number one find the value of plus 2 minus minus 3 by using the number line so here first look at it plus 2 and minus minus that means you have to move towards right side so starting with plus 2. so we can take plus 2 somewhere here so this is plus 1 0 minus 1 minus 2 plus 3 plus 4 plus 5 plus 6 plus 7 so start with plus 2 here move three places to the right one two three so what's the final answer that's plus five find the value of minus 2 minus plus 3 by using the lambda line so before we mark the numbers just see minus 2 that means starting value is minus 2 moves to the left 3 units so when you are marking the number line we can take i'll take minus 6 minus 5 minus 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 starting with minus 2 moves left by 3 units 1 2 3. so the answer is minus five example number three find the value of minus two minus minus three by using the number line so we'll take the number line now here before we mark the points you have to look at carefully starting point is minus 2 minus minus means you have to move to the right side by 3 units so we can take minus 3 minus 2 minus 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6. these are positive values so starting value is minus two moves three places to the right one two three that's the answer plus one exercise 4.1 find the value by using the number line so we'll take the number line and now how we label you have to look at starting value is plus 4 and minus means you are moving to the left so plus 4 will mark it somewhere here and starting value is plus 4 moving towards left side by 2 units so final answer is plus two take a number line for this now how we label this so here starting point is plus 1 and here minus minus means moves towards right side so we can start from here i'll take plus 1 here plus 2 plus 3 plus 4 plus 5 
,,plus 6 like that and here this is 0 minus 1. so start from plus one and moves two places to the right one two so what's the final answer final answer is plus three this one using number line so we'll take the number line and starting with minus 2 and here minus means moves to the left so we'll start -2 somewhere here it's easy first you decide otherwise you can't put all the numbers so this is plus 1 minus 3 minus 4 minus 5 minus 6 like that starting value is minus 2 3 places to the left one two three so you get minus five this one minus one and minus minus 3 so what you have to do starting with minus and minus minus means moves towards right side so i'll start minus 1 somewhere here these are pluses so starting value is minus 1 moves three places to the right one two three one two three so answer is plus two this one starting value is minus 6 and you have to move towards right side because minus minus towards right side so we'll start from -6 here so starting value is minus 
,,6 5 places to the right 1 2 3 4 5 answer is minus 1 this one starting point is plus 2 minus minus means towards right hand side so i can start with plus 2 here here 
,,plus 1 and 0 starting with 2 and 2 places to the right this is plus 4. example number four find the value of plus two minus minus four so we can use addition of additive inverse i can change the question to adding the additive inverse of minus 4 that's plus 4. now both positive 4 plus 2 addition is plus 6. find the value of minus 5 minus plus 2. so convert this to additive inverse adding the additive inverse of plus 2 that's minus 2 now this is both minus addition so just add it and put the sign so you get minus 7. find the value of minus 7 minus minus 3 so how you do minus 7 is there adding additive inverse of minus 3 is plus 3 now difference 7 and 3 
,,difference is 4 and put the sign of the bigger number that's minus 4. example 7 find the value of minus 12 minus minus 15 minus plus 5. so these two i can convert minus 12 addition of additive inverse of that plus 50 and here also adding additive inverse that's minus 5. now these two take the difference minus 12 and 15 take the 
,,difference you get 3 that's positive now again consider this one now 1 is positive and 1 is minus you take the difference difference is 2 and the bigger number is minus you get minus 2. example eight find the value of plus three fifths minus so you can do the additive inverse of plus one over 5 means minus 1 over 5. now this is 
,,difference so you take 3 over 5 minus 1 over 5 that's 2 over 5 is the difference which one is bigger positive answer is bigger so the answer is plus 2 over 5. example 9 minus five and a half minus plus two so what you do i can rewrite this as adding the additive inverse of plus 2 that's minus 2. so this means both minus now edit 5 and 2 7 and you get 7 and a half both minus means the answer is minus example 10 minus 3.2 minus i can write plus of the additive inverse of plus 1.4 that's minus 1.4 now both negative negative means adding so 3.2 and 1.4 just add it you get 4.6 but both negative means the answer also negative example number 11 find the value of minus 8.4 minus minus i can change it to plus with the additive inverse of minus 2.5 that's plus 2.1 now 1 is negative 1 is positive take the difference 6.3 so which one is the bigger number minus so you put a minus psi exercise 4.2 fill in each cage with the suitable directed number here minus 5. we can convert to additive 
,,inverse of plus 3 that's minus 3. now both negative add the two numbers 5 plus 3 8 so you put minus eight this one convert to additive inverse so this is plus with plus four one is positive one is negative take the difference four and three difference is 1 bigger number is positive plus 1. convert to additive inverse plus 7 plus minus 1 additive inverses plus 1 7 and 1 both positive you get plus 8. this one plus 7 additive inverse of minus 2 that's plus 2 and both pluses 7 plus 2 you get plus 9. find the value of each of the following so 4 you can write this one as adding the additive inverse of this 4 minus 1 you get 3 positive number because the higher number is positive minus 8 plus additive inverse of minus 2 that's plus 2. take the difference 8 and 2 difference is 6 bigger number is minus answer is minus 6 convert to addition plus of additive inverse that's plus 7 take the difference because 1 is negative and 1 is positive so you get 4 bigger number is positive that's plus 4 here also you can start from plus 9 addition of the additive inverse that's plus 6 9 and 6 addition 15 that's plus minus 5 addition of additive inverse plus 5 yeah minus 5 and plus 5 difference is 0 this one adding the additive inverse that's minus 3 so 0 and minus 3 answer is minus 3 here minus 11 addition of additive inverse of plus 4 that's minus 4 both negative so add it so 15 answer is negative this one convert the question plus 2 plus minus 1 adding of the additive inverse that's plus 4 2 minus 1 take the difference you get plus 1. plus 1 and plus 4 you get plus 5 this one i can take minus 5 convert to addition additive inverse of this is minus 2 again convert this one plus with additive inverse that's plus 6. now these two both negative so just add it and put the sign this is plus 6 now 1 is positive and 1 is negative take the difference 7 and 6 difference is 1 bigger number is negative so you get negative 1 this one plus 4 and here adding the additive inverse that's minus 2 again adding the additive inverse that's minus 8. now 4 and 2 take the difference that's 2 that's plus 2. and now again take the difference 8 and 2 difference is 6. bigger number is negative so you put negative six this one four and a half adding the additive inverse of minus 2 that's plus 2 now this means adding these two numbers 4 and 2 6 6 and a half that's positive this one minus 6 and 1 4 is there adding of the additive inverse that's 1 4 plus 1 over now you have to take the difference so we'll take the difference six one fourth minus one fourth so one fourth one fourth get cancel out you get six what's the sign the bigger number is negative so the answer is negative 6 this one plus 15.7 adding the additive inverse that's plus 2.3 now this is addition 15.7 and 2.3 adding 7 plus 3 10 and 6 plus 2 8. so 18.0 so plus 18.0 this one will take first minus 2. adding the additive inverse of plus 3.5 that's minus 3.5 adding 4.5 4.1 now these two both negative that means adding you get 5.5 that's negative and adding plus 4.1 again the difference one is positive one is negative so take the difference you get 1.4 which number is bigger negative number so answer is negative 1.4 this one plus three and a half adding the additive inverse of minus 2 that's plus 2 here also adding additive inverse of this is plus one third now look at all of this all are adding so three plus two five that's the whole part half plus one third what's half plus one third convert to the same denominator lowest common multiple is six three times two so three times one three two times three six so two times one two so you get five over six so what's the final answer 5 and 5 over 6 so that's positive example number one simplify so here multiplication what you do just multiply the two numbers and same sign you get plus multiplication here 6 and 2 12. 1 is positive and 1 is negative answer is negative simplify the following here first one two times five ten one is positive the other one also positive both positive means ansi is positive second one three times two six 1 is negative 1 is positive answer is negative third one 5 times 3 
,,15 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative 15. here 4 times 3 12 12 times 2 24. now we'll decide the sign both negative you get plus again plus with plus answer is plus example number four plus 2.5 into minus 5. just multiply by 5 first 5 times 5 25 5 times 2 10 plus 2 12. so 12.5 how do you decide the sign one is positive one is negative answer is negative here multiplied by 12 first 3.4 multiplied by 12. 10 and 2 4 and 3 2 times 4 8 2 times 3 6. when you add it you get 4 0 8 and here 1 decimal place so 40.8 is the answer but how you decide the sign minus minus both the final answer is positive find the value exercise 4.3 so straight away you can do 5 times 420 both positive means answer is positive 5 times 420 1 is negative 1 is positive answer is negative 10 times 550 both negative answer is positive 7 times 3 21 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative both negative just multiply 1 times 4 4 both negative means you get a positive answer here 11 times 0 when you multiply any number by 0 always you get answer 0 6 times 4 24 1 is negative and 1 is plus answer is negative 12 times 3 you get 36 1 is positive one is negative answer is negative here we'll multiply first two times two four four times five twenty now we'll decide the sign one is negative one is positive answer is negative that's negative and this negative both negative means the answer is plus here 3 times 1 3 3 times 2 6 6 times 5 30 decide the sign negative negative positive here positive negative you get negative now again positive negative means the final answer is negative multiplied by 2 you get 5 both positive answer is positive now here you need to multiply by 20 3 now 20 and 3 times one two two times four eight three times one three three times four twelve when you add it you get ninety four point three now one is positive one is negative means answer is negative example number one now it's division same thing you divide and finally you can put the sign 6 divided by 2 you get 3 both negative you get positive 3 6 and 2 division you get 3 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative this one 15 divided by 5 answer is 3 both 
,,positive you get positive 3 9 divided by 3 is 3 1 is negative 1 is positive you get a negative answer 15 divided by 3 you get 5 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative 9 divided by 3 3 both negative you get positive answer exercise 4.4 find the value of each of the following 10 and 2 division you get 5 plus and plus both 
,,positive means the final answer is positive 12 divided by 4 that's 3 both negative means final answer is positive 15 divided by 3 is 5. 1 is positive and 1 is negative answer is negative here 21 divided by 7 is 3 1 is negative and 1 is positive answer is negative negative 5 divided by 5 5 divided by 5 is 1 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative 1. 20 divided by 4 is 5 both negative means answer is positive now here 8 times 2 16 both positive that's positive now you have to divide by this 16 divided by 4 that's 4. 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative this one we can simplify the denominator first 6 and 2 multiplication that's 12 both negative means you get positive ones now 36 divided by 12 is 3 1 is negative 1 is positive answer is negative do the numerator 5 times 4 20 one negative one positive 
,,answer is negative denominator now 2 and 2 4 both minus means positive 1's now do this one 20 divided by 4 is 5. 1 is negative 1 is positive answer is negative do the numerator 9 times 8 72 both negative means plus answer 4 times 3 12 1 is negative 1 is positive answer is negative 72 divided by 12 you get 6 1 is positive and 1 is negative answer is negative fill in each cage with the suitable directed number answer is negative that means you are getting a plus value so 20 divided by 2 you get 10. so plus 2 because minus n plus the answer is negative 18 and 6. how you get 6 18 divided by 3. now decide the sign this is plus answer is negative that means 
,,you are getting negative 3 division you get 5 that means 10 divided by 2 is 5. now decide the sign this is plus here minus so both should be minus to get plus answer answer is 4 4 divided by 1 is 4 positive and the answer is negative so this should be negative value how we decide this one when you divide this one by 2 you are getting 6. so think about reverse way so if this is 12 here 12 divided by 2 you get 6. how you get 12 from 3 this should be 4 now decide the sign this is minus and minus if it's plus and minus the answer is minus but the answer is given is plus so that means this should be a minus value so minus 4 now this one you are getting minus 28 here plus 7 is there 7 into 4 28 but this is minus means this should be minus 4 now numerator is ok now to get 7 what should be this answer you are getting minus 4 because minus minus plus 28 divided by 4 is 7. now how you get minus 4 there 2 times 2 but this is minus so you have to multiply it by minus 2. so we covered all theory related to directed numbers subtracting a number from another number is the same as adding the additive inverse of the second number to the first number a positive number is obtained when two directed numbers of the same sign are multiplied or divided a negative number is obtained when two directed numbers of opposite signs are multiplied or divided so remember all these properties in directed numbers and practice all the exercises and examples

Number Partens,ZqLeGm4k6CU,parts of speech all words in the English language belong to a word class called the parts of speech there are eight main parts of speech in the English language they are nouns verbs adjectives adverbs pronouns prepositions conjunctions and interjections noun is the part of speech that names a person please animal or think for example this is a boy this is a dog this is red food this is a Honda City verb is the part of speech that names actions for example Ricky walked to school the baby is 
,,crying ejective is the part of speech that describes the quality of a person place animal or thing for example Rohan is a smart boy the green parrot is flying this is a big hall it is a round ball adverb is the part of speech that adds more information about a verb or an adjective for example my dog eats slowly when he is very hungry he eats quickly pronoun is the part of speech that replaces a noun for example Mickey is Indian she is beautiful preposition is the part of speech that shows location or position time or direction for example we went to school on Monday the train is passing through the tunnel conjunction is the part of speech that joins together groups of words or sentences for example I like cats and dogs the sky is cloudy but it is not raining interjection is the part of speech that shows emotion surprise or emphasis for example ouch that hurts hi how are you

Number Partens,CqrYYiffPr0,good morning students today let us study the rules of divisibility these rules will help us determine whether a number is divisible by another number without actually carrying out the division process let us have a look at different divisibility tests divisibility by two if the number is even that is it ends in two four six eight or zero we say that the given number is divisible by two for example 26 ends in 6 thus it is divisible by 2 divisibility by 3 if the sum of the digits of the number is divisible by three we say that the given number is divisible by three for example look at the number 384 when we add up all the digits that is three plus eight 
,,plus four we get the sum as fifteen we know that 15 is divisible by three thus we conclude that 384 is divisible by three divisibility by 4 if the number formed by the last two digits of the given number is divisible by four we see that the given number is divisible by four for example look at the number 164 its last two digits 
,,"form the number 64 which is divisible by 4 thus the whole number 164 is divisible by 4 divisibility by 5 if the number ends in 5 or 0 we say that the given number is divisible by 5 for example 525 ends in 5 thus it is divisible by 5 look at this another example 330 ends in 0 hence it is also divisible by 5 divisibility by 6 if the number is divisible by both 2 and 3 we see that the given number is divisible by 6 for example look at the number 408 is it divisible by 2 the number ends in 8 thus it is divisible by 2 is it divisible by 3 4 plus 0 plus 8 is equal to 12 which is divisible by 3 which makes the number 408 divisible by 3 as well hence 408 is divisible by 6 divisibility by 8 if the number formed by the last three digits of the given number is divisible by 8 we see that the given number is divisible by 8 for example look at the number 50 3888 its last three digits form the number 8 on eighty-eight which is divisible by 8 thus 53,000 888 is divisible by 8 divisibility by nine if the sum of the digits of the number is divisible by nine we see that the given number is divisible by nine for example look at the number seven lakh twenty "
,,nine thousand six hundred thirty-nine here on adding the digits seven two nine six three and nine we get the sum as 36 which is divisible by nine thus seven lakh twenty nine thousand six hundred thirty-nine is also divisible by nine finally let us look at divisibility by ten if the number ends in a zero we say that the given number is divisible by ten for example 8620 ends in zero thus it is divisible by ten kids now it is time for you to remember all these divisibility tests and find out the answer

Number Partens,ipKXvkFTEMc,the open boat by American author Stephen Crane is an account of a real-life incident involving the author when he was traveling by sea from the United States to Cuba the incident is about survival on the sea especially in hard conditions let us see how poor people tried to rescue themselves in a small boat after a shipwreck in a stormy sea the Sun climbed steadily up the sky the men knew it was broad day because the color of the sea changed from grey to green and the white tops were like falling snow white tops stand for sea foam from their low boat they could not see the sunrise only the color of the waves that rolled towards them told them that day was breaking the oiler and the correspondent rode the tiny boat and they rolled they sat together in the same seat and each Road and all then the oiler took both holes then the correspondent took both oars then the oiler then the correspondent they rode and they rode the captain hesitating in the front after the boat had climbed 
,,a great wave said that he had seen the light at Mosquito Inlet after wine the cook remarked that he had seen it the correspondent was at the Auslan and he too wished to look at the lighthouse but his back was towards the far shore the waves were important and for some time he could not seize an opportunity to turn his head but at last they came away more gentle than the others when at the top of it he hurriedly searched the western water with his eyes see it asked the captain no said the correspondent slowly I didn't see anything look again said the captain he pointed it's exactly in that direction at the top of another wave the correspondent did as he was told this time his eyes found a small still thing on the edge of the moving ocean it was exactly like the point of a pin it took an anxious eye to find a lighthouse so tiny think we'll reach it captain if this wind stays steady and the boat doesn't sink we can't do much else said the captain hopefully the captain assured them that if the wind was steady they would surely do so then he added empty hook cook he then asked the cook to clear the water which had collected in the boat so that they could sail alright captain said the cheerful cook it would be difficult to describe the secure secure means strong bond between men that was here established 
,,on the Seas no one said that it was so no one mentioned but it was on the boat and each man felt it warm him they were a captain an oiler a cook and a correspondent 
,,and they were friends friends in a more strangely Ironbound strength than may be ordinary the hurt captain lying against the water jar in the front spoke all the ways in a low voice and calmly but he could never command a more ready to obey ship's company than the other three in the boat it was more than a mere recognition of what was best for their safety there was surely in it a quality that was personal and heartfelt and after this devotion to the commander of the boat there was this once the correspondent who had been taught to be a hard judge of men knew even at the time that it was the best experience of his life but no one said it was so no one 
,,mentioned it danger brings about a strong bond among people who have otherwise a small chance of bonding without mentioning it each of them gained strength from the 
,,presence of the other here there was no distinction of status or any other differences the captain was injured but he commanded in a quiet manner because the other three were most willing to obey I wish we had a sail remarked the captain we might try my coat on the end of an oar it would give you two boys a chance to rest so the cook and the correspondent held the ore and spread wide the coat sometimes the oiler had to turn sharply to keep the sea from breaking into the boat but otherwise sailing was a success the lighthouse had been growing slowly larger it now almost had color and appeared like a little gray shadow on the sky the men holding high the or could not be prevented from turning their heads quite often to glance at this little gray shadow at last from the top of each wave the men in the rolling boat could see land as the lighthouse was a shadow on the sky this land seemed only a long black shadow on the sea it certainly was thinner than paper the wind slowly died 
,,away the cook and the correspondent did not now have to labor to hold high the all but the waves continued pushing and turning and washing the boat slowly the land rose from the sea from a black line it became a line of black and white trees and sand finally the captain said he could see a house on the shore they will see us before long and come out after us set the cook the distant lighthouse rose high the keeper the keeper is the caretaker of the lighthouse ought to be able to see us now 
,,set the captain none of those other boats could have reached sure to give word of our ship said the oiler in a low voice or the lifeboat would be out hunting for us 
,,the wind was low but the waves was still strong they realized that from the red ship their boat was the first to reach shore if another boat had reached earlier there would have been a rescue team searching for them slowly and beautifully the land came out of the sea the wind came again finally a new sound struck the ears of the men in the boat it was no thunder of waves beating the shore will never be able to reach the lighthouse now set the captain swing her a little more North Billy a little more North sir said the oiler so the little boat turned her nose once more down the wind all except the oarsmen watched the shore grow doubt and fear were leaving the minds of the men the management of the boat still took most of their attention but it could not prevent a quiet cheerfulness in an hour perhaps they would be 
,,on shore the nearness of success Shaun in their eyes everybody took a drink of water Cooke remarked the captain there doesn't seem to be any sign of life about the house no replied the cook strange they don't see us tide wind and waves was swinging the boat north strange they don't see us said the men the seas raw was here dulled but its tone was nevertheless thundering and huge as the boat swam over the great waves the men sat listening to this warm wheel overturn said everybody it is fair to say here that there was not a life-saving station within 20 miles in either direction but the men should not know this fact and so they made bitter remarks concerning the eyesight of the nation's lifesavers for unhappy men sat on the boat and murmured strange they don't see us the earlier light heartedness had completely disappeared to their sharpen minds it was easy to imagine all kinds of idlers and blindness and indeed lack of courage there was the shore of the land and it was bitter and bitter to them that from it came no sign the captain said at last I suppose we'll have to make a try for ourselves if we stay out here too long none of us will

Number Partens,69lzkfvFUqQ,simple tenses present past and future let us learn about simple tenses remember in simple tenses the verbs simply indicate an action in the present past or future the simple present tense resembles the base verb but we add s es or IES to a base verb when the subject is in the third-person singular he/she it for example I do but 
,,he does or you carry the load but she carries the load here we see that the base verb do and carry remain the same for first person I and second person you but for third person he or she we need to add es of IES to the base verb the simple present tense is used to indicate the following habits for example he goes for a walk every day regular actions for example the cobbler men's shoes current situation for example I am unwell general truths of facts for example trees give oxygen the simple 
,,past tense is formed when we add the suffix IDI to base verb for example the children jumped into the river the simple past tense shows an action that happened in the past and is over now for example he worked in Dubai last year it is also used to talk about a past habit for example he exercised every day irregular verbs to not 
,,add IDI they take different forms for example he ran last night the simple future tense is formed by adding will or shall before the base verb for example I will watch television after I complete my homework the simple future tense shows an action that will happen sometime in the future for example I will be in grade 5 next year remember simple present and simple past tenses do not have helping verbs we use singular verbs such as is was washes nose etc with singular subject for example she 
,,knows it we use plural verbs such as our work wash no etc with plural subjects for example they know it we can form negative sentences and questions using verbs in simple tenses for example he does not exercise every day will we reach on time

Number Partens,flXVRy1hjf4,hello grade 8 children today I am here to teach you mathematics relevant to your textbook so what's the first unit in your textbook that's called number patterns so 
,,this is an interesting topic and we'll create number patterns using numbers so let's take 1 2 3 what are those those are digits so here we call these are counting numbers as well counting numbers so one two three like that we can't write all numbers so that's why we put three dots after this so if any pattern if you can't write 
,,it all you have to put three dots we can create different number patterns from these counting numbers so let's take different patterns check the first one one three 
,,five seven nine what are those we call these are odd numbers numbers less than ten only if you take odd numbers you have to write down 11 13 like that but this is the number set less than check so that's why here we put curly brackets and write down 1 1 3 5 7 9 so here you can't see 3 dots this is not continuing now we can find 
,,a next term by adding 2 to the previous so here how do you get 3 from 1 we can add 2 3 plus 2 you get 5 5 + 2 7 7 + 2 9 so since the exact number of terms in this number pattern can be specified therefore it is a finite number time so here certain numbers are there so remember this term finite number pad tick the same thing 1 3 
,,5 7 9 odd numbers less than 10 in this number pattern what's the first term the first number in the number pattern we call the first term so in this one what's the first term second term is 3 third term five fourth term seven and fifth term is now let's take these numbers 2 4 6 8 10 12 what are those those are even numbers so we can divide these numbers by 2 the remainder is 0 so here you see two three dots that means this number pattern continues what you call that that's called in finite 
,,number pattern so what's the first term in this sequence or number buggy that's 2 the second term is 4 36 4 8 and the fifth term so you know how to identify terms in the number pad and what are the two words you learn finite number pattern L in finite number pattern let's take this one 5 8 11 14 17 so when you take two numbers next to each other what do you call that consecutive term so here 5 & 8 are consecutive terms when you take 8 and 11 those are also consecutive terms so you can take 
,,any 2 you can take any two terms next to each other those are called consecutive terms so 14 and 17 also consecutive terms so we'll take that one and see the pattern how you get a it from five we need to add three 8 plus 3 you get 11 11 plus 3 14 14 plus 370 so how can we find out this number so you can take any two terms consecutive terms in the number pattern if you take this is the next term and the one before that that's called previous term we can take the difference so how do you get 
,,this number 11 minus 8 or 8 minus 5 so what you call that number common difference so you are learning another term that's common difference how you get the common difference you need two consecutive terms and take the difference when you are taking the difference don't subtract 5 minus 8 that's wrong so next term minus the previous term so we'll do that so you can either take 8 minus 5 Oh 11 minus 8 you are getting same answer or 14 minus 11 or 17-14 so that's how we find out the common difference let's take this one find the common difference of the following number pattern's now you know we can take the difference between two consecutive terms so you can take any two numbers so I'll take these two then what's the difference 16 minus 12 you get this one what's the common difference these two 36 minus 30 that's six when you take these two twenty minus ten that's ten look at this question write down the first five terms of the following number patterns you have given the first term and the common differences you can start from the first seven common difference is three means you need to add three to the previous term 7 + 3 10 10 plus 3 13 13 plus 3 16 16 plus 3 19 one two three four five and you can put three dots to show that it is continuing next one first term is 14 then common difference is plus four means adding four to the previous one four plus 14 plus 480 18 plus four 22 22 plus four 26 26 plus four 30 next one first term six and common difference six so that means multiples of six so starting from 6 6 plus 6 12 12 plus 6 18 18 plus 6 24 24 plus 6/13 this one first term is 12 and the common difference is eight at eight to that 12 plus 8 20 20 plus eight twenty eight twenty eight plus eight 36 36 Plus eight forty four one two three four five can put three dots after that look at this one right down the next two terms of the following sequences so you need to identify the pattern 712 so what's the common difference 12 minus 7 adding fine so that means in this number pattern the common difference is +5 so that means add 5 to that 27 plus 5 32 32 + 5 30 silver this one identify the common difference first you get server last 7 so what you do 41 is the last term so you add 7 to that you get 48 48 plus 750 this one what's the common difference how do you get 12 from 9 adding 3 let me you can start from here 21 plus three twenty four twenty four plus three twenty seven this Molly plus five 16 plus five you get 20 bar then you can 
,,start from here 36 plus five 41 41 plus five 46 this one have you get thirty from twenty four adding six to that so that means 48 plus 6 54 54 plus six that's 60 this one following number pattern is created multiplied the previous term by 2 now this is multiplication 2 times 2 you get 4 4 times 2 8 8 times 2 16 16 times 2 32 so 
,,this is the number pattern so I can write this one starting from 2 4 8 16 32 now look at this 1 2 4 8 10 20 a different number pattern following number pattern is created first added to and then multiplied by 2 so added to 2 plus 2 you get 4 times 2 8 then adding 2 8 plus 2 10 10 times 2 20 so this is also another number pattern so 2 4 8 10 20 now look at these so first 3 terms are the same but fourth term and fifth term those are different so from these two patterns we observed even though the first 3 terms are the same can create different number patterns so same for three terms but you can create different number pants now look at this one added 3 to the previous term 3 plus 3 you get 6 6 plus 3 9 9 plus 3 12 12 plus 3 15 so here what are the numbers three six nine twelve fifteen now first three terms are the same 369 but this is 18 and 21 so how can you create that pattern first multiplied by two and then added three multiplied by two you get six then added 3 6 plus 3 9 then multiplied by 2 again 9 times 2 18 18 plus 3 21 so this one is 3 6 9 18 21 so first three terms are the same but you can create different number patterns fill in the blanks to generate different number patterns so what can we do hi plus 5 10 10 plus 5 15 that means adding 5 15 20 25 30 look at this one you can do another partner we can do multiply by 2 and add 5 5 times 2 10 10 plus 5 15 and what's the next number 15 times 2 30 30 plus 5 35 35 times 2 you get 70 this one 7 14 21 multiples of server so that means adding 7 to that so 21 plus seven twenty eight twenty eight plus seven 35 35 plus 7 42 now create another number pattern different one see first three terms try to create another one this one I can do multiply by 2 and then add 7 multiplied by 2 first and then at 7 so multiply by 221 times 242 add seven more T naught now again x - 2 times 9 18 so 2 times 9 18 2 times 4 8 + 1 98 now we'll discuss what is general term of the number pattern take this number pattern two four six eight ten twelve means even numbers so you want to write down the general term of the multiples of two now we'll try to do that so term number term and pattern okay what's the first term in this sequence or number pattern that's how can I write down two I can write 1 times 2 or 2 times 1 second term second term is 4 
,,try to write down number 4 - x - third term 6 what's the pattern I can write this one as 2 times 3/4 1 8 2 times 4 now see your pattern 10th term I need no tense term so 10th term is what 2 times 10 by looking at the pattern we can get 2 times 10 because first term is 2 times 1 second term is 2 times 2 so temp term 2 times 10 that's 20 then what about nth term n means any term I can write 2 times N or when you write without this multiplication I can write - so what's the enter to win we call this as general term so nth term is the general term of the number pattern so what you can write for multiples of Oh general term is 2 what are the numbers for n you have to start from one n equals 1 first term in equals 2 second term so likewise when you substitute in values we can find out any term so you need general term to find out the terms now what are these numbers 3 6 9 12 15 18 multiples of 3 write down the general term of the multiples of 3 so we'll try to do the same thing like before first term first term is 3 what's the pattern I can write 3 times second term is 6 3 times 2 this number and this one is the same third one 9 3 times 3/4 1 
,,12 3 times 4 then what about temperature I can write 3 times 10 that becomes 30 and what about the general term nth term three times in oh I can write down three so 
,,what's the general term of multiples of 3 is 3 and so I can write down this one as 3 n so we found out the general pattern for multiples of 2 that's 2 it general term for multiples of 3 that's 3 n now this one feel the table below by observing the previous pattern multiples of 2 2 multiples of three general term is 3/8 can you identify then what about multiples of four that's foreign so you saw the patent two three four what about multiples are fired five multiples of 7 this is 7 in multiples of chain chain in and multiples of 11 obviously that's a lemon now the reverse process finding terms using general term if you know the general term how can we find out these terms so in this example first three terms first three terms means N equals one N equals two and in equals three so what you do take the general term substitute one for first term that's three to get the second term you substitute n equal to 3 times 2 6 when N equals 3 you get the third term so that's what about tenth term general term is trillion so tenth term is 3 times 10 that's previous question which tell me 60 now the end term is given 60 and you are asked to find out what's the end value so what you do we equate general term is trillion and that's equal to 60 then how you solve this you can divide this by 3 to get in so 60 divided by 3 what you get n equals 60 divided by 3 you get 20 so 20th term is 60 or in other words we can say 20 multiple of 3 is 60 now the general term is given as 5 in you are asked to find out for three terms 11th term and which term is 75 so what you do for the first three you substitute N equals 1 you get the first term N equals 2 
,,you get the second term M equals 3 you get the good so 5 10 15 are the first three terms and then 11th term next one you are asked to find out the 11th term so how we find out the LMR term substitute 11 so 5 times 11 you get 55 so 11th term is 55 this one the third part which term is 75 means nth term is given 75 so you equate in term is 5 in general term that's equal to 75 so how you find out n divided by 5 75 divided by 5 you get 15 so 15 multiple of 5 is 75 this one you have given the general term is 11 find the 10th term so how you find out the 10th term substitute 10 for and 10th term is equal to 11 times 10 hundred 10 next 120th term so what you 
,,do substitute N equals 20 general term is 11 and that's given and you asked to find out the 20th term substitute in s 20 multiplied by 2 you get 22 put 1 0 220 this 
,,one the third part which term is 121 now the reverse process you'd have given the in term you also find out the in value and the fourth part also same way you asked 
,,to find out which term is 77 so we'll do that substitute then to get n you divide by 11 get 11 for it so 11th term is 121 what about 77 when you divide by 11 you get in ass so so seventh term is 77 fill in the blanks now you have given different number patterns and you asked to write down the first term and the change Roger so observe the first one four eight twelve sixteen multiples of four that means addition multiples are four that means adding four what's the first term for what's the general term for em then 9 18 27 36 multiples of 9 starting from 9 9 18 27 36 so what's the general term 9 in 1 2 3 4 this is also number pattern but you're adding 1 
,,to that so what's the general term starting from 1 we can write 1 in 8 16 24 those are multiples of 8 starting from 8 so the general term is a 10 identify this multiples of 12 starting from 12 you can write 12 in 1 3 5 7 9 11 find the general term for odd numbers what are even numbers 2 4 6 8 so we found out the general pattern 
,,for even numbers multiples of 2 what's that that's 2 in now we'll try to find out the general term for odd numbers what's the first term if it's even numbers what's 
,,the first term but in our pattern the first term is 1 so what can you see you have to subtract 1 to get this one second term even numbers when you consider the second term is 4 but in this one that's 3 how you get 3 from 4 4 minus 1 third term for the even pattern six this one five you can subtract and get five one from the term fourth term is eight for even numbers in this one seven 8 minus 1 is 7 tenth term you get 2 times 10 20 odd numbers what's the 10th term one less than that so we observed a pattern one less than that so I can write 20 minus 1 that's 19 xx - 2 times 20 that's 40 but we know that's this is 1 less than that this is 39 so what's the general term we found out general term for even numbers that's 2 in so what's the pattern 2 n minus 1 so we can straightaway find out the general term for odd numbers that's 2 n minus 1 we can get odd numbers by subtracting 1 from all even numbers so remember now what's the general term for odd numbers 2 n minus 1 using that now we'll try to find our 23rd odd number to do that you need to know the general term so what's the general term for numbers 2 n minus 1 if you want twenty third term you substitute N equals 23 so 2 times 23 minus 1 so what's that you get 46 minus 1 forty hi 45th so what it means here 23rd odd number is 45 find the 36th odd number so what's the general term for numbers to win - what if you want 36 substitute 36 for in 2 times 6 12 1 remaining 2 times 3 6 + 1 7 72 minus 1 you get 71 36th odd number is 71 find the 18th odd number so what's the general term 2 n minus 1 18 term you substitute 18 for 2 times 8 16 1 remaining so 36 minus 1 you get 35 18th odd number is 35 which odd number 33 now the reverse process we know the general term is 2n minus 1 for numbers so we can substitute to win minus 1 is equal to 33 now 
,,is that linear equation simple algebraic equation you know already how to solve that so what you do you can get rid of this minus 1 by you can get rid of this minus 
,,one by adding 133 plus one so what you get here 34 is equal to two it to get em you can divide this by two so when you do that you can get n m equals 2 times 1 2 4 14 that's 7 so 17th odd number is 33 which odd number is 81 now you need to get the general term so what's general term general term is 2 n minus 1 now that's equal to 81 now solve that equation Advan first to get rid of this minus 1 you get 82 is equal to 2 in then you need to divide this by 2 to get n N equals 41 so 41 or term 
,,is 81 which odd term is 17 same thing take the general term equal to 70 get rid of this minus 1 that means adding 1 you get 18 is equal to 2 in then divide by 2 what you get you get 9/9 odd number is 17 now you need to know what R square are numbers so look at this diagram starting from 1 then 2 rows and 2 columns you can create a square so two times two that's four then three rows and three columns you can create the next square number four rows and four columns you can get their next one 
,,now we'll try to find out the general term for square numbers here is the pattern of circles forming squares which lengths and widths are the same what's the first term that's one second term for we'll try to write down the pattern first term I can write one times one second terms I can write 2 times two third term nine that's three times three if it's eight eighth term I can write by looking at this pattern eight times eight what's that 69 tell nine times nine that's 81 then what about enter this should be n times in so n times n you can write down as in squared so what's the general term for square numbers you can take as in squared now using the general term of the square number can you find the tenth square number so what's the generator in squared 10th term means we substitute check ten square are same as ten times ten you get hundred so tenth square number is 100 this one find the 12 square how you do take the general term n squared and it's not stood 12 12 times 12 that's unread 44 so 12 square number is 144 find the 15 square number write down the general term substitute 15 15 times 15 is 225 so 15 square number is 225 now we'll 
,,take triangular numbers look at the picture for starting from 1 you need 3 circles to create the next triangle what about the other one you need 6 circles to create 
,,the next triangular number next 1/4 110 to create the fourth triangular number so what's the first term first term is 1 second term is 3 third term 6 fourth term 10 
,,what about fifth term can you see the pattern right like this this is one how can you get three I can write 1 plus 2 6 1 plus 2 Plus 3 you get 6 10 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus 4 then what about fifth number 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus 4 plus 5 sum of numbers up to 5 so what's the number that means adding 5 to the previous term 10 plus five you get 15 as a fifth term of the triangular numbers now we can find out this one using a method now we'll take this one if you want adding one up to four when you take first and the last you can get one plus four you can get five to plus three you can get high so when you pair up the numbers like this you can get five in two methods either 2 plus 3 or 1 plus 4 so we can easily find out this as 5 is the number when you add you are getting 2 times of that so 5 times 2 that's 10 so this is the 
,,fourth triangular number so if you want fourth you add 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus 4 how we get the number this is the easiest way to do pair up the numbers like this and then see how many times you are getting the number so in the number is 5 and 2 times you are getting that's 10 we'll take another one if you want 8 triangular number 
,,you have to add 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus like that up to 8 when you pair up like this 1 plus h you get 9 2 plus 7 9 3 plus 6 9 4 + 5 9 how many times you are getting nine one two three four four times you're getting nine so what's the number 36 so eight triangular number is 36 now 10th triangular number what you do 1 plus 2 plus up 
,,to 10 so when you pair up how many sets you can get think about a pattern now previous one we got 4 into 9 is equal to 36 4 is yeah how many digits are there eight 8/2 so we can think about this is 8 divided by 2 you get 4 what about 9 9 you are getting think about first and last 1 plus 8 you did not so we'll try to use that pattern in the next one what's the total 1 plus 10 you are getting 11 2 plus 9 also 11 so how many Elevens you can you will get we can see 10 numbers that they are 10 divided by 2 5 times you are getting 11 so 5 times 11 oh I can write 5 as 10 divided by 2 and how you get 11 first and the last one 1 plus J now can you see the pattern 11 is obtained by adding the first term and the last term the following are 5 such terms so how you create that 10 divided by 2 now what is 10 number of terms and this is the first term and this is the last / - I can rewrite this as this 10 times 10 plus 1 is 11 over 2 so what's the formula you can find the number of terms multiplied by first and the last term addition divided by two so we'll try to apply this formula to find out any triangular number take this one one two eight eight triangular number what's the pattern again we found from the previous one number of terms into first Plus last divided by 2 number of terms 8 divided by 2 and x first 
,,and last one plus 8 again i can write 8 times 9/2 so when you simplify what you get 2 times 1/2 times 4 36 1 2 20 mins xx triangular number so I can write 20 divided by 2 here x 1 plus 20 this is same as 20 into 21 divided by 2 when you simplify you get 210 this one 50th triangular number 50 numbers are they are and divided by 2 1 plus 50 50 times 51 divided by 2 you get 25 times 50 baht so multiplication 25 times 51 means first multiply by 20 and then 5 2 times 1 is 2 and 2 times 5 ten high times 1/5 and 5 times 5 25 so when you add it you get thousand 275 now you need to find out the generator so what's the pattern if there are n digits in the next number is one more than that n plus 1 if the previous number is in you're adding 1 to that n plus 1 divided by 2 so what's the general term for the triangular number 
,,n times n plus 1 divided by 2 here you don't need to write down multiplication side brackets also ok but if you think that this is not talking you can write as in times n plus 1 divided by 2 so we'll try to find out any triangular number using the chain rule to find the 10th triangular number so what's the general term for triangular numbers in times in plus 1/2 now if you want 10th one you substitute 10 10 is n 10 plus 1 over 2 so 10 times 11 over 2 that becomes 50 so general term is n into n plus 1 over 2 for triangular numbers find the 20th triangular number so general term ending to n plus 1/2 so you need xx that means in equals 20 so 20 into 20 plus 125 so you get 10 times 21 210 find the fortieth triangular number you need the general term n into n plus 1 divided by 2 when this is 40 so 14 241 over 2 divided by 2 you get 20 that means multiply by 2 and put a 0 2 times 1 to 2 times 4 8 44th triangular number same as before to take the general term and substitute 44 now substitute 44 44 into 45 44 + 1 then x 22 so 45 x 22 you get 900 plus 45 945 so 945 is the 44th triangular number find xxx triangular number general term so the triangular numbers are n into n plus 1 divided by 2 so if this is xxx triangular number substitute N equals 30 fifteen times 31 so 31 into 15 10 and 5 multiply by 1 and then multiply by 5 add it together you get 465 is the 30th triangular number find the hundredths triangular number general term is n into n plus 1 divided by 2 in this hundred substitute hundred here you get 50 times hundred one so put 0 and x 5050 is the hundredth triangular number 1 + 2 + 3 up to 15 from this sequence which triangular number do you get we observe the pattern 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 fourth triangular number 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 v triangular number so if this is up to 15 this is 15th triangular number up to 28 adding 1 + 2 + 3 up to 20 so what is the triangular number that's xx from this sequence which triangular number one up to 27 so that's 27th triangular this one up to 19 so this is 19th triangular find the sixteenth triangular number if the fifteenth triangular number is 120 so we know the pattern fourth triangular number 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus 4 then to get the fifth one you have to add 5 to that now 16 1 you need so fifteenth one is 120 so how do you get the 16th one 
,,"from 15th one you need to add which number either 15 or 16 you have to add 16 to that so 120 plus 16 you get 136 this one find the 21st triangular number if the 20th one is given 210 you are asked to find out 21st one so which number you need to add 210 plus 21 so that's one here 3 2 231 find the 10th triangular number the 9th triangular number is 55 it's a similar way ninth one is 55 and you are asked to find out the tenth one so how do you do ad turn to that get 65 find the 80th triangular number if the 79th one is given as 3,240 have you get that adding 80 to that so at eighty three thousand three hundred twenty that's the 80th triangular number now we'll try to find out pattern in between square our numbers and the triangular numbers so what are these 1 3 6 10 15 21 are triangular numbers let's take 1 + 3 is 4 so 4 is the square number that's the second square number and here 3 plus 6 you get 9 that's the third square number what about this one 6 + 10 you get 16 so what's that that's the fourth square number I can write this one is 2 squared second square number third square number 3 squared 16 is 4 square number now try to identify "
,,a pattern what's one that's the first triangular number so if I put a symbol like this is first triangle enough 3 is the second triangular number so when you add these two you are getting second square number I put a square to represent the word square what about this one second triangular number and this is third triangular number you are getting third square number find out a relationship this is third triangular number this is fourth triangular number you are getting fourth square number have you seen the pattern 3 4 3 + 1 4 2 + 1 3 1 + 2 2 2 consecutive triangular numbers when you add you get this square number so last square number if this is 4 this is fourth square number if this is 3 this is third square number and this this is 2 this is second square number so what's the pattern when you take any triangular number twenty first triangular number plus twenty second triangular number what you get we get 20 second square number now we'll use that pattern to identify this 
,,one fifth triangular number and sixth triangular number what you get what's the pattern you get sixth square number so you can write what's this number here six square then what about tenth one and eleventh triangle you are getting xi square number you can write 10 1 plus xi 1 you get xi square Arnim 21st and the 22nd but you get 21st triangular number and 22nd triangular number you get 22nd square number 20 or we can write in numbers 22nd square 33rd triangular number and 34th triangular number you are getting 34th square you can do this is 33 33rd triangular number and 34th triangular number you are getting thirty fourth square no so that's the relationship between triangular numbers and the square numbers now we will look at example number 1 in your textbook write the terms of each of the following number patterns the number pattern of the prime numbers between 1 and 17 written in ascending order so what are prime numbers only divisible by 1 and itself what's the lowest prime number 2 so you can write down to then what's the next prime number 3 5 7 11 13 14 15 16 then 17 but can we write down 17 it says in between in between means between means 1 and 17 not included so you can't write 17 there so ascending order means lowest to highest second one the number pattern of the odd number starting from one written in ascending order just the odd numbers 1 3 5 7 11 13 all numbers so what we do we have to put three dots to represent this is continuing third one the 
,,number pattern starting from 1 and followed by the terms two and one written alternatively so as to when one separately starting from one and followed by the terms so starting from one followed by the terms two and one written alternately 2 1 2 look again 1 2 so that's another number pad so we can put three dots to represent this is continuing exercise 1.1 fill in the blanks in the number pattern 1 3 5 7 9 what's the first term 1 second term is 3/4 - 1 2 3 4 that's seven in the number pattern 4 8 12 16 20 multiples of 4 the first term is 4 second term that's 8 and the third term is 12 question number two write the terms of each of the following number 
,,patterns the number pattern of the even numbers between one and nine written in ascending order so what's the first number even numbers 2 4 6 8 10 10 you can write because this is in between these 1 & 9 so this is in ascending order so that's up to this point next one the number pattern of the multiples of 6 from 6 to 36 written in ascending order so multiples of 6 to 36 means you can write 36 as well 6 times 2 12 6 times 3 18 24 6 times 5 30 6 times 6 36 the number pattern of the even numbers greater than 7 written in ascending order greater than 7 means above 7 so what's the lowest even number 8 starting from 8 you can write 8 10 12 like that so this is continuing with 3 dots the number pattern of the prime number starting from 2 written in ascending order so starting from 2 what are the prime numbers 2 3 5 7 like that this is not ending in finite number pattern so you can put three dots question number three copy the below given statements in your exercise book and mark the correct statements with a correct or incorrect symbol we'll take the first one the terms of a number patent have to be in ascending order tick ten eight six like that that's not in ascending order that's descending order that's also a number pattern so the first one is wrong because no need to be always in ascending order second one the terms of a number patent have to be different from each other no because five five five this is also number pattern so no need to be different to each other so here this is also wrong third one if the tenth term of two number patterns are different then the two number patterns are different to each other so think about you have two number sets number patterns tenth term here you got five hundred something here the tenth term is two hundred so different so different means the two 
,,number patterns are different so it says if the tenth term of two number patterns are different then the two number patterns are different so that's true example number one consider number pattern of the multiples of two starting from two written in ascending order so when you write down the number pattern this is two four six eight like that multiples of to find 11th term so what's the general term we know multiples of two the general term is two ends then using the general term you can answer these questions eleventh term so have you find out the 11th term substitute 11 for you get 2200 third term 2 times 103 you get 206 then the last part find which term is hot so 128 of this number pattern that means we know the general term is to win that's given as 728 so how we find out in divide this by to say 128 divided 
,,by 2 2 times 3 6 6 4 12 and 4 for 8 360 fourth term that's multiple of 2 is 728 example number 2 the general term of the number pattern of the multiples of 3 starting from 3 and written in ascending order is 3 so already given so we can write down 3 6 9 12 like that so nth term is given or the general term is 3 in first part find the 13th term so I will find out the 13th term substitute 13 in 9 so 39 then part to find which term is 87 so 87 is equal to three yen so how do you find out n divided by three so in so I'll rewrite this in other way rock three and means eighty-seven divided by 3 you get in eighty seven divided by three twenty ninth term is 87 in other words twenty nine multiple of three is 87 example number three in the number pattern of the multiples of four starting from four and written in ascending order with general term for so general term is given for then what's the chapter tenth term means and B equals can write substitute and nickel step four times 10 that means what part two what is the 11th term so 11th term just substitute in equals 11 four times 11 you get 44 which term is hundred so this is continuation so this is about multiples of four four which term is 100 so in this one in term is given for n means given 100 divided by four to get and when you divide by 4 you get 25 so 
,,25 fifth multiples of 4 is 100 is 43 a term of this number pattern what are the reasons for your answer okay we'll check whether 43 in this number pattern for N equals 43 you divide by four what happens you get ten yeah one and here nothing and three remaining out of four you're getting a fraction for n what is n means number of terms can you get a fraction for a number of terms you can't get a fraction so that's why so 43 is not in the number pattern so here we can write in either fraction there are 4 43 is not in this exercise 1.2 copy the table given below and complete it number pattern first term and the generator so what's the first term here hi these are multiples of 5 so what's the general term 5 in multiples of 2 that's 2 with multiples of 3 3 multiple of ten that's ten named this is 10 20 multiples of 10 
,,starting from 10 you can write 10 in 8 16 24 32 multiples of 8 starting from a twister this is 8 n these are multiples of 7 starting from 7 7 and what about this one multiples of 12 starting from 12 that's 12 in and 1 2 3 4 multiples of once so starting from 1 this is 1 in oh you can write without one just in question number to 
,,write the number pattern of the multiples of 5 between three and thirty-three written in ascending order so starting from three to 33 in between so what's the first 
,,multiple of five five five times to 10 five times three 15 20 25 30 35 but you can't write 35 this should be in between 3 and 33 so up to this point so this is a finite number partner question number three in the number pattern 11 22 33 of the multiples of 11 starting from 11 and written in descending order what is the general term we already know the general term is 11 and what is the 9th term you substitute in equals nice 11 times 9 that's 99 which term is 121 now we know the general term 11 M equals 120 1 when you divide by 11 you get N equals 11 11th multiple of 11 is 125 fourth one in the number pattern 9 18 27 36 of the multiples of 9 starting from 9 and written in ascending order what is the general term now you already know multiples of 9 the general term is 9 end what is the element job substitute in equals 1199 third part which term is 217 e now we know the general term is 9 in equate to 270 so when you divide by 9 what you get xxx term is 270 question number five in the number pattern with general term hundred in so you have given general term as hundred what is the eleventh term so 11th term means you're substituting in equals eleven hundred times you never you get 1100 part two which term is 500 that means 100 N equals 500 when you divide by hundred you get fifth term is 500 question number six what is the smallest multiple of three larger than 100 which term is it in the number pattern of the multiples of three starting from three okay so larger than 100 101 check whether it's divisible divided by 3 3 times 3 9 4 11 you can't you can't divide by 3 102 3 times 3 9 12 12 is divisible by 3 so what's the lowest number multiple of 3 after 100 that's 102 which term is it in the number pattern of the multiples of 3 starting from 3 so 3 6 9 like that they are asking which term is 102 so that means we know these are multiples of 3 what's the general term 3 n so we can equate 3n equals 102 so what's a divided by 3 you get 34 so 34 multiple of 3 is hundred - question number 7 what's the nth term that's basically general term of the pattern of the even numbers greater than 1 but less than 200 greater than 
,,1 what's the lowest multiple of 2 that's 2 for each like that what's the largest number less than 200 you can't write 200 so one before that 198 this is in ascending order smallest to largest the smallest value of n is 1 we know n V equals 1 you get the first what is its largest value that means you are that means you need to find the value of n 498 so we can write 2 N equals hundred ninety-eight divided by 2 so that means 99th term is 198 question number eight it has been estimated that in a country having a population of 2 million people the population will increase by 2 million every 25 years estimate the population of the country in 200 years so first thing we need to find out how many years are there how many steps are there for 200 years so every 25 years it's increasing so find out how many times it's changing 200 divided by 25 is 8 so that means 8 times it's changing so starting from 2 million so I'll write millions here so starting from 2 after first 25 years this becomes 4 million adding 2 million every 25 years so they're asking if this is 200 years not the population if this is 200 years that means if this is 200 years that means 8 times this is increasing so that means 8 turn 8 term of this sequence so after 50 years this becomes 6 million so this is the sequence we know these are multiples of 2 so what's the general term that's 2 when so you need 8 term what's the eighth term 2 times 8 that's 16 so these are in millions so we can write 16 million 
,,people after 200 years example number four in the pattern of the odd numbers starting from one what is the general term so one three five seven what are those odd numbers we found out even numbers the pattern is 2n odd numbers you can get it from subtracting one from even numbers so what's the general term of odd numbers - in - 
,,we'll do the second part part 2 what is the 72nd term so we know the general term is 2 n minus 1 so 70 second term is n V equals 72 so substitute you get 2 times 72 
,,minus 1/2 times 2 for 2 times 7 14 minus 1 you get 143 so 70 second term is 143 third part which term is 51 this is about odd number so general term is 2 n minus 1 that's equal to 55 add 1 to get rid of this one and then you get 2n equals 52 divided by 2 you get 2 times 2 4 4 12 that's six twenty sixth term is 51 exercise 1.3 in the pattern of the odd numbers starting from one and written in ascending order what is the twelfth term so what are the numbers 1 3 5 those are the odd numbers what's the general term for numbers we know that general term is 2 and minus 1 you can use that general term you are asked to find out 12th term 12 term means you substitute 12 in and you get 23 for that and what's the fifteenth term 15 term you substitute N equals 15 30 minus 1 you get 29 part 3 which term is 89 is all about odd numbers so we can write down n star is 89 add 1 you get 90 equals to n divided by 2 you get 90 divided by 2 45 part 4 which term is the greatest odd number less than 
,,100 what's the odd number greatest or number 99 so 99 is the largest or number less than 100 question number 2 find the value of the sum of the 34th term of the pattern of the even number starting from two and the 34th term of the pattern of the odd number starting from what so there are two patterns here what's the first pattern even numbers so starting from two so two four six like that so you are taking thirty fourth term of the even number and the thirty fourth term of them odd numbers 
,,what are numbers one for what are numbers one three five seven so they asking thirty fourth after odd number as well and first you need to find out thirty fourth term separately I'll take the total because you need the sum okay so we know the general term of the even numbers is to it then which term you need thirty fourth term N equals 34 you get sixty eight in this sequence odd numbers what's the general term one less they're even numbers to win minus one so what's thirty fourth term of that two times 34 minus 1 you get 67 now they asking what's the sum of these two values so 68 plus sixty seven hundred thirty-five exercise 1.4 what is the 10th term of the square number pattern starting from 1 and written in ascending order can you remember the general term of a square number general term of square numbers N squared now they asking temperature so starting from here you have to always look at the starting point so 1/4 like that so when you take the square numbers 1 squared 2 
,,squared 4 3 squared 9 so what's the 10th term 10th term you substitute 10 10 squared means 10 times 10 hundred question number two what is the tenth term of the triangular number pattern starting from one and written in ascending order so what are triangular numbers 1 plus 2 3 3 plus 3 6 6 plus 4 10 10 plus 5 15 and what's the general term of triangular numbers we found that general term for triangular numbers are in n plus 1 over 2 now we need till term 10th triangular number substitute 10 for n 10 times 10 plus 1 divided by 2 or you can write 10 times 11 divided by 2 2 times 5 11 times 5 is 55 question number 3 a certain number greater than 1 less than 50 which is a term of the square number pattern starting from 1 so 1 2 squared is 4 so like wise this is less than 50 and written this is in green and written in 
,,ascending order is also a term of the triangular number pattern starting from 1 and written in ascending order so in triangular numbers 1 1 plus 2 3 3 plus 3 6 like 
,,that 10 15 these are triangular numbers so one term is in both number partners what is this term so they are asking what is this term we know what's the general term of square numbers we know that's N squared what's the general term of triangular number in n plus 1 divided by 2 if one number in both number patterns these two are equal so we can take N squared is equal to in n plus 1 over 2 now what can I do I can multiply both sides by 2 to get cancel out I get 2 N squared is equal to expand brackets you get N squared n into n n squared n into 1 that's plus N when you take this term to this side 2 N squared minus n square what you get these are like terms I can ride to n square minus N squared is equal to n so N squared is equal to n so I can divide this by n you get N equals 1 so only number belongs to both is N 
,,equals 1 so we can write N equals 1 is there term belongs to both of these number factors square number as well as a triangular number question number 3 a certain number greater than 1 and less than 50 which is a term of the square number pattern starting from 1 L written in ascending order is also a term of the triangular number pattern starting from 1 and written in ascending order so we'll take square numbers first starting from 1 for 2 squared 9 16 4 squared 5 squared 25 6 squared 36 7 
,,squared 49 because up to 49 because this is less than 50 if you take triangular numbers when you take triangular numbers starting from 1 1 plus 2 3 3 plus 3 you get 
,,6 6 plus 4 10 10 plus 55 15 15 plus 6 21:21 plus seven twenty eight twenty eight plus eight 36 36 Plus 9 45 and 45 plus ten 55 you can't write 55 because this is less than 50 so these are the square numbers and these are the triangular numbers and they asking one number is there in both sequence greater than one so don't consider one day are other than one there's another number which numbers in both sequence 36 so 36 is the term in both number patterns which square number is it one two three four five six six square number which triangular number is it one two three four five six seven eight eight triangular question number four the sum of the fourteenth and fifteen terms of the triangular number pattern starting from one is a square number show that this statement is true and find which term it is of the square 
,,number pad fourteen and fifteen triangular numbers and this is the sum can you remember the pattern we observed first triangular number and the second triangular number is equal to the second square number if you take eight one and ninth number of the triangular numbers the sum is equal to the ninth square number now they're asking fourteenth triangular number and the fifteenth triangular number is which one fifteen square number so when you take this one this is the square number you get 15 square number so is this statement correct the sum of two triangular numbers these are consecutive two triangular numbers that's equal to a square number so the statement is true can dried statement is true and find the term it is of the square number pattern find which term so which term is that fifteen square question number five write the total number of triangles in each figure in order and see whether you can identify the pattern the pattern of the total number of triangles in the figures in the the given order is identical to the pattern of triangular numbers starting from one L written in ascending order find the total number of triangles in the eighth figure that is drawn according to this pattern so we need to find out how many triangles are there first diagram how many triangles are there just one triangle this one one two and we can take the bigger one that's three this one one two three four five six what about this one first we'll count small numbers small triangles one two three four if you take two at a time one two three so 4 plus 3 7 and then 7 8 9 and the bigger one that's 10 so these are the number of triangles inside these diagrams the pattern of the total number of triangles in the figure in the given order is identical to the pattern of the triangular number starting from 1 and written in ascending order so we found out these are triangular numbers find the total number of triangles in the eighth figure so we'll see what's the total number of triangles so we can find out that term we already know in into n plus 1/2 if you want the a trigger so that means eighth term in equals 8 8 times 8 + 1 9 divided by 2 2 times 1/2 times 4 that means 36 so you can write there are 36 triangles in the eighth trigger question number 6 sigh uni buys a till and start saving money by putting 1 rupee into it on the first day so 1 so 1 rupee first day on the second day she puts 2 rupees so second day she puts 2 rupees means the total is 2 plus 
,,1 333 rupees so increasing 3 plus 3 6 and so how much money is in the till by the end of the tenth day now what's this button these are triangular numbers 1 3 6 next day 4 rupees 6 plus 4 10 so these are triangular numbers you can apply the general term so what's the general term of triangular numbers and mean 2n plus 1 divided 
,,by 2 now they ask what's the value and of 10th day so 10th term turn into 11 divided by 2 divided by 2 you get 55 that means 55 rupees in the 1030 so siren approached 55 rupees in the tank miscellaneous exercise in the pattern of the odd number starting from 1 commencing from the first term if the first two terms then the first 
,,three terms then the first four terms are added and continued accordingly a special type of numbers is obtained what is the special name given to these numbers find 
,,the number that is obtained if 15 of these terms are added in order to in order starting from the first term so read it carefully in the pattern of the odd number starting from 1 1 3 5 like that 7 commencing from the first term if the first two terms first is 1 first 2 terms what's the addition of first 2 terms you get for first 3 terms five five plus three eight eight plus one nice first four terms nine plus seven 16 what you get what are these numbers these are square numbers so what is the special name for this these are square numbers find the number that is obtained if 15 of these terms I added that means you're asking to find out the fifteenth - 
,,so 15th term you can use the general term so general term of the square numbers is equal to N squared the fifteenth term is 15 squared that means 15 times 15 220 question number two milk things brought to a shop to be sold were arranged on a rack in the following manner ten teens on the lowest shelf and every other shelf having 
,,one chin less than the number on the shelf below one ting on the top most shop so one next one adding so two three like that what's the lowest one that's ten things 
,,so this is like a triangle okay be right this way first shelf one second shelf two teens third shelf three teens like that last shelf the bottom shelf that's ten find a number of milk tins that were brought to the shop so that means adding all these numbers so what's the sum you can add 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus 4 plus 5 plus 6 plus 
,,seven plus eight plus nine plus ten can you remember what's the pattern there this is like one to ten addition that means this is like tenth trying unit number finding tenth triangular number so without adding up to ten you can just do this is tenth triangular number what's the generator general term of the triangular number is 
,,n into n plus one Oh - it's a substitute ten ten into eleven divided by 2 you get fifty five tins are there by two all the milk tins on the four topmost shelves were sold within two weeks find the number of milk tins that were sold so first four means 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus 4 that means fourth triangular number will substitute to 
,,the formula in equals 4 4 times 5 divided by 2 you get 10 so this is the number of teens sold within two weeks so what's the so they're asking the number of milk teens that were sold so number number of teens sold is question number three what is the sum of the integers from 1 to 31 - like that they are asking what's the sum of 
,,all digits up to 30 so we know 1 + 2 + 3 up to 30 is the 30th triangular number general term of the triangular number is n into n plus 1 divided by 2 now substitute 
,,30 there what you get divided by 2 you get 15 times 31 multiply 30 1 times 15 multiply 10 and 5 you get 5 times 1 5 5 times 3 15 465 so sum of all digits 1 - 30 is 465 so we covered all theory related to number patterns let's your first unit we'll see what we did so we did an expression in in obtain for the intern how to find out the general term and then we did always in should be a positive whole number starting from 1 you can't get fraction 4 in then the next one general term of multiples of 2 you got to win general term of odd numbers subtract 1 from that that's 2n minus 1 general term of square numbers that's N squared finally we did general term 
,,of triangular numbers that's n into n plus 1 over 2 and also we observed another thing when you add two consecutive triangular numbers you will get a square number if it's first one and second one addition of triangular numbers you get second square number eight one and ninth one triangular numbers you get nine square not so remember all these and practice with all exercises and examples when you practice you can master in number patterns
,,
Number Partens,-3k8ptUqICA,did I gents I hope you guys are doing role and that you're managing during this lockdown period I'm driving the parents up for whoa I thought I just put a short lesson together of this number pattern section that is also in your textbooks there might be a few areas that you're not too sure about hopefully this all are not those 
,,issues and help you to completely understand there are a few things in the section that are pretty simple that I'm sure you guys already know how to do so I can spend too much time on that I'm going to be focusing more on the work concerning the general rule and number patterns okay so let's get started this will be familiar to 
,,you because this is from your textbook in the section of there are a few things first of all identify pattern or relationship between consecutive terms in order to extend the pattern that's the easy part make a general rule about the pattern with which you can find consecutive terms that's what I'm going to be focusing on the most now and work with geometric patterns links quite wrong with the previous one okay so a few examples of identifying the pattern and extending it here you can see we have all of terms er particular terms get these are called terms and they have positions as well one two three four five six you see there that are going up bar - 
,,maybe term is going up by two so he's heading to every term so the next number of the 14 will be 14 plus 2 which is 16 and just show another yeah we've clearly yeah 
,,we have another pattern goes from 3 to 7 to 11 to 15 so it's pretty clear that it's going up up for every time so to get the next term off the 15 you add 4 we'll get 19 and then you're off the 19 you add for gang and get to any needed 3 etc third one is a little bit different because it's not additional subtraction all we have multiplication so you go from 1 to 3 you have to multiply by 3 from 3 to 9 you multiple three and nine to 27 lost power 3 so to go from 27 to the next term you have to multiply by 3 and you'll get 81 you know do the same with 81 to get to the next term if you want to yeah we just have a pattern involving shapes so yeah we have these to be shapes here and you see going to be adding to here going from 1 1 tone 1 squared - 3 squeeze you have to add 2 or 3 squares to 6 squares you have to add 3 
,,so you added to you at a 3 thanks oh I ain't going to add 4 you see over here then the one after that before we going to add 5 ok yeah we just have some fractions makes a little bit more interesting we see the numerator numerator adding 1 every time we have - 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 the denominator starting with F 3 and adding before every time so as it shows you add 1 to the numerator every time and then add 4 to the denominator okay I'm not going to go too much into this next one yeah it's just exercise 1 yeah identify the relationship between the consecutive terms I write down the next to turn that is the easy part it's not that hard to identify a pattern and the until you determine the consecutive terms I'm pretty sure you guys are able to do this on your own and if you're stuck weasel in the night okay so the more challenging part is finding the general rule for pattern but I'm going to explain it to you and I'm pretty sure you get it do you cookie if you haven't done so already okay so the general rule for number patterns it shows the relationship between the term at its position than the sequence we often refer to the true as T in or the in - so we'll you'll see a few symbols here and I will explain what those symbols mean because I do have a specific meaning so when when we do number patterns one of the most common ones we refined our ones with a constant difference between the terms so most of the ones we've looked at already have that type of sequence so if the sequence IV a go from 2 to 7 for 7 to 12 and 12 to 17 in other words you're adding far every time so that is your constant difference okay constant because it's the same thank you Tom so adding 5 every time so what do these symbols mean here T is abandoned one is representing the position so it's the value of the first two this one is the value of the second to the value of the third value of the fourth term in which we see over here in represents the position but like I said here that's in usually so that position is the first one but T is the value if you understand that it'll really help you a lot going forward and don't only get confused between the two so here what they're saying is the value of the fourth one minus the value of the third one is equal to the value of the third one minus the value of the second one which is equal to the value of the second one - that ideally the first one gives you far this is the wildest rating that they have a constant difference but you don't you know that you won't be lost that sort of question or to write that out on a test that's just a way of showing you at the constant difference is 5 ok so 
,,let's do an example here we have sequence 3 270 11 to 15 determine the general rule of the sequence from si the general rule that's another way of writing it in symbolic form ok the general rule so how do we do that like we sort of the previous example you look for a constant difference so what is the difference between each turn and is it constant in this case it is we have we are adding for every time and by the way constant difference isn't always addition it can be subtraction so if this is written the other way around 15 11 7 3 then our constant difference wouldn't beat plus 4 between minus 4 okay let's deal with the first question before we get to regions adding 4 that is your constant difference so remember you'll general over here TN is equal to 4 n minus 1 that's your answer but you will you're going to start off with the difference the difference is full okay so you're right down to write down 4 that's it that's all you need right done and then it's always going to 
,,be 4 times in so it's always going to do the constant difference Tom's in now what is in in is the position so you can pick any one of these as long as you write substitute the position and then so let's take the first position now this is the first term so this position is 1 so you put full Tom's 1 what is for Tomba 1/4 but with a value of the first position is multiple the value of the first position is 3 so you put 3 in there so you've got like a little equation wrong so 3 equals 4 so what unless you do to this 4 because 3 doesn't equal 4 3 equals 4 minus 1 so this minus 1 over here you need to work out it is not going to be given to you it's not always going to be minus 1 sometimes when you plus 2 u plus 5 or minus 6 it can be anything the point is you get this value by applying the method that I just explained so let's recap the first thing you do if you get asked to determine the general find the constant difference the constant difference in this case is full so you're right down to four okay and then four times in so you pick any position I usually pick one so four times one okay but then you write the value you have to write the value of that position on this side of the equal sign TN remember T stands for the value so you've got three here equals four now you need to do something to this four times one to get it to equal the side of the equals R otherwise this equal sign means nothing and that equals means that's the same so you've got three equals full and then it's going to have to be minus one to be current or a chance all right that makes sense what letter to Ward's on is just not find the 58 turn in the pattern using the general rule is the next question so 58th turn that's its position we need to find the value of that to so we remove position must go in the place of in because in represent position so then you're going to write 58 in ins place so you will have to say four times 58 minus one and that is going to give you your value of this of the X term which is 231 so the value or the 58th term is 231 but they can also ask you the other way around like this which term in the sequence has a value of 30 on so now you don't put that 39 in the in position because in represent position this is a value so you have to put it in T's places so you have to put it in this on this side okay so if we scroll down you'll see four n minus one equals 39 so that means if you take that one away that means you have to add one to the side so you get four in equals 40 now what Tom's full gives you 40 because that's what ins position is 4 times 10 gives you 14 so in equals 10 what does that mean what does it mean of in is 10 that means the position of this value is thin so they said which term in the sequence has a value of 59 so we know that the 10th term in this sequence will have the value of 39 this saves you Tom you don't have to write out the sequence until you get to the 10th term does that make sense because we can ask you much bigger numbers that are going to take you very long to add out the sequence in order to get you the 10th term or whatever term it is here's another example that we're gonna have a look at given the sequence determine the general rule so you see this is a common question well what is the first thing we need to do I 
,,put it above you have to look for the constant difference what is the constant difference here to go from negative 2 to negative 5 and from negative 5 to negative anything from negative a to negative 11 you have to subtract 3 you subtract 3 from the negative 2 you get negative 5 etc so that is a constant difference negative 3 so you write down negative 3 Tom's 1 that would be the position the so if your first if you choose your first position where negative 3 time to 1 but the first positions value over there is negative 2 a negative 3 times 1 equals negative 3 not negative 2 so what do we need to do to negative 3 to get it to the end of T we have to add 1 so that answers our question yet so T end will equal negative 3 in plus 1 now can use that general rule to answer the questions that follow and here's a lovely 
,,exercise which you guys can do that will help you to apply the list of the defender guarding general rule yeah they give you the general rule already so that's not too bad they've given it they've given it to you're ready and you need to determine the first three terms so let's have a look at this tricky if you put the first term would be position one so you put one in the inter-basin can we call it a substitution like when you substitute someone on the sports would you replace them so you 
,,replace their in with one that'll give you one plus two which will give you the value of the first term which is three then you substitute 2 in a for the second term so two plus two is four and then for the third term you three plus two is five so you get it was three four and five and you do the same for all of these to get the value in first three terms to determine the hundreth term you put a hundred in here a hundred plus two it's going to be a hundred and two for question two point one okay I know I've gone through this change by quickly image it's quite difficult sometimes to explain without writing on that on a whiteboard to you what I'm thinking but gentlemen you're and feel free to ask me any questions in the comment section of this video or you are walking to send me a private message and I'll get back to you right over this

Number Partens,wfAyddSr9_w,atterns patterns are created when figures shapes objects etc are arranged in a particular order and repeated over and over again we all must have seen the different kinds of patterns in our daily life like on clothes bedsheets sari borders Garland's etc look at the bracelet we have a square circle triangle square circle triangle and so on this is called a pattern as it is repeating itself look we got the pattern now let us try making few more patterns look at this bag of flashcards each card has a pattern of dots look we have arranged few cards according to the increasing order of the dots starting with a card with two dots three dots for dots five dots kid let us follow the same pattern and find out the next four cards yes correct the next card will be with six dots then seven dots then eight dots and lastly nine dots kids isn't it interesting we can find pattern in letters too now observe the given pattern and write the next four letters we can see that letter E and letter B are placed alternatively this becomes our pattern so the next letter will be letter A then letter B then again letter A and lastly letter B did you know we find patterns in numbers also let's see how starting with number two when we skip count by twos we get four six eight denne 12 14 and 16 now observe the given pattern and 
,,write the next four numbers look at the pattern carefully what can you observe correct on subtracting four from 40 we get 36 which is the next number now again on subtracting four from 36 we get the next number that is 32 we see that in each step the numbers are reducing by 4 hence by using this number pattern we can find the next four numbers so we get the four numbers as 28 24 20 and 16 wasn't it fun learning about patterns

Number Partens,5Re3nbmqVaU,Hello and welcome to Number Sequencing. In this video you'll learn how to predict
,,"which number comes next in a series of numbers. Patterns are all around us. Patterns can be repeated items, shapes,"
,,"colors, images, or numbers. Sometimes a set of things are"
,,repeated to create a pattern. Number patterns are fun because you need to
,,"look carefully for clues to complete them. Here is a number pattern, or a"
,,sequence of numbers. What comes next? This is a fairly easy pattern because
,,"we count this one all the time. 1, 2, 3, 4, and... What comes next? Yes. 5. The number five completes this pattern. Here is another one. What comes next? Let's see. "
,,"We have 2, 4, 6. If you look for clues, we see that each number"
,,in this sequence is greater by 2. 2 + 2 is 4. 4 + 2 is 6. That is a clue. We should add 2 to 6 to give us the
,,"next number, which is... 8. Good work. Number patterns can also work in reverse. For example, in this pattern, what comes next? Your detective skills tell you that the"
,,"numbers are decreasing. That means that this pattern isn't adding on. It's subtracting. In fact, the pattern is decreasing by 1. 10 - 1 is 9. 9 - 1 is 8. 8 - 1 is 7. That means the next number should also be subtracted by 1 to give us the next"
,,number in this sequence. 7 - 1 is... 6. Yes. The next number in this sequence is 6. And there you have it. You now know how to complete a number
,,sequence using the patterns as clues. Keep practicing on our fun online
,,"games and quizzes, and always remember to be clever."

Number Partens,tGdNPR1b7Zc,five guns now let us see some examples of patterns now let's extend this pattern a whistle to floss a whistle to flowers and Bosch should I keep next right a whistle a whistle - plus a whistle two flaws a whistle pattern is complete now let's extend this pattern orange whistle pink whistle orange whistle pink whistle orange whistle pink whistle orange we see our pattern is complete as you can see we have some shapes on the board these shapes are in a particular pattern they are two lines and a circle again two line and a circle so friends now let's complete this pattern two lines and a circle two lines and a circle two lines and circle again two lines 
,,and a circle in this pattern we have yellow triangle and blue triangle upside down yellow triangle and blue triangle upside down so let's complete this pattern we draw yellow triangle and blue triangle upside down yellow triangle and blue triangle upside down yellow triangle and blue triangle will be upside down in this pattern 
,,we have a blue flower and yellow apple a blue flower and yellow apple so let completive pattern a blue flower and yellow apple a blue flower eye yellow apples a blue flower and yellow apple in this pattern we have a circle and a rectangle a circle and a rectangle so let's complete this pattern we have a blue circle yellow rectangle blue circle yellow rectangle blue circle yellow rectangle in this pattern we have some lollipops yellow lollipop and blue lollipop upside down yellow lollipop and now let's draw you lollipop upside down yellow lollipop and blue lollipop will be upside down yellow lollipop and view lollipop will be upside down yellow lollipop and upside-down Bua lollipop I have one more pattern with missing shapes so let's try and complete the pattern this time I have a triangle a circle a triangle and a missing shape so what comes after triangle circle so let's draw a circle again we have a triangle and a missing shape and a triangle so what comes after triangle a 
,,circle you're right isn't it easy now we have a vertical pattern we have a flower apple missing shape apple flower missing shape and a flood so let's try and fill these boxes flower apple now again a flower apple flower and now apple you're right pattern is complete pick the odd one out I have many cars here which is the odd one come on find out right this car is the old one because all other cars are small and this car is big so or one out now let's see this example I have a group of class I a whistle so which is the odd one out right whistle is the odd one out let's pick out or one out now I have a group of Bissell's which is the odd one out let's find out and pick up this is the odd one out in this group we have triangle triangle triangle circle and triangle so which people is all is right the circle is odd so 
,,let's cross the circle in this group we have three three icecream three and three so which figure is odd well right ice cream is all one and in this crew we have apple apple apple orange apple so which figure is the odd one right orange

Number Partens,fYd_fqTpBfk,hello friends I'm Akash today in the math tips and tricks series we're going to be learning the trick for the two times table let's begin by drawing out a five by two bid of five columns and two rows next for the ones digits right the two times table from two times 1 which is 2 the 2 times 4 which is 8 then we write a 0 you may 
,,remember to to eat from will the two times table that I just mentioned so 2 4 6 8 0 remember to add a 0 at the end and then do the same for the bottom row 2 so 2 4 6 8 0 so now we can split the tens digits into two parts top row and bottom row for the tens digits in the top row we will write 0 in all boxes except the last one you'll write one in that box so 0 0 0 0 1 and now for the tens digits in the bottom row similar setup we write 1 in all boxes except the last one we will write 2 in the last box instead of 1 so 1 1 1 1 2 and now you have this is amazing you have the two times table check this out it's a really neat way to learn the two times table and that's about it now you have learned the trick to memorizing the two times table you can use it to master the two times table today we're going to learn the matric for the 3 times table the reason why I'm doing 3 because if you know this trick for the 3 times table you will we be able to learn the six times table using a variation of this trick I'll explain that later let's begin by drawing out a 3x3 tic-tac-toe grid now we can start for the ones digits we go to the bottom left box and write down the numbers from 1 to 9 by starting in the leftmost column and going forward to the rightmost con but this time we're gonna go up from the bottom box to 
,,the top of the column so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and then write a 0 to the right of the bottom row now for the tens digits we're gonna split this up into three sections top row mirror bottom row for the tens digits in the top row we write 0 so 0 0 0 for the tens digits in the mirror row we write 1 so 1 1 1 and then for the bottom row 
,,tense digits we're gonna write 2 2 2 2 and then we write a 3 next to the 0 to get dirty what you may know is 3 times 10 and now you have the 3 times table take a look this is a really awesome trick I'd say so now you know the trick to learn the 3 times table you can use it to start memorizing the 3 times table in the math of tips and tricks series we're going to learn the trick for the 4 times table so now we can actually start draw out two upside-down w's or rather just draw out two ends kind of like like here as you can see behind me then right the two times table from 2 to 8 followed by a zero at each point of the M so this follows the pattern two four six eight zero so two four six eight zero and then the same for the other one two four six eight zero now that's the ones digits done now we can split the tens digits into four sections the top row of the first M the bottom row of the first M the top row of the second M in the bottom row of the second M for the top row of the first M just write 0 so 0 0 for the bottom row of the first M right one except for the last one there we write 2 so 1 1 2 for the top row of the second M just write 2 so 2 2 and for the bottom row of the second M write 3 except for the last one barely write 4 so 3 3 4 and so right before your very eyes you have completed the 4 times table this is a very neat trick to memorize it and as you can see right here behind me just look at it it's really really neat and it's a really good way to learn the 4 times table and that's about it now you have learned the trick to memorize the 4 times table you can use it to master the 4 times table today in the math 
,,tips and tricks series we're going to learn the trick for the 5 times table now we can start draw out a 5 by 2 grid of 5 columns and two rows next for the ones digits we just write the pattern of 5 and 0 so five-0 five-0 five-0 five-0 five-0 for the tens digits you write a zero and then each number from 1 to 4 twice and then finally the number 5 in the boxes so this is the pattern 0 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 and so let's do that 0 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 and now you have the 5 times table check this out 
,,this is a really neat way to learn the five times table and you can see it goes from 5 times 1 to 5 times 10 that is the 5 times table and that's about it now you have learned the trick to memorize the five times table you can use it to master the five times table in the 3 times table trick video I said that if you learn the 3 times table trick you would easily learn the 6 times table trick with one that's just much like it so today we're going to show you that 6 times table trick let's begin up by drawing out two tic-tac-toe grids one next to the other next we'll start from the bottom left corner and write all the numbers from 1 to 9 we'll start in the leftmost column going upwards from the bottom left corner and then we will go forwards over to the rightmost column so one two three four five six seven eight nine then write a zero next to the bottom row so do the same for the other grid - now for the tens digits we'll split the grid into three parts each top row middle row bottom row this is gonna take a tiny bit of a while for the tens digits in the top row of the first grid we will write zero zero zero put the tens digits in the middle row of the first grid we will write one one one for the tens digits in the bottom row of the first grid we write two to two and then we read a three next to the first of two zeros and then we repeat the same thing on the other side but with different numbers this time for the tens digits in the top row of the second grid we write three three three and I think I'm gonna get what's about to happen now for the tens digits in the middle row the second grid we write yeah you're pretty much right it's four four four and for the tens digits in the bottom row of the second grid we write five five five and then we write a six next to the second of two zeros it sounds like a lengthy process but you may actually notice that this is the 3 times table from 3 times 1 2 3 times 20 so if you know that then well you kind of know the 6 times table using this trick so now we can start all you have to do is make a diamond shape in both of them and then connect the first time into the 30 and the second diamond to the 60 and make sure you circle all of these numbers that this diamond shape touches and all of the circled numbers who create the six times table check this out this thing is really cool it's a really awesome trick yeah this is amazing you can see behind me over there we got the full six times table it's a really awesome trick in my opinion really awesome so now you know the trick to learning the six times table you can use this trick to memorize the six times table we're gonna learn the mat trick for the seven times table now let's begin by drawing out a three by three tic-tac-toe grid as you can see behind me now we can begin learning the trick for the ones digits we go all the way to the top right box and write down the numbers from one to nine by starting in the rightmost column and going 
,,back over to the leftmost column so one two three four five six seven eight nine and then you may be thinking well where's the zero so we write the 0 to the right of the bottom row right here and that is the ones digits yep we used up all of the digits and then that is the ones digits of the 7 times table now we come to the tens digits it's a little bit more complex so we're not break this up into three sections top row mineral bottom row for the tens digits in the top row we will write zero in the first box one in the second box and two in the third box okay for the tens digits in the middle row we will write two in the first box three in the second box and four in the third box and finally for the tens day it's in the bottom row we will write for in the first box five in the second box and six in the third box and then to continue the line over to the zero we will write a seven next to the zero to get seventy and now you have the seven times table take a look this is a really really really awesome trick that will easily help you to memorize the seven times table so now you know the trick to learning the seven times table you can use it to start memorizing and putting into your brain the seven times table for me the most difficult multiplication table after the 9 times table is the eight times table now here's the first way of explaining the trick and this is the eight times table write down all the numbers from zero to eight from top to bottom as you're seeing behind me right here but once you reach for include an extra four and continue until eight next for the ones digits write the two times table starting from zero up to eight again from bottom to top and once you reach eight repeat and go again from zero up to eight and once you're done you have the eight times table as you can 
,,see right here and here is the second way of explaining the trick as you can see here let's create a box of five columns and two rows for the ones digits just like you've seen in the first method we're going to write down the two times table from zero to eight in both rows but this time backwards in the opposite direction from eight to zero so eight six four two zero now for the tens digits in the first row we will write down the numbers from zero - for as you see here and for the tens digits in the second row we will write the numbers from four to eight and once you're finished you will have the eight times table as you can see right here do you know 
,,the nine times table I'm sure you do but for me the nine times table is the hardest one out of all the multiplication tables from one to nine but recently I found not one not two not three but four simple tricks to easily remember the nine times table I will let you know about these in today's video once you mastered these easy 
,,tricks you will easily agree with me that the nine times table is indeed the easiest multiplication table now I'm going to tell you how special the nine times table 
,,is so let's take a closer look the first specialty is that if you look carefully all of the products of the nine times table can be read as two columns the left column has all the numbers from 0 to 9 in ascending order and the right column has all the numbers in reverse order from 9 to 0 as you can see right here the second trick is that the sum of the digits of each answer is 9 so as you can see here 0 plus 9 is 9 1 plus 8 is 9 2 plus 7 is 9 3 plus 6 is 9 4 plus 5 is 9 5 plus 4 is 9 6 plus 3 is 9 7 plus 2 is 9 8 plus 1 is 9 and finally 9 plus zero is well 9 the third trick is that you'll notice that 9 times 1 is 0 9 or 9 and 9 times 10 is the reverse 
,,9 0 or 90 in the same way 9 times 2 is 18 and 9 times 9 is 81 9 times 3 is 27 and 9 times 8 is 72 9 times 4 is 36 and 9 times 7 is 63 and finally 9 times 5 is 45 and 9 times 6 is 54 these are three super easy tricks to memorize the 9 times table however there is the fourth trick which is the quickest and fastest and easiest way 
,,to remember the 9 times table here it is say you want to multiply 9 times 4 what you have to do is take that number 4 and find the number before it which in this case is 3 this number is the first digit the last digit is found by subtracting this number from 9 so 9 minus 3 is 6 6 is the last digit so 3 is the first digit 6 is the last digit the answer is 36 let's take another example say 9 times 8 the number before 8 is 7 which is the first digit 9 minus 7 is to which is the last digit seven is the first digit two is the last digit the answer is 72 9 times 1 is 9 and we all know that because any number times 1 is that number but did you know that it applies here to the number before one is zero and nine minus zero is well nine so zero nine or nine is the answer this is the best trick to remember the 9 times table 
,,in your brain without using a pen and paper and of course a calculator I'm very sure that this trick will help you whenever you need the 9 times table like in class 
,,or in your exam or if someone asks you what's a what's 9 times 7 you can just remember this trick and quickly say the answer is 63 so that's about it hello friends I'm Akash today I want to show you the best way to remember the 9 times table using only your hands or fingers so let's begin by opening up both hands in front of you like this now imagine that your fingers represent the numbers 1 through 10 your left thumb is the number 1 and your right thumb is the number 10 so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 
,,9 now let's begin let's take an example say 9 times 7 let's start by folding the seventh finger down like this you're seeing the answer right now actually there are 
,,six fingers to the left of the folded finger seven and there are three fingers to the right of the folded finger so the answer is 63 you're seeing it right now it's 
,,a super nice trick right now let's do the 9 times table from the very beginning 9 times 1 is 0 9 9 9 times 2 is 1 8 18 9 times 3 is 2 7 27 9 times 4 is 3 6 36 9 times 5 is 4 5 45 9 times 6 is 5 4 54 9 times 7 is 6 3 63 9 times 8 is 7 2 72 9 times 9 is 81 81 and finally 9 times 10 is 9 0 90 how cool is that right this is the best trick to remember the 9 times table using just your fingers now the 9 times table is the easiest table out of all for me this is undoubtedly the best and easiest way to remember the 9 Table two make sure you can practice what you saw by repeating it one more time and that's about it thanks so much for watching this video if you like my videos please subscribe to my channel and don't forget to hit the bell icon so you don't miss every time I upload a brand new video once again thanks so much for watching love you oh gosh

Number Partens,lv6dC0coQeI,rock and learn Patera hiya Michael what's up my friend Kevin needs a little help studying for his earth science test do you think you could pencil us in for a session well I do know a thing or two about earth science and I hear that you're a real wizard reviewing for science tests thanks Tara kevin is already waiting for us at my super science station before we go Marco Terra boy am I happy to see you I need to get ready for my earth science test glad to help kid earth science is kind of my specialty when you study earth science you'll learn about astronomy geology meteorology and more let's start by talking about our solar system tell me what you know well the Sun is in the middle of the solar system and it provides us with light and heat good good you know anything else there are eight planets that orbit the Sun but I always have trouble remembering their order I know a fantastic way to remember the order of the planets hello who's calling professor who oh you're Kevin's mom he's snack is ready okeydoke here we'll be right there great news Kevin's mom would like to serve us a little snack sounds good to me so Kevin I didn't know that your mother was a professor oh yes she's very educated here you go enjoy oh my what just happened my very educated mother just served us nachos that's it that's the order of the planets huh I see what he's getting at take the first letter of each word in the sentence my very educated mother just served us nachos and now we'll give you the first letter of the name of each planet my mercury Dairy Venus educated mother just served Saturn Uranus Neptune my very educated mother just served us nachos Mercury Venus Earth Mars Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune my very educated mother Venus Uranus Neptune hey that's pretty cool that makes it easy to remember the planets great now back to the solar system Learning Center at my super science station but what about the ah the nachos tough going kid but nachos aren't the only things in life and the planets aren't the only things that orbit the Sun take a look at this wow that's pretty cool Terra what are all these chunks of rock between Mars and Jupiter that is known as the asteroid belt the objects in this area range in size from dust particles all the way up to Ceres which is 900 kilometers in diameter 
,,Ceres is actually considered a dwarf planet because it has a large enough mass to have a rounded shape but as you can see it's not large enough to have cleared its orbit around the Sun by that I mean there are other objects in the same orbit with Ceres all of those other chunks of rock and metal are known as asteroids is Ceres the only dwarf planet now we've got more every so often a group of professional astronomers from around the world meet to assign names to objects in space three dwarf planets they've names are theories Pluto and Eris looks like there's another asteroid belt further out that's called the Kuiper belt whoa what's that that's a common comments a collections of ice dust and small particles of rock most have long oval orbits when they pass near the Sun their ice melts and evaporates people on earth see comets as huge glowing balls with tails made of gas or dust trailing millions of miles behind them all of this is pretty cool but how does it fit into earth science learning about the solar system is important for earth science because what happens in space affects things on Earth for example let's take a closer look at how the Earth and Sun interacted see how the earth goes around or orbits the Sun yeah Marco I remember that from science class it takes a full year for one revolution 
,,around the Sun and that's what causes our seasons explain to me how the Earth's orbit causes the seasons well I know it has something to do with the tilt of the earth but I never really understood that part hmm let me see if I can help when does the Sun feel warmest early in the morning or around noon its warmest around noon correct that's because the sun's rays are more direct around noon in the morning when it's cooler the sun's rays are more indirect so the earth flips back and forth oh 
,,no no no no no no the earth keeps pretty much the same tilt but watch as she moves around the Sun see here the northern hemisphere gets more direct Sun so it is summer there and since the southern hemisphere gets the indirect light it's winter now you've got the idea if we keep moving around until we get over here then it's summer in the southern hemisphere and winter in the northern hemisphere Wow actually seeing it in action makes it easier to understand even take a look at this see how the Earth rotates on its axis it goes around once every 24 hours and that's what causes day and night the parts of Earth facing the Sun or in daylight as the Earth rotates the Sun seems to set in the West Supah I think you've really got a good idea about how things work in our solar system yes take one of these kiddo Tara I don't think it's going to be raining anytime soon inside the science station I wouldn't be so sure he looks like a flash flood we got here whether or not you wanted to brother here at the water cycle and whether learning center will learn how the water cycle affects whether on earth the Sun provides the energy that drives the whole water cycle as the Sun heats water on earth water evaporates into the air as the water vapor cools in the atmosphere it condenses into small water droplets that form 
,,clouds when the water droplets get too heavy they precipitate back to the ground then the water accumulates in aquifers rivers lakes and the oceans and the whole thing can start all over again water turns to vapor by evaporation clouds slowly okay I think I understand how the water cycle works but why does it rain and snow places other than over the water good question we get rain and snow and other precipitation in all kinds of places because the Sun heats the earth unevenly land heats and cools faster than water and we know that it's warmer near the equator than the poles all of this uneven heating keeps it cold and warm air moving and the mix changes in air pressure here's how those air pressure changes cause wind cold air weighs more than warm air so the pressure of cold air is greater when the Sun warms the air the air expands it's lighter cooler heavier air moves to where the warmer and lighter air was in other words will usually blows from areas of a high air pressure 
,,to areas of low air pressure now warm air can hold more water vapor than cold air so as the air gets colder you get condensation and then precipitation there you go 
,,but it is the temperature of the air that determines the kind of precipitation rain happens when drops of liquid water fall on the surface of the earth snow forms when the air is so cold that water vapor turns directly into ice without ever passing through a liquid state if the air is cold enough the snow will fall all the way to the ground otherwise it might melt into rain on its way down sleet refers to water droplets that freeze on their way down through really cold air unlike snow sleet goes through a liquid state before freezing the result is that sley does not light and fluffy Hale is like it mega sweet when it hails large balls of ice fall from 
,,the sky hail forms in a more complex way than sleep as ice crystals start to full wind carries them back up high into the cloud this happens over and over and the crystals grow each time eventually they get too heavy and full hard that's wild Tara I never knew weather could be so complex and that's just the surface kid but it's 
,,enough to get you started those nachos aren't settin so good are you okay she'll be fine but I'm a little worried about us if there isn't I feel much better now uh that's nice but where are we just when we should be in the geology Learning Center this is where we can learn about different kinds of rocks and how they are made take a look at all these layers of rocks little bits of Earth were washed downstream they settle to the bottom of a river lake or ocean layer after layout was deposited on top so they will press down more and more over time the layers turned into a type of rock called sedimentary rock that's right sedimentary rocks make up about three-quarters of the rocks at the Earth's surface sometimes they can give us clues about what the environment was like when those rocks were formed how can they do that well sometimes dead plants or animals get buried in the sediment they get covered up by new layers of sediments and sometimes become fossils some fossils are actually parts of an animal like its teeth or bones that have turned into stone or fossilized others are trace fossils like dinosaur footprints or tunnels made by worms 
,,but most fossils are castes the dead plants and animals decay after the sediment has turned into rock leaving behind a hollow mold salts or other minerals can fill the cast and hold its shape fossils found in the same layer of sedimentary rock are from things that lived around the same time as no layers form on top the fossils get buried deeper and deeper I think I understand so the deeper the fossils are found the older they are you've got it and times large amounts of plants are deposited in sedimentary rocks if they are compressed under a lot of pressure for a long period of time they turn into carbon this gives us coal oil natural gas and petroleum I guess that's why they're called fossil fuels you bet it is and let me tell you fossil fuels are really a gas okay sedimentary rocks make up about three-quarters of the rocks at Earth's surface you got it what about the rest of the rocks what are they glad you asked there are two other kinds of rocks igneous and metamorphic igneous rocks formed when molten rock cools and becomes solid molten rock is called magma when it is below the earth's surface but sometimes magma pushes up through cracks to the surface of the earth then it is called lava we lava cools it becomes a kind of igneous rock called volcanic rocks basalt is the most common type of volcanic rock most of the rocks on the ocean floor are basalt igneous rock can also form when magma cools slowly and becomes hard while it's deep underground rocks that form this way like granite usually have large crystals fossils are not usually found in igneous rocks the heat of a volcanic eruption tends to destroy living things and only rarely preserves any evidence of them however fossils may be found in volcanic ash deposits which are actually a kind of sedimentary rock that makes sense sedimentary rocks are made from sediment and igneous rocks are made when molten rock is cooled but what about metamorphic rocks how do they form good question kiddo metamorphic rocks are rocks that have moved or changed from one kind of rock into another metamorphic rocks were once igneous or sedimentary rocks but movement of the 
,,Earth's crust caused them to change just moving the rocks changes them no try pushing your hands together very hard do you feel heat and pressure yeah when the Earth's crust moves igneous or sedimentary rocks get squeezed by tremendous pressure which heats the rock and pulls them like taffy the original rock is changed by this heating and pulling and it becomes a metamorphic rock as you might guess any fossils that we're in this sedimentary rock will now be in the metamorphic rock but those fossils may be stretched and deformed because of the heating and pooling Baumer metamorphic rocks are the least common of the three kinds of rocks slate and marble 
,,are two examples that really whoa what's this a rock concert as a matter of fact it is ladies and gentlemen please welcome all the way from Little Rock Arkansas Petros I'm sorry males because of rocks man sorry three rounds surprise even though two rocks may be form the same way they can be made up of different kinds of minerals that's right to identify the minerals in rocks scientists use properties like color luster podna s-- and streak look at these I wonder what minerals they are hey if I describe their properties that might help me to identify them Bravo know the color of a mineral is the first thing people tend to notice but be careful most minerals can occur in more than one color luster describes how light is reflected from the surface of a mineral the two main types of luster are metallic and nonmetallic 
,,the hardness of a mineral is its ability to resist scratching the most hardest scale uses ten minerals to rank hardness take a look here a diamond is the hardest naturally occurring substance with a hardness of ten and talc is very soft so it only has a hardness of one that's all good and fine but how can I find out the hardness of the minerals in this box with a little scratching not that kind of scratching we'll use minerals and objects from the Mohs scale if your mineral sample can scratch an object save this penny but it has a higher hardness let's try this one mm-hmm good choice I like the nice metallic luster can it scratch up any looks like it does Marco that means this mineral has a hardness higher than three that's the way to do it now try scratching this quartz nope and look the quartz will scratch my mineral sample so it has a hardness between three and seven we could keep on scratching away with different materials from the Mohs scale to narrow it down even more but I think you get the idea I sure do thanks Terra another way to categorize minerals with a hardness lower than seven is to determine their streak streak does that 
,,mean some of them have racing stripes nah the streak of a mineral is the color of the powder it leaves when you scrape it across a streak plate we know your mineral 
,,has a hardness lower than seven so red that's not what I would have guessed at all don't feel too bad kid science is full of surprises have a look at this table here do any of those descriptions match your mineral let me see steel gray hardness 5.5 to 6.5 rust red streak metallic luster I'll bet this is hematite that's the way to do it great job well kid your earth science knowledge is really building up it looks like something else is building up under my chair that sort of looks like a volcano I guess it was a volcano and just look where it brought us ah the topographic Learning Center this is the perfect place to learn about how the surface of the earth changes seems like a volcano would be pretty good at changing the surface tell me about it kid he's not pimples you know I had a friend do a science fair project on volcanoes she told me there are several types she told you right there are shield volcanoes cinder cones stratovolcanoes and more that's a lot of volcanoes so what's the difference between the types shield volcanoes are built by layer upon layer of lava their eruptions travel great distances from a central event or group events so they have brought the flat rounded shape they kind of look like a shield lying on the ground that's a great way to remember the name but while they may look 
,,"flat from above they can still get pretty tall mano Lowa is the largest shield volcano Mauna LOA's means long mountain but it stands over 13,000 feet above sea level and it rises over 28,000 feet from the ocean floor it would be the world's tallest mountain if it weren't mostly underwater Maui Wowi actually it's on the Big Island of Hawaii the eruptions of shield volcanoes usually don't have much ash and they are fairly safe for scientists to monitor but some other kinds of volcanoes can throw hot ash and cinders into the air these can form a pyroclastic flow which travels very fast and burns almost everything in its path that's the truth the temperature of a pyroclastic flow can reach over 500 degrees Celsius whoa what kind of volcano can do that stratovolcanoes can they are quite beautiful like yours truly but they tend to be tall and symmetric with steep sides a few stratovolcanoes that you might have heard of our Mount Fuji in Japan and in the USA you'll find Mount st. Helens and Mount Rainier in Washington State and Mount Hood in Oregon not organ or red gun those stratovolcanoes really are beautiful what about cinder cones are the little guys you can often find cinder cones on the flanks of shield volcanoes and stratovolcanoes when a cinder cone volcano erupts cinders of lava are blown into the air and fall around the opening of the volcano the pile of cinders forms a small oval-shaped volcano that can grow to about 1,000 feet but some are much smaller many cinder cone volcanoes have a bowl-shaped crater at the opening hey Marco what causes volcanoes in the first place to explain that let's dig a little deeper deeper "
,,into the earth thirties earth is divided into four layers the solid inner core the liquid outer core and the mantle that's the thickest layer and last and least is the crust because it's the thinnest layer the rocky outer crust is made of plates that fit together sort of like on puzzle pieces these plates move a little bit each 
,,year as they slide on top of a weak layer of the mantle this hotter deeper layer of the mantle can be pushed and pulled like putty the whole process is called plate 
,,tectonics the edges of the Earth's plates touch each other as they move the plates may just slide past each other but the plates can also spread apart or even crash 
,,together sometimes when two plates collide large mountain ranges such as the Himalayas are for that happens if the two plates have the same density so they fold as they move together much like two kitchen rugs push together that explains mountains but I wanted to know how volcanoes are formed hold your horses kid if colliding plates have different densities one plate can be forced back down into the deeper regions of the earth that plate can begin to melt when it reaches a depth which is hot enough the molten crust arises back towards the surface where it helps make volcanoes and islands whoo that's a long process is that how all volcanoes are formed well no here's another way as the plates move hot spots under the crust may find weak places in the plates or between two plates that are moving apart this will allow magma to come to the surface from deep within the earth and the result is a volcanic eruption which can add new landmass to existing land or even form new islands okay let me get this straight volcanoes can form where the plates are pushing together where they're pulling apart or anywhere the Earth's crust is weak that's the way the cookie crumbles and the Earth's crust now that you have an idea of how Earth's surface can be built up let's talk about how it can be worn down weathering is the process that causes rocks to crack and fragment since rocks form in different ways and are made up of different minerals they react differently when exposed to temperature changes moisture particles in the air or pressure changes I suppose that means there are different kinds of weathering that's right Kevin one thing that causes weathering is frost when water freezes it has an unusual property unlike most materials that contract when they are cooled water expands when it solidifies into ice this can put incredible pressure on rocks water gets into the pores or cracks of the rocks and then free this so when the water freezes it expands and causes pieces of the rock to break off alright another kind of weathering is abrasion that can happen when rocks rub against each other like when Oh Rock rolls downhill or when it tumbles in rivers winds can cause abrasion to wind sometimes carries dirt or sand that can wear down rocks as it blows against them plants like moss and lichen can wedge their way into pores crevices and cracks in rocks seeds from other plants can get into crevices too as they grow they cause the rocks to crack apart I heard that wetting and drying of rocks can make them break up oh yes the combination of wetting and drying is very effective at breaking up clay but that's because clay swears when it gets wet and then shrinks and crumbles as it does oh I get it the process of wetting and drying only weathers some kinds of rocks sometimes rocks break down because the minerals they are made of react with chemicals in water or air for example carbonic acid is created when carbon dioxide dissolves in water and this acid can dissolve limestone and eventually cause the formation of caves and caverns ooh look at the stalactites and stalagmites you're a regular little spelunker 
,,huh stalactites hold tight to the ceiling of the cave and stalagmites might reach the ceiling someday what a smarty now erosion is simply the moving of sediments or 
,,rock particles moving water is the most powerful force of erosion on earth the world's rivers deliver about 20 billion tons of sediment to the oceans each year that's a lot of erosion and that's why you can see fan-shaped Delta's at the mouths of some rivers such as the Nile v-shaped valleys canyons and gorges are also carved by streams and rivers flowing through the mountains moving air or wind is another important mover of sediment especially in dry regions when tiny sand grains are lifted and carried by the wind they can sculpt rocks into a variety of shapes sand dunes are hills of sand deposited by the wind such as those at Great Sand Dunes National Park in Colorado but of all the things that cause erosion my favorite is a glacier glaciers form when snow piles up over time and turns to ice the glacier begins to flow outwards and downwards under the pressure of its own weight like great rivers of ice glaciers have sculpted mountains and carved out u-shaped valleys Valley glaciers flow down valleys and continental glaciers such as the ones on Greenland and Antarctica flow outward in all the directions glaciers reshape the underlying and surrounding landscape as they move by eroding rock from one place and depositing it in another that's called deposition glaciers rivers and wind are major forces of deposition that can build up the earth in some places and I think I've got the scoop on erosion erosion is when the earth is worn down it can happen because of water wind or ice that's right kid weathering and erosion work together to reshape the surface of the earth water and cracks of rocks can turn to ice in the winter and 
,,make the cracks bigger over time bits and pieces of the rock break off and fall away winds can pick up these small bits and we're down weaker parts of rock rain can 
,,watch the small bits away over time these processes can work together to leave interesting formations such as the arches in Utah or the hoodoos in bryce canyon canyons look like fun places I'd like to travel to see them someday well right now we need to travel to our next learning center right this way Wow hey wait Marco I think my chair ran out of gas ah it looks like we need an alternative energy source don't worry balance this on your head okay but how will this solar panel help we're indoors just our way to see hiya boys I see you used a perpetual resource to get here perpetual resource yep a perpetual resource is one that cannot be affected by human use perpetual resources are also called inexhaustible resources they include things like solar energy that can be converted into electricity solar energy can also be used to heat water or air for homes and businesses sounds like we should use solar energy for everything well solar energy is very dependent on the time of day the time of year and the weather so in order to be efficient a large surface area is required to collect the energy from the Sun but scientists are working on ways to get around that hmm is solar energy the only perpetual resource oh no there's always the wind remember that the wind is caused by uneven heating of Earth by the Sun so it's an indirect form of solar energy the wind blows stronger and more consistently in some areas wind turbines and wind farms can be built in those places to convert the wind energy into electricity and there's also geothermal energy heat from the earth can be used to make steam or hot water to heat buildings or generate electricity some scientists are even looking at ways to utilize the oceans to produce energy for us without causing any environmental damage they've come up with a few ways of tapping the energy from tides and we might even find a way to use temperature differences in the ocean to produce energy in some regions the surface water can be 40 or more degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the deep water so perpetual resources includes solar wind geothermal and ocean energy what other kinds of resources are there glad you asked kiddo there are renewable resources and non renewable resources I've heard of renewable resources they can be replenished as fast or faster than we use them that's true but the problem is that usually the demand for resources like wood crops soil and water increases over time if the demand gets too high these resources cannot be replenished fast enough we have to be careful and keep things in balance that does sound like a good thing to do and what about non-renewable resources I guess those can't be replenished at all when they're gone they're really gone non-renewable resources like a natural gas oil and coal that we get from 
,,fossil fuels will eventually run out if we keep using them energy efficiency and conservation are so important we need to make non-renewable resources last as long as possible while we are looking for new alternatives energy efficiency is the use of technology to perform the same function with less energy like putting tinting on your windows to keep out the sunlight that heats up buildings in the summertime no that's to make it look cool energy conservation is any behavior that causes us to use less energy like turning off lights when they're not being used exactly Kevin and by using energy-efficient light bulbs you can save a lot on your electric bill another way to conserve energy is by insulating and weatherizing homes and buildings that way you use less air conditioning and heating you can also save on heating and cooling by placing trees shrubs or other landscaping to block the wind and provide shade but we can conserve other resources besides just energy such as wood and water there are many ways to help save water around the house it turn off the water while you're brushing your teeth take short showers instead of Bath's and be sure to fix any leaks I worked with my mom to convince the people in our neighborhood to find a garbage service that recycles we separate out plastic glass aluminum cans and paper for recycling excellent by recycling you are not only conserving resources but you are also helping to keep unnecessary garbage out of landfills yeah thanks for helping to keep the earth a cleaner place to live kiddo you're welcome Tara and thanks to both of you for helping me study earth science I'm ready to ace my test I'm so proud of you well I should be getting back home Marko I'm ready to teleport okey-dokey huh hey science fans to quiz yourself on earth science you can download a practice test at my website just visit w-w-w that mark or the pencil dot-com show now that we've reviewed some of the material from earth science let's see 
,,how well you might do on the practice test for those of you following along you might want to use pause when the question first comes up to see if you can choose the right answer before Kevin let's begin with some questions about this solar system one look at the diagram of our solar system below what is the name of Planet 5 oh 
,,yeah mark oh my very educated mother just that starts with J Jupiter that's answer B fantastical sometimes you might be asked to fill in your answer right on the page with the questions but this test has a separate answer sheet be sure to ask your teacher how you're supposed to might the answers on your test let's put the test over the answer sheet just under the question we are answering that way we can make sure we fill in the right bubbles to which objects in our solar system have long tails when they are close to the Sun and are made mostly of rock and ice a planets be asteroids see dwarf planets d comets the only one of these things I remember having tails are the Comets you'll have a great memory our answer is d3 what causes day and night on earth a the Earth orbits the Sun na earth orbiting the Sun combined with the tilt of the Earth's axis is what gives us seasons not day and night B the moon orbits the earth the moon orbiting the earth causes the tides to rise and fall on the earth but it doesn't cause day and night C the Earth rotates on its axis I think this is the right answer right - you are see the Sun that lights up half of the earth the parts that are in the sunlight are experiencing a day the parts that aren't in the sunlight are experiencing at night and if we could look down at the earth from the North Pole we would see that the earth is rotating counterclockwise so the Sun seems to come up in the east and set in the West maybe I should check this last answer just to make certain C is the best choice good thinking Kevin D the Sun orbits the earth that's ridiculous everyone knows that the Sun doesn't orbit the Earth that means our answer is C the Earth rotates on its axis let's move on to questions about the water cycle and whether for what supplies the energy to drive the water cycle can you remember what I told you I remember Terra you said the energy source that drives the whole water cycle is the Sun you are really starting 
,,to get on my good side okay so our answer is a Sun good job now let's see if you can get this next one five the picture shows a place where air currents will form due to the uneven heating of the earth in which direction will air currents most likely move let's see warm air rises and the cool air will come in to replace it so a 
,,from the lake toward the land looks right but let me check all the answers be straight up above the lake no that's not right see from the land toward the lake that's backwards D all of the above that can't be right so our answer is egg I'm glad that you look at all of the answers carefully some students make the mistake of choosing all of the above every time it's an answer choice not our boy he's too smart to do something like that ah thanks Terra now do you remember anything from the geology Learning Center I sure do sedimentary rock is formed in layers and the deeper the layers the older they are they ought to make this next question pretty simple six the rock column above shows the layers in a sedimentary rock formation the three core samples to the right were taken from the rock column on the left according to this information which fossil is the oldest well the deepest layer is layer one so it is the oldest since the fossil on the bottom of core sample X came from layer one it is the oldest fossil so the answer is C let's see if you can get the answer to this next to geology question seven why are most fossils found in sedimentary 
,,rocks let me read through the answers a fossils can be distorted in metamorphic rocks that's true you bet it is metamorphic rocks are made by pressure and heat on other types of rocks that could really mess up any fossils in the rock well let's look at all the answer choices be igneous rocks were too hot when they formed considering that igneous rocks were made of molten rock I'm sure they were too hot to preserve any fossils what about C sedimentary rocks are best for preserving organisms 
,,this one's also true so the answer must be d all of the above you're a real gem we'll take a look at one more geology question 8 the chart below shows part of Mohs hardness scale for minerals a student is testing an unknown mineral for hardness the unknown mineral is tested against fluoride but neither mineral scratches the other which of the following conclusions can the student accurately make if the unknown mineral didn't scratch fluorite and fluorite didn't scratch the unknown mineral they both must have a hardness of 4 keep that in mind while we look at the possible answers a the unknown mineral and orthoclase will not scratch each other ortho Clay's is harder than fluorite so orthoclase would scratch the unknown mineral a is wrong be the unknown mineral will scratch calcite that's true yep calcite is lower on the hardness scale but let's not be too hasty read the last to answer choices see the unknown mineral will scratch orthoclase that's the exact opposite of what would happen d the unknown mineral will not scratch gypsum that doesn't seem right no way gypsum is even lower on the hardness scale than calcite so our answer is beep 
,,this kid has a mountain of information in his head you think so let's see if he remembers what was said about Earth's changing topography 9 mountains may be formed when a volcano's erupt that's true some of the volcanoes even have the word mount in their name like Mount Fuji but I remember that mountains are formed other ways too let me check the rest of the answers B plates of the Earth's crust collide that's true too Terrace said the Himalayas were formed that way great memory kid hmm see says both a and B and D says none of the above so I'm gonna have to say that C is the right answer perfecto 10 which of these processes can be caused by movement of the Earth's plates let's see the highest mountain range in the world the Himalayas were formed by plates colliding and the islands of Hawaii were formed because of 
,,a plate moving over a hot spot some of those Islands still have volcanic eruptions that makes all of the answers true so our answer is it D all of the above let's see what you remember about weathering and erosion 11 moving water was the most important factor in forming which of these a sand dunes at Great Sand Dunes National Park no Tara said those were formed by wind be the Grand Canyon I'm pretty sure that was formed by a river although I don't know what the name of the river is that would be the Colorado River see the Andes Mountains from what we discussed mountains are built from volcanic eruptions or plate tectonics not moving water you've got a 
,,good head on your shoulders kid D Kilauea volcano that's made out of flowing lava not moving water so the answer is B the Grand Canyon nice work whoo that's a nice picture I'd like to go there someday and the men at the bottom of the picture gives you some perspective as to how large the arch really is all right all right let's 
,,get down to business read the question please 12 the landform below is an arch found in Arches National Park in Utah which type of weathering or erosion is not responsible for shaping this arch here's one of those questions that has to be read carefully the word not makes a big difference in the answer I'll choose let's see Tara talked about the combination of water ice weathering and wind all playing a part in forming arches so I think the answer is a glaciers because glaciers did not help shape the arch right you are you're a smart kid so let's see how bright you are when it comes to energy and resources available on earth no problem thirteen which of the following is a renewable resource a tree that's renewable as long as we don't use them faster than new trees can grow I think this is the answer but I'll check them all to be sure I'm so glad you have good test taking skills be natural gas that's a non-renewable resource see solar energy ah this is one of the perpetual or 
,,inexhaustible resources you told me about not a renewable one no matter how much we use the perpetual resources they'll always be around D oil no that's a fossil fuel all fossil fuels are non-renewable resources so the only renewable resource here is the tree that makes the ants at a 14 watering plants and grass in the early morning is one way to conserve water why a plants only absorb water in the morning no plants can absorb water any time of day take a look at the next one okay Marco be 
,,less water evaporates into the air in the cool morning this leaves more water for plants to absorb and allows shorter watering times that's true sea water used in the morning can be recycled in the evening that doesn't make sense if some sort of system is in place to catch unused water to be recycled it can be used anytime not just in the morning D water is more pure in the morning this one doesn't make sense either I guess that means you're sticking with answer B then yep and now for the last question 15 which of the following is not a way to help conserve energy a plant trees in the landscaping around buildings the trees wood provides shade from the 
,,Sun and help to block wind which would help with cooling and heating bills but the question is asking which one is not a way to conserve energy how about B turn off 
,,machines when they're not being used that's definitely a way to conserve energy check the next one sure thing Marco see both a and B no those are both good ways to conserve energy so that means our answer must be D take lots of bubble baths Wow you did a great job on this practice earth science test I agree nice work hey science fans you can download this earth science test at my website just visit www.marsianstudio.webs.com you

Number Partens,dSJEEOFaDz0,hello viewers welcome to pebbles ah today we are going to learn new topic that is abacus okay it's a simple counting mission and counting device and it's very useful for children by simple learning counting numbers uh with bright color beads okay i will show you the abacus instrument and how to move the beads and count the numbers okay let me enjoy children and today we are uh that is we are going to learn uh in a joyful manner how to move the beats by using abacus okay i will show you the 
,,first i will show the instrument and uh do you know the basic what is abacus and the rod type okay first you have to understand what is abacus i will show the uh simple uh that is uh this is this video is for pre-school children from the age level up to four five and six okay four to seven age level children or enjoy for this uh using this device by using how to use this device i will show you the device okay this is a mathematical simple abacus device okay and each row that is it has 10 rods okay how to move this to know that is 10 rods and by counting numbers okay you have to start from the bottom to up okay this is a device okay for 10 rods this is 
,,count by this one two three four five six seven eight nine and ten this is a a backer skate and it has ten rods and each rod has ten beads okay this is a 10 beets abacus and this is a 100 bees abacus this is called 100 b's because each row contains 10 beats okay that is 10 drops okay children and each row contains 10 beads okay 
,,so 10 into 10 that is 100 so this is called 100 beads abacus and which has bright colored beads okay do you love children because by simply you have to sliding the beads from right to left and you are knowing two counting how to count the numbers and place the numbers okay and this is called the zero level okay do you understand this this is a zero level abacus that is no moment of beats here okay do you understand this ah for reference because this is one okay you are moving in the ones place you move just like one number this is called one okay and next one is a tens place and hundred place and it grows above the up to ah next level units okay first 
,,you have to counting simple counting by using this from the ones place okay do you start okay from this basic rod okay okay i will show uh in the board for how to move and do you understand what is basic bead movement of on abacus okay let me see that is what is abacus it is a simple mathematical device okay i'll show for single that is only one's place okay so i have to draw two beats okay one and two so how do you say the number how do you say the number this is the answer that is you say 2 because once play is wrought it has two beats okay do you understand and next one here listen here this also once plays raw okay this is one's place rod for o o represent once okay listen here one two three four and five how do you say now count the beats so one two three four five the answer is five okay do you understand okay i will show you next example this is also a once please rod okay i have to draw beads listen here four five six and seven so simply you have to count the beats and say the answer the answer is seven okay one two three four five six seven so answer is seven okay do you understand and next one this also one's place rod okay listen here one two three and four by counting this number you have to say the answer what is the answer 4 because 1 2 3 and 4 so answer is 4 okay and next that is simple once place rod okay here i listen here there is no beads at all here okay i didn't write any bead i didn't draw any bead what is the answer there is no beat you have to say 0 ok this is answer 0 because there is no beads on the rod in ones place so simply by doing moving a backus that is moving beats on abacus you have to count the numbers four two five seven and here is zero okay next i have to show next up that is next place that is one's place okay we have discussed ones place and simply doing okay next we are going to learn that is two place that is one's place and the tens place okay listen here i have to draw that is one's place and tens place okay draw two rods okay by simply drawing here three beads and here one bead so what is the answer now first count the beads in ones place first you count the beads on first ones place rod say the answer three and the tens place rod it has only one bead okay children do you understand now this is one's place and this is tens place first you should write the beads number of beads in one's place only okay so count the beads and write down the answer is three and next we have to count the beads on tens place that is one so answer is 13 do you understand okay let me move on next example simply that is one's place and tens place it has two rods okay i have to draw okay let me start to count first count the ones place number okay once play is wrong it has one two so answer is two and next you have to count the beats on tens place so 1 2 3 4 and 5 you have to write the number what do you say now this is 52 okay so so this is a simple counting method and let me know how to uh form a pattern in a backers that is counting by twos counting by fives and counting by tens let me enjoy with abacus okay you

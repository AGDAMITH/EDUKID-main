AlgebraicExpression,CT9iX5osAs4,hello grade 8 children today I am here with another new topic we'll see what's the topic about you have done numbers two plus three and a half minus five oh you have done point three plus 95 so all these are with numbers so we call this is number theory then you have done straight lines circles squares parallel lines and angles 
,,all are these geometry what about letters what are these two x plus three Y minus five plus three X letters and numbers combination we call that algebra so today we 
,,are doing about algebra so what's the topic chapter five algebraic expression so we'll find out what are the terms involved in this uni and what are the concepts look at this one the price of a coconut is 48 rupees the distance from Colombo to Gul is hundred kilometers there are 31 days in the month of January Ravinder gets 80 points in mathematics course so what are they is 48 130 180 what are those those are numbers if I ask you a question what's the height of a student in grade 8 class so we can't give a specific value usually the height of the students in the class will be different from one another so therefore we need to define a term called variable so what's variable changing values of height as it is not a fixed number so when you don't get a fixed number when the value is changing we call those are variables we use algebraic terms or expressions to denote changing values so we'll take height as a letter so we use algebraic expression like x today not changing values any letter this one profit varies from one day to another day from Nima's three-wheeler so it's changing all the time it can be named as I'll put a receipt a so what's a it's a variable because it's changing all the time this one radius of three circles are three centimetres four centimetres and five centimetres respectively when we consider radius of the circle we can take this one is R that's a variable we can use a letter so what's the R value we can write R equals three centimeters R equals four centimeters that our equals five centimeters so what's the variable they are our that's the radius of the circle this one city does a bias certain number 
,,"of string hoppers to sell in his boutique every day if we do not know the number exactly can show it as another variable we'll take simple B where B is an unknown set we don't know exactly the amount of string hoppers that city dancer buys look at this one in the figure above shows three containers of the same size all three containers contain an equal amount of liquid it can be considered as what you can use another letter H because it is an unknown constant because we don't know exactly what's the water level is so here what's the variable H height of water so lowercase letters such as a b c or you can put X Y Z so any simple lowercase letters we can use to represent variables so it can be an unknown constant or a variable look at this one the daily income of poachers fruit shop can be stated as X so what is X they are jail income he saved his income by 2,000 rupees a day find the remaining amount of money what's the total income X he's saving to thousand rupees each day so what's the remaining amount you can write in terms of X X is the total value daily income subtract 2000 so the remaining amount is X minus 2000 so this is an algebraic expression so what are the terms terms in this algebraic expression we can write x an mm so those are called terms of algebraic expression so what are the terms "
,,you learn now you learned about variable and we can use simple letters for variables and the next term is terms of an algebraic expression look at this one the price of a coconut is extra base the price of 8 coconut so what you do you have to multiply by 8 so one coconut is x and x 8 so what's the value you get 8x rupees so what are the terms you can say 8x is an algebraic term and the number in front of the letter here X is the variable the number in front of the letter is called coefficient so what's the coefficient in this term 8 8 is the coefficient of the algebraic term we learned about variables terms and coefficient now look at this one combination of algebraic terms 5x plus 3y minus 4z that's called algebraic expression so what are these 5 x 3y minus 4 are the algebraic terms and what about this one the number in front of the letter what you call that coefficients coefficients and terms the width of the rectangle is X its length is 7 its length is 7 meters more than the rich right the algebraic expression for the length so how can we write down length 7 more than that ex-mo more means in maths plus addition X plus 7 is the length so what's the algebraic expression for length X plus 7 if the length of the rectangle is wild now they have given this one is y if this one is y write down the algebraic expression for width we know the width is 7 meters less than the length so we can write by -7 if you take length as Y that's Y minus 7 is the weight the price 
,,of a pen is extra pays the cost of a pencil is why rupees the price of a book is 0 please so what about price of three prints one is X and 3 you have to multiply by 
,,3 3 X 3 times X you don't need to write down the multiplication sign you can write 3x price of 4 pencils one pencil is why 4 pencils for y price of several books one book is zero Peas seven books 7z give the cost of buying all the above in the form of an algebraic expression so the total cost we can add it together 3x plus 4y plus 7c that's an algebraic expression write the terms of this algebraic expression so you have given an algebraic expression what are the terms 3x for bi and 7z coefficient of 3 X we know what is coefficient means the number in front of the letter that's 3 coefficient of 4y what's the number in front that's four coefficient of 77 is the coefficient there build algebraic expression for the following statements we'll try to write in terms of letters you can take these letters given add 7 to the double of X what if double means 2 times X so adding 7 to double of X means 2x 2x plus 7 subtract 6 from the 3 times of X but if three times means 3x 3x and you have to subtract 6 subtract 3 from the sum of x and y sum of x and y means the addition X plus 1 and subtract 3 divided by y how you divide we can write x over 1 divide X by y and subtract from seven so that turns that you have to subtract from seven that means seven - so we'll write seven minus x over Y not X over Y minus 7 because from 7 you have to subtract this amount divided the multiplication of a and B multiplication of a and B by 3 means a B divided by 3 divided the multiplication of 
,,a and B by 3 and subtract from 10 from 10 means 10 minus this value filling the gaps in the following table algebraic expressions are there as you break terms so you have to write down only algebraic terms so what are the algebraic terms 7 x + 3 by what's the coefficient 7 & 3 what are the I do break terms here 6a + 3 B here you don't write down these constants algebraic terms means only terms with letters what are the coefficients 6 & 3 here Excel why hyphens are 1 and 1 in this one 3 a coefficient is 3 this one - 3 X + 7 5 coefficients are -3 here and so this one you get a fraction but here this is an algebraic term 2x over 3 you can write X in the numerator and 3 by over 5 also an algebraic term then what's the coefficient you have to take the whole thing the fraction 2/3 three fits this one this is an algebraic term 5x over 7 and minus 2y over 3 so what's the coefficient there five over seven is the coefficient of x term and minus two-thirds is the coefficient of weiter look at this question the cost of an arranges extra pays the cost of an apple is y rupees the cost of a mango is zero peas build algebraic expressions for the following price of two oranges and five mangoes oranges is X so 2x plus because this is both together five mangoes one mango easy five mangoes 5z price of two mangoes and seven apples two mangoes is to Z and seven apples Apple is why rupee so 7 y cost of six oranges and eight apples six oranges one orange is X plus six six and eight apples one Apple is why that's eight why price of five oranges seven apples and three mangos five oranges that's 5 X 7 apples 7 y then 3 mangoes 3z question number five cost of one orange one apple and two mangoes one Apple is why and one orange is X and two mangoes - Z - look at this one right down the algebraic expression for the total cost to buy three kilos of sugar two kilos of Thailand five kilos of flour we are one kilo of each product is a rupees be rupees and C rupees respectively so what are the values total cost we need three kilos of sugar so sugar is a so three a five kilos then two kilos of Dar Daly's be rupees to be and five kilos of flour flour is C rupees of five C next one one kilo of red dollies extra peas and one kilo of yellow dollies why rupees write down an algebraic expression for the extra mounts pen for buying five kilos of yellow da then three kilos of red that means the price is high when you buy five kilos of yellow da so what's the difference five 
,,kilos of yellow doll yellow one is by rupees 5 i- three kilos of red on red dollies extra piece per kilo so 3x so the difference is this well the capacity of a bucket days M liters and bucket B is in liters you need to use 12 buckets of a and eight buckets of B at once to fill a tank what is the capacity of the track so what's the total amount of a buckets yeah 12 a buckets so M liters are there so 12 M then what about from B buckets so need eight buckets of B each bucket contained in liters so eight and so the capacity of the tank is 12 m + 8 in the father's age in one of the families years the age of the mother is beers the daughter's age is Sears give the sum of ages of the father and mother in the form of an algebraic expression fathers ages a mother's ages B so the total is a plastic give the sum of the age of the mother and daughter in the form of an algebraic expression mother's age is B daughters ages the total of the ages of the father mother and dot all three of them a plus B plus C write the sum of the total age of the three above after 10 years in the form of an algebraic expression so we have to add 10 for each value 10 and 
,,10 and 10 for all three people that means 30 so the total value is a plus B plus C plus 30 so after 10 years this is the total value manufacturers men extra piece to make a table the manufacturer made a profit of twice as much as the cost price and sold it to a retailer the retailer solely to the consumer with a profit of by rupees right the profit of the manufacturer in the form of an algebraic expression so how can you write down an algebraic expression manufacture a spend X to make a table that's the cost value the manufacturer made a profit of twice as much as the cost price so what's the profit to X so write the profit of the manufacturer in the form of an algebraic expression err so that's 2x give the selling price of the table by the manufacturer in the form of an algebraic expression so the profit is 2x and the cost price is X so what's the selling price X plus 2x when you add it that's 3x so that's the selling price right the selling price of the retailer to the consumer in the form of an algebraic expression now the retailer sold it to the consumer with a profit of Y rupees so this is the price this retailer bought that means 3 X and he keeps by rupee profit so you have to add Y so this is the selling price of the retailer to the consumer the shape shown in the above is a square and a rectangle made out of matchsticks give the perimeter of the square in the form of an algebraic expression one side is given X for sides and there X plus X plus X plus X 
,,what's the perimeter for X give the perimeter of the rectangle in the form of an algebraic expression how you find out the perimeter you have to add all these lengths so a plus 2b plus a plus 2b a and a you are getting 2 a 2b and 2b when you add 2 plus 2 4 that's 4 B give the full length of the matchsticks used to construct the 
,,above images in the form of an algebraic expression so total length so length for the squares for X and length for this one is 2a plus 4b subtract the total length of the matchsticks used to make the square from the total length of the matchsticks used to make the rectangle in an algebraic expression so you have to subtract the 
,,lengths of matchsticks used to make the square from this one so what's the total here two way plus 4b and subtract the lengths for this one that's 4x look at this one give the perimeter of the equilateral triangle in the form of an algebraic expression equilateral means all sides I equal a and a n a what's the perimeter 3a right the perimeter of the write angular triangle in the form of an algebraic expression so just add all the lengths together we'll do that X plus X plus 2 plus X plus 1 
,,now you can simplify like terms you can add X X X 3x 2 & 1 that's right the total perimeter of the above diagrams in the form of an algebraic expression so this is the perimeter of the write angular triangle and is the parameter for the equilateral triangle so add it together 3 E + 3 X + 3 multiplying an algebraic expression by 
,,a number so we'll see how we can multiply the algebraic expression by a number width of the rectangle is X this is the width and the length is 1 determine the perimeter of the rectangle x + y + X + 1 so you can write down 2 times X plus y of x + alright separately x + y X plus y when you simplify you get 2 x + 2 I now I want to 
,,just separate these two parts this part separately and this part separately what's the length of this part when you separate this what's the length of this one x + y you get the same length here X + 1 so double of this x + y so length of one part is X plus y length of 2 parts you multiply by 2 so 2 times X plus 1 but we took the same diagram finding perimeter fully and taking separately you have to get the same answer so in both methods the perimeter of the same figure is equal so we can write down 2 x + y is equal to two x plus 2y now look at this one when there's a number in front you are multiplying both these X terms by two so when X plus y is x to both the terms x + y x - so now we observe when there's a number in front of an algebraic expression you have to multiply all terms with that number a box contains 
,,a red glass balls and B blue glass balls determine the total number of glass balls in such high boxes number of total ass balls in a box was that a plus B number of 
,,total glass balls in five boxes you have to multiply 5 times a plus B then number of red colored balls in a box separately there are a red color glass balls so number of red color balls in a box is a number of red glass balls in five boxes that's five B multiplied by five if you take separately blue ones how many blue ones are there be blue ones for five boxes you get five be blue ones in five boxes so what can you say about this one the total the total is now we can write total is 5 a + 5 
,,B the answer received in either of the two methods should be equal so in this case five times a plus B is equal to 5 a plus 5b now look at this one when you multiply by the constant each term you get this one remove the brackets of the following algebraic expressions now we can use that knowledge you gain from the previous two questions there's a number in front this is a minus B is the algebraic expression so what you do multiply the first term as shown by the first arrow so this is the first arrow multiply this value here 3 times a 3 and then multiply the second term as shown by the second arrow I'll put numbers this is one red one pink one is 1 and 
,,the other color I'll take blue so this one multiply this one that's two three times minus B minus 3b now we'll follow that multiply and give me the answer this one with this you get 5x this one with this five times minus y minus five now try first this one seven times m 7m then this one seven times n plus seven ten times P 10 P 
,,plus 10 times Q 10 Q here the arrows are used to show the order to multiply so here always first one we can take first one and this is the SEC and why remove the brackets using arrows now now you can do that I mean there's a number in front of the algebraic expression you have to multiply all terms in the algebraic expression inside the bracket by the outside number yes with this this with this 3 into X 3 X 3 into 2 y + 6 1 now do this 1 7 into a 7 a 7 into minus 4 B that means minus 28 eleven times tu-22m 11 times n 11 4 times 3 P 4 times 3 12 P 4 times minus 2q so that's minus 8q this one 6 times X 6 X 6 times minus 11 by minus 66 1 8 times 3 24h 8 x k8 now look at this one you get three terms but same thing you have to multiply each and every term by the outside number this one three times five a 15 a three times to be six be three times c plus 3 C now do that four times X for X for x - y - y 4 times 7 that's + 28 8 times 2 16 a 8 times 7 56 be 8 times C that's 8 say look 
,,at this one 2 times X - x - x - 7 y minus 14y 2 times 3 z 6z 4 times P 4 P 4 times minus 3q - 12 Q 4 times 2r 8 11 times M 11 M 11 times 3 n 33 and 11 times 2 11 times 2 22 with l22 multiplying an algebraic expression by a negative number so now there's a negative number in front so we'll practice first with negative minus 3 times a minus 3 minus 3 times B minus 3 B negative into positive always you get a negative answer negative 5 times X negative 5x negative 5 into negative Y now negative into negative positive plus 5 minus 1 into 3 minus 3 minus 1 into minus 2 B plus 2 B minus into plus minus and here 5 times 2 10 2 times 2 4 that's plus because minus into minus plus and you get B here 2 times 7 here - into plus minus 14 C now you know how to multiply so plus into plus plus plus into minus minus minus into plus minus and minus into minus plus now we'll remove the brackets so you need to first multiply the first one when this number minus 3 a minus 3 times B minus 3b minus 
,,5 X and here so minus 5x minus 5 minus y you get plus 5i we did that minus 3 a and here minus 3 a you get here - nothing means 1 so this is like 1 minus 1 into 3 a minus 3 minus 1 into minus 2 B that's plus 2b this one this one minus 2 times 3 a what's the value minus 2 times 3a minus 6a this one - two - 2b plus 4b and here - two times seven you get minus 14c remove the brackets now so use arrows to multiply minus 3x minus - plus 6y this one when you multiply minus - plus 3 times 2 6 minus 
,,3 times minus 7 plus 20 months what this one you have to multiply all three terms minus 5 a minus - plus 5 times 4 20 get be your minus 5 times C minus 5 see this one multiply minus 8 times a minus 8 a - eight - seven be multiplication + 56 8 times 7 56 B question number 5 - 7 into minus X plus 7 X minus 7 into 2 y minus 14y - 7 into minus c plus 7z here minus 11 times 2 X minus 22 X minus 11 times -3 plus 33 yeah do all these multiplications try 4 times X 4 X 4 times minus 7y minus 28 y 4 
,,times 5 20 minus 3 times a minus 3 minus minus plus 21 B minus in 2 plus minus 24 6 here minus 11 times 2 minus 22 X here minus minus plus 11 times 3 plus 33 Y here 
,,you get minus 22 this one multiply minus 6 times 2 minus 12 minus 6 minus 7 plus 42 and minus 6 and minus 5 plus 13 this one minus 10 into minus 3 plus 30 minus 10 times chobe - 20 B and minus 10 times sake - 10 see what about this one - 4 times 3 H minus 12 which minus 4 times minus 4 plus 16 K minus 4 times minus 4 plus 60 now we're do multiplying an algebraic term by another algebraic term earlier we multiply by a constant now multiplying by an algebraic term 3x + 4 y how we multiply 3x 
,,times 4 1 so what we do we multiply that numbers first 3 times 4 12 and then x + y so without writing we can write without writing multiplication sign 12x what this 
,,one multiplication 7b into foil we can multiply separately the number 7 times 4 and then be a 7 times 4 28 be a it is better to write down then letters in order 28 a B but this is not wrong VA is okay but it's better it is good to write the letters in English at alphabetical order this 1 minus 3 by minus 5 X so we can multiply minus 3 and minus 5 first and then Y and X minus 3 times minus 5 plus 15 y X you can write 15 X Y to a times 7 B now we'll multiply at once 2 times 7 14 a into B a B 
,,you can write at once 3 X into 5 y 3 times 5 15 X into y X Y now there's a bracket minus sign minus 7 times 3 minus 21 a times B a B this one Phi times -3 minus 15 M times n m in here minus 4 times minus 3 plus 12 a and B you can write a B for x minus seven minus twenty eight Y into X Y X or what's the better one x1 multiplication of an algebraic expression by an algebraic term find the area of the following two rectangles separately so what's the area of the rectangle this one is length into breadth or length into width so area of the rectangle is any times X so what's that the X what's the area of the other rectangle length is B width or break is X B times X VX sum of areas you can just add it a X plus B X now when you combine the two rectangles now you are getting a big rectangle two rectangles are merged in the above diagram what's the length of this rectangle length is a here B here a plus B what's the area of the rectangle now length is a plus B and the with operate is 
,,X so X into a plus B as same rectangles are merged areas are equal now what's the area we got before a X plus B X so we can write a X plus B X is same as X into a plus B now sick how do you get this one so when you multiply the expression here can you see you get a X plus B X it is required to multiply all the terms inside brackets given by the outside term remove the brackets using arrows first one is this second one is this a 2 X a X a into - why - a why B into X BX be in 2 - 3 y - 3 B by C into a see a or a see C into 7 B 7 BC so here you can write AC as well is C + 7 BC when you remove brackets using an arrow first draw an arrow and write it then draw the next arrow and write it we'll do that separately X into a exhale Oh a X X into minus B minus BX X into 2 C 2 CX of XE y into p YP y into 2q minus 2 Q minus 2 y qi qi y into our are Y now try into p a p a into 3 q 3 a key a into for our for a 2 a into X 2x - 3 y that is -6 a why this 1 3 b into m 3b 3b into 4 12 B 5 a into 2 X 10 X 5 a into minus 3y minus 15 a why here - -5 a into z5 a 0 minus 3 into X minus 3 X minus into - now you get plus 6 a 1 plus 6 a expand brackets without using arrows no will do without arrows 3p into x 3p x 3p into minus 2 y minus 6 P for a into 2 where 8 a 4 into minus 3n minus 12 a in this one minus 4 into X minus 4 a X minus 4 times minus 3/12 a y minus 11 8 into 2 B minus 22 a be minus 11 a into minus 3 C you get plus 33 a see this one 7 a mintue l 7m n 7m into 428 look at this diagram area of the entire rectangle length is X with this a so what's the area a times X shaded area now can you see this square with length a a into a or we can write a square area of the unshaded part so you have to subtract total area that's a X minus the shaded area e squared sum of two algebraic expressions when you are adding you have to consider like terms so like terms only you can add or subtract when you consider these two terms what can you do you can add a terms with a 2a and 
,,3a you can add and then 3b and 5b separately so what do you get 5a + 5 + 3 8 at the time of addition or subtraction you have to add or subtract the like terms remove brackets and simplify taking like terms so first you have to multiply and then simplify here without arrows we'll do 2 times X 2 X 2 times y - 1 and then you have to add this 3x so I'd like terms 2x + 3 X you get 5x + 2 y right as it is here five times a five wave hi x minus B 5 B and plus seven B is there five way you can add 
,,separately yeah - five plus seven what's the value plus two so take the difference and put the sign of the bigger number plus two that's me here multiply by 4 8 X 4 
,,times y 4y now what are the like terms 8 XL minus 5x that's 3x plus 4 here you have to multiply both these terms here 3 times X 3 X 3 times y 3 by here 2 times X 2 X 2 times y 2 now add the like terms 3x + 2 X you get 5 X 3 y + 2 y you get high five do it separately 2 times a 2 a 2 times -3 b -6 b plus 5 times a highway by x - Oh Big Ten now I'd like terms - and five seven that's seven minus six and ten take the difference + OB this one seven times - 14 X 7 times y 7y this one three times X minus three x + -3 y add the like terms 14 -3 11 X 7 - 3 + 4 y this one 3 x - 6 a 3 times 5 15 b + 7 e + 10 B what are the like terms a terms 6 + 7:30 15 minus 10 plus 5 so 5 b minus 5 times 7 -35 a minus 5 times -3 plus 15 plus 40 a now like terms add 40 - 35 5 a + 15 subtraction of two algebraic expressions you have to do the same thing right the first algebraic expression in brackets right the second algebraic expression in another brackets remove both brackets and simplify three-year you nothing means just multiply by one yeah - is there so that means this is minus 1 multiplied by minus 1 minus 1 times a minus a minus 1 times minus 2 B you get plus 2 B now like terms added 3 and minus a 2 a 4 B plus 2 B you get 6 this one subtract this from this so that means you have to write this one first 12x plus 7 1 so here just multiply by one 12x plus 7 1 minus this means open brackets with minus 1 minus 1 times 7 minus 7x minus 1 times minus 2 plus 2 I like terms you get 12 minus 7 5 x 7 + 2 9 5 subtract 2x minus 3 from this so from means first this one so 6x + 7 when there's a minus sign change the sign minus 2x and minus minus becomes plus 3 like term 6 and minus 2 4 X 7 + 3 that's 10 subtract this value from this so first you write here so 3p plus 8q - open brackets with minus 1 - P last - q + + 7 3 
,,p + - b - p8 q + 2 Q thank you and our terms you get only this one so that's 7 simplify so that here multiply and first open brackets and then simplify 4 times a 4 4 times -3 minus 12 minus 2 times a minus 2 a minus 2 x - 7 + 14 now like terms that for a and minus 2 a 2 a minus 12 and plus 14 you get plus 2 open brackets first 5x - 5 minus 3 times X minus 3 X minus 3 and minus 2 you get 6 y 5x + 3 X 2 X - 5 I + + 6 Y you get Y this one has a minus 2 in front so when you are multiplying be careful - 2 times 3 - 6 Z minus 2 and minus plus plus times foil the Savoy here you get minus 8b add like terms minus 6a + 4 you get minus 2 a 4 B and minus a 2 B minus 4 B this one Phi P into 2 Q 10 PQ or QP 5 P into 4 20 P here - 3 P into Q minus 3 P Q minus 3 P into 2 minus 6 peace now these are two like terms 10 P Q minus 3 P Q you get 7 PQ 20 P minus 6 P you get plus 14 substituting the values in the edge break expression so now we will see how we can find out the expression with substituting values so what's the first one determine the value of 5 a plus 4 when a equals 3 so substitute a equals 3 there so what happens five times three plus four so 
,,what's five times three 15 15 plus four you get 19 look at this expression seven A plus 2 B now you get two letters so substitute these two values equals three and B equals three so 7 M plus 2 B is the expression so we'll substitute 7 times is 3 7 times 3 plus 2 times B equals 3 so 7 times 3 21 2 times 3 6 21 plus 6 27 look at this one now you get three unknown letters 5 a 2 B 7 C values are given a equals 5 B equals 3 and C equals -2 substitute 5 into a is 5 2 times 3 and say x minus 2 so 
,,minus 7 x minus 2 5 times 5 25 minus 2 times 3 minus 6 and here minus minus becomes positive seven times 2 plus 14 now simplify 25 minus 6 you get 19 19 plus 14 33 determine the value of the following expressions when x equals 2 and y equals minus 3 we substitute 8 times X is 2 y equals minus 3/8 times 2 16 5 times minus 3 minus 15 16 minus 15 you get 1 here 12 times 2 minus 3 times minus 3 12 times 2 24 minus into minus plus 2 so 3 times 3 9 9 plus 4 13 so you get 33 now look at this one so same values you have to plug what are the values x equals 2 and y equals -3 9 mean 2 2 plus XY means X into y so 2 into minus 3 y equals minus 3 9 times 2 18 minus 6 you get 12 2 times X X is 2 5 times minus 3 plus 11 2 times 2 4 minus 15 plus 11 so 4 minus 15 you get minus 11 minus 11 and plus 11 you get 0 this one 4 times X 
,,X is 2 2 times minus 3 plus 8 4 times 2 8 minus 6 plus 8 8 minus 6 2 2 plus 8 10 here X is 2 y is minus 3 plus 2 minus 7 times minus 3 2 times minus 3 minus 6 here plus 2 is they are already according to Bodnar's you have to multiply first minus into minus plus 21 minus 6 plus 2 minus 4 minus 4 plus 21 you get 17 determine the value of the following algebraic expressions when a equals 3 and B equals 5 so what you do first first we'll open brackets and then substitute 3 times 2 6 6 8 3 times 3 you get 9 so 9 B now substitute after you multiply now substitute the value 6 times 3 9 times 5 because B equals 5 and a equals 3 6 times 3 18 9 times 5 45 what's the addition 63 in this one you have given the same question we'll try in a different way earlier we multiplied and then simplify now we'll do we'll simplify inside brackets and then multiply by three so three is there two times a is 3 B equals 5 now simplify inside 3 times 2 6 3 times 5 15 3 times 6 plus 15 21 now multiply 3 and 21 3 times 1 3 3 times 2 6 so you are getting the same answer get the same as if simplify inside brackets or without removing bracket so you can do any method first you can multiply and simplify and then substitute or simplify inside the brackets and then multiply by the outside number remove the brackets and substitute the values so first remove the brackets 7 a plus 14 B substitute the values 7 times 3 plus 14 times 5 say 1 times 3 21 here 5 times 425 times 1 5 and 7 add it you get 91 
,,this one 4 times 3 12 a and 8 B substitute the values of 12 times 3 minus 8 times fun now simplify 12 times 3 36 8 times 5 40 36 minus 40 you get minus here 11 times 2 22 a plus 11b so 22 times a 3 because 566 plus 55 hundred twenty-one this one 9 times 3 27 a 9 x -2 18 B now multiply 27 times 3 and 18 times fun 3 times 7 21 two remaining 3 times 2 6 plus 2 81 minus 5 times 8 44 remaining so you get 90 81 minus 90 you get minus 9 determine the value when a equals 3 B equals -2 and C equals 
,,1 so just substitute the values 2 times 3 7 x minus 2 make sure you put brackets when you get negative numbers 3 times 1/6 minus minus plus 14 plus 3 so 6 plus 3 9 9 plus 14 23 this one 5 times 3/2 x minus 2 and 4 into 1 15 minus 4 plus 4 minus 4 plus 4 get canceled out you get 15 11 x equals 3 B equals -2 and C equals 1 according to what must do the multiplication first 11 times 3 33 minus 2 times minus 2 plus 4 and you get minus 3/4 minus 3/1 33 plus 130 in this one first simplify and then substitute values of the following algebraic expressions when a equals 5 because 3 and C equals -2 so you have given this expression so what you do first open brackets 2 where 2 B 3 B 3 C then what you do simplify the terms add the like terms to a you have to write as it is 2b and 3b becomes Phi B and 3c here now substitute the values equals 5 B equals 3 and C equals -2 2 times 5 10 5 times 3 15 minus 60 so but you get 10 minus 6 4 4 plus 15 19 this one first open brackets 3 a 3 times minus B minus 3 B 4 times B 4 B 4 times C minus 4 C here because there's a negative sign now I'd like terms 3-year you can't simplify minus 3 and plus 4 that's plus 1 B or B minus 4 C now substitute the values 3 a means multiplication 3 times a 3 times 5 B is 3 4 times minus 2 first multiplication according to but must 5 times 3 15 minus 4 minus 2 plus 8 so you get 8 plus 3 11 11 and 15 you get 26 this one first open brackets 3a plus 3b here to be and -2 C 5 C 5 a so each one you have to multiply by the outside number now like terms 3a and 5a 8 a 3 B and plus 2 B 5 B -2 C + + 5 C plus 3 C now multiply 8 times a what's the value for a a 5 3 minus 2 I'll write down here equals 5 B equals minus 3 B is 3 and C equals -2 C equals -2 so a is 5 B 3 C minus 2 8 times 5 14 15 here and -6 15 minus 6 you get 9 9 plus 40 49 this one 7 a 7 B minus 7 C and then plus 2a minus 2b minus 2 C when you multiply by 2 add like terms 7 + + 2 9 e 7 B and minus 2b + 5 b minus 7 and minus 2 minus 9 see now my tip life is five B's tricky and C is minus 2/9 times 5 45 five times three 15 and minus minus becomes plus nine times two eighteen now add all together 1018 one remaining five six seven so 78 is the answer this one you get fractions but same procedure just substitute the values for a eight over be sixteen over C so now substitute equals 2 so 4 over 2 8 / BBS for 16 over C C is 8 now you have to simplify first 4 divide by 2 you get 2 8 divided by 4 you get 2 16 divided by 8 you get 2 2 + 2 + 2 6 this one substitute the values a equals 2 2 divided by 2 B is 4 4 divided by 4 C equals 8 8 divided by 8 simplify division first 2 divided by 2 is 1 4 divided by 4 is 1 8 divided by 8 is 1 1 plus 1 plus 1 you get 3 this one substitute a B means a times B 2 times 4 plus BC means B times that's 4 times C means 8 minus C times a C is 8 and a equals to 8 32 16 so 32 minus 16 is 16 16 and 8 addition you get 24 now we will look at remove exercise complete the table given below algebraic expression is given unknown term of the algebraic expression coefficient of the unknown term terms of the algebraic expression and final column is mathematical operations in the order they appear in the algebraic expression so first of all what's the unknown letter X coefficient is the number in front of the letter that's three and these are called algebraic terms and what is the operation plus and multiplication is three times X now we look at the next one what's the letter here Y what's the coefficient of that term to what are the algebraic terms to Y and 4 and what's the operation first multiplication and then addition next one what's the algebraic letter B coefficient 4 and terms for P and minus hundred and the operation for times P that means multiply and then subtract this one P is the letter coefficient nothing means one terms PN minus 10 and what are the operations used 1 times P times and then - what's the later here in coefficient is + 3 terms 3 n n minus 7 and operation first multiply and then subtract question number two the length of a table is two meters more than its breadth write an algebraic expression for the length of the table by taking its breath as V when you take this table B is the bread length is 2 meters more than its brick so what's the expression B plus 2 back to write

,,and 10 what's the value 12 6 and 10 22 plus 6 28 next one 2 times P P is 1 3 times Q Q is 2 minus 4 times R minus 3 to minus 6 minus minus plus 12 12 plus 2 14 14 minus 6 8 next 1 4 8 4 times 2 minus B minus 4 there plus 5 into 1 4 times 2 8 minus minus multiplication plus 4 plus 5 then 8 plus 4 12 12 plus 5 17 these values 3x plus y so minus 1 plus 3 plus 10 z x 2 you get here we do the brackets first here minus 1 plus 3 3 minus 1 to 2 times 3 6 plus 10 times 2 20 so you'll get 20 plus 6 26 for a is 5 3 times B 3 times 1 that's 3 - 10 5 + 3 8 8 times 4 32 32 minus 10 you get 20 to 10 M plus n so 3 minus 1 minus 8 K is 8 next 1 3 minus 1 is 2 2 times till 2020 minus 8 1200 minus 3 P is 4 2 is minus 5 100 minus 3 here minus 10 here minus 10 plus 4 minus 600 6 times 3 18 that's plus 18 so 180 and the last one to a is 4 plus 2 B 2 times minus 1 minus 2 plus Phi a is 4 minus minus 1 we'll simplify inside 4 minus 2 to 2 times 2 for this one 4 plus 1 minus minus plus 1 4 plus 1 5 5 times 5 25 so what's the value you get 29 question number 5 expand each algebraic expression given below and find its value by substituting the given values for the unknowns well expand first we will first expand this tourney plus 20 be here 3a + -15 be now simplified first 10 8 3 8 13 a 20 - 50 that's 5 now substitute 13 times 7 plus 5 times 1 7 times 3 21 7 times 1 7 + 2 9 91 + 5 96 find the value of this one first expand brackets 4m plus 4 times 3 12 n + M + 5 in like terms ed you get 5m and 17 in substitute now M is 9 in this - - 9 times 5 45 here you get minus 34 45 minus 34 you get 11 find the value of this when P equals 2 and Q equals 3 first we'll expand 7 times 247 times Q 7 Q minus 10p plus 3q - 8 simplify like terms 14 and minus 10 4 - 7 + + 3 - 4 now substitute the values for x - 4 times 3 yep and - it 4 x - 8 - 12 - 8 8 8 get cancel out you get minus 12 find the value of this one 3 times 2 6 3 times 7 21 be here 3 b9c and minus 10 is there like terms simplify you get 6 a 21 and 3 24 9 CA - 10 now substitute 6 times 1 24 x - 9 x minus 3 and minus 10 6 48 27 and 10 at 48 6 54 54 - 27 27 27 - 10 you get 17 Yancy is 70 this one expand 4x minus 20 by minus 21 plus 3x plus 8l now substitute the values for x 8 20 times minus 1 because y is minus 1 minus 21 is there plus 3x 3 times 8 plus 8 l 
,,only is minus 2 4 times 8 32 minus minus becomes plus 20 minus 20 bar 8 times 3 24 minus 16 now you can subtract here 20 minus 21 minus 132 minus 1 31 31 plus 24 you get 55 55 minus 16 30 not so the answer is 39 so we covered all theory in algebraic expressions so what are the things we did when multiply an algebraic expression 
,,by a number each term of the algebraic expression needs to be multiplied by the number that is the coefficient of each algebraic term should be multiplied by the given number and simplify so make sure that you multiply by the coefficient when multiplying an algebraic term by an algebraic term there our coefficients are much like first and then the unknowns are multiplied when multiplying an algebraic expression by an algebraic term every algebraic term of the algebraic expression needs to be multiplied by the given algebraic term by substituting values for the unknown terms of an algebraic expression we obtain a numerical value for the algebraic expression so when you are simplifying either you can simplify brackets first and then multiply or expand brackets and then substitute the values so practice all these questions examples and exercise and thorough with algebraic expressions

AlgebraicExpression,20BYGqGufY8,are they grenades and welcome to worksheet cloud maths my name is Joe Milligan and I'm going to take you through some facts about algebraic expressions first of all 
,,how to write them then how to simplify them and then how to evaluate them okay if at any stage you don't understand anything and you want to ask a question remember 
,,to just send an email to that email address at the bottom of your page and somebody will get back to you right first of all we have to look at what an algebraic expression actually is it indicates a sequence of calculations that can also be described in words or with a flow diagram so for example multiply a number by 2 and add 6 to the answer that is in words as you can see this would be the flow diagram for that sentence and it's an unknown number x bar 2 and added 6 and that as an algebraic expression would look like that X plus 2 or sorry x times 2 plus 6 okay that would be the expression it's written an algebraic form okay so your expression would 
,,actually look like this 2x plus 6 remember the X is the unknown value you can call that unknown value anything you'd like you can call it a or b or Y or CID but for 
,,today's lesson we're going to refer to unknown values as X okay now you try see if you can write that as an expression two times a number added to three times the same number okay did you get that 2 times X plus 3 times X and if we make it simpler it would just be 2x plus 3x okay right let's go on let's break this down two times a number added to three times the same number okay now give it give the unknown number a name like I said earlier you can give it any name you like but today we are going to call it X so both are no numbers have the same value and they can both be called X if you choose to use y both of them would be called Y okay so these words then translate to 2 times X plus 3 times X as an algebraic expression and can also then be written 2x plus 3x which just looks a whole lot tidier okay let's try one more half a number subtracted from five times of that number it would be 5 X minus 1/2 X you might have written half X minus 5 X but let me explain to you why it's the other way around okay we break this one down we've got half of a number subtracted from 5 times that same number okay if the same number is we're dealing with only one unknown value so we can give it them both the same name and we will call it X again and so we are then we need to look at the word from in this case yeah because we are subtracting 1/2 X from 5 times X so we need to write it 5x minus 1/2 X it would be like me asking you to subtract 2 from 3 if you were to write that it would be 3 minus 2 okay let's go on you can try these now all on your own so you can pause the video and you can try them out and then we'll go over them together right let's see what you did the first one is a number less 7 again you can call it a B why is it whatever you'd like to call it we're going to call it X again and that would be X minus 7 see this time wasn't from 7 it was a number less 7 that means you subtract the 7 from the number okay half of a number added to 6 that would be 1/2 X plus 6 or 6 plus 1/2 X remember adding we can write it any which way we lack any way around okay the next one times a number divided by 2 would be 9x divided by 2 next one 3 times a number increased by 4 you've got it 3x plus 4 and then 1/4 of a number subtracted from 8 remember these are from again let's have a look it would be 8 minus 1/4 X well done guys I'm sure you got those all rights right now we're going to look and see how we can simplify the expressions okay five times a number add it to six times the same number and then subtract 4 wow that seems like quite a long sentence but let's go through it slowly 5x plus 6x minus 4 now because you've got 5x and a 6x those are both the same unknown numbers so we could say we can put them together and say it's 11x minus 4 can you see that you've got an unknown number of that X and that X 5 of those and 6 of the same things you'd get 11 of them if I were to say to you for 5x and 6x then you could say I've got 11x it would 
,,be the same kind of thing see right now you can try try those ones pause the video again have a go and we'll go over them together right let's see how you did two times a number subtracted from 3 times the same number would give you 3 minus 2x is the and then it would be the same as just plain X because you've got three X's and 
,,you - includes from that you left with 1x right the second one for added to a number and subtract 2 times the same number let's see what happens yeah we've got 4 plus an unknown X minus 2x so yeah we've got a positive x and a negative x so if you have minus 2x and you add on an X you she just got EXO it would be four minus X let's go over that one just one more time you've got a positive excellent you - in two x's from it you would end up in with a negative x so it'll be 4 minus X instead of 4 plus X right let's go over the next one and number added to 7 and 3 times that number is subtracted let's see what happens ya X plus 7 minus 3 X again you've got a positive X if there's nothing in front of it it means it's positive and see how you've got a minus 3 X so you adding an X 1 to your minus 3 X so then you would end up with 7 minus 2x you could possibly also write it minus 2x plus 7 it just looks a little bit more messy right so far we've looked at writing algebraic expressions from words and how to simplify the expression now we're going to look at how to evaluate these expressions ok we can only evaluate an expression if we are given the value of x and remember the X is the unknown number so we can't give an expression of value unless we are actually given the value of that X so let's have a look at so if we are told X is equal to 3 then we can work out the value of the expression 2x minus 1 and how do we do this well we would substitute the 3 into the expression in the position of X so it would be 3 2 times 3 minus 1 so we would write it like that or we can write it like that the only reason I wrote it like that was because the X looks sits next to the tooth so it's the same thing 2 times 3 and then minus 1 okay because we now have an actual value we can carry out the operations and the expression to find the answer so 2 times 3 would be 6 and 6 minus 1 would give me 5 rights have you got it so let's go over that again we can only substitute in when we are given the value of the X so we the value up here we are told that X is equal to 3 so 2 times 3 would give me 6 6 minus 1 is 5 and that would be the value of that expression right let's go on to your turn now I want you to find the value of the expression X minus 2 X where X is equal to 2 you can pause the video and 
,,you can try that out and then we'll go over it okay so what's the value of your expression for let's break it down we've got 8 minus 2x where the X is equal to 2 so 
,,it's 8 minus 2 times 2 that's 8 minus 4 and so the value of your expression is 4 okay try those on your own grab a piece of paper write them down pause the video and work them out okay how well did you do 8 minus 2 X where X is equal to 3 we're going to substitute the 3 in for the X so it would be 8 minus 2 times 3x minus 6 which gives me 2 5x minus 7 where X is equal to 2 same thing we're going to go 5 times 2 2 is in place of the X which gives me 10 minus 7 is 3 one thing here you have to write out the whole expression so I can't just write 5 times 2 because I've got an equal sign so my equal sign tells me that what is on this line is actually exactly the same value as to what is on that line so if I left off the 7 5 times 2 does not give me 5x minus 7 it doesn't equal that so we must just be very careful with how we write things down see okay number three 1/2 X where X is 10 half of 10 we all know is 5 3 times 2 X where X is 4 again we're going to substitute in for the X where it's 4 it will be 3 times and in brackets 2 times 4 so we'll do that first then we'll go 2 times 4 is 8 3 times 8 is 24 the next one 3x plus 2x again we substituting in 3 X + 2 X X here is 5 so 5 3 times 5 plus 2 times 5 will be 15 plus 10 and that gives you 25 I hope you all got that but let's look at the next thing remember when we simplified the expression while that last one we could probably simplify so in question 5 was 3x + 2 X where X was equal to 5 so because your variables are the same your unknowns are the same can add them together before you substitute it in so we got 3x + 2 X and that's the same as 5x remember when we simplify the expressions we looked at putting those together okay so X is equal to 5 and we can then multiply it 5 times 5 and we end up with 25 so the answer to that expression would be 25 that is the same answer as what you got when you did when you didn't simplify the expression and you kept the two terms apart it would be 3 times 5 + 2 times 5 which is 15 plus 10 and you also end up with 25 can you see you got the same answer so you could do it either way around you would end up with the same answer right let's look at see if it works for another example where 2 X + 4 X + X is equal to 3 we've got 2 times 3 plus 4 times 3 that's 6 plus 12 and it gives me an answer of 18 or we could go to X plus 4 X is 6 X 6 times 3 is 18 can you see same answer so whichever way suits you to work it out you can work it out like that you're going to get the same answer either way around right let's draw on everything you have learned today to try these ok you can pause the video again try those art and we'll go over them together right let's see how you did 2 times a number subtracted from 3 times the same number we've got 3 X minus 2 X and that would eggs we haven't been given the the value of the X so we can just simplify them right for added to 2 times a number and subtract the same number is 4 + 2 X - X would be 4 + X a number subtracted from 7 and 3 times that number is added it's 7 - x + 3 X and that would give you 7 minus 2 X right it's just revised what you've gone over today what we've learned so you've learned how to first of all write an expression in words then you learned how to simplify the expression and how to evaluate the expression when given a value for the unknown number see I made a little mistake here it's hard to simplify the expression not and expression and how do you evaluate the expression when given a value for the unknown number now you can try the activity that is being posted and then you can check it with the memo thank you for joining us today great and I hope you've understood everything just remember if you haven't understood anything at all you can email in and the email address has been on each side so you can go back and check it it is also an activity worksheet and somebody will get back to you with an answer or an explanation thank you for listening today

AlgebraicExpression,GYevDfFTCUs,hello grade 9 students today I am here to teach you an algebraic you need that's algebraic expressions chapter 5 we'll take algebraic expressions 3x plus 7 what is this one 3x plus 7 is the algebraic expression and what is 3x 3x is the algebraic term and what's the coefficient of the algebraic term that's 3 so what you call this number this is the constant term 7 so in algebra you need to know what is algebraic expression algebraic term and the coefficient of the algebraic term and the constant look at this algebraic expression 3 a + 5 b -11 write down the algebraic terms in the algebraic expression here 3 a is an algebraic term and 5 B you can't write minus 11 minus 11 is a constant write down the constant term that's minus 11 expanding brackets in algebraic expressions you have done this before in grade 8 how you expand multiply the first term with first and this one second so 3 times X 3 X 3 times 4 plus 12 all the elements inside the brackets must must be multiplied by 3 
,,this is an algebraic expression with algebraic term is 3x so this is the algebraic term the coefficient of algebraic term is 3 and the constant term is 12 now expand this minus 5 times a minus 5 a minus 5 times minus 4 you get plus 20 when multiplying by negative number the terms inside the brackets changed the sign look at here a was positive law - five earlier this was - value now this is Plus expand brackets 3 times a 3 a 3 times 2 + 6 here 5 times X 5x - 5 times 4 26 times a 6 a plus 6 
,,times 1 6 minus 7 times X minus 7 X minus 7 times minus 4 plus 28 minus 3 times 5 minus 50 minus 3 into minus y plus 3 y here - 11 times 3 minus 33 - 11 x minus m plus 11 m take these questions eight times like 8 times X 8 X 8 x - 4 - 32 here 4 times a 4 - 4 times 1/2 so what is 4 times 1/2 that means 2 so minus 2 6 times 2 X 12 X minus 6 this one 5 times 3 15 p phi x cubed minus 5 q this 1 minus 2 times X minus 2 X minus minus plus plus 22 what 1/2 times 4 X here you can do separately 1/2 
,,times 2 X here you get 2 X 1/2 times 8 you get 4 so plus Oh expand brackets a times X X a times 4 4 B times X BX B times minus 3 minus 3 this one C X plus C C times 
,,1 that's C P times Q P Q minus P times 4 you can write minus 4p when you are writing the term write the number first M into M M square M into 4 for M P into P P squared P into minus Q minus P Q 2 way times a 2 a squared 2 a times B 2 a 3 X into X 3x squared 3 X into minus 2 minus 6 X here what happens - is there - 2 P times M minus 2 will write MP in order alphabetical order M first minus 2p times minus 4 plus 8 P here again - values minus 3 X into X minus 3 X square minus 3 X into minus y 
,,plus 3 X 5 - 2 y into Z minus 2 y Z minus 2 into 3 minus 6 Y this 1 minus px - + - + P Y what about this one a square into a square a B and minus 3a X into X x squared X into - y - x - y or first we have to write down the number -2 X Y X into five that's five X we don't say X 5 5 X is the correct way of writing substitute the values in the algebraic expression what we do we can substitute the values given a equals 2 there so the algebraic term is three so how do you do that first write down the expression substitute a is 2 3 times 2 + 7 6 plus 7 that's 13 determine the value of x squared + 5 X minus 11 when x equals 3 what is x squared means 3 times 3 
,,so 3 squared 5 times 3 minus 11 9 plus 15 minus 11 15 minus 11 is 4 9 plus 4 30 what's the expression given here 5x minus 4y plus 7 you asked to find out when x equals -2 and y equals minus 3 substitute 5 times minus 2 y times minus 3 5 times minus 2 minus 10 minus minus plus 12 plus 7 minus 10 plus 12 plus 2 2 plus 7 that's 9 find the value of the algebraic expression by substituting the values for the unknown letters given below a squared minus a is given 3 so that means 3 squared minus 3 3 squared is 9 9 minus 3 you get six seven X minus three y plus four x equals 4 that means 7 times 4 y equals to 7 times 4 28 3 times 2 6 28 minus 6 22 22 plus 4 you get 26 this one you have to substitute a fraction we'll see a equals 1/2 so that means 4 times 1/2 B equals 3 3 times 3 2 times 2 so you get 2 plus 9 minus 9 9 9 get cancel out and you get to them expand brackets and simplify as much as possible first expand brackets 2 times a 2 a 2 times minus B minus 2 B plus 3a plus 21 now 
,,I'd like terms 2 & 3 8 that's 5 8 and - to be there plus 21 here first expand brackets 3x - 6 5 I plus 5 here constant terms we can simplify 3 X plus 5 by minus 6 and plus 5 is minus 1 here 6a plus 6b you know nothing means this is like 1 minus a plus v6 a - a highway 6 b + B it's 7 B expand and simplify 3x + 3 y here 2x minus 2y like terms add 3x and 2x becomes 5x 3 y + minus 2y that's plus y 1y you don't need to write 1 here 5 a minus 10 B minus 3 a minus into minus plus 12 B 5 a and minus 3a 2a minus 10 10 plus 12 plus 2 so plus 2b this one nothing means this is like 1 so a minus 3 multiply these 2 minus M square R and minus - plus 5 m now what are

,,2 y 11 minus 2 plus 9 substituting fractions - algebraic terms X is half you asked to find out 4 X plus 5 so substitute 4 times 1/2 plus 5 here you can see you can simplify the denominator with the numerator 1 and here so you get 2 + 5 that's 7 equals 1/3 9a plus 2/9 times 1/3 + 2 here 3 times 1/3 times 3 3 + 2 you get 5 x equals 2/3 now 9 x + 1 9 times 2/3 plus 1/3 times 1/3 times 3 so 3 times 2 6 6 + 1 7 here 11 minus 3 when a equals minus 2/3 11 minus 3 times minus 2 over 3 will put brackets here 3 + 3 get cancel out you get 11 minus into minus plus 11 plus 2 answer yes 13 equals 1/2 B equals 1/3 so this should be simple B so we'll substitute the values for a equals 1/2 we cause 1/3 2 times 1/2 times 2 so what's the answer 2 + here are 3 in one three two one so one day three to plus one you'll get three six a six times 1/2 minus 3 times 1/3 substitute a and B two times three three get cancelled out so what's remaining 3 here 1 3 minus 1 is 2 8 E is 1/2 B is 1/3 2 times 1/2 times 4 3 times 1/3 times 2 here 4-2 ours is to 18 times 1/2 six times one thirty two and nine three bit too so what's the final answer nine minus two answer is seven if x equals 2/3 and y equals 1/2 find the value of the following algebraic expressions 6 times 2/3 2 times 1/2 3 times 1/3 times 2 2 times 1/2 times 1/2 times 2 4 here plus one times one one four plus one you get five this one 9 times X what is X X is 2/3 4 times 1/2 3 times 1/3 times 3 2 times 1/2 times 2 so 3 times 2 is 6 2 times 1 is 2 6 minus 2 same question another part 12 X is 2/3 - why why is half substitute 3 times 1/3 times 4 4 times 2 eight here - when to get canceled out you get one there 8 + 1 9 9 X is 2/3 minus 2 times 1/2 3 n here 3 3 times 2 6 2 + 2 get cancelled out you get minus 1 6 - 1 answer is 5 find the value of value if P equals 1/3 so substitute 1/3 for P simplify first 3 times 2 6 2 + 4 that's 6 9 P minus 2/9 times P is 1/3 minus 2 here simplify 3 + 3 3 - 2 you get 12 P P is 1/3 + 3 3 times 1 3 times 4 4 + 3 you get 7 3 P plus 11 3 into 1/3 + ulema 3 + 3 get cancel out 1 plus 11 is 12 so you need to simplify the fractional part that's multiplication and then do the addition find the value if M equals to 4 times 2 + 11 8 plus 11 that's 19 6 times 2 plus 5 multiplication first 12 + 5 17 10 times 2 - 1 xx - 1 that's 19 8 times 2 plus 10 8 times 2 16 + 10 26 find the value when x equals 2l y equals 1/3 for X is 2 y is 138 plus 1/3 how can you write you can write 8 full parts and 135 X plus 3 by 5 X that's not bad by 2 3 y 1/3 is there 3 3 get cancelled out so 10 plus 1 the answer is either 1 another one 8 times 2 minus 6 times 1/3 3 and here too you get 6 8 times 2 16 minus 2 answer is 14 again this one 10 times 2 minus 9 times white why is 1/3 3 times 1/3 times 3 10 times 2 20 minus 3 answer is 17 find the value of M equals 1/2 and in equals 1/2 for these expressions 8m a miss half in Miss 152 times 4 here are 5 times 2 4 times 1 4 2 times 1 2 4 minus 2 you get to do the same thing 16mm is 1/2 it needs 152 with 16 you get eight five and five get canceled out 8 minus 1 is 7 10 mm is half a Miss 152 and ten five five and this 1 so 5 plus 1 you get 6 6 times mm is 1/2 minus 15 times n that's one field to end is 3 5 times 3 15 so you get 3 minus 3 answer is 0 binomial expressions what is 
,,bi means two so expressions means when you get two terms 3x plus 4y is binomial expression X minus 5i so all these are binomial expressions so there are two terms in all these expressions due to one term or both of these terms are algebraic terms these are called binomial algebraic expressions so here one term is constant and the other one is algebraic term here both terms are algebraic terms product of two binomial expressions now X plus 2 is a binomial expression X plus 3 or so another binomial expression now we'll try to multiply these two so this is the product of both binary expressions or binomial expressions expand the brackets and simplify as much as possible now we'll try to do that using this method so we are multiplying here X plus 3 they are we can write x plus 2 here X plus 2 this way row wise X plus 
,,3 column wise X plus 2 so we can use multiply row and columns X into X we know this is X square X into plus 3 plus 3x this one 2 into X plus 2 X 2 into 3 plus 6 so what's the answer when you multiply using this method you get x squared - 3 X 2 X + 6 now simplify I can simplify these two - 3 + 2 5 X + 6 so that's how we can multiply using this method now we'll do the same thing X + 3 is there x + 5 X into X x squared X into 5 5 X 3 into X 3 X 3 into 5 15 so what are the values you are getting here when you multiply you get x squared - 5 X 3x + 15 so when you simplify you get 8x plus 15 - the same thing a plus 4a plus 4a into a a square into 4 4 a 5 into a 5 a 5 into 4 20 so when you multiply you get all these terms so a square plus 4 plus 5a plus 20 so when you can so you can add these to phibn for where you get 9e and this is 20 similar to that one y + 3 y + 7 Y into y Y square my into 3 3 by 7 into y 7y 7 into 3 20 so what's the answer Y squared 3 by 7 y + 20 bucks so these 
,,two terms you can add you get 10 buy and here are twenty one this one now - so a minus two so you can write in one color - to a +3 here a squared - 2 way here plus 3 a + -6 - into + - now what are the terms you are getting a squared minus 2a plus 3 and minus 6 so simply 5 3 - 2 + 1 that's a minus 6 this was X - 5 X - 2 so we need to multiply X into X X square X into minus 5 minus 5 X here you get minus 2 X minus 2 into minus 5 that's + step write down the terms and simplify x squared minus 
,,5 minus 2 minus 7 and you'll get 10 here similar to that one a minus 7 a minus 3 a into a a square minus 7 8 - 3 times a minus 3 a minus 3 times minus 7 plus 25 so what are the terms you are getting a squared minus 7 a minus 3 a + 21 a squared - 7 + -3 minus 10 plus 21 expand and simplify so we'll take the whole expression multiplied with this and this so you get a into a plus 2 here 3 with a plus 2 now expand brackets a into a square plus 2 a 3 into a 3a plus 6 so you get a squared 2a and 
,,3a v b +6 this one through the same thing the whole expression multiplied with this one X into X minus 2 5 into X minus 2 then expand brackets x squared minus 2x plus 5 X minus 10 so x squared minus 2 plus 5 that's plus 3x minus 10 this one this whole expression with this end this p with p + 5 + -7 b 3 plus 5p squared plus 5p minus 7 P minus 35 so you get P squared minus 7 and plus 5 minus 2p minus 35 this one Y with Y minus 3 and minus 4 with Y minus 3 so this term multiplied by these two 
,,terms Y squared minus 3y minus 4y plus 12 so you get Y squared minus 3 minus 4 minus 7y then you get plus expand and simplify again we can write a plus 3 expression 
,,with a plus 7 with this now expand a square plus 3 plus seventy plus 21 but you get a squared 3 a + 7 a 10 a plus 21 what about this one y with y + 7 + 4 with y + 7 
,,now multiply Y into y y square and 4y plus 28 four times seven simplify y squared 7 plus 4 11 y plus 28 this one a minus 3 times M plus 4 times M minus 3 M into M M 
,,squared minus 3 M 4 M minus 12 so you get M squared minus 3 plus 4 plus M minus 12 what about this one p + 7 x p + + 8 x p + 7 you get P squared + 7 p 8 b + 56 p square 7 p + 8 P 15 P Plus 56 look at this one P with P minus 8 and the other one is minus 3 with P minus 8 expand brackets you get V squared minus 18 minus 3 P plus 24 P square 8 + 3 11 so this is minus 24 there this one X with X - 4 - 7 with X - 4 x squared minus 4 X minus 7 X + 28 x squared minus 4 X and minus 7 X minus 11 X and here plus 28 here 4 into 6 + P + + P into 6 + p expand separately 24 + 4 p here 6 P plus P squared so 24 is there here 6 plus 4 10 plus P Square what about this one 4 is there 7 - why - why with 7 - what 4 times 7 28 here - 4 y minus 7y plus y square answer is 28 minus 4 minus 7 minus 11 y + y squared there this one a with a - 
,,8 + 8 with a minus 8a squared - 8 8 plus 8 a + 64 minus 64 a squared - 8 e + 8 a get cancel out you get minus 68 so this one P into P minus 4 and plus 4 with P minus 4p squared - 4 p + 4 P minus 16 yeah also me the term get canceled out P squared minus 16 is what seven with seven plus M minus M with seven plus M when you simplify expand brackets 49 + 7 m - 7 M minus M Squared so what's the value 49 minus M Squared because this these two terms get cancelled out so what are these actually can you remember difference between two squared terms so you get square terms here and here this one give it to a plus three minus five it to a plus three to a squared 
,,plus 3a minus 10y minus fifteen simplify you get 2a squared - 7 8 - 15 question number 19 expand using the arrow now we'll use another method we call it rainbow method or foil so I'll show you how to do that at once without writing separate brackets this one first with first number so that's F a into a that's a square that's F first with first that's the arrow number one now we are taking oh-oh means outside values so outside here with outside that's the second one a with eight get 8a that's outside I mean inside with inside so inside with inside that's number three three with you get three that's I thought 1l l means last with last two last week last

AlgebraicExpression,NybHckSEQBI,"Hi! This is Rob. Welcome to Math Antics. In this lesson, we're going to learn some really important things about a whole branch of math called Algebra. The first thing you need to know is that Algebra is a lot like arithmetic. It follows all the rules of arithmetic and it uses the same four main operations that arithmetic is built on: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. But Algebra introduces a new element... the element of the unknown. When you were learning arithmetic, the only thing that was ever unknown was the answer to the problem. For example, you might have the problem 1 + 2 = what? The answer isn't known until you go ahead and "
,,"do the arithmetic. Now the important thing about Algebra is that when we don't know what a number is yet, we use a symbol in its place. that symbol is usually just any letter of the alphabet. A really popular letter to choose is the letter 'x'. So in arithmetic, we would just leave the problem like this: 1 + 2 = ""blank"" and we'd write in the answer when we did the addition. But in Algebra, we'd write it like this:  1 + 2 = x The 'x' is a place holder that stands for the number that we don't know yet. What we have here is a very basic algebraic equation. An equation is just a mathematical statement that two things are equal. An equation says, ""the things on this side of the equal sign have the same value as the things on the other side of the equal sign."" In this case, our equation is telling us that the known values on this side (1+2) are equal to what's on the other side, which happens to be the unknown value that we are calling 'x'. One of the main goals in Algebra is to figure out what the unknown values in equations are. And when you do that, it's called ""solving the equations"". In this equation, it's pretty easy to see that the unknown value is just 3. All you have to do is actually add the 1 and 2 together on this side of the equation and it turns into 3 = x, which is the same as x = 3. So now we know what 'x' is!  It's just 3. That almost seems too easy, doesnt it? And that's why in Algebra, you are usually given an equation in a more complicated form like this: x - 2 = 1. This is exactly the same equation as 1 + 2 = x, but it has been rearranged so that it's not quite as easy to tell what 'x' is. So in Algebra, solving equations is a lot like a game where you are given mixed-up, complicated equations, and it's your job to simplify them and rearrange them until it is a nice simple equation (like x = 3) where it's easy to tell what the unknown values are. We're going to learn a lot more about how you actually do that (how you solve equations) in the next several videos, but for now, let's learn some important rules about how symbols can and can't be used in algebraic equations. The first rule you need to know is that the same symbol (or letter) can be used in different algebra problems to stand for different unknown values. For example, in the problem we just solved, the letter 'x' was used to stand for the number 3, right? But 'x' could stand for a different number in a different problem. Like, if someone asks us to solve the equation, 5 + x = 10. In order for the two sides of this equation to be equal, 'x' must have the value '5' in this problem, because 5 + 5 = 10. So 'x' (or any other symbol) can stand for different values in different problems. That's okay, but what's NOT okay is for a symbol to stand for different values in the same problem at the same time! For example, what if you had the equation: x + x = 10? This equation says that if we add 'x' to 'x' we will get 10. And there are a lot of different numbers we could add together to get 10, like 6 and 4. But, if we had the first 'x' stand for 6 and the second 'x' stand for 4, then 'x' would stand for two different value at the same time and things could get really confusing! If you wanted symbols to stand for two different numbers at the same time, you would need to use two different symbols, like 'x' and 'y'. So in Algebra, whenever you see the same symbol repeated more than once in an equation, it's representing the same unknown value. Like if you see a really complicated Algebraic equation (like this), where 'x' is repeated a lot of different times, all of those 'x's stand for the same value, and it will be your job to figure out what that value is. Okay, so for any particular equation, we can't use the same letter to represent two different numbers at the same time, but what about the other way around? Could we use two different letters to represent the same number? Yes! - Here's an example of that. Let's say you have the equation: a + b = 2 What could 'a' and 'b' stand for so that the equation is true? Well, If 'a' was 0 and 'b' was 2, then the equation would be true. Or, we could switch them around. If 'a' was 2 and 'b' was 0, the equation would also be true. But there's another possibility: If 'a' was 1 and 'b' was also 1, that would make the equation true, right? So, even though 'a' and 'b' are different symbols, and would usually be used to represent different numbers, there are times when they might happen to represent the same number. Oh, and this problem can help us understand something very important about how symbols are used in Algebra. Did you notice that there were different possible solution for this equation? In other words, 'b' could have the value 0, 1, or 2 depending on what the value of 'a' was. If 'a' is 0 then 'b' must be 2 If 'a' is 1 then 'b' must be 1 If 'a' is 2 then 'b' must be 0 'b' can't have two different values at the same time, but it's value can change over time if the value of 'a' changes. In Algebra, 'b' is what's called a ""variable"" because it's value can 'vary' or change. In fact, in this equation, both 'a' and 'b' are variables because their values will change depending on the value of each other. Actually, it's really common in Algebra to refer to any letter as a variable, "
,,"since letters can stand for different values in different problems. But at Math Antics, we'll usually just use the word ""variable"" when we're talking about values that can change or vary in the same problem. Alright, so far we've learned that Algebra is a lot like arithmetic, but that in includes unknown values and variables that we can solve for in equations. There's one other really important thing that I want to teach you that will help you understand what's going on in a lot of Algebra "
,,"problems, and it has to do with multiplication. Here are the four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Although in Algebra, you'll usually see division written in fraction form, like this. In Arithmetic, all four operations have the same status, but in Algebra, multiplication get's some special treatment. In Algebra, multiplication is the 'default' operation. That means, if no other arithmetic operation is shown between two symbols, then you can just assume they're being multiplied. The multiplication is 'implied'. For example, instead of writing 'a' times 'b', you can leave out the times symbol and just write 'ab'. Since no operation is shown between these two symbols, you know that you're supposed to multiply 'a' and 'b'. Of course, you can't actually multiply 'a' and "
,,"'b' until you figure out what numbers they stand for. The advantage of this rule about multiplication is that it makes many algebraic equations less cluttered and easier to write down. For example, instead of this: a * b + c * d = 10 You could just write: ab + cd = 10. You can also use this shorthand when you are multiplying a variable and a known number... like 2x, which means the same thing as 2 times 'x' or 3y which means the same thing as 3 times 'y' Since the symbol and the number are "
,,"right next to each other, the multiplication is implied. You don't have to write it down. Finally some good news! Now I never have to write down that pesky multiplication symbol again! Oh yeah!! Ah, not so fast... there are some cases in Algebra where still need to use a multiplication symbol. For example, what if you want to show 2 x 5? If you just get rid of the times symbol and put the '2' right next to the '5', it's going to look like the two-digit number twenty-five, which is NOT the same as 2 x 5. So, whenever you need to show multiplication between two known numbers, you still have to use the times symbol, unless... you use parentheses instead. "
,,"But aren't parentheses used to show grouping in math? How can you use that to show multiplication? Ah, that's a good question. Parentheses are used to group things, "
,,"but whenever you put two groups right next to each other, with no operation between them, guess what operation is implied. Yep!  Multiplication! For example, if you "
,,"see the this, it means that the group (a+b) is being multiplied by the group (x+y). We could put a times symbol between the groups, but we don't have to because it's the default operation in Algebra. The multiplication is just implied. So, going back to our problem: 2 x 5 If you wanted to, you could put each of the numbers inside parentheses like this, and then you could get rid of the multiplication sign. Now this can't be confused with the number twenty-five, and since the groups are right next to each other, you know that you need to multiply them. Of course, it might seem strange to have just one thing inside 'group' symbols like this, but it's okay to do that in math. An alternate way that you could do the same thing would be to put just one of the numbers in parentheses, like this. Again, you won't confuse this with a two-digit number and you know that multiplication is implied. Okay, so we've learned that Algebra is a lot like arithmetic, but it involves unknown values or variables that we need to solve for. And we learned that in Algebra, the multiplication sign is usually not shown, because it's the default operation. You can just assume that two things right next to each other are being multiplied. But why do we even care about Algebra? Is it good for anything in the 'real world'? or is it just a bunch of tricky problems that keep students busy in school? Actually, Algebra is very useful for describing or ""modeling""  things in the real world. It's a little hard to see that when you are just looking at all these numbers and symbols on the page of a math book. But, it's a lot easier to see when you start taking algebraic equations and graphing their solutions. Graphing an equation is like using its different solutions to draw simple lines and curves that can be used to describe and predict things in real life. For example, there's a whole class of equations in Algebra called ""linear"" equations because they form straight lines when you graph them. Those sorts of equations could help you describe the slope of a roof or tell you how long it will take to get somewhere. Another class of algebraic equations, called ""quadratic"" equations can be used to design telescope lenses, or describe how a ball flies through the air, or predict the growth of a population. So Algebra is used all the time in fields like science, engineering, economics and computer programming. And even though you might not need Algebra to get by in your day to "
,,"day life,... ...so divide both sides by 3. That means x = 42. So... in three... two... one... YES!! Alright... now to see how much butter I need. It's still a very useful part of math. Thanks for watching Math Antics,"

,,the factors again come 6 6 times 4 so when you write all the factors of 24 we can start from 1 you can write 2 3 4 6 8 12 and 24 so here you know I mean brackets so 
,,these are all called factors and again when you look at factors we can form another set that's called prime factors what are the prime factors in this set so what are the prime numbers 2 & 3 so I can write if you want prime factors I can write as 2 n 3 don't take 1 as a prime number the lowest prime number is 2 now we'll take algebra expressions now it's 3 how can you write down 3 I can write starting from 1 1 times 3 oh I can write 3 times then what are the factors in 3 I can write number 
,,1 and 3 a + 3 now we'll take 5 a B now try to write down all the factors starting from 1 1 times 5 a B then I can take number 5 then 5 times a B now I can combine with a letter and write 5a times 5a times B oh I can connect be with five and write five B times a then what are the factors in five maybe one five then I can write a 
,,B what is 5a 5b a B and 5e so I can't write factors of five baby all these numbers and expressions now we'll take this one find the common factor of the algebraic expressions a B and a C what is common mean common means belongs to both these expressions we'll try to do separately and see what's the common factor a B so already be is there I can write this - it a times B a B what about AC C is already there I can write a now compare these two what can you see you can see this one is common the common factor is written within the circle so what can you write about the common factor common factor is hey let's take this expression 2 ax + 6 X 5 now you need to be careful you have to take all factors and see what's common now if you take X only that's not the common factor sometimes you need to take two or more factors 
,,we can take X look at these two numbers 2 & 6 2 is common so we can take 2 as well so I can take instead of taking 1 X I can take two weeks out so 2x times either what about 6 X Y I can take 2x + 6 is 2 times 3 and y remain now can you see the common one inside the circle 2x is the common factor now we will take this one 7 XY + 
,,21 X Y Z so when you are trying to find our factors first look at number 7 and 21 what's common 7 is common so we can take 7 then look at carefully the letters X is 
,,there and why is there so we can't write 7 X Y in one part and what's the other one 7 X 1 7 X Y times 1 what about this mark if you take 7 X Y out have you get 21 this is 3z now can you see this one is the common bond for both expressions so what's the common factor 7 X take this one a squared B and a B squared so when you take 
,,this one what's common a letter is common B letter is common so we will take a B when you take a B 1 is remaining there when you take a B 1 B is remaining there so what's the common one common factor is a this one now you get three expressions try to find out the common bond for all three three six nine what's common we know that three is common X is there in all three expressions and Y is not there so we'll take three X out three x times y 3x times then how you get 6 3 times 2 so 2 Z so check again 3 X into 2 Z you get 6x z what about this mod when you take 3 X out to get 9 this is 3 and this is P now we see 3 X is common for all these three expressions that's called a common factor so common factor is 3x now in this one is slightly different so you are getting expressions now try a X plus y so this is one expression so that's a factor so I can write x plus y one expression into a here also X plus y is one expression into B so what's the common one there we can see the common one is this expression so you need to remember when you're trying to factors it can be just a number or letter or expression so I can take X plus y out so that's the common factor take this one X into 2 a plus B Y into 2 a plus B so what's common we'll take this one so I can write to a plus B into X here I can write to a plus 
,,B with what so what's common this is the common part so common factor is to a plus B another one now try a into X minus 2y B into X minus two my so these two expressions are the same so which one is the common you can easily get the common factor so we can see X minus 2y into a and here X minus 2y into B so what's the common one this one is the common you can write X minus 2y is the common factor not the one look at carefully a - to win into five p7q into a - tool five and seven there are no common factors PQ also not common so that means we can take a - to win with 5p here a - to win with 17 so we see this is the common factor this one another question a squared X - 3 1 b squared x - 3 by so a squared B squared no common factors we can write x -3 by into a squad in this one X -3 by into B Square so which one is common so the common factor is this one belongs to both these expressions so I can write X minus 3y is the common factor now we'll look at rules related to factor so 
,,we have to do three rules in this unit so we'll take the first one eliminate the common factor of the algebraic expression X plus a lie now eliminate means taking out so when you take these expressions you can take a letter out a is common so I can write taking a out a and then what's remaining when you take a out X is remaining from this one and the plus sign is there Y is remaining from the other one you can check again multiplying these two you need to get this far into X plus a into y ax plus IVA so we can take a letter out from this so that's the first rule when you get an expression taking one letter out from the expression so rule number one if 
,,there's two expressions like this one letter is common take it out so that's how you factorize now we'll use that rule in these examples look at carefully these two 
,,expressions what's common 7 and 14 a number is common there seven is common when you take seven out what's remaining X is remaining from this one and then the sign comes here 14 you already have taken seven out seven times two so this becomes two what about this one three six what's common P and Q both are not common so three take it out what's remaining P plus 6 you get 3 times 2 so this is 2 Oh cute this one a B a plus AC what's common is common take it out what's the remaining part B plus C look at carefully the next one 3 and minus MN m miss come on take it out 3 minus and here which one is common this common take it out so what you write here so when there's no number here means that's 1 so remember that X means 1 next when you take X out you can write 1 there 1 plus what this one a squared plus a B 1 is common check it out a plus B write down the below algebraic expressions as product of two factors so that means take the common letter or number out from these expressions now you have 3 so you have to do the same thing look at all three expressions and take the common 112 p 8q and for look at the numbers what's the common 1 4 4 8 12 4 is common check it out what's remaining 3 P minus 4 already taken from 8 so that's 2 and here I told you when only one number is there that means 4 times 1 so 4 
,,already taken you get one then this one 20x minus 15y 35 so what's common there 5 is common check it out remaining part you inside 4x3 by and this one m-miss come on take it out the remaining part 7m minus 2 and here and this one only come on take it out a plus B minus C this one eight six three there are no common numbers only 
,,X you can take so 8 X 6 Y and when you take X out that's 3 Z what about this one he is common when you take a out this is a B squared + C squared remain so that's how we factorize when you get three expressions and only one letter or number is common now look at this one write down a 2x + y + 2 b x + y algebraic expression as product of two factors okay we'll take separation in this one a into x plus y so you can write the two factors like this what about this one - b into x + 5 so we can write 2 B into X plus 5 now what's the common factor we can see this is the common bond for both expressions so here you get an expression is common so you can take it out so that's the second rule so in second rule you can take one expression out so what we do when you get a into X plus y 2 B into X plus y this X plus y you can 
,,check it out we can take X plus y out and write down the remaining part inside the other bracket so a plus 2b so that's the second rule so remember that first rule says you can take a letter or number just one here you can take an expression out from the algebraic expressions now we'll try to use that theory in these expressions so eliminate the common factor and write down the below expressions as product of two factors so when you look at these two expressions we can see a minus B is common so make sure that you put brackets and the remaining part also you have to write inside brackets when you take a minus B out this becomes X and this is three bar 
,,so X plus three by this one what's comma the whole expression is common a plus seven is common take it out what's remaining two P Q this one tryna X minus y is common take it out the remaining parties is God plus this one what's common this one is common so 2 plus 7y is common take it out and write down the rim look at carefully this one P minus 2q is common check it out and write down the remaining part 7 M plus N squared this one what's common X minus 3 5x minus 3y take it out and the remaining part 11 a plus 3b insert several questions are there related to that so try to do those M plus n is common what's remaining to be minus 11 Q here also X minus 3y common and 7 plus 8 M is the remaining part always the same here comes so a plus 2b when you take it out what you get x squared plus y squared this is also this 
,,is common to P plus 3 is common take it out and then remaining part you write inside now will look like this one now what happens earlier you got two expressions now you have four expressions so how we do that how we try to find out the common factor when you get four terms so we'll take two at a time we'll take first two separately and the next two separately so I can write in here X plus a I and this one is B X plus B bar then you take this expression what's common is come and take it out and then I can write x plus y there this one B is common I can take it out and write X plus y now try to write down factors so what are the factors of this X plus y and in this one X plus y and so what's the common factor so common factor for both is X plus so here the common factor is X plus y what's the other two terms are the two terms are the end here B now you are learning the third rule what's that when you get four terms you can take two at a time and then factorize again when four 
,,"terms are found take two terms at a time and find a factor so here take these two separately these two separately factorize and then finally you will end up with two expressions again the car take the common factor out X plus y is , take it out and you can write down remaining part as a plus take this question factorize so when "
,,you are factorize you have to take two terms at once so when you take these two take 5 out 5 is comma take it out remaining parties X plus 2 1 now a is common plus say take it out what's remaining X plus 2 1 now X plus 2 y is common take it out and the remaining part that's 5 plus you write in the other bracket this one when you take these 2 is common what's the remaining part B plus C these 2 Plus 3 is comments then B plus C so B plus C is common check it out what's the remaining part a plus 3 now look at this one positive so when you take first 2 a is common take it out what's remaining if last 3 these 2 plus 5 is common take it out you get a plus 3 
,,now a plus 3 is common take it out and the remaining part you write in the other bracket if last high look at this one I'll take this one as negative so when you take these two what's common is common so what's remaining B minus C so here 3 is common which one we need to take plus 3 or negative 3 plus 3 when you take you get the same term B minus C now we can see B minus C is common take it out and the remaining part that's a plus 3 in the other bracket look at this one when you take first 
,,2 is common take it out the remaining part is 3 plus Q now what - so we need to get minus sign out - a it's common so what's remaining 3 plus Q now again 3 plus Q is common take it out q what's remaining B - hey these ones from these two a is common take it out this is X plus minus minus so I can take minus 9 out then this becomes plus inside - x plus becomes minus X plus y into a - this one when you take two at a time is come and take it out a minus 2 there which one is common there what we take minus or plus look at carefully when you take plus X out what's remaining X minus plus 6 out you get a minus 2 so then we can see a minus 2 is common so be careful when you have one positive and one negative sometimes you need to take the minus out sometimes not so in this case you don't need to take - out you can write x + X and then a minus 2 is remained then a minus 2 is common and you can write this as a plus X this one you take these two out so what's common this one I can take 
,,X out l- then this one which one we can take - 7 o + 7 so think about this minus sign in the first place if you take - out you are getting -7 out you are getting ill - f that's what we need not a - L other way around so you have to get the same factor in the first one to factorize further so we can take - 7 out what's remaining 
,,there this is L - so what's common now it'll minus M is common check it out the remaining part is X - so in this one just I have given two expressions just to see you can take either plus or minus sometimes you can just take the positive number sometimes you can take that negative one so here if you take Elm out what's remaining - seven in this one if you take minus M out what should be there - seven right because minus into minus becomes plus seven so when you ask to find out the common factor if you if you take just Ament seven you can't find out common factor so that's why so you need to be tricky so to get plus it can be both - so em if you take em that's seven positive into positive positive button to get the common factor there you need to take minus MN minus seven then we can see minus seven is common so in this one what's the common ones - now the next one find the factors of the following algebraic expressions a X plus B by plus a y plus B X now we discussed when you have four terms you take first two separately and the next two separately but what happens here when you take first two separately you can't see any common factors 
,,what we can do there we can interchange the terms so that we get factors now B by and ax no common term so I can switch this term here and this term there because X 
,,is common there so I'll switch that so first term I can write as it is instead of B by I can take this term here BX then a by and I can write this term there now see whether you can apply the previous rule rule number three when you take these two separate here and these two separately you can see that now X is common take it out and you can write this as a plus B what about this one plus wise they gain a plus now a plus B is come on take it out and write down this as X plus so when you can't factorize the first two what you do interchange the terms so the factors can be found by interchanging terms now here also AP and 6q there are no common terms so 
,,what we do I can take a queue there so write down that AP plus EQ now this term here and six feet already there and I can write 6q last take first two is common check it out then V plus key remain then this one plus six is common take it out and P plus Q is remain then P plus Q take it out and the remaining part is a plus six so that's how we factorize now take this one also three a and B X can you find factors you can't find factor so what you do you interchange these two this so I can rewrite this as 3 a + ax and three b + PX then take us two separately and the last two separate yet factorize what's common there a is common when you take a out 3 plus X is remaining from these 2 B is common three plus six remain no three plus six is common so you can take 3 plus 6 out and write down the remaining factor inside so you'll get 3 plus into a plus B now we need to talk about factors of trinomial quadratic expressions so you're learning three terms trinomial tri means three by means to try means three so something about treat quadratic expression what are cod Hritik expressions have you heard about that this word quadratic means when you get 
,,maximum power is two we call those are contracting expressions so in this expression you get three terms that's why it's trinomial why this is quadratic you get power to so there are three terms to this expression as X square term is there this is a quadratic expression so we are trying to factorize when you get three terms with a square term so when three terms of x squared plus five x plus six are converted to four terms can factorize by taking two at a time so we did three rows what's the third one when you get four terms take two terms at once and factorize but three terms there so if we can't split one term to two you get four terms so that's our 
,,idea how can we factorize trinomials three terms you split into four terms so how you're going to do that so this is the method so step number one is here take first you have to write in order square term first and X term then and the constant term third and what we do we multiply first and the last term's x squared into six what you get 6x squared here the sign is important so plus sign so you need to observe the sign so you are getting plus 6x squared then what you do you are trying to find out factors of 6 X square so we'll first look at the number what are the factors of 6 we know that's 1 into 6 2 into 3 that's all so try to find out the factors and then what you do when you multiply here when you add these two can you get the middle term 1 & 6 both positive so what 4 plus 1 and plus 6 you get plus 7 but the 
,,middle term is plus 5 so you can't take 1 & 6 so what about 2 & 3 2 + 3 you get 5 so first you need to identify when you add the factors are we catching the middle term yes we are getting the middle term by these two factors so that means these are the correct expressions so how can you write 6x squared I can write 2x into 3x not just 2 times 3 you get 6 so 6x squared means 2x times 3x then when you add the factors 2x and 3x you are getting 5 X so what we do when you get quadratic trinomial quadratic expressions you are splitting the middle term into two parts so I can rewrite this as x squared instead of 5x I can write plus 2x + 3 X now we get four terms take two at a time and factorize X is common take it out it's plus two is remaining three is common take it out again X plus two is remaining now X plus two is common take it out so what's what's the remaining part X plus three so what's the step first multiply the first and the last and try to find out all factors and how you select the correct factors when you add the factors you need to get the mediator so here this expression both are pluses all three terms are pluses now we'll look at these expressions now we have to we get same type of questions all positive so how can we factorize rearrange it already they are x squared 7 X term and the constant 12 into x squared 12 x squared what's the sign positive sorry what are the factors of 12 1 into 12 2 into 6 3 into Oh now select the appropriate factors what's 
,,the suitable one to get 7 how can we split 7 1 and 12 can you do that No 2 & 6 you can't because you get 8 3 & 4 so that means you can drive this is 3 x + 4 X so this is the ofoh these are the appropriate factors so 3 X + 4 X so I can split 7 X into 3x + 4 X now take two at a time and Trice when you take X out you get X plus 3 there when you take 4 you get X plus 3 because 4 times 3 12 now X plus 3 is common you take it out then you get X plus now try this one a squared plus 8 a plus 50 so 
,,when you multiply these two you get plus 15 a square so the sign is positive what are the factors of 15 1 15 3 times 5 what is those are the factors now see how you 
,,get the middle term 8 a can we take 1 and 15 no we have to take 3 & 5 because 3 + 5 8 so this is a squared so you need three eight times five ways so these are the two factors appropriate to this one so I can split 8a using that 3 & 5 a take two at a time and factorize is comma and take it out a plus 3 is remaining five and fifteen plus five is comma and take it out and a plus three also remaining then a plus 3 again come on take it out and you can write the remaining part inside brackets so the factors are a plus 3 and a plus now try these ones similar wave all these pluses x squared into 18 18 x squared this is plus what are the factors of 18 always 
,,"start from 1 and C then 2 with 9 3 with 6 those are the factors now select the suitable factors is it 1 and 18 or 2 & 9 Oh three and six which one two one nine two plus nine is so we have to select this one so how can you write 18x squared this is 2 X n 9 X now we'll split the middle term - 2 X + 9 X take two at a time and factorize X's , and take it out that's X plus 2 9 is , and take it out that's X plus No X plus 2 is common what's the remaining part X plus this one amen 14 M squared + 14 40 mm M square factors of 14 one with 42 with 7 those are the factors which one is suitable to get 9 2 & 7 so we can write two women 7 M both positive so I can't split instead of 9m that's 2 M + 7 name now take two at a time and factorize I can take em out and the remaining part inside brackets here 7 out and you get same thing in + 2 M plus 2 when you take it out M plus 7 is remaining these ones now in this one can you see the number first but this is also in order square term then the middle one is there it's just the simple one without the square term and a constant so you can do this way as well no need to rewrite the square term first same thing 16 times P squared plus 16 P Square what are the factors of plus 16 sign is important this is plus 16 plus 16 times plus 1 16 times 1/2 times 8 4 times Oh now which one is suitable for + 4 8 16 and 1 17 so you need to select that select these two factors to 1/8 so this becomes 2 p + 8 P this botha positive now we can split the "
,,middle term to 2p + 8 take two at a time rule number three now when you get four terms take two at a time and factorize take two out - his comments you get 8 + P when you take P out you get 8 plus P okay they need + P take it out you get 2 + now what's the difference you get a negative sign so here positive negative positive what's the earlier one something positive something again positive now what's the pattern here squared term positive the middle term negative and the last term positive now we'll see how we can do when the signs are different the middle term of the expression is now - 7e not +7 e but you follow the same procedure a squared + 12 you get positive 12 a squared so you need positive 12 but when you add the factors you need to get minus 7e so how can you get positive values and when you add you need to get negative values first we'll write down factors factors of 12 1 and 12 to 6 and 3/4 but you can take plus into plus as well but we know that negative times negative is positive so if we put negative money into negative 12 you get positive 12 negative 2 into negative 6 again positive 12 so either you can take both pluses or both minuses in this case you need to take minus value because when you add 3 & 4 you get plus 7 but we need minus 7 so you need to take minus 3 and minus 4 minus 
,,3 minus 4 you get minus 7 so these are the two appropriate factors so yeah you need a square yard.this is 3 and minus 4 now we can split the middle term minus 3 minus 4 plus 12 take two at a time and factorize a a minus 3 know which one we take you can take plus 4 or minus 4 if you take plus 4 what happens you are getting minus 
,,ay inside but we need plus a so always check the previous factor so we need to take minus 4 out to get a here if you take minus our this becomes minus 3 now we get same factor a minus 3 and what's the remaining 1 a minus now we'll apply that in these examples middle term is negative but the last term is positive 12x squared one 
,,and 12 just one factor what are the other factors to with six three with this is plus but the minute term is negative means you need to take both negatives minus eight how you get minus 8 minus 2l minus six so these are the two appropriate factors so you can write 2x + 6 X so split the middle term into - 2 X - 6 x + 2 and take two at a time so when you take X out this is X - 2 which one we take minus 6 or + 6 you need to get positive X inside so we need to take - six out X minus 2 so X - 2 
,,is there X minus 6 this one plus 14y Square 1 and 14 and what are the other factors 2 + 7 that's all middle term is minus 9 definitely we know that both should be - 
,,and to get Y squared this should be both wise so minus 2 y x - 7 y you get 14 y square now split the middle term take two at a time and factorize take Y out the remaining fact Y minus 2 here we have to take minus seven now to get positive y ya then this becomes minus 2 so y minus 2n y minus 7 this one all the terms in order square term then the single term and the constant 16 M square what are the factors 1 and 16 2 with 8 4 & 4 middle term is negative 10 so we have to select the appropriate one so to get M Square and this should be M na minus 2 m and minus 8 mu get minus 10 so you are we are splitting the middle term into 2 minus 2 m minus 8 M plus 16 tape 2 at a time I'm out you get a minus 2 yeah take minus 8 out - - because minus 8n - Joe you get plus 16 M minus 2 there come on what's the remaining 1 - 8 this 
,,one P squared into 30 30 P Square what are the factors of 31 and 32 with 15 3 with 10 can we get 4 no then that's odd what about 6 6 times 5 so that means I can write pi times 6 when you go in order I can write 5 times 6 so those are the factors but the middle term is negative both numbers should be negative what are the suitable want to get 17 - 17 I can take 2 and 15 this boat should be negative this is P and P they are to get P squared now let's play the middle term minus 2p minus 15 B 30 day two at a time now do it take P out what's remaining P minus 2 here which one we take minus 15 you can take to get plus P P minus 2 P minus 2 into P minus 30 now what happens when you get different factors here can you proceed no that means something wrong with your previous step so make sure you need to get the same factor to proceed further this one the constant first and the square term last so you don't need to rearrange it what are the factors of 16 Y square factors of 61 16 to wait for for what are the suitable ones to get minus 10 minus 2 n minus 8 and this becomes Y n Y now I'm splitting the middle term minus 10 by 2 minus 2 y and minus 8y take 2 at a time and factorize what's common there 2 is common and I can write 8 minus 5 in this 1 minus y is common 8 minus y minus into minus is plus now we get same factor so 8 minus y and the other one is too - why some more questions try 21 with y square 21 y square what are the factors of 21 1 with 21 3 with 7 and you the middle term is minus 10 we can't take 1 and 21 so definitely we know these two both mega- and we can write wise as well spread the middle term and factorize by taking two at a time this one you can take 3 out and the remaining part 7 minus y this one you can take Y out are we taking - yr plus y out we need plus 7 so we need to 
,,take minus y out 7 - why Cemil - why is comma and take it out the remaining part is 3 - what this one K squared into 15 so 15 K square factors of 15 1 15 3 5 now we 
,,need to select appropriate factors to get minus 60 so 1 + 15 you get 16 so this both should be negative to get negative 16 here so K squared you get minus 1 KN minus 15 K split the middle term you don't you can write 1 K or without one also correct take two at a time man factorize take K out K minus one is there yeah that's why 
,,it's important to write one if you take K out you are getting one there yeah we can take -15 out the remaining part is K minus one so K minus one is common take it out the remaining part is K minus 15 and also you can multiply and see whether you are getting the previous expression so here K into K likewise you can check with the yawns is correct factors of 48 what are the factors are 48 one with 48 two with 24 three with 16 and 4 with 12 so likewise you can write down factors but no need to write down all if we can find out at once - 19 how we get 19 from these two by ID adding the numbers because we saw that if it's minus and then plus you need both 
,,- so we can select the we can select 3 and 16 as the factors to get 19 both should be - to get + 48 so split the middle term into minus 3h and minus 16 H take 2 at a time when you take it out you get h minus 3 here you need to take -16 out to get plus h then minus 3h minus 3 is common take it out and write X minus H minus 60 factors of 32 now to get minus 18 one with 32 two with 16 here when you are trying to find our factors just see whether you get this number we see that already it's there so you don't need to find all factors we can see 2 and 16 becomes 18 this should be minus 2 MN minus 16 so the factors are -2 ml - 16 M now take two at a time and factorize stick em out you get a minus 2 there when you take -16 out a minus 2 okay now a minus 2 is come on let's take it out and write down the remaining fact that M minus 16 this one you need 19 years squared what are the factors of 1919 is a prime number so in prime numbers you can't find other factors always 1 net itself so 1l 19 we are getting 19 and 120 so both should be negative and this is minus 1 in length - 19 split the middle term into one meal and 19 years take two at a time and factorizes please come and take it out you get L minus 1 it's good to write 1 then you can easily see when you take a lout the remaining part is 1 your 19 - 19 when you take that's ill - 1 so L minus 1 is common take it out L minus 19 is remaining now what's the change the middle term is plus and the last term is negative so 
,,so far what are the things we did we did all terms positive second one we did middle term negative but the last term is positive now we are trying to learn how to factorize when the middle is positive and the last term is negative so same procedure you multiply the first and the last but now you are getting minus 18x squared earlier both cases these two you got plus as the final valid now you are getting minus 18 first without considering the sign what are the factors of 81 and 82 with 9 3 
,,with 6 now just check this is not about adding now because to get minus one number should be positive and the other one should be negative so one positive one negative and the product you get negative and how do you get the middle term now the middle term is +7 positive value if we take plus 9 and minus 2 you can get +7 so in this case when you get a negative on what we do try to try out the factors the bigger number should be positive to get +7 you need plus 9 and minus 9 minus 2 so first 
,,select the appropriate one and put plus father bigger factor so here minus 18x squared is obtained when multiplying the first term and the final term since the middle term is plus 7x the larger factor of both factors must be positive now we can split so to get x squared this should be X and X now I can split 7 X into minus 2 XL 
,,plus 9 X take 2 at a time when you take a South you get X minus to take plus nine out X minus two here we need to take plus because X first that's positive x minus 2 is common take it out and the remaining part we write ya now we'll apply that rule in these examples now we can see the middle term is plus and the last one is negative so when you multiply always you get a negative value so negative 10 a square so factors of 10 110 to 5 and then to get +3 one should be plus and 1 should be negative but the bigger number should be positive so when you select this one this is plus and this is minus plus 5 and minus 2 you are getting plus 3 then this is a so that's how we find out the appropriate factors so a squared minus 2a and +5 it take two at a time and factorize when you franchise you get a minus 2 when you take plus five this is a minus 2 again a minus 2 is common take it out and write V plus 5 next one minus 30 be square factors of minus 31 32 with 15 3 with 10 think about 
,,without writing can you get the middle term 7 plus 7 definitely not with want 1 and 32 with 15 you are not getting 3 with gel you're getting server so we can think about 3n +7 means the bigger number is plus and the smaller one is negative to get B squared both should be peace now we can't split the middle term 2 minus 3b plus 10t Plus 2 and last row separately here we can take me out this one you can take 10 out now B minus 3 is common and here V Plus now try to find out the factors at once -20 C square what are the factors of 21 and 22 with 10 now c2 with tail are we getting it yes so two with 10 the middle term is positive means the bigger number is positive and they're smaller one is negative to get C squared this should be C and C now let's pick the middle term minus 2c plus 10 C minus 20 take two at a time take C out you get to C minus 2 plus 10 out you get C minus 2 then C minus 2 is common what's remaining c plus now here the constant term is first doesn't matter as long as the this term in the middle it's okay you can get this for R term first all last minus 12 P Square middle term is plus 4 think about factors one with 12 2 with 6 2 with 6 you can get 4 so I'm not writing all factors now I'm writing appropriate one to at six but plus four is there this is plus and minus so to get P squared this is PE n now I can't split the middle term okay two at a time and factorize you can take two out you get 6 minus P plus P there are six minus P 6 minus fields come on remaining one plus this one 21 minus K squared minus 21 K squared what's the suitable one to get for one with 21 3 with 7 3 & 7 you are getting 4 so 3 with 7 
,,plus 4 means this is Plus this is minus and to get case come on it should be case now you can do fast you don't need to write down all factors at sea we are you get 
,,plus 4 now take two at a time threes comment there 7 minus k plus K is common and you get 7 minus K so 1 minus K it's comma and take it out you get 3 plus K now what happens in this one the term is also negative and also the constant term is also negative so we'll revise what we did we did oh positive then we did middle term positive negative and the last term positive and the third one we did middle term positive and the last term negative now we are doing middle term negative as well as Laster negative so in this case you got all positive this is a middle term negative this is last term negative now you are getting middle term and last term both are 
,,negative so what we do same procedure when you multiply first and the last you get minus 10 May square this is also minus like previous one factors of minus 10 to get minus 3 think about factors one with chain 2 with 5 2 & 5 relates to 3 so we'll write 2 & 5 now what happens is this is a nd middle term is negative means you need to get the bigger one negative negative 5 and plus 2 you get negative 3 so middle term is negative means select the bigger one negative so he'll say the middle term is negative 3a the larger factor of both factors must be negative so we can use that one to split the middle term C squared minus first we'll write plus to a minus 
,,B minus T here don't think that I can in this one here you can write minus five way first and then write to a you get the same answer so don't worry about which one 
,,to write first you can write any two factors first if you can't see the factors then what you do you can interchange the terms when you take first two you get a that's a plus two minus five common for both so I can take minus five out then you get a plus 2 a plus two is common and you get a minus so in this case also when negative is in the middle term you have to select the larger factor negative now we'll use that one to factorize now straight away we will try to find out the factors without writing all -12 factors of 12 to get 4 1 12 to 6 to 6 you get four middle term is negative means bigger number should be negative this is 6 6 n minus 6 X + 2 X so x squared + 2 X - 6 6 - 12 when you take first 2 you get X X plus 2 when you take - out - 6 6 - 6 out you get X plus X plus 2 X minus 6 this want to get minus 20y 
,,squared the middle term - 8 1 + 22 with 10 to tell you get 8 so 2 + 10 y middle term is negative means the bigger one is negative split the middle term I can write the 10 Y first as well we'll do that it was always I took the smaller one first but you don't need that take first - and you can see why is common when you take 2 out you get Y minus 10y minus 10 is common take it out and write down the remaining factor y + 2 this 1 minus 22 factors of - 22 1 with 22 you are not getting 9 - with 
,,11 to any level you are getting so - with 11 - means in the middle bigger one is - and this is positive so you can write this one and the middle term - 2 Z minus 11 
,,see take two at a time and factorize then you take Z out that's the plus two minus eleven out that's Z plus 2z + 2 is common and you get Z minus eleven this one - 20 M Squared when you mod their first and the last middle term is - it means this is minus one name factors of 21 with 22 with ten and four with five four and five differences one and the middle term is negative means bigger number is negative and this is positive select the middle term and take two at a time and factorize so I'll take four plus four out you get em - but so a minus 5 into M plus 4 this one h squared into - 26 - 26 H square one with 26 - with 13 - and 13 you get 11 this is minus 11 you'd have to take the difference so - for the larger number and this is positive splitting the middle term 2 plus 2 H and minus 13 H ok first two terms you get H comma when you take these two you can take minus 13 out and h plus 2 is common and h minus 13 remaining this one again quadratic me all these are trinomial quadratic expressions three terms and the square term is there - 30 M Squared 1 and 32 with 15 you need - 13 so - with 15 the middle term is negative so the bigger number larger number negative and this one is positive here K squared into 30 not M square so this should be k squared so k k is there now split the middle term K squared 
,,+ 2 k + -15 K then you take first two plus two when you take - 15 now that's K + 2 k plus 2 is common and K minus 15 is remain now look at this one write the following algebraic expressions they're squared terms now slightly different so you have given expressions then you are asked to write as square terms so what can you see about these numbers for 16:9 25 49 64 ol square numbers 2 times 2 4 4 times 4 16 so we can easily write in terms of a square number x squared is already there so for I can write 2 times 2 if I write 2x whole thing squared you get the same thing 2 times 2 for X into X x squared so final answer is 4x squared so this is a square term so this is the expression and you get a square term now try this one 16 P squared how can you write as a square term 16 means 4 times 4 so I can write 4p whole thing square 9m squared 3 m whole thing square 25 is 5 times 5 5h whole thing square 49 7 times 7 7 else whole thing square 64 means a times eight 8k whole thing square 36 6 times 6 6 P squared + 81 means 9 times 9 9 a whole thing's crap now we know how to write down any expression as a square term right as difference between two 
,,squared terms difference means subtraction you have given two expressions and both we need to write as square terms x squared already a square term you can write as 
,,it is minus 4y squared we read that before 4 is 2 times 2 so I can write 2y whole thing square so difference between means this is negative so 2 squared terms with minus sign in the middle in the next one 9 minus a squared 9 how can you write as a square term 3 squared and a squared already yeah this 125 5 squared + 4 a squared 
,,4 is 2 times 2 so I can write 2 a whole thing square this 116 4 times 4 so this is 4 8 whole thing squared + 9 is 3 and 3 so 3 B whole thing's 81 9 times 9 9 X whole thing squared 49 means 7 into 7 7 y whole thing square 36 means 6 times 6 right like this and 121 is can you remember square terms square numbers 11 times 11 seventh one a squared B squared I can write a B whole things got 64 times 4 so 4 squared x squared is also square so I can write as it is and 144 is 12 times 12 12 square 
,,this one 4 is 2 times 2 so I can drive to Y whole thing square 81 is 9 times 9 16 again a square number 4 times 4 169 so you need to know square terms 2 times 2 4 3 
,,times 3 9 4 times 4 16 so like that 169 is 13 times 13 13 Q squared so in this one we did writing any expression in terms of difference between two squared terms now look at this one find the factors of the difference between two squared terms now you have given this one a square term is they are in a constant term what's missing when you compare with trinomials we got three terms one a squared and the next one should be hater now nothing means you can take the middle term as zero so we can rewrite this question as a squared plus 0 a minus four and proceed as before like factorizing trinomials will do that a times minus four minus four square a square 
,,factors of -4 and the middle term is 0 so 2 well 2 2 a and 2 way but both are the same so one is positive and one is negative when you add you are getting 0 a now we will try to split that 0 you can write plus 2 a and minus 2 a and when you take the first 2 separately you get a plus 2 and here are negative sign and 2 is common a plus 2 then a plus 2 come on you get a minus 2 so this is a long process when now you have two terms but when you are trying with zero term in the middle it takes time so what we can do we can find out an easy way so I'll explain when you get two terms how we can factorize now we'll take the same question a squared minus 4 here a squared term and here 4 is also square term now can you see that we can rewrite this as 2 squared difference between two squared terms so a squared + 2 squared so when you get two squared terms what we do we can write two factors like this and think about how you get a squared that's a and a how you get 4 that's 2 and 2 so you write down the factors and one factor is positive and one factor is negative so that's really easy when you get two terms and both terms are square terms so what you call that difference between two squared terms when you get difference between two squared terms you can write the first one here and the last one for you get to 
,,enter so this number so when you write down the square term these two comes yeah and one is minus and the other one is positive now we can factorize all these using 
,,difference between two squared terms 16 first you have to write as a square term 16 is 4 times 4 so I can write as 4 square what's the next step then put two brackets x squared is X and X this is 4 and 4 one is positive and one is negative so you can switch this factor first and this one last so one factor is always positive and the other one is negative so in this one 49 you can write 7 squared so what are the factors why why this is -7 + +7 this one 36 you can write 6 squared so 6 first and then P so what are the factors 6 minus PN 6 plus B now try to factorize using difference between two square terms first thing you have to write a square terms 7a 
,,whole thing square R and 5b whole things well then easy you write 787 in first and the second term is 5 B 1 is negative and one is positive this one 81 9x whole thing squared 49 7y whole thing square now write down the 2 well it's 9x here and seven by one is positive and one is negative this one try 144 12x whole thing square twelve times twelve hundred forty four five and five twenty five how do you write down the factors with two brackets first term here and then last term here and one is positive other one is negative now it's easy two terms you can end both are square terms if both are square terms you can apply this not for all factorization 11y whole things crash then you can straight away write 9x and then other term is eleven by one is positive and the other one is negative some more questions a squared B 
,,squared I can write a B whole thing square 25 five C squared so when you take the difference a B first and five C next one means positive one is negative this one 121 is 11 P whole thing square 49 is 7 Q whole thing square so how you write down the factors p 7q one is positive and a other one is negative what about this one right as a square term 4x whole thing squared and 13 my whole thing squared right down the tube records first term first and the last second one is positive one is negative here also write as a square term a B whole thing square and C D whole thing square one is positive one is negative so here we use difference between two squared 
,,terms now what happens can you write down this as a square term - a square - is not a square number what we do there when you get something like this with two numbers we can take the common one out so eliminate the common factor two first then what you get when you eliminate that one so we will take the same question I'm taking 
,,two out two is common a squared - 25 now but we know 25 is a square number now we can use difference between two squared terms I can rewrite this as a squared and five squares now - is there what are the factors of this a a here five five one is positive and one is negative so it's easy when you get extra term try to eliminate that and then think about applying difference between two square terms in this one what's common I can see a you can take it out then you get a squared - 49 both these are squared numbers you can apply difference between two squared terms I can write this one as plus 7 n minus 7 now try to factorize these ones you can take the common term out I can take 4 out what's remaining 25 y squared and here for is there I can write what's the before that I'll write down there when you take 4 out I can write this as a square term so 25 5 into 5 so 5 by whole things square now write down the factors X X X is the term I don't take the square term 5 by is the other term then this is plus and this is negative in this one what's common I can take 4 out when you take four that's 4 a squared minus 4 times 9 9 B squared now 4 & 9 both are square terms I can write this is as to a whole thing squared and this one has 3 B whole thing squared then take the difference between two squared terms for is or we they are the two factors are two we plus 3 B and 2a minus 3b so you have to do this step to identify the factors so you have to write down square terms and then we take these two terms this one X is common take it out 4x squared minus 9 y squared and then write as a square term 2x whole thing squared and 3 by whole things square then apply difference between two square terms 2x + 3 y + 2 X - 3 well how we do this one right as a square term I can write this one as a square squared whole thing square B 4 how can you write B squared whole things square now apply difference between two squared terms a squared plus B squared and a squared minus B Square can you factorize further plus one we can't when you get to square term with plus we don't know how to factorize but we know the difference between two square terms that that means when you get square terms with minors we know how to factorize so you can factorize a squared plus B squared here again you can factorize one is 
,,positive the other one is negative so in your plus billion a minus B so if you do up to this point you are getting half marks so you need to factorize completely find the value using factor knowledge look at these two 7.5 is common take it out what's remaining 2.7 and 7.3 now we can simplify inside brackets so 7.5 times addition of these two numbers 7 + 3 10 7 + 2 9 and 10 so you get to just multiply this by 10 it's easy move the decimal place one place to right so you like 75 as it what about this one look at carefully 9.3 is common check it out what's remaining three-putt 9.3 so this is three point five and six point no add these two you get ten one 
,,remaining 6 plus 3 8 6 plus 3 9 9 plus 1 again just multiply by 10 nine point three times ten nice now using factorization method you can find out values otherwise you have to multiply all these decimals and then add it so which one is easy use this method again twelve point five is common take it out what's remaining twelve point five and here minus two point five now the subtraction so what's 12 point five minus two point five you get ten so ten times twelve point five you move one place 
,,to the right the answer is hundred twenty-five this one you get two squared terms apply the difference between two squared terms one means plus and the other one is 
,,"negative when you add these two get fifty then what about this one when you subtract you get four four times 50 that's two hundred so it's easy to apply the difference between two squared terms to find the answers this one difference between two squared terms so I can write one factor positive one factor negative so when you add these two you get 200 what's the subtraction you get 6 so 6 times 200,000 200 in this one also you get difference between two squared terms so one is positive one is negative then when you add these two you get 10 multiplied when you subtract you get five five times ten Yonsei is 50 look at this one now you get how many expressions one two three four what's that rule number three when you get four expressions take two at a time and factorize these two we'll check what's the common 12.3 is "
,,calm take it out what's remaining four point five and five point five when you take class to seven point seven is common you get four point five and five point five 
,,now when you add what you get two point three yeah this is same four point five plus five point five you get ten you know also you get 10 now we see ten is comma and check it out what's remaining 20.3 yen seven point seven now when you add these two what you 7 + 3 10 and 10 again 10 times 10 you get 100 so as there are four terms take two terms at a time and factors this one how many terms are there 1 2 or 3 4 so we'll follow the same procedure we'll take these two and these 28.7 is common 
,,"take it out what's remaining 4.6 l 5 points from this you can take 1.3 out what's remaining four point six and five point four no and these two 6 plus 4 10 five plus four so you get 10 here what about this one same thing so you get 10 now two expressions 10 is common take it out what's remaining eight point seven and one point three so 10 times what's the addition 10 times 10 you get now we'll look at review exercise in your textbook so you need to know how to factorize expressions just normal expressions and then we did trinomials and then difference between two squared terms right each of the following algebraic expressions as a product of factors so you have to take the common term out L write down the remaining part inside brackets what's common here 8 and 12 will see 4 is common take it out remaining part you write insult this one 9 and 18 9 is , take it out remaining part a plus 2y inside brackets 3 M plus 6 3 is common take it out so 6 is 3 times 2 so you get M plus 2 "
,,20 and 30 10 is common to a minus 3b this one for his comma P minus 5 5 Q so 4 times 5 you get minus 24 times minus 5 you get minus twenty twelve and four I can take fallout 3 - ok this one no three expressions three terms are they are so C common for all three three is common take it out the remaining part you write inside brackets 3 times 5 you get 5 B 3 times 12 minus 8 4 4 is common 3 8 minus 2 B plus 1 because I can write this one as 4 times 1 9 minus 3 minus 6 3 is common 3 minus B minus 2 C so you get 9 minus 3b minus 6 see these two you can take forward or minus 4 does not matter you can take any term so I look like I can take 4 out you get minus 3x inside plus y all I can't change the terms and write down by minus 3x same answer - - both they are that means common for both - for we'll take it out then you get this one in plus P this one which one we can take either minus or plus we take minus three out if you take minus 3 this becomes positive - - because - - you get positive take a out remaining part B plus C you can take P out and then not P there what's the value here one because just P means 1 P 1 minus Q 3 terms are there a is common take it out b + c - take this 1 3 you can take it out and also x is common so we can take 3x out so what's remaining this becomes 1 plus 2 what what about this one B is command + 3 so 3 B you can take it out you can write 2 a minus 3 C multiply and see whether you get the term 3 B 2 minus 3 C you get minus 9 PC here for P you can take it out for P that means a plus B minus 1 because 4 P when you take it out one is remaining in this one you can take X out you get x squared + 2 em 
,,you can take it out 3-2 in in remaining this one six is also common is also common I can take six six out six is out that means one - two 1s and one T example number one factorize 3x plus 6y plus KX plus 2k y four terms what's the method take two at a time and factorize from these two I can take three out you get X plus 2y from 
,,these two I can take plus K out X plus two now we see X plus 2y is common and then the remaining part you write inside brackets example number two similar way four terms you can take first two and last two separately if you take this one you can take a out so a minus three is there when you take B out a minus three there so a minus three is common what's remaining a plus B example number three see a method X is comma and take it out you get X plus y now what happens both - you can take - one out because XY only one is common take one out you get X plus one X plus y and the remaining part X minus one exercise six point one factorize each of the following algebraic expressions of so you get four terms take two at a time he's common you get X plus y last three is common X plus y so X plus YN EI plus three nice two is common you get X minus eight here plus three is common then you get X minus eight so X minus eight ten a plus three what about these two Emmys come on take it out you get P minus Q minus n so which one we take - a no plus in you need positive P so we'll take minus n P minus Q P minus Q and a - this one which one is common in his common take it out get K Plus both negative you can take negative B out k plus L you are getting so k plus L is comment and the remaining part is B minus P this one take two at a time and factorize X take it out you'll get X plus four when you take minus three Y out that's X plus four again X plus four is common remaining part you write separately this one when you take these two Y is come and take it out Y minus 7 so in this one do we take minus 2 or plus 2 you take minus 2 to get positive by inside this becomes minus because minus minus becomes so y minus 7 and y minus 2 this one again take two at a time and see whether you can factorize here is comma and take it out this one too is common you get same thing a minus eight and plus two this one B you can check it out B plus 5 minus - you can take minus 2 out you get positive here because positive into negative is negative so B plus 5 and B minus 2 this one okay two at a time and factorize here or so two at a time and actress this one 5 is comma take it out when you take five this is one one plus six here minus y will take it out then this becomes 1 plus X 1 plus X n PI - what this one when you take a out X minus 1 here to get plus X will take minus one out X minus one again minus minus plus six minus one and a minus an example number one now this is these are trinomial quadratics have you factorize multiply the first and the last you get plus 6x squared and try to factorize plus 6x squared and when you add the factors you need to get plus five six one six two and three two three you are getting fine so 2x and 3x are the appropriate factors so you can split the middle term to 2x and 3x now we can take three at a time and factorize you get X plus 2 here when you take 3 out you get X plus 2 X plus 2 is common for both take it out and 
,,write X plus 3 as the other factor this one middle term is negative and the other one is positive so what you do when you find out the factors the larger factor should be negative so we'll try to find out positive 12x squared and find out the factor so that the difference is minus 8 or the addition tell me this is the second part we did this is minus this is plus means both the factors are negative so here find both negative factors to get positive 12x squared so what are the suitable factors 6l 2 so 6 & 2 you get minus 6x + -2 X now we'll split the middle term and take 2 at a time and factorize so here you can take minus 2 out and write X minus 6 so X minus 6 is common what's remaining X minus 2 example number 3 now the middle term is positive and their last term is negative then what we do now you are getting the difference when you take the difference you need to get plus 2 that means larger factor is positive so we'll do multiply these two you get my knee minus 15y squared find out the factors of -15 the difference is +2 15 is 5 & 3 so this positive the bigger one should be positive so this is plus and this is minus so I can write the middle term as plus 5i + -3 bar take two at a time and but right here I can take minus 3 out this becomes y plus 5 Plus 5 is common you get Y minus 3 example number 4 both negative so what's the situation both negative means when you multiply you're getting negative and the difference is minus 1 so the bigger number the bigger factor is negative here so what are the suitable factors to get minus 1 5 & 4 bigger one should be negative - 5 en plus boy now I split the middle term take two at 
,,a time I can't take +4 out now we see a minus 5 is common and the remaining part you right here exercise six-point tuna factorize the quadratic expressions given below so now we will try to do at once + + means the addition comes here so we can write 18x squared factors of 18 to get 9 6 & 3 so 6 X set 3xo split the middle term and take two at a time and factorize now see we are getting the same factor if something happens that means you are not getting the same so you have to go back and check again this one plus 30 by square factors of 30 to get 11 6 & 5 the buta pluses split the middle term into ante two at a time and now see what factors are the same here by plus six are there that's common take it out and remaining part you write inside the bracket this is also positive positive 24 a square factors of 24 to get 10 6l when you are doing sums you can easily get the factors correct factors at one six and Oh both positive we split the middle term and Factor s plus 6 here when you take plus 4 plus 6a plus 6 is common and the remaining part you right here this one 15 so you get 15 B squared when you multiply plus 15 B squared what are the 
,,factors of plus 15 to get minus 8 so minus 8 means both factors are negative both factors negative means 5 and 3 B minus 5b so you can get minus 3b minus 5b that's 50 take two at a time and factorize minus minus plus so B minus 3 is come and you get me - this one middle one negative last one positive me same thing so 6 6 square 
,,and the factors this is negative middle term is negative so that means both negative factors so you can't get 6 and one because you get minus 6 and minus 1 minus 7 so 3 & 2 both are the appropriate factors now split the middle term and fat rice X is common and here 2 is common minus minus plus X minus 3x minus 2 this 1 plus 20 and middle term is minus 12 so plus 20 M square factors of plus 20 but the middle term is negative means both negative what are the factors 10 + 2 4 & 5 you're not getting 10 + 2 10 and 2 both negatives you get 12 so M squared minus 10 name - 2 wim plus 20 so take two at a time and factorize when you take minus 2 world you get minus here and M minus 10 and if minus 2 oh you can do at once this one different last term is negative means one factor is positive and the other factor is negative so you need to get one here so one here means this one the larger factor is positive so how do you get larger factor positive so that means minus 12 what are the factors 6 & 2 it doesn't work for 1 3 so larger factor should be positive so you get me to the top Bonnie that means for a minus 3 then you take two at a time - 3 out you get a plus 4 gate take a plus 4 out you are getting a minus 3 now the next one - 24 P squared when you multiply last term negative means the larger factor is positive but the middle term is positive 24 8 times 3 so this is plus and this is minus then only you get plus 5p so P squared + 8 P minus 3 P minus 24 take two at a time and you take P out that's this minus 3 out you get P plus 8 so P + 8 + P minus 3 this one last term is negative when you multiply you get 16 we are what are the factors middle term is plus means the larger factor is positive 16 is a 10 choose larger factor is positive there is positive 8 and negative 2 P split them at middle term 8 P minus 2 P minus 16 state two at a time and factorize you get B plus 8 and B minus 2 this one same thing final value is negative means one is positive and one 
,,is negative how we find this is one factors of 12 4 & 3 middle term is negative means larger one is negative and the other one is positive in fact right so you write the middle term in terms of minus 4 L plus 3 and take first 2 separately and the last 2 separately so you get X here X minus 4 when you take +3 out what's remaining you get X minus 4 so X minus 4 is common take it out and the remaining part is X plus 3 this one last number is negative means you take the difference minus 40 a square the middle term 40 is 8 times 5 always think about the middle term and try to find out the correct factors 8 and 5 middle term is minus means the bigger one is 
,,negative now split the middle term into minus 80 that's five you take two at a time and factorize a minus eight e minus 8 is comma and the remaining part is a plus this is also same negative 10 our square factors of negative 10 that means we have to take the difference 10 means 5 and 2 middle term is negative means negative 5 r+ 500 splitting the middle term take two at a time you can take plus 2 out - hi then R minus 5 is common you get R plus 2 as their other factor this one both positive so that's easy plus 9y square R that means addition when you add the factors you are getting plus 6 what are the factors 3 + 3 so you get 3 by n 3 Y so Y squared is plus would pluses Y squared + 3 y + 3 y + 9 and take two at a time you get y plus 3 when you take 3 out that's also y + 3 now y plus 3 is common you get y plus 3 so you can write instead of this y plus 3 squared doesn't matter either you can keep like this or write as a square term this one positive as a middle term is negative so what's the condition both factors are negative 25 what are the factors five and five but both are negative so K squared - 5 K minus 5 K was 25 Dave two at a time and factorize you can take minus five out because you need plus K inside no okay - five again K minus five you can write as a square term this one four plus four X 
,,plus X square same things now so x squared meter term is plus means both pluses so plus 2 X n plus 2 X split the middle term 2 + 2 X + + 2 X and then take two at a time what's common to is commas 2 plus X and here also X is comma 2 plus X now 2 plus X is common and the remaining one is also 2 plus X I can write this one as a square term like this when you multiply you get positive 36 x squared middle term is plus 15 so that means addition what are the factors to get plus 15 12 + 3 + 3 15 so this is positive and this is also positive now split the middle term - 12 X + 3 X and you can take 12 out 3 + X when you take X out 3 + + X again now 3 + 6 come on 
,,take it out you get 12 plus X for the next factor this one middle term is negative this the constant term is positive what it means both factors are negative what are the factors that means addition we have to think about adding the two factors you need to get 11 36 and high but both factors are negative because the middle term 
,,is negative now split the middle term when you take two at a time 6 is common and a is common I'll take - a out because I need plus five minus a ok so five minus a is common for both and the remaining one is six minus a this one last one is positive and the middle term is negative that means both the factors are negative so what are the factors of plus 54 think about it 9 + 6 6 + 9 54 and when you add 6 plus 9 you get 15 so 9 and 6 but middle term is negative means both negative so we can split the middle term like this fat rice so you get 9 out 9 times 6 so you get here why when you take minus y out 6 minus y so 6 minus y is common take it out and raining part 9 - Wow example number one now you get two terms and we did difference between two square terms we can see 25 is a square number so write this number as a 
,,square term then how we write down the factors we write X and X to get x squared 5 and 5 to get 5 squared and 1 factor is positive and the other factor is negative this one again difference between two squared terms I can write 9 as 3 square then you can straight away apply difference between two square terms one is positive and one means negative example number three two terms so again same thing how can I write Phi l squared as a square term I can write to a whole thing square 49 seven squared difference between two squared terms two ways one term and the other one is seven one is positive one is negative here one is there is one a square number yes 
,,we can write 1 square is 4 P squared I can write to bead whole thing squared so this is difference between two squared terms so you can write down the two factors one is the first term 2 B is the second term one factor is positive the other factor is negative example number five so fact rise 2 x squared minus 72 now can you write as a square number 2 is not a square number so if that means first you need to find out the common factor for both you can take two out and right this is 36 now 36 is a square number so you can write as difference between two squared terms so I can write two factors one is X mine +6 and the other one is X minus six now find the value so you can use difference between two squared terms so what are the two factors one term is 33 the other one is seventy one factor is positive one factor is 
,,negative what's this value 50 50 times what's the difference difference is 6 plus 7 13 so 16 50 times 16 so take 0 and multiply by 5 5 times 6 33 remaining 5 times 1 5 5 + 3 8 so the answer is 800 example number 7 you get fractions but don't worry you can write it as a square term how can I write this fraction as a square term I can write x over 2 whole thing square once is a square number 9 you can write 3 square then this is difference between two squared terms so what are the factors you can write x over 2 minus 1 over 3 or x over 2 plus example 8 1 minus so I can write 1 squared 4 1 how can I write this one as a square term 3x over 4 whole thing squared because 16 is 4 times 4 and 9 is 3 times 3 difference between two squared terms one one the other term is 3x over for one term is positive one term is negative exercise 6.3 factorize the expressions given below so all these are difference between two square tiles hundred is 10 square so you can write one is positive and the other one is negative again this one right as a square that's six squared one factor is positive and the other factor is negative what about this one 9 squared is 
,,81 we can write as one factor positive the other factor negative here 4 + B squared 4 I can write 2 squared apply difference between two square terms one factor positive the factor negative this one four squared and a square one factor is positive and the other factor is negative you can write the negative 1 first as well 64 is 
,,8 squared when you write down the two factors you get this one is positive the other one is negative all these are two terms and we can see square terms will try to 
,,factorize here already this one is a square term this one you have to rewrite as a square term like this now apply the factor rule one factor is positive the other factor is negative this one you have to write both as a square term first and write down one factor positive the other one negative hundred this is square number I can write an X whole thing squared + 1 s1 square so what are the factors 10 X plus 1 and X minus 1 here 25 is 5 square this is already there so what are the factors 5m + n 5m - 49 is 7 square a t-bar you can write 9p whole thing square after you write down as a square term only you can write down the factors so 7 + 9 p 7 - 9 P this one I can't write 5 a bead whole thing square this is 3c whole thing square now write down 5 a b +3 c 5a b minus 3 c miscellaneous exercise factorize the following algebraic expressions by changing the order in which the terms appear as required yeah because we can't factorize these two so we need to change will change these two X minus BX minus a y plus B Y now take two at a time X out you get a minus B here I can take minus y out eight minus B your - - here plus a minus B is common you 
,,get X minus y as the other factor now look at this one what can you see yeah like terms are there so you don't need to take two terms apparel here but rice here first will simplify 9 P plus 3 P 12 P these two you get minus 8 Q now fact rice two expressions take the common term out for is come and take it out you get 3p minus 2q 
,,now we'll take this one you get trinomial quadratic expression but the order is not correct we need square term we need this one the middle term and here I'll rewrite this as square term first and X term and then the constant now multiply these 2 you get negative 12x squared find the factors of minus 12x squared to get plus one 
,,last one is negative means we take the difference difference is plus one so the larger factor is positive what are the factors four and three larger factor is positive means this is plus four and minus three now split the middle term you get this tail two at a time and here minus three out you get X plus four X minus 3 this one 
,,is the order correct no so constant term I can take this one a square term last and the middle term minus 3 K now when you multiply first and last you get minus o K 
,,square meter term is negative means the larger factor is negative so 4 times 1 and we take the difference so minus 4 n plus 1 so 4 minus 4 K plus 1 K minus K squared now take two at a time take 4 out you give 1 minus K when you take K out this is also 1 minus K so 1 minus K is come on you can write down o plus K as the other factor question number 2 factorize the following algebraic expressions two terms are there so T is not a square number so we'll take the common factor out what's the common factor to take it out so you get 4x squared minus 25 now 25 and 4 both are squared numbers I can rewrite as a square times 5 squared is 25 now I can write down 
,,the 2 factors as 2 X is the first term 5 is the other 1 is positive the other one is negative this one 3 I can take it out what's in answer here keep on now 81 is a 
,,square number that's 9 square now you can write down as difference between two squared terms X minus 9 and X plus 9 this one take the common term out is common I can it be is common for that common so what's remaining is squared B squared here one is remaining no I can write this one as a B whole thing squared + 1 square 1 squared is 1 now apply difference between two squared terms a B plus one a B this one you can take three out one minus four Q square now you can apply difference between 
,,"two square terms 1 squared is 1 - Q whole thing squared is 4 Q squared now write down the two factors 1 plus 2 Q 1 minus 2 Q find the value so we can use factorization to find these values because all these are square terms so we'll apply the formula difference between two square terms one means positive one is negative 23 + 3 26 here you get 20 put 0 and x - 2 times 6 12 2 times 2 4 + 1 5 here 45 + 5 + 45 - 5 are the factors 45 + 5 is 50 45 minus 5 is 40 so when you multiply you get 2,000 "
,,this 102 squared - 2 square so you can use difference between two squared terms hundred - plus 200 - - - you get 104 here here you get hundred it's easy to multiply 
,,by hundred move two places to the right so with two zeros yeah so ten thousand four hundred fourth one join each algebraic expression in column a with product off its factors in column B so we need to do separate here and find out the answer from the right hand side so we'll take the first one x squared minus X minus 6 this means one last term - means you need to get one plus and one minus middle term is - means the bigger factor is - so what are the factors last six x squared 3 n - bigger 
,,"one is - so I can write x squared - x will put 1 X so I can split the middle term 2 - 3 X and + 2 X and take two at a time get X - 3 when you take + 2 out that's X minus 3 so X minus 3 is common the other factor is x + 2 X - 3 and X plus 2 this one this one four terms so we take two at a time take two at a time X is , take it out here minus 3 is comma and take it off so what are the factors x + 5 + X - 3 yeah you get here this one two terms you can take common terms out first 2x is common when you take that you get x squared minus 4 now our difference between two squared terms so 2x is there you can write 4 as 2 squared now apply difference between two squared terms you get X plus 2 and X minus 2 where's that here so I can connect here the other one 4x squared minus 9 m squared I can rewrite as square terms 2x whole thing squared + 3 M square what are the factors to X plus 3 m 2x minus 3 where's there yeah definitely the other one is this one but this is the fraction yeah x squared over 25 you can write it as a square term x over 5 so x over 5 I'll do it here thing squared + 1 square now x over 5 plus 1 and x over 5 minus 1 it's already "
,,there so we did all so all answers are okay so we complete all factorization methods related to your textbook so what are they we did when you get common factor you 
,,can take it out that's rule number one sometimes you get expression as a commenter that's rule number two and when you have four terms you take two terms that factorize and then we did factorization trinomial quadratics and difference between two squared terms so practice with all these example and exercises to improve your knowledge in factorization

AlgebraicExpression,nn_6exr-ShA,in this video you will cover algebraic expressions a topic covered in class 8 math okay moving on let's understand what an expression is to begin with an expression 
,,is nothing but a combination of variables and constants of one or more terms and what does that mean so lets it that's better understood with an example like you see on the right side we have an expression for X square minus 5y plus 10 it has three terms the terms being for X square being the first term minus 5y being the second term and +10 being the third term and a term is nothing but a part of the expression that is separated by the plus or minus signs so for X square minus 5y and plus 
,,10 these become the three terms of the expression for x squared minus 5y plus 10 for instance if you had an expression of the form a minus 4b plus 5c then a would be one term minus 4b would be the second term and plus 5c would be the third term easy enough digging in further we need to understand what a coefficient is what are like terms and what are constants let's look at this expression here for X square minus 5y plus 2 a B minus 4 B a and minus 10 so again we have five terms right or x 
,,squared minus 5 y plus 2 a B minus 4 B a minus 10 so in this example the coefficients would be 4 minus 5 plus 2 and minus 4 let's take a look at what like terms are 
,,like terms are the terms with the same variables raised to the same power now here which are the same variables raised to the same power we see a b and b 8 right these are the same variables and they are raised to the same power a is raised to the power 1 b is raised to the power 1 same goes here b is raised to the power 1 and a is raised to the far one that makes two a B and minus 4 B a like terms and constants are nothing but terms without any variables associated with them so my understand becomes a constant in this scenario now let's understand different types of algebraic expressions we have what are called monomials binomials trinomials polynomials sounds pretty easy based on the name of each cuz mono means one by means to try corresponds to three poly corresponds to multiple right so in the similar fashion 
,,the description is also associated with the same meaning so monomial means an algebraic expression comprising of one nonzero term for example 7a is an example of a monomial 3x square is an example of a monomial because it comes each comprises of one nonzero term similarly a binomial consists of two nonzero terms same way we have seven plus five be three X minus four X Y cube each consists of two terms right two nonzero terms seven being one of them five B being the second term in the first 
,,expression the second expression we have three X being the first term and minus four X Y cube being the second term a trinomial comprised of three nonzero terms so in this example these two examples consists of three terms that makes each of them a trinomial and a polynomial consists of one two or more nonzero terms so a monomial is a also a final polynomial a binomial is also considered a polynomial and a trinomial is also considered a subset of a polynomial so in this example three x squared would be a polynomial 3x minus 4 XY cubed would be considered a polynomial all of these would be considered polynomial because by definition a polynomial can serve one two or more nonzero terms all right moving so let's take a look at how we add and subtract polynomials let's take a look at the example given here we're trying to add two expressions here for X cubed plus or 5y minus 10 and 5 X square Y minus 15 minus 6 X cube minus 2 y so if what we have to do here is that we add the where we group the like terms together and each of these expressions we figure out which other like terms right we notice that 4x cubed and minus 6x cubed are like terms similarly 5y and minus 2y electrum so we group them together and then we form the addition that gives us the result which is -2 X cubed plus 5 X square y plus 3y minus 25 similarly we have a little variation in the question here where we've been asked what must be subtracted from 5x minus 6 X cubed minus 10 to give this result which is 4 X cubed plus 12 so it's nothing but saying what must be subtracted from a if you consider this to be a to give C so it's nothing but saying a minus B equals C so what is B right so B becomes a minus C so if this was a and this was C we subtract 4x cubed plus 12 from - from 5x - 6 X cubed minus 10 so of course we changed the signs of 4x cubed + 12 that makes it minus 4x u minus 12 and that's the result which is minus 10x cubed minus 5x minus 22 and that's the answer now moving on let's take a look at how to multiply polynomials so we have an example given here for a minus 1 times minus 2 a plus 7 so what we have to do is we take each term of the first expression and we multiply it with each term of the second expression so we take four a and multiply it with minus 2 a plus seven and then the second second term which is minus one and multiply it with minus 2 a plus seven so that's how we open the brackets solve them that gives us minus eighty square because for a times minus 2 e is minus 80 square and then plus 28 a plus 2 we because minus 1 minus 2 acre just last way minus 7 and that's the answer which is minus 8a squared plus 38 minus 7 here's another example we've been given the base and height of triangle in terms of expressions as minus 4 X plus y and X minus 3 y applying the formula 
,,for triangle which is 1/2 base times a height we inject and the expressions that we've been provided we simplify it to get this answer which is nothing but half times a multiplying the each of the terms of the first expression with the second expression and that gives your area in square units easy enough and then last but not the least we look at how to divide polynomials so one thing you need to remember is that when we divide terms with the same bases we subtract the exponents if you haven't seen one of my other videos you may want to take a look at it which talks more about about X powers and exponents and come in handy for this particular slide okay so we have to simplify this expression here which is 40 a square B minus 16 a B square plus 24 a cubed b cubed which is the expression and they've asked us to divide by 8 a B so what we have to do is when you are subdividing two expressions and dividing an expression by one term that term gets divided by each of the associated terms of the numerator so it becomes 40 a square B divided by 8 AP - 16 a B Square minus 8 a couple divided by eight a B plus 24 a QB cube divided by 8 a B and then now when you divide a square B divided by a B that is nothing but b and b cancel out a square divided by a gives us a that gives us 5 a because 40 divided by 8 is 
,,5 16 by 8 is 2 a B squared divided by a B gives us B and then 24 a cubed b cubed divided by 8 a B is nothing but 24 by 8 is 3 a cube by a is a 3 a raised to the power 3 minus 1 by applying this rule where we subtract the exponents and that gives you a final answer which is fine 8 minus 2 B plus 3 a square B Square that's a folks keep on solving additional examples and you will be an expert at all the normals as well please subscribe to my channel and keep watching and sharing and liking these videos appreciate your inputs and thoughts and comments thanks so much see you soon

AlgebraicExpression,49G43UkVvEM,hello grade eight children today I'm here to teach you chapter seven in your textbook that's called factors so in this lesson we'll look at what our highest common factor look at number fifteen and see what are the factors how can you write down fifteen as a product of two numbers I can write 51 times 15 again 3 times 5 or 5 times 3 same thing so these are called these numbers are called factors if a number can be written as a product of two whole numbers numbers are called factors so what 
,,are the factors of number 15 1 3 5 and 15 now we'll take another example 24 what are the factors we can write 1 times 24 2 times you divide by 2 and see what's they 
,,are the factor 24 divided by 2 you get 12 so 2 times 12 3 times 8 4 times 6 again 6 times 4 8 times 3 so these are the numbers we call factors for 24 so what are the factors 1 2 3 4 6 8 12 24 now we'll take another 136 write down all factors of 36 so you can start from 1 1 times 36 divided by 2 you get 82 times 18 36 divided by 
,,3 and C you get 12 divided by 4 that's 9 6 times 6 36 so what are the factors of 36 we can start from 1 2 3 4 6 9 12 18 and 36 so these are the factors of 36 will take 18 18 how can you write 1 times 18 2 times 9 3 times 6 or 6 times 3 9 times 2 again so what are the factors of 18 1 2 3 and then you can write 6 9 18 so factors always 1 and the number itself are factors any number when observing factors when you look at all these numbers 1 and itself yes 1 and 36 4 36 1 and 15 for 15 so you 
,,get always 1 and the number itself are factors always write down all factors of 32 1 times 32 1 times 32 32 you can write 2 times 16 4 times 8 so what are the factors 1 2 4 8 16 32 so 1 and the number self always a factor write down all factors of 21 times 22 times 10 4 times 5 so factors of 21 in 2 4 5 10 20 45 1 times 45 3 times 3 times 1 3 4 15 that's fine divided by 5 that's 9 so what are the factors 1 3 5 9 15 and 40 now we look at what are common factors write down highest common factor HC afreet stands for highest common factor of 6 and 10 so that's what we need to find now when you take 6 what are the factors we know 1 and itself always a factor then you can divide this by 2 so 2 is a factor you can divide this by 3 3 is a factor so 1 2 3 6 factors of 10 1 and itself always a factor you can divide by 2 you can divide by 5 so when you look at these two numbers what are common factors of 6 and 10 1 & 2 so 1 & 2 are common factors highest common factor of 6 and 10 which 
,,one is the highest to so 2 is the highest common factor the largest common factor is called the highest common factor so we select common factors out of that the largest one we call highest common factor find the highest common factor of 12 and 18 so how we write 12 1/2 yes get 6 divided by 3 you get 4 divided by 4 you get 3 and divide by 6 you get 12 and finally 12 is also a factor 81 be visible by 2 divisible by 3 and what else 4 is not there 5 6 and then 18 what are common factors they're common ones 1 2 3 & 6 so out of these what's the highest one six six is the highest common factor so we can write 12 in terms of 6 into 2 18 you can write 6 times 
,,3 so here if you take these two factors highest common factor is in the circle 6 is the highest common factor find the highest common factor of 15 and 20 15 1 not divisible by 2 3 5 and 15 21 - ok then 3 not divisible 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and then finally 20 so what are the common factors there one fine those are the two common factors out of these two you can write down the highest one is fine so if you take 15 I can write 5 times 3 and 5 times 4 so highest common factor is in the circle find highest common factor of 20 and 30 now can you find out at once when you look at 20 and 30 10 times 2 and 10 times 3 so here I can write 10 times 2 and 10 times 3 so what's the highest common factor for 20 and 13 that's 10 fine highest common factor of the tn 45 what do you think 15 times 2 and 15 times 3 so 15 times 2 is 30 15 times 3 is 45 so what do you think the highest one highest one we can take as 15 24 36 60 now you get three numbers and we are asked to find out the highest common factor so 24 36 60 when you look at it we see what is the common factor 12 these are multiples of 12 12 times 2 12 times 3 12 times 5 that's the maximum number common factor we can take so what's the highest one highest one we can take as 12 these 3 45 6 275 so when you look at it carefully we see 15 either common factor and it's the highest one 15 times 3 15 times 4 and 15 times 5 75 so highest common factor we can take as 15 finding highest common factor using prime factors so we did so far 
,,by looking at the numbers we took the highest one now there's a method to find out if you can't see at once you can use prime factor method so we'll take 12 so what 
,,you have to do take separate numbers and see what are the factors you can divide by 2 again you can divide by 2 you can't divide by 3 so what are the factors 2 times 2 times 3:18 what are the factors you can't divide by 2 divided by 3 you get 1 2 times 3 times 3 24 divided by 2 again 2 and again two and finally 3 2 times 2 times 2 times 3 now what we do we take the highest common factor from this this is one common factor and there's another common factors what we do we multiply these two so we can take highest common factor as 2 & 3 that's 6 so we can write 12 as 6 into 2 18s 6 into 3 24 as 6 into 4 so 6 is the highest common factor 4 12 18 and 24 find highest common factor of 15 30 and 45 15 we know 3 times 5 so when you divide 15 you can see this is 3 & 5 here you don't need to multiply by 1 so you can write 3 
,,times 5 30 3 2 5 so 2 3 5 2 3 45 divided by 3 again 3 you get 5 3 3 5 now select the common 1/3 is common and five also common so what's the highest common factor we multiply these children so three only we take once and this is five so 15 so 15 is the highest common factor of 15 30 and 45 finding highest common factor of 12 24 
,,60 so now use prime factors and find out 12 you can write 2 to 24 you can write 2 2 to 3 and 60 you can't divide and see the factors 2 to 3 now select common factors 2 is common another 2 is common and here 3 is also so what's the highest 1 2 times another 2 times so 2 times 2 4 4 times 3 12 so the highest common factor of all these numbers is 12 now look at 22:40 4 60 you look at we see what's the highest common factor but we'll check it 22 2 times 11 11 times 1 so 2 times in our 44 / 222 
,,again we'll get to it 22 divided by 11 1 so 2 times 2 times 11 66 when you divide by 2 you get 33 divided by 3 you get 11 2 3 11 so what's common 2 is common and 11 
,,is a common factor so 2 times 11 is the highest common factor so 22 is the highest common factor five highest common factor of 14 21 and 49 14 divided by 2 + 7 - x 720 bar you can divide by 3 3 times 7 49 is 7 times 7 now what's the highest one 7 is the only common factor and it's the highest one so 7 is the highest one 26:39 65 now you can do it so 26 divided by 2 to get 1313 is a prime number so 2 times 30 39 can divide by 3 and 13 is a prime number so 3 times 30 65 you can divide by 5 and you get 13 so 5 times 30 so what's the common factor highest common factor is 13 so 13 you can write as the highest common factor write down the highest common factor at once now can you see when you look at these 3 we can see 10 10 times 5 10 times 16 times 7 so if you can do that we can easily find out the highest common factor so from all these what's the highest common factor we can write as 10 this one what do you think 35 what's the number high times 7 7 times 7 7 times 10 what's the number 7 7 we can see that the highest one 7 times 5 7 times 7 49 7 times 10 70 so what's the highest one 7 is the highest common factor 30 45 60 what can you say 
,,15 15 times to 15 times 3 15 times 5 so we can write 15 times to 15 times 3 you get 40 for it so here 60 is 15 times 4 so what's the highest common factor highest common factor is 50 look at these numbers 80 100 and hundred and eighty so 10 is okay then look at 810 18 another 2 is common so what's the highest common factor so you get 20 so just check 20 times for 20 times 500 20 times 5 here 20 times 4 what's 20 times here 9 so 20 is the highest common factor so we can take 20 now look at these ones 1845 63 divisible by 3 and you get 9 and 21 again divisible by 3 so these are multiples of 9 so I can write 18s 9 times 2 what's this one 9 times 5 63 is 9 times 7 so what's the highest common factor there 9 is the highest common factor finding highest common factor for algebraic terms now so far we did numbers now these are letters and numbers a mixture we call it algebraic terms now let's take 4x squared how can you write for 2 & 2 2 times 2x squared means X annex so you can first expand it like this and see what are common factors 6 how can you write 2 times 3 and X Y X into y 8 2 times 2 4 4 times 2 8 and x squared means two x's there and Y squared means two wise now take the common ones 1 2 is common what is X 1 X is common there and what about YY is not common because it's not there here so only 2 
,,"well X so 2 and X you can write 2x is the highest common factor right down highest common factor for these are G break terms 8 2 times 2 times 2 is there and B squared means B twice 12 2 times 2 4 4 times 3 12 a squared is a times a and B then 22 then again neither - 2 times 2 4 4 times 5 20 and B now see what are common and from that you can find out the highest 1/2 is , another 2 what is e you can take ears commenter and one B so what are the common factors to 2 e and B so when you multiply 2 times 2 4 so for a B is the highest common factor right down highest common factor for these numbers a B a times B 3 a B means 3 times a times B so a B means 2 "
,,times 2 times a B when you write down factors make sure that you write in prime numbers B is Commerce and is common so what's the highest common factor we can multiply a and B so without this multiplication sign we can write ap another algebraic terms find the highest common factor if you can't get it at once you write like this and find out the prime factors 2 times 2 times 3 is 12 and then P Q squared means cube and cube 8 2 times 2 times 2 P squared means P and P and want you there 40 divided by 2 divide by 2 divide by 2 and then high so 2 times 2 times 2 times 5 so when you select the common ones here to another two and what is here we forgot P and Q squared so we'll take pinion q squared P Q and Q now we'll select the common ones 1p is common 1q common here so that's all so you can write 2 times 2 times P times Q 2 times 2 4 4 P Q is the highest common factor right down highest common factor for these numbers 24 divided by 2 divided by 2 again 2 and then 3 2 times 2 times 2 times 3 and then M N squared one name and two ends 36 divided by 2 2 you get 9 divided by 3 and another 3 so 2 times 2 times 3 and 3 and M square that means 2 m 
,,then one name M squared N squared here 48 48 divided by 2 divided by 2 again so when you divide you get all these numbers then - how many times one two three four two three four and then three M Squared n square so that means - MZ twins now we'll find out the highest one to another to is common what else look at carefully three 
,,is common you take one name and another in so what's the number 2 times 2 4 4 times 3 12 so 12 mm now you can do this so write down the factors first 7 we know it's 
,,a prime number 7 only 7 x 1 x 2 eyes till how can you write as prime numbers 2 times 5 two x's and one why 9 we see 3 times 3 and x and x 4 x squared and y and y 4 y square now take the common ones out when you take numbers nothing common only letters are common 1 X you can take it out and one boy that's all so what's the highest common factor x into y or you can write x y so now the 1 6 you can write 2 x 3 2 x's two ones 12 - x - 4 4 x 3 12 - XS + 1 by 15 3 times 5 2 XS + 2 1 now we see that this X is common another X is cover what else now that Y you can take another one no numbers are common so what's the highest common factor X x + y you can write 
,,x squared Y now we look at how we can write algebraic expressions as a product of its factors so remove highest common factor for this 6 X + 15 Y and write as a product of two factors so we can separate the two terms 6x + 15 1 when you look at 6 X you can write 2x + 3 15 Y you can write 3 a 5 by so that's the common one and it's the highest common law so common factor is 3 and what are the remaining part you get 2 X 5 so we can take this highest common factor out and write down the remaining part so here when you take 3 out from 6 what's remaining 2 X when you multiply what you get 3 times 2 X 6 6 you are getting then when you take 3 from here 15 what's remaining five bye so when you take three out you get five by here so we can write 6x plus 15y as 3 times 2x plus 5y because when you multiply expand you get the same answer 6x 3 times 5 15 what so you get the same answer so when you are taking common factors out what you call that we call we are factorizing what's the reverse order expanding brackets and then factorizing so we are now looking at taking the highest common factor out from the expression look at these 2 5 a and 10 B so how 
,,can you write 5 a I can write 5 times a 10 B 5 times B 5 times to be then how can I write 5 8 and 10 B I can take the highest common factor out and the remaining part I can put inside the brackets a and plus sign this sign comes here so 8 plus 2 B now you can check by multiplying these two 5 times a 5 a 5 times 2b check me so that's correct now see this one you have given two terms 7p + 14 cube so what's common 7 times P I can write 7 times 2 cube I can write for 14 so 7 is the highest one 
,,so I can take 7 out and write the remaining part P plus 2 Q inside brackets so when you multiply you get 7p + 14 this one what do you think six times five six times 
,,two so I can write 6 times 5 m 6 times 2 n that's 12 so 6 you can take it out and the remaining part 5m plus 2n you can write inside so 6 times 5 30 30 M 6 times 2 n 12 15 X + 18 y the plus sign is there so we write plus sign so 15 3 times 5 X 18 y 3 times 6 y know what's the highest common factor 3 take it out and the remaining 5 5 X + 6 Y you can write inside the brackets this one now the sign is negative so we'll put negative 10 yeah this should be negative 20 X you can write 10 with 2 X 10 with 3 B that's 30 B so 10 when you take it out what's remaining 2 X now the sign is minus 3 always this sign comes here as well so 2x minus 3 be multiplied and 
,,see 10 times 2 20 10 times 3 30 and minus sign comes this one for a and 20 B what's common will take 4 4 times a four times five B so four is the highest common factor take it out the remaining part e + 5 b you can write in sat 8m plus 28 what's common look at carefully when you look at carefully sometimes you get it at once for four times - it four times five in four is the highest common factor take it out and write the remaining part inside the bracket so 2m plus five write down as product of factors at once can you take the highest common one out 7 + 35 7 is common so what's the remaining part when you take 7 a is there and then here 35 we have already taken 7 so 5 is remain 5b 8 12 16 what's the common factor for multiples of 4 so 4 is common 2 x 4 times 3 12 so 3y there 4 times 4 16 so for Z third one what's common 6 + 8 4 2 is common no letters common there so only you can take 2 so 2 a squared remain minus sign because this is minus 2 times 3 6 so 3 B squared and here 2 times 4 8 4 C square fourth one nine six three multiples of 3 so it take 3 out 3 plus 2x plus y so here only 3 is calm 12 16 20 what's common for four you can take it out 4 times 3 12 so 3 P 4 times 4 16 so 4 cube + 4 times 5 20 so that's 5 are 40 50 60 you can take turn out when you take 10 for X is there 5y + 10 x 6 16 so - its 22 11:33 definitely we know that's 11 11 times 2 20 to 11 times 1 so you can write a only no need one name - 314 2135 multiples of 7 and take 7 out to where 3 b + 5 2 4 6 2 take 2 out a plus 2b minus 311 2255 again 11 is common x + 2 y minus 5 write down as productive factors no no numbers just the letters so what's common 
,,here a I can write a times X a times y so I can write ax plus ay Y taking the common highest common factor out a and the remaining part inside so a into X plus y so 
,,these two are the product of factors again 2 PQ + 4 P R I can write - P - P times Q to P times here - are you get 4 PR no - P is common highest one so you can take it out and write Q + to work always check whether you are getting the same term - n PQ 2 PQ + 2 P into two are 4 p are these examples how can I write x is common 3 and X I can take so 3 X into X 3 X into 2 y 3 X into 3 Z so what's the highest common factor 3x I can take it out and write x + 2 y + 3 Z look at this one first 7 XY 14 x CI 21 X so what's common 7 X into are 7 X into 2 z 7x - three is 21 X so how can you write down this one I can write take seven X out take seven X out and write 
,,down the remaining part inside y - Z and this one eight twelve sixteen and here P P P P also common so we can take four P out for P times to P you get eight P squared forty-four p x 3q squared twelve P Q squared 4 P times 4 Q 16 B cube so for P is the highest common factor there so remaining part you write inside to p3 q squared + 4 Q write down algebraic expression 5 a plus 10 B as product of two factors so again 5 a I can write 5 times a 10 B I can write phi x 2b so 5 is common that's the highest common factor take it out the remaining part your right inside write our algebraic expression 7 XY 14x e 21 x as product of two factors so 7x is the highest common one check it out so you can write Y there 2 Z 3 so when you take my necks out what's remaining y plus 2z plus 3 so we call these are factors of this expression find factors of these ones ap square 12 P Q squared 8 P squared Q so already give up for P you can take it out so for P means 2 when another P 4 times 3 12 P is already there so Q Square when you take 4 P out this is 2p q 8 P squared Q you'll get now for P is the highest common factor take it out and remaining part 2 V 3 Q squared + 2 PQ you can write inside brackets find factors of these three expressions what's the highest one x squared x squared x squared so definitely x squared is common and 6 9 12 you get 3 so 3 x squared we can take it out if it's 3 x squared this is 2y squared 3x squared take it you get 3 only 3x squared when you take it you 
,,get for y so no need to circle that so 3x squared it's the highest common factor and you can write down the remaining part inside the brackets find tractors at once 
,,so we'll do at once look at the number three six three is common so no letter is common so the remaining part you write insult six and nine three is common so when you take three hours it's to a and three be fifteen and twenty you can take 3 out 5 X + 4 3 times 3 is not common there what's common 15 and 25 is common so when you 
,,take 5 out 3x + 4 1 12 and 15 you can take 3 out for a and 3 times 5 15 so 5 be 20 and 30 I can take 10 out 2x + 3 okay these ones take the factors at once 8 10 12 I can take for ya X also common for X out then - y remaining for X when you take this is 3 z 9 + 53 is common and 1a is common so 3a so 3b 5c 16 and 24 butts comma 8 
,,8 times 2 16 eight times three twenty four eight and twelve here you can take four out to here X is also come on X is also common for is also common so for X you can take it out 2x 3y so you get 12 X Y 30 and 45 what's common 3 you get 15 10 so only 3 & 5 15 you can take it out 2 & 1 X and you take 15 X you get 2 y inside and 15 times 3 45 3 Z so 15 times 3 45 fine factors now three expressions three terms are there at once we see a nice common take it out the remaining part we write inside brackets from these we can see only X is common 1 X 2 y and y square your sign is the same you can't change the side here PQ q RQ is Q is common P plus R plus s here M is common you can write M plus n plus here what you write one name is there when you take em out that means one is there so M times 1 is M so here when you take 
,,"the whole thing out you have to write this is 1 now here also same thing when you take a out this is 1 here 1 plus B plus B Square this one too you can take it out what else p2p that's all so when you take two P out Q minus 2 R and 3's let's comment here and Miss common 3 so 3 M foo and you get 12 here then 5 6 9 12 3 1 P is , so 3 P to Q 3 r & 4 yes what is here only hey so when you take a out this is a plus B plus C this one X is combine and no number is common so only X 2 X 3 y + 5 Z now what happens you can take negative numbers as a common factor so we'll look at this one so this is a negative number so negative 2 way I can write negative 2 times "
,,a so negative 2 times 8 oh I can write negative 8 times 2 you are still getting the - - wait look at this 1 minus 5b I can take minus 5 and B or minus B and 5 - 7 X 
,,- 7 with X or minus X with 7 here minus 15 minus 3 into positive 5 oh I can write 3 with negative 5 minus 12 minus 4 with 3 or 4 plus 4 with minus 3 I can take the minus sign to any of these factors find factors of minus 14 a minus 21 B minus 14 so we'll take minus 7 then what's the other part - a if you take minus 7 out what's 
,,remaining three big now is C minus seven is the common factor so I can take minus seven out and write down the remaining part 2 a + 3 B inside brackets now multiply 
,,and see 7 times 2 away 14 let's - minus and plus that's - you get 21 B fine factors of minus 8x minus 12i so I can take minus 4 if you take minus 4 this is 2x minus 
,,4 times 3y you get minus 12i now we'll take minus 4 out from the two terms that's the highest common factor the remaining part you can write inside so this is plus 3y plus 2x so that's why this plus 3y comes over there now find factors here both negative I can take minus 3 out so when I take minus 3 out this becomes plus a plus 
,,5b 4 minus 4 will take out - well when you take it out you get 2x and 3y from this minus 3 out but you get 3p and 2 K minus 2 and -6 we take minus 2 out e + 3 so multiply and see whether you are getting the same expression all three will take minus 2 out what's happening here you get 5n that's positive because this is negative now here positive is there so this becomes negative because you have already taken a minus sign out so 2 times 4 8 that's four N and minus 2 you have take it out and 
,,then this becomes plus 3 so multiply and see whether you get this sign correctly - - and - you get +8 a will take - 11 out you can take plus 11 also then the sign stays the inside so if you take minus 11 this becomes X plus 6 this becomes plus 2y and here plus becomes minus 3 15 18 3 3 is common so we'll take minus 3 out you get 5p this is minus so this becomes plus 6 q & 3 are so that means plus or minus classes there so that becomes minus because - - you get plus their take - formed E and then this becomes must to be 8 and here plus becomes minus minus - you get plus 4 times 24 36 12 you can take minus 12 out so this becomes 2 p3q and here - because 
,,- 12 and - are you get plus 12 are 16 24 8 I can take minus 8 out this becomes 2 X plus 3 by and minus Z so minus 8n - see you get plus 8 see find factors of following algebraic expressions so you can take either plus or minus will take all common factors that's called highest common factor I can't take two what so what's remaining two this one X is common for so I'll take four X out this becomes 3 2 y 4 times 2 8 XY minus 4 X already taken 10 12 8 I can take 2 and here a 2 way so what's remaining 5 a + 6 b + 4 c all these I can take a out a plus B plus C this one x squared is common take it out 2 plus 3y minus 5z this one p is common and 3 so 3 P 3 P 
,,when you take 3 q is there for R + 3 x - 2 SS you get 6 PS remove common factor at once so now you should be able to take the highest common factor out at once so when you take an expression just try to take all possible factors out so here X take it out what's remaining y + ya when you look at this one is come on take it out so you'll get a plus B minus 8 see what is this one what is common 3x when you take 3x a minus B here 9 + 3 3 comma and take it out you can write 3x + 1 because remember when you take the highest number out always remember this is 1 so 1 X is common take it out remaining parts you can write inside with the correct sign a is common so remaining part a plus B minus C here X is common L - M - what's common there 3 yes 3 is common for p5q and - a / b is common C is common L is common three terms 
,,come ABC when you take ABC one remaining here one be remaining here and one C remaining there X Y you can take it out when you take XY out exist remaining Y is remaining there and XY both remaining yeah so try to take the highest wall out so fine factors means you are taking the highest common factor out 3 take it out you get 4x - 5 14 and 20 1:7 is the highest common factor to M minus 3 9 and 12 3 and here a squared is also common when you take 3 s squared you get 3 minus 4p we are 16 and 
,,24 what's the highest one 8 and X so 2x 8 times 2 16 x squared and here 3y 8 times 3 24 X Y this one 15 and 25 x and y comma 3 what remaining 5 you have already taken so this becomes 4 X 12 and 21 3 x squared is common and 1 Y is common take it out so what's remaining 4 here plus 3 x squared Y we have taken that one out 3 times 
,,4 12 minus 7 x squared you have taken out so One X is remaining and Y squared is there we took one Y out one Y remaining check it again 3 x squared so 3 times 7 21 x squared and X X cube Y and y Y squared now we will look at your review exercise find the highest common factor of each set of numbers given below so how we find out do it separately and find out the highest common factor 12 2 times 2 4 4 times 3 12 2 times three six six times three eighty now take the highest one two and three 
,,so highest common factor is two and three that's six thirty and twenty four two times fifteen fifteen you can write three and five if you can't figure it out you do 
,,separately and find out the factors so here fifteen three times four and twenty four two times twelve twelve means two times two four four times three now what are the common factors two and three so highest common factor is 2 times 3 that's 6 45 and 60 45 60 you can divide by 5 5 times 9 9 you can write 3 and 3 divided by 5 you get 12 12 you can write 2 times 2 4 4 times 3 12 so what's the highest common factor 5 3 that's all 5 times 3 that's 15 6 12 18 when you take that we can't say 6 is the highest common factor but we'll show the workings 2 times 3 2 times 2 4 4 times 3 12 2 times 9 so that 9 is 3 times three two is common and three is common so highest common factor is 2 times 3 that's 6 this one 15 30 and 75 3 times 5 30 3 times 10 so you can write 3 10 you can write 2 and 575 3 you get 3 times 2 6 so 25 25 you can write 5 and 5 what's the highest common factor 3 & 5 you get 50 now take this one 36 24 and 60 you can divide by 2 you get 18 18 also divided by 2 you get 9 9 you can write 3 & 3 24 you can divide by 2 you get 12 12 how you can write 2 times 2 4 4 times 360 divided by 2 you get 30 divided by 2 again 15 3 times and fun know what's common to another two and three common now what's the highest common factor 2 times 2 times 3 4 times 3 12 12 is the highest common factor 6 9 12 6 2 times 3 9 3 times 3 12 3 times 4 so what's common only 1 3 is common you can write highest common factor is 3 15 30 and 45 how can you write 3 times 5 53 times 10 10 you can write 2 times 5 45 3 and 15 there 15 3 times 5 so what's the highest common factor 3 is common and 5 is common 3 times 5 15 he left for 13 and 511 you can write 1 times 11 1 times 13 all these are prime numbers 1 and the number itself are the factors so what's the highest common factor in this case only one example number 1 find the highest common factor of the algebraic terms in each part given below so we can write separate 2 times P times Q for 2 times 2 P Q now take the common 1 highest common factor 2 P Q 2 P Q is the highest common 7mn 14 M and P 28 m and q 7 is 7 times MN 42 times 7 times M and P 28 2 times 14 14 2 times 7 M in Q now what are the common ones 7 M hmm 7 mm so highest common factor is 7 ma exercise 7.1 find the highest common factor of the algebraic terms in each part given below so you write like this and find out them common ones x into y 3 into X into y 2 times 2 into X prime factors here without writing 4 times X right 2 times 2 times X X is common why is not common so that's all so highest common factor is just X this one for C 8 a 4 B 4 how can you write we write in terms of prime numbers 2 times 2 times C 8 2 times 2 times 2 and a 4 again 2 times 2 so you can see 2 & 2 common so that's 4 2 times 2 you get 4 is the highest common back to their 2 X 8 X + 4 X 1 you see 
,,2x is the ice common factor but we'll show 2 times X 2 times 2 times 2 X 2 times 2 times x and y so what's the common 1/2 + 1 X the highest common factor is 2x this 
,,one for P 8 P Q 12 P 2 times 2 4 and SP 2 times 2 times 2 PQ that's 8 PQ 2 times 2 4 4 times 3 12 P Q now we'll take the common ones out to another 2 and P so highest common factor is 2 times 2 times P that's 4 P 8 P Q R 16 QR and 7 mq r 8 2 times 2 times 2 and then P Q R is there 16 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 7 7 times M Q now what R comma Q is common our is common that's all so what's the highest common factor Q this one 4x 6x y 8 q r x 4 x 2 x 2 x x 2 x 3 by x and y 8 2 times 2 times 2 q 
,,r x now take the common ones to another 2 is not common x that's all so highest common factor is 2x so highest one is 2 X 4 X 6 a B X 10 a B X Y now write down all the factors for x 2 x 2 6 2 x 3 a B X 10 2 times 5 a B X Y now see the common factors to X that's up so what's the highest common factor to X this one 6 MN 12 MN y 15 my 6 means 2 times 3 12 2 times 2 4 4 times 3 15 three times now we'll take the common ones 3 & M and means not common so what's the highest common factor 3 example number one write the expression 36 a plus 60 B as a product of factors so that means you can take the highest common factor out so what do you think 36 and 60 B 6 times 6 6 times 10 so another 2 so 12 12 times 3 12 times 5 so that means 12 is their highest one so take it out you get 12 times 3 so 3 a plus 5 if you can't figure 
,,it out you just write down 12 times 3 12 times by me so common one take it out and the remaining part you write inside brackets example number two write the expression as a product of factors so 12 X 25 and 16z 12 4 times 3 24 times 5 16 4 times 4 so 4 is the highest common month so when you take for the remaining part three x 5i + 4 z so i told you if you are not okay write down 4 x 3 3 x 4 x 5 button here 4 x 4z so when you check for out the other parts inside the brackets exercise 7.2 fill in the blanks the expressions are given and you asked to fill in the blanks ok so 3 X means 3 times X 12 millions 3 times 4/3 is comma and take it out what's remaining x + 15 X you can write 5 times 3 X 25 times 4 y so when you take 5 out what's remaining 3 X + 12 a how do you write 12 B 6 times 2 in here this number given now 6 times 3 18 so here 3 comes there so what's the number here this is 18 now look at this one 12 4 times 3x you get 12 X this one 4 x 2 y you get 8y 4 times 5 z is 
,,20 Z when you take 4 out what's remaining 3 x - 2 y + 5 this one you have to check the common fat here 5x is there how will you get 30 from five six times 5x now you can take six out six times for 24 so for y there six times three you get 18 and here we missed one black what's that six times when you take six out what's remaining two a plus three question number two write each of the algebraic expressions given below as product of two factors such that one factor is the highest common factor of the terms of the expression so what's the highest one - you can take it out X plus 3y here four is the highest one so 2x plus 3y this one 3 3 times 5 15 3 times 6 18 9 9 27 9 you can take 9x + 3 y 4 and 24 you can take it out P plus 5 cube 12 and 30 get 6 2p plus 5 cube 20 and 30 we can take ten out to weigh and three be 36 and 54 what's the number 18 if you can't figure out you just do it 36 is 2 times 18 so 18 times 254 when you divide by 2 you get 27 divided by 3 9 again this one so here 3 times 3 times 2 18 18 times 3 so 18 you can take it out so 18 times 2a and 18 times 3 B so here 60 and 90 vc10 is common and another 3 so 30 so you can take 
,,30 out so this is 2p + 3 okay Part B what's common 5 is comma take it out what's remaining 2y and here Phi 3 15 12 3 you can take it out and write down the remaining numbers inside 18:12 6 6 you can take it out 3 - 2 M + M 10 2015 5 only 5 - a 4 B + 3 if you can take the highest one out you again check inside whether you can take another fact out then you can do again 989 I can take nine out C minus 2a plus one because nine is nine times 1/12 618 six you can take to D plus one and three see there three six three three is common X plus 2y minus 1 10 4 2 2 is common 5 m 2 n minus 1 so this is 2 times 1 12 8 4 before you can take it or not and then the remaining part you can write so 1 is there 9 3 6 3 3 plus B plus 2 C here is not common it is not there so 3 only a squared to be a so here a also comes to a B plus 3 
,,B squared for 16 12 for is there a is not comments only 4 a squared minus 4a B minus 3 C example number one write minus 15 as a product of two factors such that minus 3 is a factor so minus fifteen if minus 3 is a I can write minus three times five ah to write ten as product of two factors such that minus 2 is a factor so 10 if 
,,I take minus 2 as a factor what's the remaining 1 minus 5 because - and - you get plus 10 write down each of the algebraic expressions given below as a product of two factors such that one factor is a negative now so we'll take a negative number out - for when you take minus 4 this is plus and this is plus so for my second one we'll take minus 8 out so remaining part this is plus plus is there so this becomes minus 3n minus - you get positive and minus 16 is there an so this becomes plus 2 
,,so minus 8 is the factor we have taken it out exercise 7.3 right - 20 as a product of two factors such that minus 4 is what factor if minus 4 is there what's the other factor 4 times 5 no so the other one is plus 5 or you can write just 5 write 12 as product of two factors such that minus 4 is one factor so if this is 12 if I want to take minus 4 what happens to get Plus this should be minus 3 minus 4 times minus 3 you get plus 12 write each algebraic expression given below as a product of 
,,two factors such that one factor is a negative number so we'll take minus four if you take minus 4 this becomes minus 3x minus minus plus and here you get plus y expand and see whether you get the same expression we take minus 4 out this becomes plus 3 and this becomes minus y minus minus plus take minus 4/3 X plus y here minus 
,,3 we'll take it out a minus minus minus plus 5b and this becomes plus 2c what's the common one minus six out to eight so you get minus 12a this is minus because this is plus three beef and this is minus order check on this is for see what's the common factor there 8 minus 8 very japanese peeny this is minus because this is plus 
,,minus minus plus 5q and here - already taken so this is plus 8 times example number one write the expression as a product of two factors so here expression is 18 X 24 XY + 12 X Z so what are the common factors 18 24 12 you can take 6 + XS comic so 6 6 you can take it out when you take 6 6 this becomes 3 6 times 4 so this is 4y + 12 that's 2 Z multiplied and say 6 times 2 12 exa example number two write the expression as product of factors 15 pink.you 45 P Q R + 60 Cuba 15 Q is common so we 
,,take 15 Q out what's remaining please there 15 times 3 is 45 so 3 you have 15 times 4 is 60 so you can write for example 3 write the expression as a product of factors 306 a B and 12a C 3 e is common that's the highest common factor when you take 3 out this becomes 1 remember that 3 a times 1 is 3 this is 2 B and when you take 3 from 12 that's four C so 6 a b + 12 AC you are getting exercise 7.4 write each algebraic expressions given below as a product of two factors now you can take the highest common factor out and write down the remaining part inside the bracket so if this is P 1 plus Q so X is common Y Z plus P chip 3x is comment here when you take 3x that's 1 plus 2y here 15 and 25 and P you can take it out 3q minus 4r this one for people you can't take it out 1 minus 4 Q and then 3r this one what is common to it 1 minus 4 B and minus 4 sick take 5 X out 1 - 2 y + Z because we have taken 5 X out what's common here 3 a B all 3 are commenting 1 - 3 C right each of the following algebraic expressions as a product of two factors establish the accuracy of your answer by simplifying the product so we have to recheck whether you are getting the answer ok so first take the common one highest one highest common factor you get Z minus 2 P now we will check whether we are getting the same thing when you multiply you get X Y Z when you multiply this 1 you get minus 2 X Y P no check X Y P we are getting the same answer this one when you take four weeks out 3 minus 5 I 
,,now multiply and see whether you are getting the same four times three 12 X 4 times 5 20 that's - 20 X Y check whether you are getting the same thing here is come on check it out B plus C minus T multiply and see whether you are getting the same as a B plus AC minus ad so that's correct what's common P is common take it out 1 plus Q plus Q are multiplied and C P into 1 P P into Q P Q and P Q so that's correct take X out P minus y -1 multiply and check whether it's correct X P minus XY minus X so it's true this one what's common to a B now we can't take B to a we'll check it out then this becomes 3 B 4 B squared + 6 C when you multiply what you get 6 a 
,,be 2 times here - a 8a b squared + 6 x - 12 AC no check it's correct join each algebraic expression in Group A with the algebraic expression in Group B which it is equal to so we can expand brackets and find the answer 2 times X 2 X 4 y and so this is the here when you multiply this one 6a + 4 B where 6a + 4 b + 12 C order is not important so we need to find out your 12 C is there 8 a 4 B so this one 5 times 2 so you need to multiply all okay with the outside number 10 a - 5 10 a - 5 5 times 3 15 B so this is this next one 4 times 3 12x minus 8y + 20 z for Pierre or for AP for BP and for P 2 times 5 10 a 10 a minus 2ac 10 a minus 2ac and for a B this one when you multiply two works minus 3 XY 2 X minus 3 XY and here 3 XY square what about the next one 8 a for a B and minus 4 AC 5 times 3 15 XYZ 15 X Y Z Phi times 
,,5 25 XY + 20 X Z 3 times 4 12 X minus 6 XY + 9 XZ this one - x - 4 4 P squared 4 P squared + 2 QR + 2 PQ R so you get this one so you are getting all the answers there complete the table given below original expression and after factoring the expression so that means you have to expand records 12 a 4 x 2 b 8 B 4 x 3 12 a squared what about this one here other way around you have to factorize what's common 9 a calm and you take 9a out one plus 3z squared plus 2 be remaining here you need to 
,,expand 3 times 2 6 a PE 3 times 3 9 and then you get 9 AR and here you get 18 this is also expanding brackets 2 a squared 2 times 3 6 a B and 2 times 2 4 a squared C here 8 is common take it out and X you can take it out when you take 8 X out y plus 3 P + 8 times 5 is 40 so 40 you get Q is there expand 6a be 8 BC and here what's the number your Phi 2 times 5 minus 10 is see here also expand brackets 6 x PQ so we can write in order 6 PQ x 3 times 3 9 9 x squared and 3 times 6 18 PX when you 
,,multiply this one by six 12 XY squared and then 18 XY + 6 x 4 24 z now factorize this one what's common 3 a is common so when you take 3a out B - to be here so 3 minus here to be and here when you take 3 out for see here you can simplify so same term you can first simplify and write down this 1 s 3 a B minus 2 B - B this is also correct last one what's common for X is common take it out for X you get 2y minus 3 P 4 times 3 12 X P then minus 4 take it out 5 a y so for X and this one you get 
,,20 a X well again fill in the blanks algebraic expression is there one factor and you ask to write down the other factor so 4 is a factor then what's the other one when you take 4 this becomes minus 6 and plus 3 here you can write 3 - X as well or day is not important so you can write 3 minus 6 or so minus 4 when you take it out what's remaining we can take minus 4 then this becomes plus 6 and here minus X minus 3 now to take it out when you take two out this becomes minus three X and minus four Y goes - - is it correct no this is plus 2 this becomes plus if you take minus 2 X out this is plus so 3 you get 3 times - ok then this is minus means this is 
,,- take 2 X out 2 times 4 so 4 1 multiply and say 2 minus 2 and minus 4 plus 8 X for this one take 2 out when you take positive 2 out - II here plus 2 B you get 4 B and when you take - from minus 6 plus 2 it becomes minus 3 C so you get minus 6 C now we'll take - two out so when you take minus 2 out this becomes plus a and here you get minus 2 P minus 2 B and minus 2 you get plus 4b and - is there this becomes plus so when you take minus 2 this is 3 C so minus 2 times 3 C - 6 C now take - 3 
,,B from here so what's the remaining part this becomes positive and this is also positive a plus 3 so multiply and see - 3 B a or 3 a B and minus 9 B here 2x Y comma 
,,then this becomes 1 - two times four four Z because that's - now here you can take whatever the highest common factors what's the highest common factor five Y we can take so we'll take five Y as the highest common factor so what's remaining you get X plus two here Y you have already taken two X and here to pee now again can you 
,,see same jump d15 XY + 10 X Y both are like terms so you can add it here so X + 2 X you get 3x + 2 P now multiply and see 5 times 3 15 X Y so these two 15 XY + 5 I + 2 P you get 10 XP is it correct here this one and this one 10 P Y so that's correct so we covered all theory part related to factors so what's the main topic we did finding highest common factor so take the highest common factor as one factor and the expression which is obtained by dividing each term of the algebraic expression by the highest common factor as the other factor and write the algebraic expression as a product of these two factors so that means when you want to factorize what 
,,you do take the highest common factor and write down the remaining part inside the bracket so practice all the exercises and examples and thorough with finding factors

AlgebraicExpression,Kzj0B8VUXC8,today we're at a car manufacturing factory and what you see here are different parts of a car he has an engine the gearbox the headlights the mirrors and the brakes 
,,all these and many more parts are put together to make a car but each of these parts is also made up of smaller parts for example the engine consists of a spark plug piston piston rings crankshaft connecting rod sump and valves so basically many small parts are put together to form bigger parts and the bigger parts are put together to manufacture a car are you wondering where the algebra is in all of this well forming algebraic expressions is just like putting together parts of a car let's 
,,see how here's an algebraic expression an algebraic expression is a mathematical phrase that contains ordinary numbers variables like X or Y and mathematical operators like add subtract multiply or divide this expression consists of three parts 5x y 3y and 7 parts of an expression which are formed separately and then put together with operators like addition or subtraction are known as terms so 5x y 3y and 7 are the terms of this expression these terms are formed by multiplying variables and numbers let's look at the term 5x y this term is made up of a number five and variables x and y then we have 3y which is a product of 3 and Y and finally we have 7 which is a constant term as it has no variables the smaller parts like 5 x and y in a term 5 X Y are called factors so factors combine to form a term and terms are 
,,put together to form an algebraic expression we can see that one of these factors may be a number like five and the others could be variables like x and y the number is called the numerical coefficient or just coefficient of the term while the variables are called the algebraic factors hence we can say that in 5 X Y 5 is the coefficient of the term and X and y are the algebraic factors do you know there are two types of terms in an algebraic expression when terms have the same algebraic factors they are called like terms for example in this expression the factors of 2 XY are two x and y and the factors of 5 XY are 5 x and y since they have the same algebraic factors that is x + y - x y + 5 XY are called like terms on the other hand negative 7 x + 4 y have different factors x and y so they are called unlike terms if an expression contains only one term it is called a monomial for example negative 7 XY 8 z 2 x if an expression contains two unlike terms it is called a binomial for example 3x plus 4y or 4 XY plus 2z an expression which contains 3 unlike terms is called a trinomial for example 2x + 3 XY plus 7y in general an expression with one or more unlike terms is called a polynomial therefore a monomial binomial and trinomial are all polynomials fill that's a lot but head back to your tutor to understand more about algebraic expressions

AlgebraicExpression,jGjsVfhVlz8,this unit is all about solving algebraic expressions now simple way to say what an algebraic expression or equation is is simply solving for an unknown variable for 
,,example let's say I know some number which I'm going to represent by X plus 5 equals 15 now we don't need to really do anything to take a guess at what that X could 
,,be we know it's going to be 10 so 10 plus 5 equals 15 so some of these expressions are pretty easy to figure out just by taking a guess at it we're going to be looking at a few harder ones where we got to follow a few simple steps in order to solve for X so whenever you have an equation it doesn't matter what you have it could be x plus 5 all over 2 equals 15 whenever you have something like this we ultimately want to end up with the letter all by itself on one side and the numbers all on the other side so if the letter is e you can use s you can use M it doesn't really matter what letter we use sometimes you'll see X and sometimes you'll see other letters so we always want to figure out how are we going to get this letter all by itself on one side and all of the numbers on the other side so we're going to do a few examples with that and we're going to follow two basic steps in order to do it so here's one of the sheets that was included here it's called infinite algebra 1 and what we're going to try to do this is starting off with a very simple equation so I'm going to zoom in a little bit just to make it a little bit easier to see oops this particular problem let me see view zoom let's go three hundred percent so it's a little easier there so here's what we have we have 26 equals eight plus V and 
,,in this case they didn't use X they use the letter V now we know we want to have V all by himself in the end so what is it we want to move well this eight is going to have to move to the other side so when we move him over to the other side a funny thing happens with the 8 since we know it's a positive 8 because there's nothing 
,,in front of it there's no a minus in front of it when we move this positive 8 to the other side we're going to still have 26 but we're going to end up with this positive 8 becoming take away 8 and don't forget we still have this positive v left on this side and I'm just going to leave it as V now when we go 26 take away 8 the final answer will be 18 for V so that will be our final answer so in ones like this there's only one step to do all you have to do is move this guy over to the other side and change the sign from a positive to a negative looking at a 1 like this where the P or the letter is on this side of course we're not going to move the P over here we're going to move the number so this positive 3 goes over to this side and becomes negative 3 so all we're left with now is P on one side and of course 8 take away the 3 on the other so the answer to P will be 8 take away 3 which is 5 now we can easily test out to see if it were right by simply putting 5 back into the original equation for P so if I go back here and I look at the original equation which was 3 plus P equals 8 so remember our answer was 5 so 3 plus let's put 5 in for 
,,P and we can put it in brackets if you want so 3 plus 5 does equal 8 so we have 8 on each side so we know our answer is correct so that's if you're asked to figure out and of course remove this guy over that's if you're asked to validate or check your answer all you got to do is take your answer in this case it's 5 and plug it into your letter be careful when you get to negatives here sometimes when you put a number to the other side the negative becomes positive of course so in this case the minus 15 when we move it to the other side to separate it from the positive n we're left with n on one side and this minus 15 don't forget the minus 9 still there this minus 15 becomes positive 15 now the easiest way to think of when you're doing addition of negative numbers and positive number you can take out your calculator in this case and on most calculators you will find a positive and negative sign there so if I want a negative 9 all I have to do is punch in 9 and then press the positive negative 1 and that automatically changes it to negative 9 and then to add 15 just go plus 15 and our answer of course for this one would be 6 so in this case n will equal 6 so that's if you have a calculator that has the plus and minus on it if you don't just think about it this way if you have negative 9 on a thermometer and I could draw a lovely thermometer and if we're all the way up to negative 9 of course we go up a degree it's negative 8 if we go up another degree it's negative 7 so if we go up 15 degrees we're going to have to jump 1 2 3 15 times we're going to do that 15 times so you could draw a number line and think of it like a thermometer and if you're adding you go this way if you're taking away you go the other way and of course adding a negative if you have one is the same thing as taken away so in this case the 15 moves over here and becomes negative 15 the plus 4 here moves over and becomes negative for the negative 9 moves over and becomes positive 
,,9 the negative 15 moves over and becomes positive 15 and so on so in just about every one whenever you have it whenever you have it you're trying to figure it out all you have to do is move the one that's not attached to P there's nothing attached to P just move it over to the other side and change the sign to a positive and you'll get your answer here's another one it's a single step one but it's not plus or minus you'll notice that it's a fraction so in any fractions written like that what this fraction really means is divided by and to find what it the opposite of divided by is you just have to think of multiply so if you have V over 8 and you're dividing by 8 and you got it times it by 8 or do the opposite that will cancel it out for you but don't forget whenever you do it to one side you must do it to the other side so we have V left all by himself and 2 times 8 which is 16 so we just solved for V V will equal 16 so I could show you that one in another one here there we 
,,go so we got 16 equals K over 11 I think I'll put that one on another page so 16 equals K over 11 so we want to get rid of what everything on this side except for the K well since this mean divided by a fraction is divided by we're going to do the opposite and we're going to multiply by eleven that will cancel out of course the 
,,11s because 11 over 11 is going to equal 1 anytime you have a fraction that is say even 7 over 7 that equals 120 over 20 equals 1 so don't forget though when you times one side by 11 you must do the exact same thing to the other side so I'm going to have the times 16 by 11 as well so I'm going to take my calculator move him over here and of course then I'm going to go 11 times 16 and my answer of course is 176 so my answer to this math problem just by using the calculator will be 176 left on one side and the other side is just K so k equals 176 it doesn't matter which side you put the K on or which side you put the other one on sometimes you'll see it 
,,written both ways looking at this one this is not a divided by there's no divided by underneath that there's no fraction so whenever you see just the numbers touching the letter that really means multiply and of course we're going to do the opposite so when you got negative 15 times X we're going to go and divide it by negative 
,,15 like that that will cancel out the negative 15 but don't forget what you do to one side you must do to the other so I'm going to divide 0 by negative 15 and it doesn't really matter when we solve that zero divided by anything is still going to be zero so X will equal zero in this case looking at number 19 there's a negative seven in front of n so you've got to divide it because negative 7 is times n so you must divide it by negative like that and of course you do it to one side you can select the minus seven you must do the exact same thing to the other side so we're left with just n on one side and twenty-one divided by seven is three and you can use your calculator for that but don't forget it's a positive twenty-one divided by a negative seven so a positive divided by a negative is always a negative okay the only way you can get a positive out of a negative is if both of them were negative which they're not so we're not going to put it there so in this one here since that's 14 times K we're going to divide it by 14 on each side moving over here this is negative 11x so we're going to divide it by negative 11 in order to cancel it out and then we're going to divide this by negative 11 on this side so a negative divided by negative is a positive so we know our answer is going to be positive so X 
,,is all by himself now 143 divided by 11 if I were to take my calculator so 143 divided by 11 and you notice I didn't put in the negatives when I did it because I know a negative divided by a negative is a positive so I don't need to worry about my negatives what my answer does turn out to be 13 so if we put X back in there if we put 13 times negative 11 we should get negative 143 so we could always check our answer so this one here is divided by 18 so we're going to times it by 18 to cancel out this side of course you must times this minus 5 by 18 to cancel out or sorry to get your answer on that side so it's pretty much the same thing all the time you're either going to have the shift if it's a take away or plus you're going to have to shift it over to this side and change the sign if it's a divided by or a multiply you're going to have to do the opposite end times it by seven or times it by a number or in some cases you'll have to divide it by a number like we did up here all right so now that we know how to do the shifting of numbers and we also know how to multiply the numbers sometimes you might get two step equations and these are 
,,usually the ones that are worth the most on a test in these two steps you just got to do one step at a time it's no big deal no harder it's just you got to remember 
,,which step to do first and in this case we always move what's not connected to the letter so this a over four we can't just take the a off and move them over here because he's part of a fraction so we're going to keep him there and we always moved the plus or the minus first so I'm going to take this plus two and shift him over 
,,to this side so I've still got a over four left on the right hand side on the other side since I've moved my positive two over here the sign changes to a negative two so six take away 2 is four and we've still got the a over four left now the easiest way to get rid of a the divided by four that's down here because that's the only thing left that divided by four is two times it by four to cancel it out and of course if you times one side by something you must do the exact same thing to the other side so A's all by himself on one side and of course four times four will give you 16 on the other so a must be 16 for this equation to be true looking down here at this one well maybe I'll do him on a separate page again 9 X take away 7 so 9 X take away 7 equals and just a double check 9 X take away 7 equals negative 7 so 
,,remember the first step always is to deal with the thing that's not connected to the X first in this case it's the minus or to take away 7 so I'm going to shift him 
,,over to the other side and he's going to become plus 7 because he switches signs so we're left with 9x all by himself equals negative 7 still there and we've also brought over a plus 7 all of a sudden negative 7 plus a 7 they oh they cancel each other out to give you 0 because if you have a negative 7 degrees and you add 7 degrees you're back to 0 degrees and of course 9x is still here and to get rid of this 9 times X we must d vide it by x and of course we know 0 divided by anything is still going to be 0 so X will be 0 in this case and that makes sense because if you put 0 back into X up here 0 times 9 is still 0 so that cancels it out and we're left with just negative 7 on this side which is what we've got on the other side okay in this one here it looks a little harder but it's not really the first thing we deal with is the plus or minus so we'll take the minus 5 and bring him over here so negative 5 now becomes a positive 5 because we shifted them so negative 4 is still 
,,there plus 5 equals and remember this is still on that side our loops over 20 so negative 4 plus 5 if you punch that into your calculator is positive 1 and that equals R over 20 the only way to get rid of that divided by 20 now is to do the opposite which is times up by 20 that will cancel it out and of course 1 times 20 is 20 so R will equal 20 now I'm going to take this one V plus 9 over 3 equals 8 and I'm going to do that one because that one's a little bit trickier so V plus 9 over 3 equals 8 just the double check make sure I wrote that down correctly V plus 9 over 3 equals 8 so again you would almost think you got to move this plus 9 over here but the problem is this V Plus 9 is part of this whole fraction ok so it's like having it in brackets okay so how do we get rid of the divided by 3 first of all and the easiest way to get rid of the divided by 3 is 2 times each side by 3 of course that will cancel out the 3 and we'll times this by 3 on this side then we're left with V plus 9 on one side 8 times 3 if you work it out on your calculator will give you 24 now it looks like one of those one-step problems that we were doing earlier so we take the plus 9 bring them over to the other side and shift them and it becomes negative 9 so V is all by himself 24 take away 9 will leave us well you take away 10 in a b14 so add one more and it'll be 15 for our answer so remember anything in brackets needs to stay together you still times it by whatever you need to times it by to get rid of the divided on the bottom okay so let's try another one and I think I'll try this one that already has a 1 here so this one here is two and then bracket n plus 5 now you could go ahead and work it all out but there's no really no need all you need to think about is how do I get rid of this two times all this stuff on that side and the easiest way is to just divide it by two and that'll cancel out that but if you do it to this side of the equation you must divide the other side by two so we're left with n plus five equals well two divided by two is one and a negative divided by positive is a negative so now all we have to do is shift this plus five over to the other side and it becomes negative five that gets rid of it now we're left with N equals negative one takeaway five more is going to be 
,,negative six and that will be our answer for that one so in these two-step problems you always start with the plus or minus first and shift him over and then you've 
,,got it times it by a number or sometimes you got to divide it by a number depending upon what the opposite is so as you can see all of the problems on the example sheets are pretty much the same you shift them over and then of course you're going to times it by four to cancel eight the divided by four if there's brackets well what's in front of the bracket this is 12 or negative twelve times all this so we're going to go divided by negative of 12 and that'll cancel that and of course then it'll be much simpler to solve be careful with your negative signs then you must shift this over first and it becomes positive and then you've got to divide by negative nine to get rid of the negative nine times so don't forget to do not just the nine times but the negative that's in front of the nine as well then the last one over here you got to divide it by ten to get rid of the ten in front but don't forget to do it to both sides and watch your negatives when you're doing this one and it should work out for you nice and easy just like the rest of them you might be given some times the value of x and you might be asked to plug it back into your equation should be easy just take two and wherever your letter is it doesn't have to be X just simply put two or whatever you're given into it and solve it like you always do so 2 times 5 is 10 plus 6 more is 16 so the answer when you put X in there will be 16 when you're looking at this one here we could use why usually we stick to 
,,X's and Y's in math put 3 in for y and of course 4 times 3 is 12 take away 8 will give you 4 for your answer and all the answers are given to you anyway so this is just a practice that you can go ahead and work on now why do you need to know how to plug in certain numbers and solve and get an answer because when you start to graphing coming up next you're going to be given something with x and y and you're going to have to plug in your own numbers so going to zoom back out just a little bit and we'll go up to there and that should give us enough so we can see it a little bit clearer so here's what we've got we've got Y and X so we've got two letters now you remember back in grade five and six you guys had to do these coordinate planes it's almost like playing a game of battleship where you had to call up two numbers or a letter in the number b-52 so you looked at B on one side and you looked at 52 on the top and then you match them up in order see if you could sync some of the battleship what you're really trying to do here is come up with your own values and then plug it into this chart going left to right is called the x value okay so 
,,if it's positive you go this way if it's negative you go that way first so you always go sideways first for X for the Y value on this graph it's the line going up and down so if your answer or Y will end up being say 3 then you're going to end up with your Y value of 3 so you're going to end up with two things you're going to have an x value separated by a comma and a Y value so I could start with X let's say X was 2 and I plug 2 into my formula here so if I put 2 in for X 2 times 2 is 4 take away 5 is going to leave me with negative 1 will be my answer so I will plot this now I'll start with my ex so you always start from the middle and you say ok X is positive 2 so I go over 2 and Y is negative 1 so I go down 1 2 negative 1 and there's my first point plotted right there ok but how do you know which numbers to use generally whenever you're given an equation and you're asked to graph it the easiest way to do it is just simply make your graph like this put X on one side put Y 
,,on the other the X is your input or the numbers you're choosing and the y will be your answer or your output so we'll start with negative 2 negative 1 0 and then we'll go with positive 1 I'll put the plus sign there although you don't really need it you know it's positive even if it was just written 1 usually we pick a couple numbers below zero and a couple above so let's start with the first one let's plug in negative 2 for X so our an equation which is y equals 2x take away 5 I'm going to plug in negative 2 because that's my first one so let's do that y equals 2 times negative 2 and then take away 5 of course now let's keep going and keep solving so 
,,Y still equals well 2 times 2 is 4 but since it's a positive and a negative it's negative 4 take away 5 so it's going to become even more negative so negative 4 take away 5 equals negative 9 so our answer here is negative 9 for y so when x equals negative 2 y equals negative 9 now let's try putting X in as negative 1 so I'm going to go down use the exact same equation I'll rewrite it again down here so remember our equation it is y equals 2x subtract 5 now of course I'll put in my negative 
,,1 so y equals 2 times negative 1 take away 5 more so 2 times 1 is 2 since it's a negative it's going to be negative 2 take away 5 more and my answer for y is negative seven so when X is minus 1 y will be minus 7 I'm going to do one more because 0 is really easy to plug into any formula if we put 0 into here for X it's going to be 2 times 0 well 2 times nothing is still nothing take away 5 from nothing and we're going to be minus 5 so you notice the pattern that's happening you can look at your first one here is going up by 2 because it's becoming a little bit more positive now we're a little less negative whatever way you want to look at it so in this 
,,case it's going up by 2 and again it's going up by 2 when you go from this one to this one so really we could pretty much fill in the next two numbers without having to work it out so let's add 2 more on to minus 5 and that'll be minus 3 and then the next one when we add 2 more it'll be minus 1 so it's a little trick to solving 
,,the rest of them I like to do 3 numbers because you can see if you made an error in one of them if you do 3 of them you can really see and if you get the pattern the same you know you're right so there's our coordinates so let's start with X at minus 2 so there's minus 2 and Y is minus 9 of course I don't have enough space here 
,,I got minus 6 so I'd have to go down 3 more so that's minus six - seven - eight - nine so I put my dot right there let's do another one minus one minus seven so we start there in the middle and go over negative one for X and go down negative 7 for y which will be about right there again your graph on a test will be complete or we'll have enough now I'm going to put in 0 and negative 5 so I'm starting at X so I'm going to go over 0 well that's easy for X I just don't move and then I go down 
,,5 because I'm going to negative 5 I'll plot another one it's going to be positive 1 and negative 3 so I'm going to go over positive 1 and down negative 3 and finally positive 2 so I'm going to go over 2 and then I'm going to go down 1 and as you can see if I were to draw a straight line providing I had done this pretty accurately you notice all of it should be in a straight line because this is a formula for a a line so if it's not all in a straight line you also know that your answer must 
,,have been run let's try one more here we have negative 6x plus 5 for this one you again draw your table like this you put in your X on one side and your Y on the other and then you give your minus 2 minus 1 and 0 1 & 2 now do we have to pick those five numbers it's not totally you could have picked 1 2 3 4 5 but you do have to make sure that all the numbers are in order in this case they're going up by one so if you had to pick one two three four five it'll still work so the only thing you 
,,have left to do is plug in minus two into your equation right here for X and then see what you get so if I put minus two in here it's going to be negative 2 times negative 6 which is positive 12 plus 5 more is positive 17 now right away you can see there's no way to graph it on this you would need some graph paper and you would 
,,have to make your own coordinate grid because negative 2 and positive 17 would be way up here somewhere okay so that's not a very good numbers to choose these ones right here the ones you will be given of course will be much easier to choose from and you just go ahead and draw your table with X&Y each time and then put your numbers there and just plug them in and once you get three of them done you don't really have to do the rest you can just see the pattern that's going up here and keep jumping like that so I hope this has been helpful for you and if there are any questions or any problems and you need some help with it feel free to email me at mr. Edison at hotmail.com well and of course nothing's coming out on the computer so I'll put it here so we'll be mr. Edison my goodness shocking I'll try that one more time okay so mr.

AlgebraicExpression,PVoTRu3p6ug,hello welcome to the algebra course my name is Mike and I will be teaching you this course so what is algebra well loosely translated from its Arabic roots algebra means balancing and restoring but that's a little bit boring and and to us what does that mean so far well it means nothing really I prefer to think of algebra like all math as the mystery of the unknown and what do I mean by that well before you get to algebra you do things like adding numbers subtracting numbers multiplying dividing numbers and there's really no mystery there you're just kind of doing arithmetic you're combining numbers together in algebra we have new things called variables or unknowns that we represent with letters so for example we have something like X plus 1 equals 5 we can think of X as just standing in the place for a number what number needs to go there so there's some mystery here we're on the hunt for the number that goes in place of X well this example is not too hard if instead of X and if we had in place of ax there in that equation if we had 4 then 4 plus 1 equals 5 that's certainly true so instead of that X we need to put a 4 so what we say is that X must be equal to 4 and there we go we've solved our first algebraic equation we started with an unknown called the variable X and we found out it had to be 4 so the key idea here is that X is what's called a variable or an unknown they're synonymous and what do we need to know about variables well variables just stand in the place of a number in our example the letter X the variable stood in place of 4 also variables are usually written as letters of the alphabet in this particular 
,,example we chose the letter X but it doesn't have to be X and in fact let's see another example of an equation with a variable so how about a plus 10 equals 12 so what has to go in for a what does a stand in the place of well it's not too hard to see that if we put it to where a is then we get a true equation so a is equal to 2a a is standing in the place of the number 2 and if you really want to see that we can write this out to +10 certainly equals 12 so we can see that a really was just 
,,standing in the place of 2 and that's that's the the beginning of algebra instead of working with just numbers we start working with variables and that's a very powerful tool ok we'll see how powerful it is and we'll see lots more examples and and and really dive into this when we get into the course see that in this video we're going to talk about different types of numbers if you have to memorize the different types of numbers for a class then this is a great place to start if not then we're gonna get on the same page by just quickly reviewing these different types of numbers so we start with the natural numbers which are sometimes called the counting numbers because we start at one and we just count up from there 1 2 3 4 5 6 so on and so on until we get to a hundred a million a trillion and it just keeps going 
,,if we want to add in zero we can do that and sometimes we write that little subscript of a zero sometimes we call these the whole numbers the natural numbers with zero that's not too important now the integers have all the natural numbers they have zero and they have these negative numbers so an example of an integer is something like negative 7 now negative 7 is an integer but it's not a natural number because there's no negatives in the natural numbers on the other hand something like 20 
,,is both a natural number and an integer we can clearly count up to 20 in the natural numbers and if you look at the integers the integers include all the natural numbers one two three four five and so on now what's an example of a number that's not an integer well how about something like a fraction now when we move to the when 
,,we if we want to include all the fractions then we move to the rational numbers so for instance one-half is a rational number but it's not an integer now one-half is a rational number because if you look one is an integer in the top and two is an integer in the bottom so when we make a fraction with integers that's a rational number now can you think of any examples of a number that is both a rational number and an integer well five is both why think about it five is definitely an integer and a natural number for that for that matter but it's also a fraction because 5 is the same thing as 5 over 1 now 5 is an integer and 1 is an integer so we can write 5 as a fraction of integers so 5 is a rational number and an integer in fact all the integers are rational numbers now what about things that are not rational numbers well the square root of 2 is not a rational number but it is something called a real number so real numbers are all the rational numbers all the fractions and there are these mysterious things like the square root of 2 and the square root of 3 and numbers that we call irrational so for example 5 halves is a fraction so it's both a real number and a rational number but the square root of 2 is only a real number we'll talk more about the real numbers at the end of the video but they're really really really important they're the numbers we'll be using most often in this course finally we get to the complex numbers which are just real numbers with imaginary numbers things of the form a plus bi where a and B are real and I is the imaginary number square root of negative 1 now if this all seems if the complex numbers right now seem mysterious and weird to you don't worry about it we'll talk about it later but let's revisit the real number line for the real number so this is the 
,,real number line and it's just a continuous line of numbers you can see we have all the integers 1 2 3 and so on we also have everything in between so for example right where that Green Dot is that's perhaps the square root of 2 because the square root of 2 is approximately 1.4 1/4 and it keeps going on forever so it's just a little less than 1.5 now the interesting thing about this is that if we were to draw a number line with only rational numbers so only fractions well we already talked 
,,about the fact that the square root of 2 is not a rational number it's not a fraction so if we drew a number line with only fractions there would be hole holes in it there would be a hole where the square root of 2 goes so the real number line is really special it has this property that every number is there there's no holes or 
,,jumps or gaps and well we'll use the real number line in that sense that basically when we can think of it as all the numbers on that line the whole line is continuous and filled with numbers ok see in the next video in the last video we learned how addition and multiplication have this nice property called the commutative property now we're going to learn a new property that addition and multiplication both have and it's the associative property so addition is associative let's start with 
,,addition here so a plus B as a group plus C is the same thing as a plus the group B plus C so really it tells us something about how we're grouping addition where we write these parentheses and really it's saying it doesn't matter where we write them because they're they're the same so let's see an example nine plus three plus five and we'll do nine plus three as a group well this is equal to 9 plus the group 5 plus 3 or 3 plus 5 so 9 plus 3 is 12 plus 5 and then on the other side we're going to get 9 plus 8 12 plus 5 is 17 9 Plus 8 is 17 and so we can see the associative property an accident action doesn't matter where we put the parentheses the both 
,,sides are equal since it doesn't matter where we put the parentheses what we're gonna do is just drop them the parentheses don't tell us anything interesting so we don't need them it doesn't matter where we put them so why put them anywhere okay so that was addition multiplication is the same multiplication is associative so we 
,,write that as a times B as a group times C is equal to a times the group B times C so it's the same thing and let's see an example of this five times three as a group is equal to five times the group 3 times 2 so 5 times 3 is 15 times 2 and then on the other side we'll get 5 times 6 and 15 times 2 is 30 5 times 6 is 30 so you can see that both sides are equal if you're wondering if anything isn't associative in the next video we'll see that subtraction is not associative and we'll see how that works okay see you then we have two groups of marbles on screen 5 blue marbles and 2 red marbles and if I asked you to tell me how many total marbles marbles are there some of you might write well there's five blue ones plus two red ones so there's seven marbles in total but some of you might start counting with the red and 
,,you'd say there's two red ones plus five blue ones which still gives you a total of seven marbles so the important thing here is that five plus two is equal to two plus five it doesn't matter which order we add in because we're counting the same number of marbles and this is a really important property of addition it's called the commutative property of addition and it says that if we have any two numbers and B then a plus B is equal to B plus a so it doesn't matter which order we add two numbers in then we have something similar for multiplication so let me write some dots on screen here and I want you to count how many doubt dots there are on screen 
,,or tell me how many you don't have to count them but tell me how many dots there some of you might say well there's five groups of three here's a group of three and 
,,there's five of them so that's five groups of three or in other words five times three and so there's fifteen dots on-screen others of you might look at it a little 
,,bit differently instead of seeing five groups of three maybe you see three groups of five so here's a group of five and there's three of those so that's three times 
,,five which still gives us 15 total dots on-screen so again the important thing here is that five times three is equal to three times five and there's nothing special about five and three this works for any two numbers so this is the commutative property of multiplication and we write a times B is equal to B times a so given any 
,,two numbers you can multiply them in either order you like these two properties seem simple the commutative property of addition and the commutative property of multiplication and they are simple but they're really important so they'll be good to know okay see in the next video I want to talk to you about simplifying fractions or what's sometimes called cancelling fractions so let's start with the basics five divided by five is what it's 1 right any number divided by itself is just one so negative 1131 divided by itself again is just one what about fractions something like 3/7 divided by three sevenths well a fraction is just a number and so we're dividing it by itself so we get one what about zero zero divided by zero well this is not equal to one this is the only exception and it's because we can't divide by zero if we tried to divide by zero the the universe would split open and your mother would cry it just would be terrible so zero divided by zero is undefined and that's the only exception so we end up with this nice little rule if a is not equal to zero then a divided by itself is equal to one so what does this have to do with canceling fractions well let's see a really simple example two divided by four is the same thing as 2 times 1 divided by 2 times 2 well because we know the way fractions multiply that's the same as 2 over 2 times 1 over 2 but 2 over 2 we just talked about that's just 1 so we're left with 1 times 1 over 2 or in other words 1/2 and 1 
,,times anything is just that same so we're just left with 1/2 so it took us quite a few steps but we simplified to fourth to one half let's see another example six over twenty-seven well six is three times two and 27 is 3 times 9 and again we can split this up into two fractions so we end up with 3 divided by 3 times 2 divided by 9 the 3 over 3 that just becomes a 1 so we're left with 1 times 2 over 9 which of course is just a 2 over 9 so now this is taking a lot of writing it takes quite a 
,,few steps so maybe we want to abbreviate this we know how everything's gonna work out we're gonna end up multiplying by 1 so instead of writing out those steps we're gonna do something like this let's see it let's see this again only with an abbreviation so 6 over 27 is 3 times 2 over 3 times 9 and we know that 3 is gonna cancel to 1 so we'll just cross it out and that's an abbreviation for those steps underlined and orange and we end up with 2 ninths okay so this can actually be really useful let's combine simplifying fractions and what we're doing in this video with some things we've already learned what if we had something like 3 times 3 over 40 7 times 2 over 13 sorry at 13 times 3 over 40 7 times 2 over 13 times 47 well it looks like the 13 in the denominator there and the 13 on the Left maybe will cancel and the the 47 in the denominator and the 47 on the right might cancel so since multiplication is commutative something we've already learned we can rearrange this any 
,,way we want so we'll rearrange it this way let's put the 13s together and the 47s together also multiplication is associative which means we can group it any way we 
,,want so not let's not only put them next to each other but let's actually group them and now we know the way fractions multiply that's something we've already learned 3 times 2 over 13 is just 30 or sorry 13 times 2 over 13 it's just 13 times 2 over 13 we get something similar over on the right hand side and now we can just cancel but let's since this is our first example let's just go through one more step so 13 times 2 over 13 times 1 right 13 is the same as 13 times 1 so we'll just put that one in there and 3 times 47 is the same as 47 times 3 and 47 is the same as 47 times 1 and now we're all set to cancel so we're just left with 2 over 1 times 3 over 1 while 2 over 1 is just 2 & 3 over 1 is just 3 so this is 2 times 3 which is equal to 6 and it took those quite a few steps because I wanted to write everything out so we can see how this works but the the main point here is that we can use all of our rules to simplify that net multiplication okay what if we have addition instead of multiplication can we cancel then something like this well the answer is definitely no doing something like that is wrong you don't want to do that why not well let's see if we cancelled we'd be left with 1/3 so instead of canceling let's see what happens if we just do this addition and try and simplify so 5 plus 1 is 
,,6 5 plus 3 is 8 and then we're left with 6 is 2 times 3 8 is 2 times 4 and now we know those twos cancel and we're just left with 3/4 well 3/4 certainly is not the same thing as 1/3 if we had cancelled the 5s originally we would have gotten 1/3 but of course 3/4 does not equal 1/3 so that's just an example of why this doesn't work out it really it doesn't work out because we need to be multiplying by something over itself because when we're multiplying by something over itself we're really 
,,just multiplying by one and that's where the simplification comes from but when we have addition we don't have any multiplication so we're certainly not multiplying 
,,by one okay see you in the next video I want to talk to you about division but before we do that we should do some review of fractions so if we want to multiply two 
,,fractions a over B times C over D we just multiply across the top so a times C and then multiply across the bottom so B times D really simple multiplying fractions is really easy so let's see an example three over five times two over seven well we just get three times two in the numerator over five times seven and in the denominator so it's just six over 35 really really basic stuff let's do another example how about negative 5 over 8 times 9 over 11 well this is just negative 5 times 9 over 8 times 11 and negative 5 times 9 is negative 45 and 8 times 11 is 88 just to be thorough why don't we do one more example and then we'll talk about something different how about 1/3 times 40 over 41 well 1 times 40 is just 40 over 3 times 41 so this is 40 over 123 okay so we figured out how to multiply fractions it's really really simple but you might have a question lingering and that question is how do I multiply a number by a fraction we know how to multiply fractions by fractions but let's see an example of multiplying just a number by a fraction in integer so for example 7 times 2/3 well the key to doing this is just to remember that 7 is equal to 7 over 1 so we can turn 7 into a fraction and now we have 7 over 1 times 2 over 3 which of course is 7 times 2 over 3 times 1 which is just 3 so we have 14 thirds 14 over 3 now this comes up so often we can single it out as its own special case so we can write our own rule for a number times a fraction a times C over D is equal to a times C over D and now if we just use this rule here that we derived we'll have 7 times 2/3 is just equal to 7 times 2 over 3 which of course is 14 thirds so all we did was we skipped this step where we wrote 7 as 7 over 1 we don't need to really write that every time as long as we understand how all this works okay I hope that was a good review see in the next video I want to talk to you about subtraction subtraction is kind of nasty it has it doesn't have very many good properties that we like for instance 6 minus 2 is not equal to 2 minus 6 why because 6 minus 2 is 4 and 2 minus 6 is negative 4 so obviously 4 is not equal to negative 4 so subtraction is not commutative and the example we just gave is 6 minus 2 is not equal to 2 minus 6 there's other things wrong with subtraction for instance subtraction is not associative so an example of that would be 9 minus 4 grouped minus 1 is not equal to 9 minus parentheses 4 minus 1 and we can go through this just to prove 
,,it to ourselves 9 minus 4 is 5 minus 1 and then on the other side we have 9 well 4 minus 1 is 3 so 9 minus 3 those are not equal because 5 minus 1 is 4 and 9 minus 3 is 6 so subtraction is not associative and there's another reason subtraction is not that great but first let's just write our example down so our example here was 
,,9 minus 4 parentheses minus 1 or parentheses 9 minus 4 and parentheses minus 1 is not equal to 9 minus parentheses 4 minus 1 okay another reason that subtraction is 
,,not that great is because sometimes it can be confusing with the order of operations so for instance 10 minus 6 plus 2 maybe we're not sure should we do subtraction 
,,first or should we do the addition first so we think of the order of operations parentheses exponents multiplication division addition and subtraction and that looks like we're supposed to do addition first addition becomes where comes before subtraction so this would be 10 minus 8 which would be 2 but that's wrong that is the wrong answer what we forgot is that what the order of operations really says is then what is when you have only subtraction and addition left do everything from left 
,,to right so this is really 10 minus 6 which is 4 plus 2 which is equal to 6 and that's the right answer so the third reason subtraction isn't that great is because subtraction can be confusing with the order of operations if we're not careful in our example for this one is 10 minus 6 plus 2 but all is not lost there's something 
,,we can do we can actually turn subtraction into addition because a minus B is an abbreviation for a plus negative B so let's look at our first example how would that work well 6 minus 2 is equal to 6 plus negative 2 and now since we're doing addition we know this is commutative so we can change the order so now we have negative 
,,2 plus 6 notice in this example the negative sign stays with the 2 in our original example the negative sign went to the 6 that was the problem the negative sign was on the wrong number okay so when we think of subtraction as addition of a negative number we get commutativity back look a little note about the notation here why do we put parentheses around the negative sign it's really because doing it that way is ugly and unclear and you might even confuse somebody if you're if you're not very neat so instead what we do is we put parentheses around the negative sign so that everything is really clear if we look at this it's very clear what we mean we mean 6 plus negative 2 and now anybody looking at that will know exactly what you mean ok so that's just a note about why we put parentheses around the negative sign 
,,let's talk about what happens it with associativity when we think of subtraction as addition of a negative number well subtraction really does become associative again because we're turning it into addition so let's just look at our example here 9 minus 4 from the parentheses 9 minus 4 in parentheses minus 1 is equal to 9 plus negative 4 plus negative 1 and now this is all addition and since addition is associative it doesn't matter where we put the parentheses we could put them around the 
,,9 plus the negative 4 or we could put them around the negative 4 plus the negative 1 and why don't you try doing that at home see if you get the same answer you should because addition is associative ok and finally let's look at our third example does this fix the problem so 10 minus 6 plus 2 if we think of this as 10 plus negative 6 plus 2 now if we do the negative 6 plus the 2 first we would get negative 4 from that so 10 plus negative 4 which is equal to 6 so even though we did the negative 6 plus the 2 first we got the right answer ok so the important thing to take away from this video is that subtraction is not commutative and it's not associative but we can think of subtraction as addition of a negative number and then we get all those nice properties back okay see in the next video let's look at factoring a cubic polynomial so the way we're gonna do this is we're gonna factor by grouping and for now that's the only way we're gonna look at later on in the course we'll talk about factoring with the rational roots test and synthetic division and things like that but for now we're just gonna group it so how does that work well we group the first two terms together and then we add the second two terms the group of the second two so this will be X cubed plus 6x squared plus and then minus 4x minus 
,,24 so we haven't changed anything we just decided to group these into into pairs and now we factor out of each group while we can so on the left side we can get an x squared out of each term and that just becomes x squared times X plus 6 and then we have to add to that well what can we get out of the next term well we can give them entire negative 4 right this will be negative 4 times X minus sorry X plus 6 right because negative 4 times positive 6 becomes that negative 24 and now we have an X plus 6 multiplying both terms so we can just factor that out so this becomes x squared minus 4 x by X plus 6 and we're almost done but remember the difference of squares set if we have x squared minus a squared this is always going to be equal to X minus a times X minus B or sorry plus X plus a sorry there's no B involved X 
,,minus a times X plus a well that's what we have here is in this x squared minus 4 is the same as x squared minus 2 squared x by X plus 6 so now we can use the difference of squares to factor this completely into X minus 2 times X plus 2 times by oops sorry mr. parentheses up there times X plus 6 and now we're done this is as simple as as we can get this problem so we factored by grouping that's how we're gonna do it what happens if you have a coefficient in front of the X term so let's look at that what if we had something that looked like 3x cubed plus plus 9 x squared plus X plus 3 what are we going to do now well we're actually we're gonna do the exact same thing nothing changes so so when you have a cubic polynomial if it factors by grouping if this grouping method works it's really really quite simple so we're just going to set up our groups here and we have 3x cubed plus 9x squared plus X plus 3 well what can we factor out of out of the group on the left we can take out an entire 3x squared right and now we'll just be left with on the inside we'll be left with just an X plus 3 right and now plus well what's common 2x + 3 the only thing common to both of those actually is just the number 1 right 1 times X is still X and 1 times 3 is still 3 so we're gonna factor out of 1 it's it's really not factoring it out it's always been there but we're gonna write it just to make this more clear and now we have an x + 3 common to both terms so we factor that out so this becomes 3x squared plus one x by x plus three and that's as simple as we can get this particular problem but as you can see factoring by grouping is it makes makes these problems really easy so until we talk about the rational roots test this is the only way we're going to try and factor cubic polynomials okay see in the next video

AlgebraicExpression,_ExCEHUIIUI,hello children today i'm here to teach you chapter 12 in your textbook that's algebraic expression so this is an algebra unit and it's really important to learn so in this lesson we are constructing algebraic expressions simplify algebraic expressions and finding the value of algebraic expressions by substituting numbers look at this one how many apples are there so you get five apples one two three four five so there are five apples in this figure how many cars are there one two three three cars in this figure how many bottles are there one two three four four bottles in this figure so above information can be written in numbers 5 3 4 are numbers look at this one here eggs are there in a container can we count it's difficult to cut we cannot identify how many eggs are there in the container so we can take x x number of eggs are there in this container so we know we can count but here it's difficult to count we have to take one at a time and count so we call that is a known variable x is the number of x so we can count and find out the value of x what about this one rice grains are there so can we count we cannot count the number of rice grain in the bowl so we can take y letter y as the number of rice grain so we can't count that it's very difficult so we can take a letter for that number of rice grain is y look at this glass container this it contains water but can we identify the amount we can't identify so we can take any letter so we can take x liters x liters of water profit varies from one day to another day for a tuk-tuk driver it can be named as why rupees where y is a variable so it changes all the time so we can use algebraic terms to denote changing values use letters in the english alphabet so you can use any letter abc any letter in the english alphabet psre has x rupees and gina siri has two rupees find the total amount of money that both have so that means we need to add x rupees plus two rupees that's the total number rough money so total amount of money both have look at this question age of mala is x x years grandfather is five times of age as mala write down grandfather's age in terms of 
,,x so how can we write down so we can write grandfather's age is equal to 5 times x because x is the age of mala so you can write without the multiplication sign i can write this is as 5x so what's the grandfather's age 5x write the answers at once 5 times x i can write without the multiplication sign 5x x times 7. here when you 
,,are multiplying we normally put the number in the front so 7x not x7 you say 7x 5 into y 5y y into 11 11y 13 into a 13 a and a into b a b you don't need to write down this multiplication sign when you are multiply but when you are multiplying two numbers you have to use a multiplication sign look at this question length of a log is p meters find the length of a log 2 meters more than twice the length of the previous log what's the new length length of a lock 2 meters more that means 2 plus 
,,twice the length of the previous log previous log is p twice the length of the previous 2 p 2 plus 2 p is the length of the new log price of a book is 40 rupees find the price of 5 books so we can multiply 40 times 5 so you get 4 times 5 20 so 200 rupees so when you get numbers you can multiply and write down the number find the price of x number of books so that's 40 times x 40 times x you can write as 40x no need to write down the multiplication sign find the price of y number of books so 40 is one book you can write 45 price of four kilos of sugar is p rupees price of one kilo so that means you have to divide this by 4 p over 4 price of 5 kilos of sugar so this is 1 kilo you can multiply by five so p over four for one kilo multiply by five you get the price of five kilo of sugar so we can write this number as five p over four five times p five p divided by four sheila's age is x years father's age is five times of sheila's age fine father's age five times x so you can write five x years mother's age is four times of sheila's age so what's sheila's age x so four times means i can write as four x sheila's sister is half of sheila's h so what's the sheila's age you can write x over 2 or half into x half of sheila's h so you can write x over 2 without writing half into x we can write x over 2. grandfather's age is 52 years older than sheila so how can we write grandfather's age x plus 52 grandmother's age is 48 years more than sheila so we need to add 48 to x that's x plus 48. write down algebraic expressions add 3 to a a plus 3 subtract 7 from b b minus 7 add 5 to 3 times of x 3 times of x 3x at 5. add 7 to half of y 7 plus half of y i can write y over 2 half into y same as y over 2. add q to twice of p add q to twice of p to p add five times of x and three times of y five times of x 
,,is five x three times of y is three y so add those two values add three times of q 3q and half of p half of p i can write p over 2. write down the following algebraic expressions in words what can you write x plus 7 add 7 to x add 7 to x here subtract 8 from y subtract 8 from y this one add three two twice of e add three two twice of a this one add three times of x and three times of x and two times of y so add these two add three times of x and two times of y look at this one this is divided by 3 divided by 5 so we can say one third of a one-fifth of b so you can say subtract you can say subtract one fifth of b from one third of a so one third of a here one fifth of b is here so subtract one fifth of b from one third of a this one you can say first the numerator add 3 2 twice of x twice of x and then answer divide by 5. so you get first 2x plus 3 add 3 to twice of x and divide by 5. look at this diagram perimeter is the outer length of a closed figure you already know that find the perimeter of the above figure so how we find our perimeter r x r r plus r plus x so we know we can add like terms r and r you can write 2r 2r plus x find the perimeter of this figure so this is a square all sides are the same x so what's the perimeter perimeter is equal to x plus x plus x plus x so we can add the like terms and write this is 4x so the perimeter of this square is 4x find the perimeter of the rectangle with length l and breadth b breadth is b so if this is b this is also b this is l so what's the perimeter you can add outer length of the figure l plus b plus l plus b now we can add the like terms i can write l plus l b plus b then l plus l is 2l and this is 2b i can even take 2 out and write l plus p so that's the perimeter of the rectangle look at this diagram need x centimeter length of wire to make a circular wire so this is a wire circular wire so you need x centimeter length find the length of wire needed to make three circles so we can say this is x another one is x the third one is also x x and x and x you get 3x from the above three circles can make a square find the length of one side of a square so three 
,,circles total length is 3x so how can we find out one side of a square length of one side of a square so if y length is one side y y y y so 4 y equals 3x so we need 
,,to divide this by 4 to get one length so length of one side is the total length is 3x divide by 4 you get length of one side look at this diagram find the perimeter 
,,of the figure perimeter is outer length so i can add r plus x plus r like terms i can add it together so 2r plus 6. price of a pen is four rupees more than the price of a pencil if price of a pencil is p rupees find the price of a pen price of a pencil is rupees p the pen is four rupees more than that so p plus four petrol needed to travel x kilometers is three liters find the distance can travel with one liter so we can say three liters x kilometers 3 liters x kilometer so we need 1 liter 
,,x divided by 3. so we can say x divided by three kilometers one third of x find the perimeter of the triangle all lengths are given so just add it at the outer length x plus y plus c so you can't simplify because these are not like terms algebraic terms and constants take a look at 2x plus 3 that's an algebraic expression combination of several terms algebraic terms in terms of unknown letters so we can say algebraic term is 2x and 3 we say it's a constant when you look at this one what are the algebraic terms there 3y is an algebraic then minus 5x is also an algebraic term and 8 is a constant 8 is a constant term look at this expression what are the algebraic terms i can write 2a 3b and 7c those are algebraic terms and the constant term is 8. coefficients of algebraic expressions so look at this one when you take 2x algebraic term the number in front of the unknown letter we call it's a coefficient so coefficient of x is 2 coefficient of y is 3 so what about the coefficient 
,,of a here when you close a you get the coefficient of a that's 5. what's the coefficient of b when you close b you get minus 4. you have to consider the sign as well look at this algebraic expression what is the coefficient of x squared that's 3 coefficient of y squared that's plus 5 constant term is minus 2. look at this algebraic expression coefficient of a that's 2 coefficient of b nothing there nothing there means this is just 1. so the coefficient of b is 1. what's the constant term minus 8 fill in the blanks algebraic expressions are there you have to write down number of algebraic terms and total number of terms how many algebraic terms are there one term all together how many terms are there two terms here two terms are there out of that one algebraic two terms are there and one algebraic here also two terms are there one unknown litter that's algebraic term one two three three terms are there out of three two terms are algebraic terms one two three terms are there how many algebraic terms one two the other one is a constant here one two three algebraic expressions are there all three are unknowns with letters three algebraic terms two terms are there and both are algebraic terms fill in the blanks algebraic expression is there number of algebraic terms and total number of terms two terms are there out of that one algebraic two terms are there and one algebraic term that's why only one term is there that's an algebraic term two terms are there one unknown later that's one algebraic term two terms are there and one algebraic term two terms are there and here one algebraic term look at this algebraic expression number of terms in the algebraic expression one two three four what's the constant term just the number without any unknown letters that's 9. write down algebraic terms 3x squared 5xy minus 7y squared those are algebraic terms what's the coefficient of x squared the number in front of x square that's 3 coefficient of y squared that's minus 7 and coefficient of x y that's 5. now we'll see how we can simplify algebraic expressions here total number of apples we can write here 3 three and two three plus two that's you get five total number of mangoes here three total number of oranges that's two so as these are not the same type cannot add together so we can't say total number of fruits we can't add apples with mangoes and oranges they are totally different so like these are not like terms so we can't add so we can say separately number of apples 5 number of mangoes 3 and number of oranges 2. so these are like terms when you get same term x terms these are like terms so you can add like terms but when you take this one x y p q total different letters you can't add it together when simplifying algebraic expressions only can add or subtract the like term same letters a plus a plus a you can say that's 3 a this is like 1 1 1 x plus x plus x plus x 4 times you are adding that's 4x 3 and plus 2 you can add and say 5a that's how we add like terms 5x plus 7x we can write 12x 2 plus 3 5. 5 minus 4 1 1 m or you can write just m without writing 1. now can we add x and y no but we can add these two those are like terms 8 plus 3 11 x but you can't add y term so you can write as it is minus 2y this one add like terms 4a and 2a 4 plus 2 6a and 
,,b terms you can add 3b plus b 4b now look at carefully now what are the terms x squared terms these two you can and these two you can add 4 plus 3 7 but the term is 
,,x squared and 5x and 3x you can write 8x look at this one a squared terms you can add this and this and a terms you can subtract 3a squared plus 2a squared 5a squared and 5a minus 3a that's 5-3 2 2a this one m terms and n terms so m terms you can simplify n terms separately 4 plus 7 11 m minus 3 minus 2 adding minus 5 in minus 3 minus 2 becomes minus 5. 2p and 7p that's 9p and 3 plus 4 7. a terms you can add 2a and 5a that's 7a 3b minus b that's 2 b 3 minus 1 first write the like terms next to each other and then simplify so you can do that without taking separately 2 a and 3 a you can write together 3 b and minus b you can write it together 2 plus 3 5 3 minus 1 you get 2b now write it together x terms 5x minus 2 x these two you can add it 7y minus 31 subtract 5 minus 2 3 3x 7 minus 3 you get plus 4 y what are the like terms here a squared and 2 a square then 2a and 5a three and one now edit a squared and two a square this is like one one plus two three two and plus 5 that's 
,,7 and 3 plus 1 you get 4. these ones you can write together first 2p squared you can't do anything 3p and 8p you can write together and 810 minus 2. so 2p squared these two we can add 8 plus 3 11p 8 minus 2 you get 6. this one like terms you can add separately to 9xn 2x y terms 3y and 5y and minus 4 and minus 2 you get minus 6 i'll write it separately first minus 4 and minus 2. now we'll add 9 plus 2 11 3 plus 5 8 and minus 4 minus 2 minus 6. like terms you can add or subtract this one p terms first 8p minus 2p q terms 7q and 3q and 4 you can write separately so 8 minus 2 6 7 plus 3 10 and 4 you can add separately that's a constant look at this one write down algebraic expressions for the perimeter of the following figures so how can we write down the perimeter outer length x plus x plus 4 plus y now you can add like terms x and x you can write 2x plus 4 plus y so we can't add again because the others are not like terms it's a triangle what's the perimeter add outer length 2a 2a 2a all lengths are equal this is an equilateral triangle so 2 plus 2 4 4 plus 2 6 6a perimeter of this figure eight is one side in x a another a x and t now add 
,,like terms x and x 2x and a 2a then 8 plus 10 18. so you get the perimeter 2x plus 2a plus 18. substituting values in algebraic expressions we'll try to substitute and find the answer find the value of 3x plus 5 when x equals 2 so what we do we take the value of 2 and substitute instead of x so three instead of x i can plug two 
,,now according to bodmus multiplication first starting from left three times two 6 6 plus 5 you get 11. find the value of 5x plus 3y when x equals 3 and y equals 2. substitute five times three because x is three three times two y is two now multiplication first five times three fifteen three times 2 6 15 plus 6 you get 21 find the value of 7 a minus 2 b plus 5 when a equals 2 and b equals 3 we substitute a equals 2 b equals 3 multiplication first 7 times two fourteen then these two three times two six plus five then you can start from left and two subtraction and addition fourteen minus eight fourteen minus six that's eight eight plus five thirteen find the value of following expressions when x equals to substitute here not x a equals to substitute a equals to 2 times 2 plus 8 multiplication first 2 times 2 4 4 plus 8 12. 7 plus 3a 7 plus 3 times 2. so you get 7 plus 3 times 2 6 6 plus 7 you get 13 a squared plus 5 so a equals 2. 2 squared plus 5. what's 2 squared 2 times 2 so what's 2 times 2 4 4 plus 5 you get 9. 4 plus 5a equals 2 5 times 2 according to botmus multiplication first 5 times 210 10 plus 4 that's 14. find the value of following expressions when a equals 6 and b equals 3. so substitute a equals 6 6 squared b is 3 3 squared 6 squared means 6 times 6 36 3 times 3 you get 9. so what's the 36 and 9 when you add you get 9 plus 6 15 and 1 remaining 3 plus 1 4 45 10 a b that means multiplication 10 a is 6 and b is 3. so 10 times 6 60 60 times 3 you get 6 times 3 a 18 and put a 0 180 a plus 7 b what's a a6 b3 6 plus 7 times 3 b is 3. so 6 7 times 3 21 21 plus 6 you get 27 what about 7a plus 2 b 7 a a is 6 2 b 2 times 3 so 7 times 6 42 3 times 2 6 42 plus 6 just add it you get 40 8. find the value when x equals 2 and y equals 1 two plus one two plus one is three now subtraction two minus one that's one now substitute here 3x means 3 times x 3 times 2 5 times y that's 1. so what's 3 times 2 6 5 times 1 5. six plus five eleven two x plus seven y two times x x is two y is one two times two four seven times one seven four plus seven you get eleven find the value when a equals four and b equals 6 we'll substitute a is 4 4 divided by 2 b is 6 divided by 3 what's 4 divided by 2 you get 2. 6 divided by 3 2. so 2 plus 2 4 this one a is 4 4 divided by 4 and b is 6 6 divided 
,,by 6. what's 4 divided by 4 you get 1 6 divided by 6 is 1 1 plus 1 you get 2 a squared plus b squared so what's their value a is 4 b is so 4 squared and 6 square so 
,,what's 4 squared means 4 times 4 16 6 times 6 36 now add this 6 and 6 12 1 remaining 4 plus 1 5 52 a square that means 4 square plus 2 times a a is four four squared four times four you get sixteen two times four that's eight sixteen plus eight you get 24. now we look at the exercises and examples in your textbook example number one the letter m represent a number of unknown value write in terms of m the number which is 3 times the given number 3 times the given number means 3 f write in terms of m the number which is 15 more than twice the given number 15 more than that's addition twice the given number 15 plus 2m exercise 12.1 construct an algebraic 
,,expression for the price of five apples by taking the price of one apple is a rupees so a rupees into 5 you can say 5a 5a rupees the price of a pineapple is 10 rupees more than the price of five apples construct an algebraic expression for the price of a pineapple in terms of a so what's the price of pineapple 10 rupees more than the price of 5 apples price of 5 apples is 5a so this is the price of a pineapple question number two a shop owner buys 12 loaves of bread from a bakery at b rupees per loaf he then sells these loaves so that each loaf brings him a profit of three rupees what is the total amount the shop owner pays for the loaves of bread he buys 12 lobes one is b rupees so what's that you can write as 12 b rupees that's the buying price what is the selling price of a loaf of bread so he take profit of three rupees from each low so what is the selling price of a loaf of bread the buying price is b that's b plus 3. that's b plus 3 rupees a customer buys a loaf of bread and 500 grams of sugar the price of one kilogram of sugar is 80 rupees what is the total amount the customer spends now see a customer buys a loaf of bread so what's the price now b plus 3 and 500 grams of sugar the price of 1 kilogram of sugar is 80. so what's half a kilo one kilo of sugar is 80 rupees so what's half a kilo that means you need to divide by 2 80 divided by 2 you get 40 rupees so that's for sugar and what's the price for the loaf that's p plus 3. so what is the total amount total is b plus 3 plus 40 rupees so you can edit and write down b plus 43. another question one meter is 100 centimeters we know the conversion the length of a table is k centimeters more than 2 meters so what's the total length 2 plus k express the length of the table in centimeters in terms of k meters and centimeters so you can't add so 2 meters means 2 times 100 200 centimeters so the length is 200 plus k both in centimeters the width of this table is 50 centimeter less than its length write the width as an expression of k so width is equal to 50 less than that so the length is 200 plus k minus 50. so what's the length 200 minus 50 is 150 plus k 
,,this is also in centimeters example number one if more than one meter of cloth is bought then the price of one meter is p rupees if less than one meter of cloth is bought then an additional 10 rupees is charged write the price of half a meter of cloth as an algebraic expression so if it's more than one meter then you have to pay p rupees if less than one meter if cloth is bought then an additional 10 rupees is charged so additional 10 rupees so p plus 10. write the price of half a meter half a meter means less than one meter so you have to take this one so write the price of half of a meter of cloth as an algebraic expression so one meter is p rupees so half half of a meter what's the price p over 2 but additional charge is 10 rupees so the price becomes p over 2 plus 10 this is in rupees example number 2 a father sells the three plots of land he owns at p rupees per plot he then divides the money he receives equally among his four children right the amount of money received 
,,by each child as an algebraic expression so what's the price he got it by selling three plots so the price is one plot is p and three plots so three p now that's the total amount so now he divides into four equal parts four children are there so what's the money received by each child amount of money per child so this amount 3p 
,,you need to equally divide by 4. so 3p over 4. exercise 12.2 complete the following table algebraic expression is there unknown constant or variable in the algebraic expression and terms of the algebraic expression so what are the terms so a over 2 and 5. two terms are there out of that unknown constant or variable in the algebraic expression is a here two terms are there p over 4 and minus 8. so what's the unknown letter here p in this expression you get x over 5 and 10. x is the unknown letter here also you get two terms 25 and y over three what's the unknown letter that's why question number two construct an algebraic expression for each of the following situations the value of a number is denoted by a what is the value of the number that is greater by 4 then half the value of the given number so value becomes 
,,greater by 4 plus half the value of the given number a over two in a restaurant a loaf of bread is sold for pee rupees a person buys quarter of a loaf of bread so that means p over 4 is the price and a dish of dal the dish of dal cost 30 rupees that's 30. write an algebraic expression for the total amount of money the person has to pay p over four that's quarter of a loaf of bread and the dish of dal is 30 rupees so i'll write this is rupees the height of a building is 5 meters less than half of its length if its length is l meters write the height as an expression of l so height becomes 5 meters less than half of the length that's l half of l minus 5 
,,so this is in meters the price of 1 kilo of sugar is y if 100 rupees note is tender then half a kilo of sugar is bought write the balance as an algebraic expression 
,,so that what's the cost of half of a sugar half a kilo of sugar y over two because y for 1 kilo divided by 2 then the balance balance becomes 100 rupees you give minus y over 2 that's the balance he receives question number three the price of a box of pencils containing 12 pencils is x rupees write the price of one pencil as an 
,,algebraic expression so 12 pencils is x rupees so one is x over 12. one pencil is x over 12. if the price of an eraser is 10 rupees right the amount of money required to buy two pencils and and one eraser so what's the price it's to buy two pencils one pencil is this two pencils means you have to multiply this by two and 1 eraser eraser is 10 rupees so what's the total here you can simplify 2 times 1 and 2 times 6. so i can write this one as x over 6 plus 10. question number 4 write the expressions given below in words the expression 5 a minus 8 can be expressed in words as it says the value which is 8 less than the value of 5 times a 8 less than the value of 5 times a what can we write here 2a plus 8. so we can say the value which is 8 more than so we'll write according to this one the value which is eight more than 5 times of a more than 2 times of 2 times of a instead of 5 times of a you can write 2 times of a this one is 15 less we can write the value which is 15 less than 3 times of x three times off of x this one we can write you can expand first and right so if you expand it's 2p plus 10 or without expanding how can we write the value 5 more than p double it we can write first p plus 5 what is the value means p plus 5 you can write the value which is 5 more than p the value which is 5 more than p double it or then and then double it that means we are multiplying by 2. or you can write this is like 2p plus 10 when you expand brackets then you can write the value which is 10 more than twice of p this one the value which is 4 less than 1 4 of b p over 4 means one-fourth of this one 5 times p less than 20 the value which is five times p less than twenty this one plus fourteen the value which is 14 more than half of x x over 2 means half of x this one one less the value which is one less than one-fifth of five y over five 1 5 5 here 30 more adding 30. so the value which is 30 more than p over 2 p over 2 means half of p half of p now this one this part is less than 45 so we can write the value which is one third of y one third off by less than 45 example number one there are a number of boys and b number of girls in a class write the total number of students in the class as an algebraic expression so a and b so you can't add so we can write that's as a plus b so that's a plus b you can't add these because these are not like terms write the algebraic expression x over 2 plus y over 2 inwards we can write sum of total total or sum of half of x and half of phi sum of half of x and half of y example 2 25 coconuts were bought at 8 rupees each and all 25 fruits were sold at b rupees each assume that b is greater than a write an algebraic expression for the profit so what's the buying price 25 coconuts were bought at 8 rupees each so buying price a into 25 we can write 25a and 25 fruits were sold at b rupees age selling price so 1 is b rupees and this is 25 b now we know b is greater than a so how we find out the profit we know that b is greater than a so the selling price is more than buying price so we can say profit is equal to selling price minus the buying price we can take 25 out and write 25 v minus a or you can keep the answer as 25 b minus 25 a exercise 12.3 construct algebraic expressions for the following a number is represented by a what is a number that is greater than a by b that means more than b a plus b a number is represented by p write the number less that is less than p by q that means subtract q from p the price of a coconut is x rupees the price of one kilo of rice is what write an expression in terms of x and y for the price of four coconuts and three kilos of rice four coconuts that's 4x three kilos of rice one kilo is y y times three three y so that's the price total price in trophies next one the price of 
,,one kilo of sugar is x rupees and price of 250 grams packet of tea is y rupees find the amount of money required to buy 2 kilos and 500 grams of sugar and two packets of tea so we know one kilo is x rupee so two kilos 2x so 1 kilo is x rupees what about 500 grams that means half of a kilo so x over 2 that's the total price for sugar now here we'll take the common denominator convert to 2 this becomes 4 4 x over 2 and x over 2 and you can add it same denominator so 5 x over 2 and what about 
,,the price for t two t packets one t packet is y rupees so 2 y so what's the total total is 5x over 2 and 2y so this is in rupees 250 grams means one-fourth of a kilogram one kg of potato is extra peas a bundle of green leaves is by rupees write an algebraic expression for the amount paid if 250 grams of potatoes and a bundle of 
,,green leaves are bought so what's the total price 250 means one-fourth of a kilo kilo is x so we need x over 4 that's for potatoes and a bundle of green leaves that's what so the total amount paid is x over 4 plus y this one there are x number of singular books and y number of english books in the school library half the single 
,,books and half the english books are literature books if the library has issued 23 singular literature books and 18 english literature books then express the number 
,,of literature books remaining in the library as an algebraic expression so first we need to find out number of literature books for their number of literature books 
,,it says half of sinhala books and half of english books are literature books half of sinhala books that's y over two half of english books that's x over so singular 
,,books x over 2 and english books y over 2. so that's the number of literature books how many books given books given 23 and it says 18 english books so all together 
,,41 so what's the remaining remaining literature books so you have to subtract x over 2 plus y over 2 that's the total number where they are and 41 given and the remaining is the difference between those two write the following expressions in words so we can write this is addition sum of 3 times x and 5i 5 times y now it's a difference so how can we write the difference subtract 7 times b from 2 times a this one how can we write we can write first these two subtract y from one fourth of x quarter of x quarter of x and then at 5. you can write after that you need to add 5 to the answer this one will take these two sum off 2 times k and 3 times p and subtract eight example number one simplify the following so when you want to simplify you can add or subtract like terms so we'll write like terms first 3x 5 x if you take k terms that's 6 k and 3 k and then 7. so these two you get 8x these two 9k and then 7 separately this one first a terms 5a and 3a b terms b minus b constant terms eight minus five so five a and three a eighty b and b you get zero eight minus five that's three example number two there are 25 boys and 15 girls in grade 4 class there are 28 boys and 11 girls in grade 5 class the price of a pen is p rupees and the price of an eraser is q rupees find the total amount of money needed to give 
,,a pen to each boy in grade 4 and erase it to each girl in grade 4 and erase it to each boy in grade 5 and append to each girl in grade 5. so we'll take grade 4. girls boys there are 25 boys and 15 girls in grade 4. grade 5 28 boys and 11 girls the price of a pen is p rupees and the price of erase is q rupees find the total amount of money needed to give a pin to each boy in grade four so pins given to each boy what's the price of a pen p then an eraser to each girl in grade four what's the 
,,price of an eraser okay so that means you have to multiply by q here then an eraser to each boy in grade five so eraser is q so 28 times q and a pen that's p rupees 
,,for each girl in grade 5. so that's the total you have to find out the total is 15 q 25 p 11 p and 28 q so like terms 15 q and 28 q and p terms 25 p and 11 p so when you add it 43 q and here when you add it you get 36 p so that's the total price exercise 12.4 simplify the following so we can add like terms all that straight away 4x plus 3x 7x and you can't add 5y and 7. this one only 4 and 3 you can add 3a plus 6b plus 7 4 plus 3 you get 7. here 5p minus 2p that's 3p q and q you get 5 q this one 10 m and minus 4 m 6 m these two you can subtract 10 minus 7 that's 3. so 3n this one what are the like terms 3k and k you get 4k 5l and 4l you get 9 l and 10 
,,minus 5 you get plus 5. what about this one 8x and x you get 9x these two 7 minus 4 plus 3y and 13 and minus 11 you get 2 13 minus 11 that's 2. write an algebraic expression for the perimeter of each of the figures below simplify the expression so this is a square so what's the perimeter 2x 2x 2x and 2x so when you add you get 8x this one a rectangle so what's the perimeter 2y another 2y 3x and another 3x so when you add it you get 4y and 6x 3 plus 3 you get 6 6x what's the perimeter here this is a triangle just add all the outer lengths 3x 2p 2p plus 4. now like terms you can add these two 2 p and 2 p 4 p and 4 that's all you can add you can't add p terms with x terms this is a rectangle again what's the perimeter x plus three and another x plus three x and another x so all together how many x's are there x x x x four times four x three plus three you get six what's the perimeter here so can you see when you take this length here this length here what you get actually it's a rectangle so perimeter of a rectangle so one length with this y plus one so we can straight away find out the perimeter of this figure is y plus 1 y plus 1 and this length you get here x plus 4 another x plus 4. so like terms at x and x you get 2x y and y 2y 1 2 and then four four plus two six six plus four you get ten so that's the perimeter of this figure example number one find the value of each of the algebraic expressions given below when x equals 4 and y equals 2 so that means substitute 4 minus 2 you get 2 this one three times four minus two minus five according to budma's multiplication first three times four twelve minus two minus 5 you get minus 7 12 minus 7 that's 5. exercise 12.5 find the value of each of the algebraic expression given below when a equals four so substitute a equals four three times four twelve twelve minus five you get seven this one i can simplify inside four minus three brackets first that's one five times one you get five fifteen minus 2 and 
,,what's the a value 4 what must multiplication first 2 times 4 8. so you get 7 7 times 4 minus 5 multiplication you get 28 minus 5 you get 23 for each of the values given to x find the value of 6x plus 4 6x x is 1 plus four six plus four you get ten six times two now because x is two six times two twelve twelve plus five you get 
,,seventeen x equals five what's the expression six x plus four six x is five plus four six times five thirty thirty plus four thirty four x is twelve six times twelve plus four six times two twelve and you get seventy-two plus four that's seventy-six find the value of each of the given expressions by substituting the given values 4 x x is 4 13 y equals 1. now we'll do multiplication four times four sixteen thirteen times one thirty now you can and then subtract from left sixteen minus thirteen that's three three plus five you get eight seven a minus three b minus eight when a equals three substitute three there b equals one multiplication first 21 minus 3 minus 8. so 21 minus 8 and 3 both minus that's 11. so 21 minus 11 is 10. what's the value here 2 p equals k equals 2 2 times 6 is 12 2 minus 5 12 plus 2 14 14 minus 5 you get 9. now we look at the miscellaneous exercise the length of a room is x meters less than twice its width you can write the width of the room is 3 meters 
,,write an expression in terms of x for the length of the row what's the length the length of a room is x meters less than twice its width twice its width but x meters less so 6 minus x meters it's the length the price of a pen is x rupees and the price of 12 books is why rupees nimal buys two pens and three books write an expression for the total amount of money spent by nema total amount is equal to two pens one pin is x so that's two x three books twelve books why rupees what about one book 12 books y rupees so one book is y over twelve then three books multiply by three y over 12 multiplied by three you can simplify you get four here so you can add that amount here so what's the total amount this is in rupees 2x plus y over 4. write each expression given below in words i can write 8 more than half of y y over 2 
,,i can write half of y this is one third of a is less than less than 16 simplify the following like terms 8 a and minus 2a minus 6b and minus 3. 8 a minus 2a that's 6a 7 minus 6 you get 1b minus 3 this one like terms 6x and 6x y terms 5y and minus 3y 6x and 6x it get cancel out 5y minus 3y you get 2y find the value of each of the expressions given below when x equals 7 and y equals 3. we'll substitute x equals 7 y equals 3 6 times 7 42 5 times 3 15. now subtract you get 7 and 2 27 here substitute 7 x is 7. six times y y is three multiplication first seven times seven forty nine six times three eighty so 49 minus 3 and 18 when you add both minus so you can add 21. subtract these two you get 8 and 2 28 a father's age was 35 years at the time his son was born right the age of the father when his son is x years old so 
,,that means father's age is 35 plus x the mother is four years younger to father write the mother's age in terms of x when the sun is x years old father's age is this so 4 years younger to the father so subtract 4. so 35 minus 4 31 plus x that's mother's h how many years older is the mother than the sun so you can look at this one that's 31 years more than the sun's age 31 yes we covered all theory related to algebraic expressions so algebraic terms with the same are known are called like terms several like terms can be simplified into one term by adding or subtracting them and algebraic terms with different unknowns are called unlike terms two unlike terms cannot be simplified further into one term by adding or subtracting them so practice all exercises and example and thorough with algebraic expressions

AlgebraicExpression,Qs35Zdho4gI,good morning grades and welcome to worksheet cloud maths my name is Joe Milligan I hope you're all well today and I wish you a very happy birthday and remember although today is officially birthday birthday should be every day for us because we should be looking after our environment every single day right we're going to go into algebraic expressions today we sorry algebraic equations today we have already done algebraic expressions and the difference is that now we're going to look at how 
,,to keep a scale balanced okay using an equation so what is the difference between an expression and an equation well an expression has an unknown value and in order 
,,to find its value you need to know what the unknown value or variable is so for example 10x plus 3 we can't do anything with it because we don't know the value of the unknown the value of the it variable which in this case is X okay X is the variable we don't know its value the expression has to stay as it is but if we get given the value say we told that their baby is 5 then we can say that 10 times 5 plus 3 and we can get the value of the whole expression which is 53 so we can evaluate the expression ok but that what is the difference an equation on the other hand can will be worked out because we are given the value of the expression so in other words the output number has been given to us and then we can manipulate the whole equation to find out what the X is but remember it has to be balanced on both sides so what you do to the one side you must do to the other side and the whole point is to get X on its own to find out what the value of x is so market said this equation needs to remain balanced so in order to work out what the X is we need to eliminate the other values equally from both sides remember if you've got a scale and you 
,,add something to one side if and not to the other side it's going to become unbalanced we need to keep this equation balanced at all times so what we do to the one side we have to do to the other side and the whole point of trying to work this out is to get X on its own so if we have a look at this step by step there's our equation we've got 10 X plus 3 is equal to 53 we want X on its own so we can find out its value so what do we do we would take away their 3 on this side but we have to do the same on the other side so there we go 10 X plus 3 minus 3 which means that we have to take away the 3 on the other side can you see we've kept it balanced if we only supply the 3 on the one side it wouldn't be balanced and the equation wouldn't work out so 10 X is then equal to 50 now we have to divide this side by 10 and that side by 10 so that we can have X on its own just like that can you see how we've kept the equation balanced and we're going to end up with X is equal to 5 now we mustn't just leave it there and say okay well that's that's fine X is equal to 5 let's check it ok and by checking it we're going to substitute back into the original equation so we would go can see that our answer is 5 we've said that X is equal to 5 let's put 5 back into the original equation so we've got 10 times 5 plus 3 we can see that it's going to be 53 but let's just go through the motions okay 10 times 5 is 50 plus 3 is 53 it works well done right let's look at another one together and this time we're going to be starting from a given statement in other words a word statement so the statement is a number added to 85 is 90 we now need to make 
,,up a an equation from that and there's your equation X plus 85 is equal to 90 now remember we want to leave X on its own so in order to do that we're going to say 85 minus 85 on the side but we have to do the same on this side to keep it balanced and X is equal to 5 how do we check we then subs back in five in place of X so 5 plus 85 is equal to 90 90 and 90 balanced our scale is balanced so yummy we've got it right that means that X is equal to five that is correct okay now you try one and then we'll go over together there's your once you try pause the video work it out on a piece of paper and then we'll go over it together right how did you do that would be X divided by 4 so divide a number by 4 to get to 12 X divided by 4 is equal 12 we've now got to try and get rid of the X on this side sorry not the X we're going to get rid of the other values so that X stays on its own and in order to do that we will use the inverse operation or the opposite operation so what's opposite to divide it would be multiply what we do on the one side we do on the other side because we have to keep the bell of the scale balanced so X divided by 4 times 4 and then we have to do the same on the other side 12 times 4 so what are we going to get X is equal to 48 okay now we check it by substituting we're going to put 48 in the place of the X 48 divided by 4 what is that equal 12 12 is on the other side yay it works scale is balanced which means that 48 is correct 48 is the value of X right if you have some more to try you can write these down try them on a piece of paper pause the video and then we'll go over them one by one together but how did you do let's have a look at the first one twice a number is a hundred so we've got 2 X is equal to 100 how do we get rid of the 2 it's 2 times X so we must divide by 2 which means we have to do the same to the other side 2x divided by 2 is equal to 100 divided by 2 which means that X is equal to 50 let's substitute in to check 
,,that it rat 2 times 50 is equal to a hundred right there we go our scale is balanced we've got it right which means that the 50 is the correct answer of X remember that this is not the answer for X that is your double check this means that that is the answer for X if that is correct what you've done in this section means that you have got it right if you are confident and you don't need to do a substitution that's fine but if you're a little bit weary and the answer doesn't look quite right substitute it back in to double-check yourself it's look at number two half a number is 15 right we've got 1/2 X is equal to 15 what we need to do now the inverse of that 1/2 would be to times it by 2 remember half X is the same as x over 2 or X divided by 2 okay so we would go 1/2 x times 2 is equal to 15 times 2 because we've got to keep that scale balanced which means that X is equal to 30 okay substitute it back in half 30 its equal to 15 both sides of the scale are balanced therefore 
,,you are at and X is actually 30 number 3 let's see how you did yeah 4 plus a number is 23 4 plus X is equal to 23 would be your equation again we've got a positive 4 there which means we have to take 4 away on that side of the X on the left hand side we have to take far away on the right hand side 2 so there we go 4 plus X minus 4 is equal to 23 minus 4 so these two fours would then disappear and you would have this to work out on this side so X is equal to 19 it's put 19 back into substitute we just want to make sure every single time that a scale is balanced 4 plus 19 that gives you 23 23 is the same on the other side you've got it right which means 
,,that X is equal 2:19 let's look at the last one 93 editor number is minus three Brad 93 plus X is equal to minus three it's remember get rid of the 93 on that side which means we have to do the same to the other side so what we do to the left hand side has to be the same as the right hand side so we've got 93 plus X minus 93 which is equal to -3 minus 93 so it's going to be X is equal to minus 96 that doesn't look quite right so let's check it 93 minus 96 is equal to minus 3 that means 93 minus 96 is minus 3 which is the same as on this side so even though it looked a bit funny it is correct you have dealt with negative numbers so this shouldn't be too much of a mission means that X is minus 96 and that is correct okay right let's go one step further this is a bit of a challenge because now we're going to introduce unknown values to both sides of the equation so you can also have variables on either side of the equal sign for example in X minus 7 is equal to 5x plus 3 maybe it looks a little bit daunting to you maybe it looks a little bit difficult but let's just use the same things that we've done all the time and let's work through it 
,,carefully so the first thing we need to get all our variables onto the same side of the equation and all the constants onto the other side but we will do it step-by-step as you go along and you get used to this you can do it order in one step but let's try to step by step for now right we've got 10 X minus 7 minus 5 X can you see we've taken the variable across but we're going to do minus five X because on this side we did minus five X to get rid of that 5x there so we're going to be left just with the constant okay so we've got 5x minus 7 because 10x minus 5x gives me 5x keep the minus 7 we haven't done anything with that and we've got a three left there now we've got to get 5x on its own we're used to working with something that looks like this so we've got it take away the seven by adding on seven and we'll add on seven to that side okay so all our constants to the other side there we can see minus seven plus seven is going to give us naught but we have to add on seven to 
,,keep our scale balanced so we're going to end up with tune on the side and 5x on the other side we're not yet finished we need to have X on its own so how do we get 
,,X on its own we're going to divide by five here which means we have to divide by five on that side just like that so we're going to end up with X on its own and X is equal to two so I think a good thing would be to substitute because that was quite a long process let's make sure it works okay 10x minus seven is equal to five x plus three we've got a substitute for both values of X not just the one so we're going to substitute two in here we're going to substitute two in there and we're going to get 10 times two hundred seven and five times two plus three let's see we've got 20 minus 7 and 10 plus 3 and we're going to get 13 on both sides it works see if that is balanced then it means that that is correct okay let's try another one together 9 minus X is equal to 2x plus 3 we've got to get all our X's on one side and all our constants on the other side so let's add on X to the side and we'll have to add on X to that side which means that we're going to be left with 9 on the left-hand side and 3 X because we've got 2x plus X on the right-hand side but we haven't done anything with that plus 3 yet so let's try and move that to the other side so that all our constants are on the same side which means that we'll do u minus 3 here and we'll do a minus 3 on that side we're going to end up with 6 on the left-hand side and 3 X on the right-hand side divide this by 3 divide that by 3 and you're going to get X is equal - it doesn't matter whether your ex is on the right hand side or the left hand side you've got it as being equal to two - check they'd substitute in 9 - x equals 2x plus 3 remember we have to substitute and for both X's so we're going to get 9 minus 2 is equal to 2 times 2 plus 3 9 minus 2 7 2 times 2 is 4 plus 3 7 is equal to 7 yay we've got it right now we need to try these you need to try these on your own you can pause the video try those on a piece of paper and we will go over them together right let's have a look how did you do the first one 5 X plus 3 is equal to 9 minus X can you see we have taken that X across by adding it onto the side and you add it onto that side then we get so then we will get 6 X plus 3 is equal to 9 can you see how that has just made that X disappear and we've taken across to this side okay we now have to take that constant and put it 
,,on the right-hand side so to do that we're gonna say plus 3 minus 3 we're going to end up with 6x there then that we'd have to say minus 3 that we did it there and 9 minus 3 is 6 and X is equal to 1 okay let's see by substitution we take the one we're going to put it back into our original equation by substituting it 5 times 1 plus 3 is equal to 9 minus 1 5 plus 3 is 8 9 minus 1 is 8 yay it's right that means that X is equal to 1 okay the next one 2x plus 3 is equal to X plus 4 2x plus 3 minus 3 X plus 4 minus 3 can you see we've kept the scale balanced completely we've got 2x on its own and X plus 1 on the other side that means we need to take that X 
,,away we need to put it on this side so what if we - at yeah we've gotta - it there so we've got one left on this side and X left on that side I think that tickles a 
,,little bit premature but let's have a look by substituting it in we're going to take the 1 we can substitute it in 2 times 1 + 3 substituted in on the side 1 + 4 2 times 1 is 2 2 + 3 is equal to 5 and we have got a balanced scale which means that your X is correct let's look at the next one right 10 - 3 X is equal to 3x - 2 10 we've got to get rid of the 3x on this side let's take it across because it is a negative so then it becomes a positive and it's much easier to work with it's not saying you can't work with a negative but let's take the negatives across to this side okay so we're going to try and take that across we're going to say minus 3x plus 
,,3x and we've got 2 plus 3x on that side as well so we left with 10 on the left-hand side 6 6 X because it's 3x plus 3x over here but we still got -2 it's try and get our constants to the right side and so in order to do that we've got to add on to here which means we add on to there which means we have 12 on the left-hand side 6x on the right-hand side we've got to get X on its own how do we do that we divide by 6 on the right hand side divided by 6 on the left hand side and we're going to 
,,end up with 2 is equal to X let's have a look if we can substitute does that work 10 minus 3 times 2 which is going to be giving me 10 minus 6 and on this side it's 
,,4 yeah we've got 3 times 2 minus 2 which is 6 minus 2 it's for array that is right okay remember again just to go over it again this is not your answer for 6 this is your double check to make you sure that your scale is balanced that would be your answer to X if this is balanced then X is right U of X is right okay let's look at the next one three X minus two is equal to X plus 4 3 X minus 2 minus X we're going to take that X away from here so there we've - turd and we've - to check keep the scale balanced remember we end up with 4 on the right-hand side and 2 X minus 2 on the left-hand side so now we've got to get rid of this - we're going to add it to the left-hand side and add it to the right-hand side we're going to end up with 2x is equal to 6 we want X on its own so forgot 2x we've got it divided by 2 and divide that by 2 divide the right-hand side by 2 X is equal to 3 if you're not sure if it's right if you 100% sure that it is right then you can leave it there if you're not sure it's right check by substitution yeah we've taken our 3 we've put it back into our original equation into the right places 3 times 3 is 9 9 minus 2 is 7 
,,on the left hand side 3 plus 4 is 7 on the right hand side if balance says yay X is equal to 3 right guys thank you for watching the video thank you for being part of worksheet card have a wonderful day further and remember to celebrate Earth Day see you next time

AlgebraicExpression,f4c8izcEX4s,hello graduate children today i'm here to teach you chapter four in your textbook that's directed numbers we can call it directed numbers as well so we'll see what are the basics here what is this one what what you call this one this is a number line so starting point is 0 and then towards the right hand side you get positive numbers towards left hand side you get negative numbers so 0 plus 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4 like that towards this side to the right side minus 1 minus 2 minus 3 to the left side of 0. what about in between in between means any decimals or fractions in between the whole numbers but only we mark the integers half 0.5 is in between 0 and 1. so any fraction or decimal in between the integers now what are these plus 1 plus 1.2 plus 3.5 these are directed numbers there's a direction that's why we use plus or minus so here it's better to write directed numbers in brackets because we can see that whether it's towards positive side or towards negative side now here use plus for addition and subtraction we use minus sign so therefore it is better to write directed numbers in brackets so here minus 3 means to the left side of 0 
,,3 units to the left plus 8 means towards right hand side plus 5 towards right hand side minus 4 towards left hand side so when you want to show directed numbers sign is important and make sure that you put brackets now what are the properties in directed numbers magnitude and the direction so what is magnitude means the size of 
,,the directed number just a number direction means whether it's positive or negative so consider plus 3 what's the magnitude there you take only the number plus 3 that is the distance on the number line from 0 to plus 3 this is towards right hand side plus sign represent the number is in the right hand side to zero consider minus five directed number what's the magnitude there magnitude is five so what's the meaning of that magnitude 5 means starting from 0 to -5 distance from 0 to -5 and minus means the number is in the left hand side to zero write down the magnitude and the direction for given directed numbers plus seven so what's the magnitude 7 what's the direction plus plus means to the right minus 8 magnitude is 8 minus means to the left of 0 plus 4 4 is the magnitude this is to the right and minus 10 10 is the magnitude this is to the left 0 that's not moving so magnitude 0 and what's the direction none not moving left or right minus six means six is the magnitude minus means to the left plus 12 plus 12 means magnitude is 12 and plus means to the right now look at this one numbers with the same magnitude and opposite signs are located in equal distance from zero when you add these the answer is zero now what it means now take this one so here i can start minus 3 minus 2 minus 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 like that minus 3 what it means 0 to minus 3 distance plus 3 means 0 to right hand side distance so these two distances are the same when you add what happens opposite 
,,sides get cancel out and you get 0 if this is plus 7 to get 0 you need to add minus 7. if this is 0 plus 8 is there that means you have to add minus a and if this is minus 10 is there you have to add plus 10 to get 0. so we call it's the additive inverse additive inverse means if you take plus 3 minus 3 is the additive inverse of plus 3. now if you take plus 7 what's the additive inverse that's minus 7 minus 12 what's the additive inverse of minus 12 that's plus 12 when you add these you get zero addition of directed numbers so what we do so plus 2 plus 5 so we can start from plus 2 in grade 7 you did starting with 0. now we can start with plus 2. so plus 2 is there here and adding plus 4 so straight away 4 units from here 1 2 3 4 so the answer you are getting here is the final answer so what is plus 2 plus 4 that's plus 6 so the answer is plus 6. start from plus 2 and move 4 places to the right answer is obtained from the last position on the number line let's take this one 
,,minus 3 so start with -3 plus plus means to the right and plus 4 means you are moving 4 places to the right 1 2 3 4 so you're moving to this side so what's minus 3 plus 4 answer is plus 1 this one negative 2 plus negative 3 so starting from negative 2 and adding negative 3 adding means to the right but you are subtracting here another minus three now again you have to go back to left so another three one two three to the left side so what's the final answer minus 2 adding 3 places to the left so final answer is minus 5. so start from minus 2 and move 3 places to the left answer is obtained from the position on the number line find minus 4 plus 7 so starting from minus 4 plus seven that means moves to the right seven places one two three four five six seven so here to here so what's the final position plus 3 here 2 this is 3 so plus 3 is the answer this one plus seven and minus eight so here plus seven starting point is plus seven adding and here minus eight so minus means you have to move eight places to the left one two three four five six seven eight so this is the final position so what's the answer minus one plus 4 plus minus 7 so starting point is plus 4 plus and minus 7 means moves 7 places to the left so what's the answer 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 so here 2 here so the final position is minus 3 write down the answer at once now all are positive and addition so what you do just add the numbers and put the sign positive both numbers are positive answer is also positive and value is the sum of the two numbers so you can do at once 5 plus 3 8 sine is positive 7 plus 2 9 sine is positive 6 plus 4 10 sine is positive 8 plus 6 fourteen sign is positive nine plus one ten sign is positive and four plus four eight sine is positive write down the answer at once now what happens you get both negatives and addition sign is there so what we do both numbers are negative answer is also negative and the value is the sum of the two numbers if both are negative just add it 3 plus 2 5 but the sign is negative 5 and 3 8 here negative 7 plus 6 13 negative 30 5 and 5 10 that's negative 10 9 plus 2 11 that's negative 11 and four plus four eight that's negative eight write down the answer at once now what happens one is positive and the other one is negative so what we do here addition of directed numbers with opposite signs ignore the sign and take the difference between the two values sine of the answer is always the sign of the larger number so what we do take the difference 7 and 2 difference is 5. and which one is a bigger plus 7 so the answer is plus 5. 6 and 3 difference is 3 positive 6 is the bigger one it's plus 3 10 and 4 what's the difference 6 but large number is negative so negative 6 here 11 and 8 what's the difference 3 large number is positive so you put positive 3 subtraction of directed numbers now you are asked to find out plus 4 minus minus 2 using number line so what's the starting value plus 4 here subtraction is left and minus 2 you need to get the opposite direction so that means plus 2 so 2 places to the right so you get 6 is the answer so we can write plus 4 minus minus 2 is plus 6. this one find minus 3 minus minus 5 using number line so minus 3 is the starting point minus means left subtraction and minus 5 you have to consider the opposite that means five places to the right one two three four five so you get plus two so minus three minus minus five is plus 2. find the answer using number line so starting value is plus 3 minus minus means left here plus 4 so left 4 places 1 2 3 4 so you get this number so what's the answer minus 1. 5 minus minus 7 start with minus 5 okay so these are all positive numbers and here minus is left and another minus means opposite direction seven places to the right one two three four five six seven so you get plus 2 as the answer so make sure that you put brackets so the answer is plus 2. this one plus 4 is the starting point minus plus 6 means 6 places to the left 1 2 3 4 5 6. 6 places to the left the final as is minus 2 so you can write -2 there zero minus minus four what's the starting value zero and here minus and another minus get cancel out so you are moving four places to the right one two three four what's the final answer you get plus four so here also plus four is the answer this one 0 that means starting point is 0 minus plus 5 means moves 5 places to the left 1 2 3 4 5. you get minus 5 so what's the answer minus 5 is the directed number plus 2 minus plus 4 starting value is plus 2. this is all positive and minus to the left 4 units 1 2 three four so here this way so the answer is minus two write down the answer at once now you know what you have to do so here 7 and these all this is positive both positive and the subtraction just subtract 7 minus 5 plus 2 8 minus 4 what's 8 minus 4 plus 4 10 minus 6 you get 4 and this is plus 4 9 and plus 5 difference is 4 and this is plus 4 6 and 4 subtraction you get plus 2 11 and 9 
,,you need to subtract 11 minus 9 2 11 minus 9 is 2 that's plus 2 this side minus 3 and plus 4 now so here difference is 1 and look at this one so you have to add starting from minus 3 move 4 places to the left again so what's the answer 4 and 3 you get 7 that's minus 7 this one starting from minus 5 moves 9 places towards left side 9 plus 5 14 that's minus starting from minus 10 you are moving 12 places again to the left side so you are adding these two numbers so 22 and this is minus 8 and 
,,4 addition is 12 and this is minus because starting value is minus 4 you move 8 places to the left starting point is minus 9 move 11 places to the left that means just add these two numbers starting from minus seven subtract plus eight means moves eight places to the left eight plus seven fifteen that's minus additive inverse we know if it's plus 2 when you add minus 2 to both sides what happens you get plus 2 n minus 2 becomes 0 so you get x equals minus 2 so what's the additive inverse of plus 2 that's minus 2 so minus 2 is the additive inverse of plus 2 addition of additive inverse numbers the answer is 0 so when you add additive inverse you get the answer 0. now we'll see these numbers you are getting 0. how you get 0 when you add additive inverse plus 3 when you add additive inverse of plus 3 that's minus 3 you get 0 minus 2 there when you add plus 2 you get 0 minus 8 when you add plus 8 you get 0 plus 9 when you add minus 9 you get 0 minus 3 additive inverse is plus 3 minus 7 additive inverse of that is plus 7 to get 0 plus 11 additive inverse is minus 11 when you add additive inverse values you get 0 write down the additive inverse of given numbers plus 3 or 3 inverse minus 3 minus 8 plus 8 is the additive inverse 9 is minus 9 minus 6 that means plus 6 plus 11 means minus 11 is the additive inverse minus 1.5 plus 1.5 plus three and a half minus three and a half minus six point three plus six point three and plus seven and a half means minus seven and a half minus 2 1 4 means plus 2 and 1 4 so these are the additive inverse of these numbers now when you have two numbers directed numbers to subtract what you can do you can add the additive inverse and change the question for example if the question is plus 5 minus plus 2 that means you can add the additive inverse of plus 2. so this is same as plus five plus of minus two so both cases you get the same answer so here also plus five and minus two phi minus two is plus three then subtraction means moves two places to the left that is also plus three so subtraction of directed numbers means addition of additive inverse of that number write down the following subtractions as addition of additive inverse and find the answer now how can i write this question plus 7 i can write plus of minus 2 adding these two numbers so what we can do 7 and subtract 2 you get plus 5 plus 6 minus becomes plus additive inverse of minus 5 is plus 5. so you get 6 and 5 addition that's plus 11 plus 6 is there minus becomes plus of the additive inverse that's minus 2 that means 6 minus 2 you get plus minus nine and here additive inverse of minus five is plus five so nine and five addition we take the difference and put the sign of the larger number it's minus 4. this one minus 11 is there addition of additive inverse is minus 3 then minus 11 minus 3 both are the same sign add it and put the minus sign so minus 40. here also you can do the same thing minus 8 adding the additive inverse of minus 4 that's plus 4. so take the difference that's 4 put the sign of the bigger number that's minus 4 minus 6 addition of the additive inverse that's minus 3 both signs are the same so add it and put the sign minus 9 plus 11 addition of the additive inverse that's plus 3 11 plus 3 14 that's plus minus 12 additive inverse of plus 
,,3 is minus 3 both negative so add it that's 15 both negative so you get the answer also negative minus 9 adding of the additive inverse of minus 5 that's plus 5. so 
,,this is the difference because 1 is positive and 1 is negative and they put the sign of the larger numbers you get minus 4 for subtraction write down the addition of additive inverse numbers and find the answer same thing i can write minus as the plus of the additive inverse so you get 11 plus 3 40. now we'll do this one minus 6. plus 3 here you can convert to addition of additive inverse of minus 8 that's plus now these two you can add 8 plus 3 11 11 minus 6 you get 5 that's positive this 
,,one minus 9 plus minus 2 and here convert to addition of the additive inverse that's plus 6. so minus 2n minus 9 minus 11 minus 11 and plus 6 means the difference is 5 the bigger number is minus 11 so you get minus 5 minus 1 plus 8 minus becomes additive inverse of that that's plus 3 and plus plus 2. 8 plus 3 11 11 plus 2 plus 30. this one plus 11 and here convert to positive addition of additive inverse of minus 4 is plus 4 and here also adding the additive inverse of minus 2 is plus 2. now all are positive just add the numbers 11 plus 4 15 15 plus 2 17 multiplication of directed numbers so what we do ignore the sign just multiply the two numbers and 
,,then what you do if both signs are the same answer is positive always if the signs are different you get a negative answer 3 times 2 6 plus plus both signs are the same you get plus 6 2 and 2 4 both pluses plus 4 2 and 1 2 both pluses you get plus so remember same sign you get always positive when you multiply by zero what happens multiplication of directed number by zero is always zero now look at this one multiply the directed numbers 3 times 2 6 and this is plus 2 times 2 4 and this is plus 1 times 2 2 same sign you get plus 0 times plus 2 you get 0. so when you look at this side you see a pattern 6 4 2 0 what are these numbers minus 2 minus 4 and minus 6 will check whether it's true both numbers are not the same now same sign 1 is negative and 1 is positive so the answer is negative so 2 times 1 2 you get negative 2 2 times 2 4 you get negative 4 3 times 2 6 negative 6 because 1 is positive the other one is negative so here you need to remember multiplication of positive 
,,numbers answer is always positive multiplication of positive number with a negative number answer is negative write down the answer once answer is positive when multiply two positive numbers so all these are positive numbers so you get positive answer 5 times 3 50 plus 15. 4 times 3 12. so plus 12 two times six twelve plus twelve seven times two fourteen plus fourteen and four times four sixteen that's plus sixteen one times three three that's plus three eight times two sixteen plus sixteen eleven times two twenty two that's plus six times three eighty that's plus 10 times 440 that's plus find the answer 3 times -2 ignore the sign and here 1 is positive and 1 is negative you get the answer negative this is 4 minus 4 1 times 2 2 this is minus 2. 0 times -2 is 0 now look at this one same sign minus and minus so you 
,,get positive 2 2 times 2 plus 4 because both are negative both are negative you get plus 6 so what's the thing you need to remember multiplication of positive number and a negative number is always a negative answer answer is negative multiplication of two negative numbers the answer is positive write down the answer at once answer is negative and multiply a positive and a negative number now plus as minus here all these 1 is positive the other number is negative so always the answer is negative 3 times 2 6 that's negative 6 3 times 2 6 negative 6 4 times 4 16 negative 16 6 times two twelve that's negative twelve eight times five forty that's negative 
,,forty six times three eighteen that's negative eighteen eight times two sixteen negative sixteen here nine times one nine negative nine four times four sixty that's 
,,negative two times 11 22 that's negative one negative and one positive answer is always negative write down the answer at once answer is positive and multiply two negative numbers in all these both numbers are negative so the final answer is positive three times two six five times one five six times two twelve eight times three 
,,twenty-four nine times two eighteen then 4 times 3 12 5 times 3 15 11 times 1 that's plus 11 10 times 2 20 9 times 3 27 so here both negative means the final answer 
,,is positive write down the answer at once yeah you get combination sometimes positive sometimes negative both negative answer is positive one is negative one is positive answer is negative one is positive one is negative answer is negative so you need to multiply separate 9 times to 80. both negative answer is positive 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative so 10 times 3 30. 11 times 3 33 both negative that means plus one negative one positive answer is negative both negative positive answer one negative one positive answer is negative both negative answer is positive 9 times 4 36 both negative means answer is positive 12 times 224 one negative one positive answer is negative write down the answer at once look at all these questions multiplied by zero when you multiply any number by zero what's the answer 
,,you always get zero so what are these answers all these are zeros because you are multiplying by zero any number with zero is always zero find the value now you can 
,,take 2 at a time and find the answer 4 times 3 12 but it's negative now both negative the answer is positive twelve times five sixty plus one minus four and minus two four times two eight both negative means plus plus say ten minus 3 multiplication 8 times 3 24 1 is plus 1 is negative means you get a negative answer this one minus 9 minus 1 both negative means plus 9 now multiply with 4 9 times 4 36 both positive means the answer also positive minus 5 times 2 you get a negative answer because 1 is positive and the other one is negative multiplied by negative both negative now so you get a positive answer again take 2 at a time 8 times 3 24 both positive one is positive one is negative so first multiply four times four sixteen one remaining four times two eight plus one nine one plus and one negative answer is negative both negative you get a plus answer plus 33 and when you multiply by a negative the answer is a negative one both negative you get plus answer 3 times 2 6. here you can do separately these two 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative 4 times 3 12. now 12 times 6 ignore sign and multiply 6 times 2 12 1 remaining and here 72 is it positive or negative 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative here 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is 12 there minus 12 negative 12. both negative answer is positive 4. now 12 times 4 48 what's the sign one negative one positive answer is negative this one again take two at a time negative both you get positive 10 positive both you get positive 6 now multiply both positive you get positive 60. here both negative negative negative you get positive answer here negative negative positive answer now positive positive multiplication you get positive answer 9 times 4 is 30 6. find the value just multiply by two first two times one two two times three six what's the sign one negative one positive answer is negative multiply by two two times one two two times five ten ten point two is the answer both 
,,negative you get plus sign four times this 4 times 3 12 1 remaining 4 times 1 4 plus 1 5 so 5.2 both positive means answer is positive this one multiplied by 2 6 and 2 1 is negative and 1 is positive answer is negative now we look at division of directed numbers now we know multiplication 5 into plus 2 you get plus 10. now what 
,,happens when you take 10 divided by plus 2 you take this one to this side that becomes division so what's the answer you are getting plus 5 divide the numbers ignoring the sign answer is positive when dividing positive number by a positive number so just ignore the sign 10 divided by 2 you get 5. both positive means answer is also positive write down the answer once 8 divided by 2 is 4 how you decide the sign both positive means positive sign 15 divided by 5 is 3 both positive you get the positive answer 10 divided by 10 1 both positive you get 1. 16 divided by 4 4 you get plus 4 8 divided by 2 that's 4 that is also plus 4. 20 divided by 5 20 divided by 5 is 4 both positive you get positive 4. 16 divided by 8 you get 2 that's plus 2. 30 divided by 10 that's 3 you get plus 3. 40 divided by 10 you get 4 both positive means plus 4. 36 divided by 6 you get 6 both positive so when you divide both positive numbers the answer is positive now this one we know plus into minus 4 is negative 4. and when you take this one to this side negative 25 divided by negative 4 you are getting plus 6. so now look at this question both negative answer is positive answer is positive when dividing negative number by a negative number write down the answer at once both negative numbers all in all these questions both negative numbers when you divide both negative numbers the answer is positive just normal division 8 divided by 2 4 answer is plus because both are negatives 16 divided by 
,,4 4 that's plus 4. 20 divided by 5 you get 4 that's plus 4. 18 divided by 6 you get 3 that's plus 3 12 divided by 2 6 that's plus 6 18 divided by 9 you get 2 that's 
,,plus 2. 20 divided by 10 you get 2. ours is plus 2. 30 divided by 10 that's three answers plus 40 divided by 20 you get plus 2 24 divided by 12 you get plus 2 because both the numbers are negative negative number divided by a negative you get a positive answer now what happens here 1 is negative and 1 is positive so minus 8 and 
,,plus 3 we know that's minus 24 when you take plus 3 to this side that means minus 24 divide by plus 3 you need to get minus now what happens 1 is negative 1 is positive answer is negative answer is negative when dividing negative number by a positive number here also both numbers are negative you get positive 24. when you take this one here minus 6 to this side what happens plus 24 divide by this is plus 24 divide by minus 6 the answer is minus 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is always negative answer is negative when dividing positive number by a negative number so it can be positive first number and the divisor is negative or divisor is positive and the number given is negative final answer is negative write down the answer at once plus and minus so you get negative 12 divided by 4 3 plus and minus 18 divided by 6 is 3 you are getting a negative answer again minus n plus 30 divided by 5 is 6 answer is minus 6 negative positive 28 divided by 7 that's 4 you get negative 4. 27 divided by 9 you get 9 times 3 so this is negative now look at this one 12 divided by 4 you get 3 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative 18 divided by minus 6 1 is positive and 1 is negative answer is negative 30 divided by 5 6 1 is positive and 1 is negative so answer is negative 28 divided by 7 you get 4 1 is positive and 1 is negative answer is negative 27 and 9 you get 3 answer is negative 3 so you need to remember when you get same sign pluses you get positive or either same sign negatives the final answer is positive when you divide here this one one positive and one negative always you get negative answer order is not important you can get negative number divide by a positive still the answer is negative so multiplication of different signs answer is negative so in this case you get negative here you get positive for same sign write down the answer at once now combination so first multiply numbers separately and then decide the sign 7 times 2 40 both pluses answer is plus 6 times 2 12 both minus answer is plus now the division 12 divided by 6 answer is 2 this is minus and plus the sign is negative division again 30 divided by 15 you know that's 2 sign is negative because 1 is negative and 1 is positive 32 divided by 8 you get 4 1 is negative 1 is plus means answer is negative 9 times 3 27 1 is positive and 1 is negative that's minus 16 divided by 4 you get 4 both negative answer is positive 18 divided by 18 you get 1 both negative answer is positive 40 divided by 20 ans is 2. both negative means you get plus 27 divided by 3 you get 9. one negative and one positive you get minus again eight times eight multiplication 64. both negative you get plus now division 64 divided by 8 that's 8 1 positive 1 negative answer is negative 12 times 3 multiplication you get 36 1 positive 1 negative answer is negative 36 divided by 12 you get 3 both negative here you get plus 48 divided by 2 that's 24 1 negative 1 positive answer is negative 8 times 4 32 both negative answer is positive here division negative negative division you get 4 divided by 4 1 both negative means the sign is plus 18 divided by 1 you get 18. both negative that's plus 40 divided by 8 that's 5. one negative 1 positive means you get minus 9 times 3 27 and both positive means answer is positive so that's not hard you can just multiply the numbers and then decide the sign simplify following directed numbers so we can do the numerator first and then the denominator 4 times 3 12 but this is negative because 1 is positive and 1 is negative now 12 divided by 6 is 2 one negative and one positive answer is negative 8 times 4 32 is this plus or minus minus minus both means this is plus 2 times 2 4 1 minus and 1 positive means you get minus 4. now division 32 divided by 4 is 8 plus and minus the answer is minus this one we'll do these two first 5 and 2 10 minus minus becomes plus and then here three times one three one positive one negative is minus three now you can do ten times three 30 but this is negative and divide by negative 30 divided by 3 is 10 both negative means the final answer is positive this one we'll 
,,do these two 8 times 2 16 that's positive and multiplied by a negative value here 6 times 2 12 and you get a negative answer no numerator multiply you get 3 times 6 
,,18 1 remaining 3 times 1 3 plus 1 48 that's negative because 1 is positive and 1 is negative now divide by -12 both negative answer is positive 48 divided by 12 is 4. so you get plus 4 as the answer do this we'll do these two separately 9 times 3 27 that's minus and then 12 times 3 36 that's minus because 1 is negative and 1 is 
,,positive now 27 times 4. 108 that's negative negative that's positive divide by minus 36 the answer is negative 1 is positive 1 is negative how many times are there 
,,36 times what's the answer 3 3 times so you get 3 times 36 is 108 so you get negative 3 as the final this one you can do these two minus 8 and 4 minus 32. multiplied by plus 2 here 4 times 4 16 and this is minus minus plus now numerator separately 32 times 2. that's plus into minus minus 64. divide by plus 16 minus n plus minus 
,,how many 16s are there for sixty-four four so answer is minus four this one 12 times 4 you get 48 that's minus 3 times 2 6 minus minus plus now divide 48 divided by 
,,6 8 but this is minus because 1 is negative well 1 is positive 12 times 8 96 plus into minus that's minus 3 times 2 6 both minus that means plus 6. how many sixes are there divide by six you get one for 36 that's 16. is it positive or negative one is negative one is positive answer is negative these two what is eighteen times three 24 3 times 1 3 plus 2 54 but the answer is negative 6 times 3 18 answer is positive now divide how many 18s are there for 54 3 so the answer is 3 minus and plus 
,,different signs you get negative so the answer is negative 3. here we'll take these two first 4 times 3 plus 12 and then with minus 6. here 18 times 2 you get 36 that's minus 1 is positive 1 is negative now multiply these two 72 12 times 6 but the answer is negative now both negative 72 divided by 36 is 2. both negative means answer is positive now we'll look at example number one find the value of minus 3 plus minus 2 by using the number line so number line is given what's the starting point minus 3 so this is the starting point and then what we do plus minus 2 means 2 places to the left so 2 places to the left means answer is minus 5 review exercise 
,,now we'll take the review exercise find the value of each of the following by using the number line plus 2 and plus 6. so we'll take the number line okay so what's the starting value plus 2 so here i'll take minus 2 minus 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and we'll put 8 here these are pluses that's the number line starting point is plus 2 and 
,,plus 6 means 6 places to the right one two three four five six so what's the answer plus eight plus eight and minus 5 so we'll take the number line again so plus 8 is there so we need 8 i'll mark this one as 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 minus 1. now start from plus 8 and plus minus 5 means moves 5 places to the left so 1 two three four five what's the answer plus three minus two n plus three we'll take it minus two so that means i'll take this one as minus 3 minus 2 minus 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 these are pluses so starting value is minus 2 plus plus 3 means move 3 places to the right 1 2 3 answer is plus 1. this one take the number line and starting value is minus 3 so 
,,you need to check minus three but here minus means moves left so we'll start from here plus one you need to decide what are the numbers you need so here minus 3 is the starting point and here this is left means you need more minus values so four places to the left one two three four answer is minus seven this one plus 4 and minus 6 is there that means towards left side so we'll take plus 4 here starting point is plus 4 6 to the left 1 2 3 4 5 6. so you get minus 2. find the value of each of the following you can do it at once what's the condition both pluses means just add the two numbers 3 plus 2 5 so you get plus 5 now both negative that's also adding two numbers four plus two six you put a negative sign here one is positive one is negative you take the difference five and three difference is two but bigger number is positive you put plus 2 plus and minus take the difference that's 6 bigger number is negative so you put negative 6 here this is additive inverse addition so what's the answer negative 7 and 7 difference is 0. so when you add additive inverse you get 0. these two all positive so that means adding the numbers 5 plus 2 7 7 plus 3 now here all these negative numbers so that means adding negative numbers 3 plus 1 4 4 plus 4 8 what this is negative 8. all these two these two positive and the other one is negative so what is this one plus two plus four you get plus six now you have to take the difference because 1 is positive and 1 is negative so 9 and 6 difference is 3 bigger number is negative so minus 3. here you have to take the difference because 1 is positive and the other one is negative so 5 over 7 minus 2 over 7 that's 3 over 7. so answer is 3 over 7. how you decide the sign the bigger one is this that's positive 1 is positive 1 is negative 2 so take the difference when you subtract you get 8 and here 1. so 1.8 is the answer which one is bigger 5.2 that's negative so the answer also negative here what are these two additive inverse so additive inverse addition is zero example number one find the value of plus 2 minus minus 3 by using the number line so here first look at it plus 2 and minus minus that means you have to move towards right side so starting with plus 2. so we can take plus 2 somewhere here so this is plus 1 0 minus 1 minus 2 plus 3 plus 4 plus 5 plus 6 plus 7 so start with plus 2 here move three places to the right one two three so what's the final answer that's plus five find the value of minus 2 minus plus 3 by using the lambda line so before we mark the numbers just see minus 2 that means starting value is minus 2 moves to the left 3 units so when you are marking the number line we can take i'll take minus 6 minus 5 minus 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 starting with minus 2 moves left by 3 units 1 2 3. so the answer is minus five example number three find the value of minus two minus minus three by using the number line so we'll take the number line now here before we mark the points you have to look at carefully starting point is minus 2 minus minus means you have to move to the right side by 3 units so we can take minus 3 minus 2 minus 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6. these are positive values so starting value is minus two moves three places to the right one two three that's the answer plus one exercise 4.1 find the value by using the number line so we'll take the number line and now how we label you have to look at starting value is plus 4 and minus means you are moving to the left so plus 4 will mark it somewhere here and starting value is plus 4 moving towards left side by 2 units so final answer is plus two take a number line for this now how we label this so here starting point is plus 1 and here minus minus means moves towards right side so we can start from here i'll take plus 1 here plus 2 plus 3 plus 4 plus 5 
,,plus 6 like that and here this is 0 minus 1. so start from plus one and moves two places to the right one two so what's the final answer final answer is plus three this one using number line so we'll take the number line and starting with minus 2 and here minus means moves to the left so we'll start -2 somewhere here it's easy first you decide otherwise you can't put all the numbers so this is plus 1 minus 3 minus 4 minus 5 minus 6 like that starting value is minus 2 3 places to the left one two three so you get minus five this one minus one and minus minus 3 so what you have to do starting with minus and minus minus means moves towards right side so i'll start minus 1 somewhere here these are pluses so starting value is minus 1 moves three places to the right one two three one two three so answer is plus two this one starting value is minus 6 and you have to move towards right side because minus minus towards right side so we'll start from -6 here so starting value is minus 
,,6 5 places to the right 1 2 3 4 5 answer is minus 1 this one starting point is plus 2 minus minus means towards right hand side so i can start with plus 2 here here 
,,plus 1 and 0 starting with 2 and 2 places to the right this is plus 4. example number four find the value of plus two minus minus four so we can use addition of additive inverse i can change the question to adding the additive inverse of minus 4 that's plus 4. now both positive 4 plus 2 addition is plus 6. find the value of minus 5 minus plus 2. so convert this to additive inverse adding the additive inverse of plus 2 that's minus 2 now this is both minus addition so just add it and put the sign so you get minus 7. find the value of minus 7 minus minus 3 so how you do minus 7 is there adding additive inverse of minus 3 is plus 3 now difference 7 and 3 
,,difference is 4 and put the sign of the bigger number that's minus 4. example 7 find the value of minus 12 minus minus 15 minus plus 5. so these two i can convert minus 12 addition of additive inverse of that plus 50 and here also adding additive inverse that's minus 5. now these two take the difference minus 12 and 15 take the 
,,difference you get 3 that's positive now again consider this one now 1 is positive and 1 is minus you take the difference difference is 2 and the bigger number is minus you get minus 2. example eight find the value of plus three fifths minus so you can do the additive inverse of plus one over 5 means minus 1 over 5. now this is 
,,difference so you take 3 over 5 minus 1 over 5 that's 2 over 5 is the difference which one is bigger positive answer is bigger so the answer is plus 2 over 5. example 9 minus five and a half minus plus two so what you do i can rewrite this as adding the additive inverse of plus 2 that's minus 2. so this means both minus now edit 5 and 2 7 and you get 7 and a half both minus means the answer is minus example 10 minus 3.2 minus i can write plus of the additive inverse of plus 1.4 that's minus 1.4 now both negative negative means adding so 3.2 and 1.4 just add it you get 4.6 but both negative means the answer also negative example number 11 find the value of minus 8.4 minus minus i can change it to plus with the additive inverse of minus 2.5 that's plus 2.1 now 1 is negative 1 is positive take the difference 6.3 so which one is the bigger number minus so you put a minus psi exercise 4.2 fill in each cage with the suitable directed number here minus 5. we can convert to additive 
,,inverse of plus 3 that's minus 3. now both negative add the two numbers 5 plus 3 8 so you put minus eight this one convert to additive inverse so this is plus with plus four one is positive one is negative take the difference four and three difference is 1 bigger number is positive plus 1. convert to additive inverse plus 7 plus minus 1 additive inverses plus 1 7 and 1 both positive you get plus 8. this one plus 7 additive inverse of minus 2 that's plus 2 and both pluses 7 plus 2 you get plus 9. find the value of each of the following so 4 you can write this one as adding the additive inverse of this 4 minus 1 you get 3 positive number because the higher number is positive minus 8 plus additive inverse of minus 2 that's plus 2. take the difference 8 and 2 difference is 6 bigger number is minus answer is minus 6 convert to addition plus of additive inverse that's plus 7 take the difference because 1 is negative and 1 is positive so you get 4 bigger number is positive that's plus 4 here also you can start from plus 9 addition of the additive inverse that's plus 6 9 and 6 addition 15 that's plus minus 5 addition of additive inverse plus 5 yeah minus 5 and plus 5 difference is 0 this one adding the additive inverse that's minus 3 so 0 and minus 3 answer is minus 3 here minus 11 addition of additive inverse of plus 4 that's minus 4 both negative so add it so 15 answer is negative this one convert the question plus 2 plus minus 1 adding of the additive inverse that's plus 4 2 minus 1 take the difference you get plus 1. plus 1 and plus 4 you get plus 5 this one i can take minus 5 convert to addition additive inverse of this is minus 2 again convert this one plus with additive inverse that's plus 6. now these two both negative so just add it and put the sign this is plus 6 now 1 is positive and 1 is negative take the difference 7 and 6 difference is 1 bigger number is negative so you get negative 1 this one plus 4 and here adding the additive inverse that's minus 2 again adding the additive inverse that's minus 8. now 4 and 2 take the difference that's 2 that's plus 2. and now again take the difference 8 and 2 difference is 6. bigger number is negative so you put negative six this one four and a half adding the additive inverse of minus 2 that's plus 2 now this means adding these two numbers 4 and 2 6 6 and a half that's positive this one minus 6 and 1 4 is there adding of the additive inverse that's 1 4 plus 1 over now you have to take the difference so we'll take the difference six one fourth minus one fourth so one fourth one fourth get cancel out you get six what's the sign the bigger number is negative so the answer is negative 6 this one plus 15.7 adding the additive inverse that's plus 2.3 now this is addition 15.7 and 2.3 adding 7 plus 3 10 and 6 plus 2 8. so 18.0 so plus 18.0 this one will take first minus 2. adding the additive inverse of plus 3.5 that's minus 3.5 adding 4.5 4.1 now these two both negative that means adding you get 5.5 that's negative and adding plus 4.1 again the difference one is positive one is negative so take the difference you get 1.4 which number is bigger negative number so answer is negative 1.4 this one plus three and a half adding the additive inverse of minus 2 that's plus 2 here also adding additive inverse of this is plus one third now look at all of this all are adding so three plus two five that's the whole part half plus one third what's half plus one third convert to the same denominator lowest common multiple is six three times two so three times one three two times three six so two times one two so you get five over six so what's the final answer 5 and 5 over 6 so that's positive example number one simplify so here multiplication what you do just multiply the two numbers and same sign you get plus multiplication here 6 and 2 12. 1 is positive and 1 is negative answer is negative simplify the following here first one two times five ten one is positive the other one also positive both positive means ansi is positive second one three times two six 1 is negative 1 is positive answer is negative third one 5 times 3 
,,15 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative 15. here 4 times 3 12 12 times 2 24. now we'll decide the sign both negative you get plus again plus with plus answer is plus example number four plus 2.5 into minus 5. just multiply by 5 first 5 times 5 25 5 times 2 10 plus 2 12. so 12.5 how do you decide the sign one is positive one is negative answer is negative here multiplied by 12 first 3.4 multiplied by 12. 10 and 2 4 and 3 2 times 4 8 2 times 3 6. when you add it you get 4 0 8 and here 1 decimal place so 40.8 is the answer but how you decide the sign minus minus both the final answer is positive find the value exercise 4.3 so straight away you can do 5 times 420 both positive means answer is positive 5 times 420 1 is negative 1 is positive answer is negative 10 times 550 both negative answer is positive 7 times 3 21 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative both negative just multiply 1 times 4 4 both negative means you get a positive answer here 11 times 0 when you multiply any number by 0 always you get answer 0 6 times 4 24 1 is negative and 1 is plus answer is negative 12 times 3 you get 36 1 is positive one is negative answer is negative here we'll multiply first two times two four four times five twenty now we'll decide the sign one is negative one is positive answer is negative that's negative and this negative both negative means the answer is plus here 3 times 1 3 3 times 2 6 6 times 5 30 decide the sign negative negative positive here positive negative you get negative now again positive negative means the final answer is negative multiplied by 2 you get 5 both positive answer is positive now here you need to multiply by 20 3 now 20 and 3 times one two two times four eight three times one three three times four twelve when you add it you get ninety four point three now one is positive one is negative means answer is negative example number one now it's division same thing you divide and finally you can put the sign 6 divided by 2 you get 3 both negative you get positive 3 6 and 2 division you get 3 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative this one 15 divided by 5 answer is 3 both 
,,positive you get positive 3 9 divided by 3 is 3 1 is negative 1 is positive you get a negative answer 15 divided by 3 you get 5 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative 9 divided by 3 3 both negative you get positive answer exercise 4.4 find the value of each of the following 10 and 2 division you get 5 plus and plus both 
,,positive means the final answer is positive 12 divided by 4 that's 3 both negative means final answer is positive 15 divided by 3 is 5. 1 is positive and 1 is negative answer is negative here 21 divided by 7 is 3 1 is negative and 1 is positive answer is negative negative 5 divided by 5 5 divided by 5 is 1 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative 1. 20 divided by 4 is 5 both negative means answer is positive now here 8 times 2 16 both positive that's positive now you have to divide by this 16 divided by 4 that's 4. 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative this one we can simplify the denominator first 6 and 2 multiplication that's 12 both negative means you get positive ones now 36 divided by 12 is 3 1 is negative 1 is positive answer is negative do the numerator 5 times 4 20 one negative one positive 
,,answer is negative denominator now 2 and 2 4 both minus means positive 1's now do this one 20 divided by 4 is 5. 1 is negative 1 is positive answer is negative do the numerator 9 times 8 72 both negative means plus answer 4 times 3 12 1 is negative 1 is positive answer is negative 72 divided by 12 you get 6 1 is positive and 1 is negative answer is negative fill in each cage with the suitable directed number answer is negative that means you are getting a plus value so 20 divided by 2 you get 10. so plus 2 because minus n plus the answer is negative 18 and 6. how you get 6 18 divided by 3. now decide the sign this is plus answer is negative that means 
,,you are getting negative 3 division you get 5 that means 10 divided by 2 is 5. now decide the sign this is plus here minus so both should be minus to get plus answer answer is 4 4 divided by 1 is 4 positive and the answer is negative so this should be negative value how we decide this one when you divide this one by 2 you are getting 6. so think about reverse way so if this is 12 here 12 divided by 2 you get 6. how you get 12 from 3 this should be 4 now decide the sign this is minus and minus if it's plus and minus the answer is minus but the answer is given is plus so that means this should be a minus value so minus 4 now this one you are getting minus 28 here plus 7 is there 7 into 4 28 but this is minus means this should be minus 4 now numerator is ok now to get 7 what should be this answer you are getting minus 4 because minus minus plus 28 divided by 4 is 7. now how you get minus 4 there 2 times 2 but this is minus so you have to multiply it by minus 2. so we covered all theory related to directed numbers subtracting a number from another number is the same as adding the additive inverse of the second number to the first number a positive number is obtained when two directed numbers of the same sign are multiplied or divided a negative number is obtained when two directed numbers of opposite signs are multiplied or divided so remember all these properties in directed numbers and practice all the exercises and examples

AlgebraicExpression,BZeFnoAHFkw,all right hello gradates and welcome to 8.5 solving equations part 2 found conveniently on page 268 of your textbook and the goal is to solve equations by balancing 
,,essentially what you do to one side of the equation you do to the other side here is one side there's the other what you do to one side you do to the other balance both sides are to be equal alright so let's take a look at this one here now 3n plus 2 equals 17 your goal is to isolate the variable that's the variable you need to 
,,isolate that you need to find out what is N write this down isolate the variable so that's our goal here find out what's the variable so in this case how are we going to do this we need to eliminate numbers around it now we can eliminate it there's many ways that you've heard and they all mean the same thing so I'm going to talk through a bunch of examples using the terminology that we've come across in the past so let's do this here we're going to balance these two sides now your next line in your equation will read like this you need to eliminate that too how am I gonna living at that too all right 3 n plus 2 well plus 2 then eliminate like this - to subtract 2 now because we're balancing there's an equal sign you do the same thing on the other side so 17 is minus 2 so then you're left with 3n equals 15 all right how we're going to get rid of this how am I going to get rid of the 3 I'm going to divide it by itself and you what you do once how you do it the other so 3 divided by 3 is 1 so the next line will be 1n or just n 15 divided by 3 is 5 n is 5 let me see if this works three times five plus two 3 times 5 is 15 plus 2 is 17 beautiful it works next alright we've heard this carrying over moving it to the other side so all I hear oh I move it to the other side well here's why you're moving it to 
,,the other side because the example we we've just did so T plus 8 equals 14 what is T your line your next line will read as follows plus 8 minus 8 so you're not carrying it over your mitt you're balancing both sides ok 14 minus 8 so T equals 2 6 does this work 6 plus 8 is 14 boom beautiful that works as well lovely we move on now take the time press pause get all these examples down so I have to have an example press pause go back in case you missed it and take down each example work it through I want to see all these examples next day plus the question I'm going to be giving you at the end of this glorious presentation next reversing the signs again we've done this already this is just different way of expressing it so 10 plus D well I am I going to do what am i doing this 10 this is a positive 10 to eliminate this or 2 is in order to isolate the D you have to subtract it from itself plus D and what you do one side you do to the other minus 10 so D equals 15 does it work 10 plus 15 you substitute the variable with the number 10 plus 15 equals 25 lovely well done alright last example 18 p equals 55 what am I going to do here we've seen this already divide it by itself wonderful and what we do the left side do the right side what is 55 divided by 18 well works out to three point zero five five six all right so essentially three point zero five approximately we plug that in it's going to be 55 point zero four or something so it works and finally for next day now again paused copy this down take this and bring it in tomorrow I want to see all the examples Plus this one come prepared with this equation work it out and I don't see it we'll take it up and that's it so this is your homework from the homework take down this equation and bring it for next day alright good good thank you very much thank you for watching we'll see you in class bye-bye

AlgebraicExpression,fUOdon3y1hU,algebraic expressions and equations good day students welcome back to my classroom for today's lesson you are going to learn how to differentiate expression from equation translate variable expressions and equations into algebraic expressions and equations and vice versa and lastly identify a variable in non-algebraic expression and equation let us begin let's cover brain exercise let's take a look at this one we have the sum of eight and nine can you translate this into a numerical expression great job we have here the keyword sum which represents addition this means that we need to add eight and nine so that is eight plus nine and this is an example 
,,of a numerical expression next one we have the sum of four and a number again our keyword here is sum which means addition this means that we need to add 4 and a number here we do not know the value of a number therefore we are going to represent it by a letter let's say letter n so that is four plus n this is an example of algebraic expression next one we have the sum of four and the number is seven again our keyword here is the word sum which means addition and we need to add four and a number which is four plus n and the word is represents equal sign therefore four plus n is equal seven this is an example of algebraic equation now do you know what is the difference between algebraic expression and equation let's go and take a look let us discuss the differences between expression and equation in algebraic expression it is a mathematical phrase for example we have this sum of 4 and a number and as we can see this is not a complete sentence while the algebraic equation is a 
,,mathematical sentence for example we have the sum of four and the number is seven another one is algebraic expression has no equal sign while in algebraic equation it has equal sign which represented by the word is lastly in an expression a value of the letter or the symbol can change for example here we have 4 plus n we can say that the value of n is 5 so that would be four plus five or we can say that the volume n here is nine so that would be four plus nine or let us say it is equal to so that would be four plus two on the other hand in algebraic equation the value of the letter or the symbol cannot be changed it has a fixed volume or fixed answer here n four plus n equals seven we cannot say that the value of n is nine as it will not say that the equation is correct if we say that the value of n here is two the equation would be wrong what if we say that the value of n here is three or plus three equals 7 and that is the correct value of m wonderful now that you know the 
,,differences let's move on to the parts of algebraic expression the first one is the variable the variable is any letter or symbol that represents a number here the variable is letter x the next one is the coefficient the coefficient is the constant value used with the variable it is the factor or the number being multiplied to a variable here the coefficient is two we can always find the coefficient before the variable the next one is the constant the constant is the fixed value that does not change here the constant is number five and lastly we have the term the term is a number or variable a product or quotient of a number and variables separated by 
,,plus or minus sign here in a given example we have the plus sign and it separates two terms which are 2x and 5 remember that addition and subtraction only separate terms while division and multiplication do not separate terms now that you already know the parts and the differences between equation expression let us go and translate some verbal expressions here we have a number plus 3 first one that you need to know is what is the missing here the missing here is a number this means that we 
,,are going to represent it by a variable any letter that we would like to let's say i want letter m the next keyword here would be the word plus which means edition so that is m plus three so our algebraic expression here is m plus three now let's have another example we have the sum of a number and three again let's take a look 
,,for some keywords here the keywords that we have is the word sum which means addition therefore we need to add a number which can be represented by a variable let's 
,,say letter m and the number 3 so that is m plus 3 very good let's have another one we have m increased by 3 here we already have a variable which is m so let us write m next we have the keyword increase by increase by represents addition so that would be a plus sign and lastly the number three next one we have three added to m so again we already have a variable which is m and we need to add 3 to it so that is m plus 3 next one we have 3 more than m again our variable here is m and the word more than represents addition and we have three so that is m plus three now let us identify which are the variables coefficient constant and the number of terms here in our given algebraic expression the variable here is the letter which is and very good next one let us take a look for the coefficient again the coefficient is the number that we see before the variable as we can see there is no number before a variable here but it doesn't mean that we do not have a coefficient remember that a coefficient is a factor or a number multiplied to a variable all variables that do not have a number beforehand has a coefficient of one because it means one times m which is equals m so the coefficient here is one next one the constant here is very good it is three and let's count the number of terms since this algebraic expression is separated by a plus sign or addition our terms here are m and 3. so we have two turns great job let's have another example next one we have a number minus seven again we have here a number which can be represented by a variable so let us say letter f our next keyword here is the word minus which represents subtraction and there is 7 so that is f minus seven next one we have the difference of f and seven so again let's take a look for some keywords we have different and the difference represents subtraction so we need to subtract f and seven all right let's have another example we have f decreased by seven so our variable here is f and we need to decrease this one which represents subtraction by seven next example we have seven subtracted from f so our variable here is is the letter f and we need to subtract seven from it to that will be m minus seven and lastly we have seven less than f and our variable again here is letter f and our keyword is less than which means subtraction 7 so that is f minus seven now let's identify the variable here again our variable is the letter which is very good is letter f and now let's take a look for the coefficient since there's no number before our variable here therefore the coefficient here is one next one is the constant the constant here is negative 
,,seven now let's count the number of terms so we have here minus that separates the term so we have f and seven so that is to turn all right let's go to our next example this time we have a number time two again we have here the missing value which is a number so now let's represent it by a letter let's say letter n times which means multiplication two in an algebraic expression we do not use the multiplication sign as it confuses us into a variable x instead of using the multiplication sign the number we just simply combine the number and the variable so that would be 2 n next example we have twice of n here our variable is n and our keyword is the word to white which means to time so that is two times n therefore that is to n on to our next example we have n multiplied by two here our variable is letter n and our keyword is multiplied by two so we need to multiply n by two so that would be two n next one we have the double of n here our keyword again is double which means times two so we need to times two the letter n so that is two n all right next one we have the product of n and two so our variable here is n and our keyword is product which is the answer for multiplication this means that we need to multiply n and 2 so that is 2 m now let us identify the variable the variable here obvi is the letter and while the coefficient is 2 as it is the number before the variable next one is the constant as we can see we do not have a constant here while the number of terms since there's no addition or subtraction that separates the term we only have one term now let's move on to our next example next one we have a number divided by five again we have the missing volume which is a number so let us represent this by a variable f and we need to divide this by five so we can write this as n divided by five next one we have the quotient of n and phi so again our keyword here is equation which means division so it means that we need to divide n and five so that is n divided by five next one we have one fifth of n so it means that we need to multiply one and n so that is one-fifth n but it can also be written as n over five okay next one we have the ratio of n to five our variable here is n and our clue word here is the ratio we all know that we can represent ratio by a fraction so 
,,that would be n is to five or n over five which also means and divided by five now our variable here is the letter n while the coefficient here is one fifth as this 
,,is the factor or the number being multiplied to the variable n next one is the constant here we cannot see a constant so that would be zero or not well the number of terms since there's no addition or attraction with separate t terms this means that we only have one term great job now that you already know some basics this time 
,,let's try to translate a verbal expression with more than one operation into algebraic expression let's have our first example six more than twice a number so again 
,,we need to take a look for some clues in order for us to translate this one so our clue word here as we can see we have two white a number and we all know that that 
,,means two times a number or a variable so we can say that is two a and next one we have six more than and that is plus six so therefore our expression here is two a 
,,plus six wonderful now let's identify the variable here is a good job well the coefficient here is 2. next one the constant is 6 and we have here two terms which are two a and six let's have another example this time we have 18 less than half a number now let's take a look for some favorite we have here 18 less than and we all know that lessons mean subtract so that is minus eight next one we have have a number and that means one half times a number or a variable so that would be one half y now if we combine them together we have one half y minus eight so that is 18 less than half a number so here our variable is y well the coefficient here is one half well the constant is negative 18 or minus 18. and the number of terms here are two that is one-half y and eighteen now let's have another example we have one plus twice a number is ten so our first clue right here is to rise a number and that means three times a variable so we can say it is to re b next one we have one plot and that means plus one if we combine that together we have three b plus one and we still have more to translate here we have the word estet which means that equals ten so that is three b plus one equals ten so here we have the variable b while the coefficient here is three the constants are one and ten and the number of terms here are three which are three b one and ten this time let us translate an expression into a verbal or word sentences or phrases here we have b plus eight divided by two so first we have b plus eight we can write this one as the sum of b and eight and next we have divided by two so that would be divided by two now we have the sum of b and eight divided by two wonderful let's have another example here we have three n plus 25 equals 31. first let's try to translate plus 25. we can translate this 
,,one as 25 added two but i will use 25 added two next we have three n this means that three times n but we can also say to rise of n and lastly we have equals 31 which means s31 so now we have 25 added tutorials of n is 31. good job students you made it this far now here are the things that you learned today you

AlgebraicExpression,Ks-wwYpS20Y,in this video we're gonna take a look at one of the most powerful and time-saving algebra tricks ever I've tutored hundreds and hundreds of students and I have never seen any of them used this trick I don't think anyone really knows about this so stay tuned so you can learn one of the best algebra tricks ever hey everyone its Brian if you're looking for all the lessons and tricks to make math easy start now by subscribing one of the most hated things to do in math and algebra in precalc is 
,,solving systems of equations everybody hates doing it if you don't remember what systems of equations look like they look like this right systems of equations or simultaneous equations you're given more than one equation and more than one variable and the traditional way that you solve this is either by what's called elimination or by substitution basically you solve for one of the variables in one equation and you plug it into the other equation it's a lot of work so with this method we're just gonna skip all that we're just gonna skip right to the answer all right are you ready for it so here we go I'm just gonna write the answer x is equal to here's how it works 2 times 10 is 20 minus there's a 1 in front of this Y 1 times 11 is 11 divided by 2 times 2 is 4 minus 1 times 1 is 1 that would be 20 minus 11 is 9 over 4 minus 1 is 3 9 over 3 is 3 you just solved for X in like a few seconds Wow so at this point to get Y you have an option if it's easier you can just plug 3 in for X into either of these equations and get Y but that's kind of just like the old method so I'm just gonna continue with my trick so let's do the same thing for y y 
,,is equal to and it works just slightly different than the last time so Y is equal to 11 times 2 is 22 - 1 times 10 is 10 and then I divide by the exact same thing I 
,,got last time I work in here 2 times 2 is 4 minus 1 times 1 is 3 you can just you can just keep the denominator here it's gonna be the same so when you're solving for y it's even one less step so I'll just keep that as 3 22 minus 10 is 12 over 3 12 over 3 is 4 and there you go you solved the system of equation without doing any 
,,elimination without doing any substitution just wrote down the answer saves you so much time so at this point you might be wondering why have you never heard of this where does this come from this is actually something called Kramer's rule it's something you learn in a linear algebra class or a matrices class the reason you haven't heard of it is because it involves what are called determinants and that's something that's defined for matrices and I just kind of threw that all out I didn't worry about doing any of the theory behind it and I took away some of the intermediate steps just to get to the bare bone just to get the answer as quick as possible 
,,so if you want to look into the theory of Kramer's rule you're welcome to but this is the application of Kramer's rule I just kind of removed a few intermediate steps for you let's take a look at one more example to make sure you've got this down here I have another system of equations simultaneous equations 3x minus y equals to 4x plus 5y equals 1 and let's do the trick so here we go X is equal to and remember how this works we do minus 1 so we do the coefficient of Y here minus 1 times 1 
,,is minus 1 minus 2 times 5 is 10 divided by and this time we go the diagonals the other way minus 1 times minus 4 is 4 minus 3 times 5 is 15 if you simplify this minus 1 minus 10 is minus 11 minus 4 I'm sorry 4 minus 15 is -11 something over itself is positive one how do you do it with y remember this time we take the coefficients of the X I do two times minus 4 is minus 8 minus 1 times 3 is 3 all over and remember the bottom the denominator it's just the same from the last time so you can 
,,just keep this keep the denominator to the same don't even worry about computing that the second time minus 8 minus 3 again is minus 11 over minus 11 that's again 1 
,,so X is 1 and Y is 1 in this equation and if you're ever not sure if you ever feel like you made a mistake you could always plug these numbers back into the equations and make sure that you make sense if I plug 1 in for X and y 3 minus 1 is 2 and minus 4 plus 5 is 1 it works out before you try this trick on your problems make sure you have the ordering right make sure you know which numbers to multiply and when when you're solving for x it's this times this minus this times this and when you're solving for y it's this times this minus this times this make sure you have the ordering down for the numerators now I know what you're thinking you're saying Brian this is great two-by-two systems of two equations and two unknowns two variables that's great you just saved me a lot of time thank you very much what if I have more what if I have three equations and three unknowns what if you have more than that so here are three equations with three variables can I use my trick for this 
,,the answer is yes but it's probably not worth it Cramer's rule this trick it gets a little bit more complicated the more equations you use you can learn the details 
,,if you take a matrices or linear algebra class but it actually wouldn't recommend this trick for a more than just two equations it kind of just gets a little bit too complicated and a little bit too much to memorize as a trick if you do want to learn the best way to solve this system and actually exactly this system you can click right here and you can watch my video on what's called Gaussian elimination that shows you how to solve a system of three equations in three unknowns the best and 
,,most efficient way in this video you learned one of the most powerful and time-saving algebra tricks out there to solve systems of equations I really hope you got something out of this video if you found it helpful I would really appreciate it if you would subscribe to my channel and tell your friends watch this video too so they can learn the benefits of this trick thanks very much for watching have a great day

AlgebraicExpression,-6BxSBRWQ2o,hello graduate children today i'm here to teach you chapter 6 in your textbook that's solids so what are solids take a stone that's a solid 3d figure a cuboid a brick a dye so those are solid so you get different shapes in this lesson we'll discuss certain types of solids so what are solids object that has a specific shape and which occupies a certain amount of space is called a solid surfaces of solids can be curved or play so take a thin biscuit tin so you get curved surface as well as plane surfaces and when you take a cube cuboid you get only plane surfaces so you get different types of solids with curved as well as plane surfaces so you need to know what are these terms we we can say vertices f is faces and e edges we'll see what are edges faces and vertices in certain solids first shape that you have to learn about a cube what is a cube all sides you get squares all sides are equal now we will look at a cube and see what are edges vertices and faces so i have a model with me so this is a cube when you take one side that's a square so when you turn this way you get squares now first thing we need to look at number of faces so how many faces are there so one two three four five six so six faces are there number of edges so these lines are called edges so 1 2 3 4 and 5 6 7 8 and sideways 9 10 11 
,,12 so all together 12 edges are there number of vertices vertices are these points 1 2 3 4 other side another four four plus four eight so when you look at this diagram you can figure out number of faces one two three four five six and vertices 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and number of edges 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 12 edges are there now we'll find out what's the sum of faces and edges faces and vertices v plus f vertices plus faces b is eight and six so eight plus six you get fourteen now take e plus two edges plus two edges twelve 12 plus 2 also you are getting 14. so what can you say about this we can write v plus f vertices plus faces is equal to edges plus two so vertices plus faces is equal to edges plus two so this is called euler's relationship so euler found out that he's a mathematician he found out the vertices 
,,and phases when you add it it's equal to the edges plus 2. now we look at these shapes first one is a cuboid like a brick second one a cube a dye a regular tetrahedron so here all sides are triangles and a square pyramid so you get a square in the base and all the other sides are triangles and a triangular prism means you get two triangles and you get three rectangles so that's called a triangular prism so these all are solids a regular regular means all sides are equal now we'll take those shapes and identify vertices faces and edges take the first one what do you call that a cuboid how many vertices are there one two three four five six seven eight how many faces like cube you get six faces edges you can count 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12. so 12 edges are there so same as a cube b is a cube we did that before so you get same number of vertices spaces and it's just like the cubot see a regular tetrahedron have you seen a regular tetrahedra so i'll show you this is a regular tetrahedron all sides you get triangles but regular means this is like isosceles triangles here but if all sides are equal we call it regular tetrahedron so c regular 
,,tetrahedron now we'll see how many vertices are there one two three four how many faces one two three and bottom so you get four edges one two three four five six six edges are there so you can use this diagram as well so here from this one two three four four vertices and one two three four five six six edges and four faces now take d d is a square pyramid so how many vertices are there one two three four five how many faces one two three four and bottom you get five how many edges one two three four five six seven 8 and e is a triangular prism so how many vertices are there one two three four five six six vertices are there how many faces one two three four five and how many edges one two three four five six seven eight nine nine edges are there now we'll see whether there's a relationship between vertices and faces with edges plus 2. so the first one a cuboid you get 8 plus 6 that's 14. 12 plus 2 that's 14. so these two are equal equal euler's relationship is true b is a cube same as cuboid you get 14 yeah 12 plus 2 you get 40. so that's also true but c is a regular tetrahedra regular tetrahedron four four six four four and six here so what you get four plus four eight six plus two eight so you are getting the same so euler's relationship is true d we found five five eight five five and here it just eight five and five ten eight plus two also ten so we can say euler's relationship is true for d as well what about e e is a triangular prism six five nine six five nine so 6 plus 5 11 9 plus 2 that's 11 so same thing so euler's relationship is true so what can you say about all these solids we can say v plus f is equal to e plus 2 so if you write down the words this is vertices this faces is equal to edges plus 2. now we'll look at this solid regular octahedron so what is octahedra means octa means eight eight sides are there so how can we create that so can you see one two three four five six seven eight triangles are there so regular means all sides are equal so these are equilateral triangles so when you take eight equilateral triangles you can create this regular octahedron so cut out the above figure and prepare a model of regular octahedron by folding along these edges examine and identify the special features of the model so we'll see what are the features what are the vertices edges and faces in regular octahedral so i have a model to show you so this is the regular octahedron eight sides are there so there are how many faces you get eight equilateral triangles so eight faces are there all phases are the shape of identical equilateral triangles there are how many vertices one two three 
,,four five and this one six so there are six vertices in a regular octahedron and how many straight edges are there one two three four and here also four four and four eight and here around this eight plus four you get 12 straight edges in a regular octahedron length of the edges are equal because we say this is a regular octahedral so all sides are equal edges intersect to make a vertex so this is a vertex how many edges intersect one two three four four edges intersect to make a vertex point how many faces intersect to make a vertex point one two three four four faces also when it intersects it makes a vertex point so this is a vertex point now remember this one to make a regular octahedral you need eight equilateral triangles so practice to draw the net to make the regular octahedron the next solid shape you need to know is about dodecahedron so dodeca means 12 12 faces are there so what are these shapes five-sided figure pentagons so one two three four five six 7 8 9 10 11 12 12 regular pentagons when you connect together you get dodecahedron this is a regular dodecahedron with 12 faces it consists of 12 regular pentagons with same area so cut out the above figure and prepare a model of regular dodecahedron by folding along these edges examine and identify the special features of the model practice to draw the net to make regular dodecahedron so we'll see what are the vertices edges and faces so i'll show you a model for that so this is a regular dodecahedron so all these are pentagons now we'll see how many phases i told you dodeca means dodecagon means 12 faces 12-sided polygon so 12 faces are there so remember that it's 12 faces all faces are the shape of identical regular pentagons there are how many vertices now we'll see how many vertices are there so we can take up there are five and down also five five and five ten what about around this we'll start from this vertex point 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 so we counted this one 10 so 5 and 5 10 10 
,,plus 10 20 20 vertices are there and there are edges how many edges are there one two three four five five above five down and here another five and another five so 
,,five ten twenty now what about a round we'll start from this line one two three four five six seven 8 9 10. so we counted this one so 10 and 10 10 all together 30 straight edges are in a regular dodecahedron so length of the edges are equal because this is a regular dodecahedron now we'll take another solid means 20 20 phases are there this is used to decorate christmas trees and take as visa planters so how can we make the ecosahedral you need 20 equilateral triangles cut out the above figure and prepare a model of regular ecosahedral by folding along edges examine and identify the special features of the model so we'll see how many edges vertices and faces in ecosahedron so this is an ecosahedral i'll show you a model so this is ecosahedra so how many equilateral triangles are there so you get 20 equilateral triangles so remember this is 20 20 faces are there all phases are the shape of identical equilateral triangles and how many vertices are there so count and see one one two three four five so here around five so 1 plus 5 6. so you get the same thing here 6 and 6 12 so you get 12 vertices in a regular because a hadron and how many edges are there so 1 2 3 4 5 and down also 5 and we need to count this way 5 this way 5 so 5 5 10 15 20 now now we will see side how many edges are there we'll start 
,,from this slide one two three four five six seven 8 9 10. so we started from this point so 10 there so all together how many edges are there 30. so 30 straight edges in a regular cosahedron length of the edges are equal because this is a regular ecosahedron now we'll fill in the blanks using previous solids so can you remember regular tetrahedra how many vertices we got one and then three so four faces three triangles and below four edges six so what's v plus f faces n vertices 4 plus 4 you get 8. and e edges we got 6 6 plus 2 you get 8. so what can you say about euler's relationship that's true cube can you remember cube how many vertices 8 and faces 
,,6 and edges 12 so when you take v plus f 8 plus 6 that's 14 12 plus 2 also 14. so that means euler's relationship is true regulo-octahedron now we look at this one regulo-octahedron octa means eight so eight faces are there and can you remember we did that we got six vertices and 12 edges now we'll see vertices plus faces 6 plus 8 you get 14 and edges plus 2 you get 40. so that's true eyeless relationship is true now regular dodecahedron dodeca means 12 phases so remember that and then we got 30 edges and 20 vertices now we'll see whether it's true 20 plus 12 you get 32 and 30 plus 2 also 32 so that's true and regular ecosystem ecosa means 20 spaces so remember that one 20 faces are there and we got this one 12 and this is 30. so what's v plus f so 12 plus 20 is 32 and 30 plus 2 also 32. so this is true for this solid as well so how can we remember these edges vertices and faces look at this one so easily you can remember regular tetrahedron and cube here this is cuboid cube 
,,and cuboid you get the same thing and here octahedron remember this 8 and then dodecahedron remember 12 and 32 then you can fill the other values and regulators are 
,,hydrogen also remember 20 and 32 so when you subtract you get the same here same ages for both regular dodecahedron and regular ecosystem what are platonic solids you have learned five types of regular solids that are introduced by the mathematician plato so therefore we call it as platonic solids having identical regular polygonal phases the same number of phases meeting at every vertex so in platonic solids we know that vertices plus phases is equal to edges plus two so platonic means regular polygonal phases what are they we learned about that regular tetrahedra cube regular octahedron regular dodecahedron regular ecosahedra those are the five platonic solids now we'll look at this question select the nets which cannot be constructed a cube now look at carefully this one you can make a cube so this is the bottom surface and then you can create the cube by folding these along these edges so this is okay you can create a cube but what happens here when you keep this one as the base you can create all sides but what happens to the top part so you can't create a cube there this one here when you fold it these two sides come this way but we can't fold this one to make a cube so you can't make the top part so this is also wrong and what about this one bottom is here so you get two faces here and when you put it up you can create a cube so you can create here a cube there label the given nets of cubes which the sum of opposite sides is equal to 7 so that means if you take up and butter the sum should be 7 so here one done for you so when you create this one this is the bottom and you get this is the uppermost part so 5 plus 2 
,,7. so likewise you are getting opposite side how can we create another one so you can put any number there if this is 4 so this is the upper part for this one so 4 plus 3 that's 7. if this is 6 this and this side you need to get 7 and 5 with 2 you can put any number we'll put 5 there if this is 5 this should be 2 because this is up and down and here side these two so you can put 1 and 6 there and here if this is 4 this should be 3 so you can create you can put any number and see to get the 
,,sum of opposite sides is equal to 7 from which net that can be constructed a square pyramid here this is a square and you get four triangles now you can close this side and this side what about this side we can't connect this one here so you can't create a square pyramid from this then you take this one this comes here and then 
,,you can fold it and create a square pyramid here so that's correct this one you can fold it here and here but you can't close it from this triangle so you can't create so what's the number number two is the correct diagram below is a composite solid made out of a cube and a square pyramid find out number of phases vertices and edges and check whether euler's relationship satisfies the satisfies for the solid now consider faces here when you take the cuboid cube you're not getting six faces 
,,because here the upper part is closed with this pyramid so you get five here and what about this one so you get 4 4 plus 5 9 9 faces are there vertices will count vertices 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 9 vertices are there edges 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12. 13 14 15 16 16 edges are there now we'll add faces and vertices faces and vertices nine plus 9 so you get 18. e plus 2 16 plus 2 you get 18. so what can you say about the euler's relationship it's true below is a triangular prism find out number of phases vertices and edges and check where the euler's relationship satisfy for the solid now faces two triangles and three rectangles so three plus two five faces are there vertices one two three four five six six vertices are there edges one two three four five six seven eight nine now we let faces and vertices 5 plus 6 you get 
,,11. e plus 2 edges 9 9 plus 2 11. so what can you say about euler's relationship that's true below is a prism with cross-section as trapezium find out number of faces vertices and edges and check whether euler's relationship satisfy for the solid faces so you get one two three four five six so like a cube six faces are there vertices one two three four five six seven eight edges one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve so same as a cube or cuboid faces plus vertices you get 6 plus 8 that's 14 edges plus 2 12 plus 2 you get 14. so both are the same so you can write the euler's relationship is true below is a prism with cross-section as trapezium find our number of phases vertices and edges and check whether euler's relationship satisfy for the solid now same as before so how many faces are there one two three four five six six faces are there vertices one two three four five six seven eight eight vertices edges one 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 12 edges are there now add faces and vertices you get 6 plus 8 that's 14 e plus 2 means 12 plus 2 that's 14. so you get same as this so euler's relationship is true below is a prism with cross section as trapezium find out number of phases vertices and edges and check whether euler's relationship satisfies for the solid how many faces one two 
,,three four five and the bottom one six vertices 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 edges 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 and here this one 12 we can't see that but it's behind so 12 f plus v faces plus vertices 6 plus 8 you get 14 edges plus 2 12 plus 2 that's also 14. so you get euler's relationship is true now we'll look at review exercise fill in the blanks in the table given below a cuboid so can you remember 12 edges six faces and eight vertices so cube is the same as cuboid so 12 6 8 regular tetrahedron tetrahedron you can draw a triangle like this and another triangle here and you can connect so this is a regular tetrahedron how many faces one two three four faces four edges we'll count vertices first one two three four and edges one two three 5 6 6 edges square pyramid how can you draw a square pyramid you can first draw a square and take any vertex point and connect all these then so that's a square pyramid how many edges are there one two three four five six seven eight eight edges are there 
,,faces so four around and bottom one that's five vertices one two three four five and triangular prism how can you draw a triangular prism you can draw a triangle here another triangle and then connect all sides like this this is a triangular prism how many edges one two three four five six seven eight nine nine edges are there how many faces one two three four five five faces and how many vertices one two three four five six six vertices are there draw nets that can be used to construct the following solids a square pyramid so how can you draw square pyramid means a square and four triangles so you need to draw a square here and then triangles around so these sides are equal so that means these also needs to be equal so all sides are equal so that's a square pyramid triangular prism you need you need two triangles and three rectangles so you can take three rectangles like this and two triangles there when you fold it you can get a triangular prism question number three a figure of a solid constructed by pasting together two triangular faces of two identical regular tetrahedrons one on the other is given here find the number of edges faces and vertices of the solid so we look at number of faces f f is number of faces so you get here one two three four five six six faces are there then how many edges 
,,are there edges one two three four five six seven eight nine nine edges how many vertices one two three four five v equals five now we'll see whether the euler's relationship is true vertices plus faces so v equals 5 plus phaser 6 you get 11. now we'll check e plus 2 edges is 9 9 plus 2 you get 11. so in this one vertices plus faces is equal to e plus 2. so euler's relationship is true a solid constructed by joining a cube and a square pyramid is shown in the figure find the number of edges phases and vertices of this solid so we'll find out edges edges 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 edges are there how many vertices are there one two three four 5 6 7 8 9 9 vertices are there how many faces are there one two three four and four around here this is for the cube you can take five except the top part so five 
,,plus 4 9. now we'll check whether the euler's relationship is true v plus f 9 plus 9 you get 18. edges plus 2 16 plus 2 also 18. now can you see v plus f is equal to edges plus 2 so euler's relationship is true exercise 6.1 name the solid which can be constructed using each net given below so rectangles and two another rectangles this is a q void this one one two three four four triangles tetrahedron here it's not mentioned all sides are equal if it's all sides are equal this is a regular tetrahedra so one side is an equilateral triangle now how many faces are there one two three four five six seven eight eight faces what's the name regular octahedron 
,,if all sides are equal we call it a regular one regular octahedra then this is six squares so what you call that cue cube not cuboid cube this one two triangles and 
,,three rectangles triangular prism how many triangles are there one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twenty means ecosa ecosahedron so this is regular ecosa hedron exercise 6.2 verify euler's relationship for a regular tetrahedron by considering the number of phases vertices and edges it has so it's easy to draw a regular tetrahedron so big triangle and a small triangle like this and then connect so this is tetrahedral and how many vertices are there so how many vertices are there we'll count one two three four four vertices are there how many edges you can count one two three four five six and how many faces one two three four so around three and bottom one that's four so four six four now we'll verify euler's relationship so according to euler's relationship v plus f vertices plus faces is equal to edges plus 2. now left hand side v plus f 4 plus 4 you get 8 right hand side edges six plus two you get eight so left hand side is equal to right hand side so you can say it's true euler's relationship is true for this solid that's regular tetrahedron look at question number two for a square pyramid write down the number of faces vertices and edges show that the above values satisfy euler's relationship square 
,,pyramid so you can draw a square like this and connect to a point so this is a square base pyramid and now you can count how many vertices one two three four five how many faces one down and four triangles four plus one five faces are there and how many edges edges i can use one two three four five six seven eight now we'll see 
,,whether euler's relationship is true v plus f is e plus 2 vertices 5 faces 5 so you get 10 here edges 8 plus 2 this is also 10 so left hand side is equal to right hand side so this is true euler's relationship is true for square pyramid question number three if a certain solid has nine edges six vertices and if euler's relationship is satisfied find the number of faces it has so we know according to the euler's relation vertices plus faces is edges plus two we know how many vertices are there six many edges 9 now we need to find out how many phases so we'll put f for faces and we'll try to solve the equation 9 plus 2 11. 6 plus f is 11 so what's f subtract 6 from both sides so 11 minus 6 you get 5 so 5 faces question number 4 a figure of a composite solid is shown here determine with reasons where the euler's relationship is satisfied for this solid so we need to count vertices faces edges now we'll see vertices one two three four five six seven eight nine faces one two three four five and then four around four triangles five plus four nine edges itches 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 edges now we'll see whether it's true v plus f is e plus 2 now we'll check v is 9 phase is 9 so left hand side is 18. what about right hand side e means 16 plus 2 so you get 18 here so left hand side is equal to right hand side so this is true for this solid question number five a certain solid has ten edges six faces find the number of vertices it has if euler's relationship is satisfied so here what's the equation v plus f is e plus two we vertices so you need to find out that f six faces is given ten edges now if it's true this satisfy so you can solve the equation v plus 6 is equal to 10 plus 2 12 subtract 6 from both sides you get v equals 12 minus 6 so six vertices question number six the figure given here shows a pyramid of which the upper portion has been cut out and removed verify euler's relationship for this solid okay so we'll find out number of vertices one two three four five six seven eight vertices are there how many edges one one two three 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 and how many faces so here four around four 
,,and then two upper face and the bottom face so six now we'll check whether this is true we plus f equals e plus 2 left-hand side we 8 plus 6 and e is 12 plus 2 so 8 
,,plus 6 is 14 12 plus 2 is 14 so this is left hand side and this is right hand side this is equal so two sides are equal therefore euler's relationship is true for this solid exercise 6.3 complete the table given below so cube shape of the face of the solid we know that's that's a square are all the faces regular yes regular are 
,,the number of phases meeting at each vertex equal equal so when you take one point one two three so when you take this one also one two three so equal number of faces meeting a text number of faces also equal number of edges one two three one two three so three edges meet at vertex and three phases meet at a vertex is the solid 
,,a platonic solid platonic solids those are regular ones yes that's a regular one now we'll take cuboid so when you take a cuboid you can get square or a rectangle so are all the faces regular no rectangles two opposite sides are equal not all sides are equal not regular are the number of phases meeting at each vertex equal if you take this vertex number of faces one two three if this is the vertex one two three so that's equal number of phases meeting at a vertex point so how many three is 
,,the solid a platonic solid no this is not regular it's not a platonic solid regular tetrahedron so each one is a equilateral triangle so each shape is an equilateral triangle so that's regular are the number of faces meeting at each vertex equal if you take this one one two three here get one two three yes equal and it's three and is the solid a platinic solid yes because this is a regular one this one regular octahedral so regular means all sides are equal and octahedron eight sides are there each one is equilateral triangle so this is regular and if you take this vertex how many sides are there four if you take this one one two three four so equal and what's the number that's four so yes this is a platonic solid more shapes are there regular dodecahedron dodeca means 12 sided figure so each side it's a regular pentagon all the faces regular yes i'll write regular are the number of phases meeting at each vertex equal we'll look at it if you take this one one two three if you take this one one two three yes equals and three vertices three phases meet at one vertex is a solid a platonic solid yes because this is regular regular ecosahedra how many sides 20 triangles are there so that's regular one and what you call that equilateral triangles are there so that's regular and we'll check if you take this vertex how many faces one two three four five if you take this one one two three four five five faces meet at one vertex point that's equal and this is a platonic 
,,shape so you can write down that's here's a platonic solid and the last one is a composite solid consisting of a cuboid and a square pyramid so what are the shapes you are getting now we look at the last one composite solid consists of a cuboid and a square pyramid so cuboid means a rectangle squares you can get so you can get rectangle square and here equilateral triangles and are these regular no because rectangles are there so not regular and are the number of faces meeting at each vertex equal we'll check if you take this one you get one two three four if you take one point here this one you get one two three four if you take this point you get only three so that means it's not equal we can't give exact numbers so sometimes three sometimes four so is the solid a platonic no it's not a platonic solid question number two construct a regular ecosahedron and 20 regular tetrahedron such that the ecosahedral and the tetrahedrons have edges of equal length construct a composite 
,,solid by pasting a tetrahedron on each phase of the ecosahedron for the composite figure and find out the number of edges and the number of phases and the number of 
,,vertices so this means when you take 20 tetra regular tetrahedrons and when you paste it what you get you get a ecosahedral so you get an ecosystem so here if you take this one ecosahedral so and this is tetrahedron if all sides are equal here when you paste it 20 of these equivalent to one ecosahedral so basically they are asking number of edges number of phases and number of vertices of a of an ecosahedron solid so that means you know already ecosahedron is how many faces 20 faces so here number of faces 20 and then remember 32 32 is the total then number of edges is 32 minus 2 that's 30 this is number of vertices is how you get 32 you are adding 12 
,,to that so 30 20 and 12. from the following select the platonic solids and write down the corresponding numbers so this is not regular not a platonic so here this is a platonic shape that's cube this is a platonic shape regular tetrahedron and here this can be a square so this is not a regular one and here this is a regular one 
,,so if this is 12 sides one so we call this is this is 10. 10 plus 2 12 sides are there so what you call that that's dodecahedron and this is it can be a square or a 
,,rectangle here so it is not regular so you can't take that one and prism is also not a regular one so that's not platonic solid and what's this this is ecosahedron ecosahedron is 20. equilateral triangles are there so what are the shapes now look at this one here you get eight faces and equilateral triangles we can say regular octahedron so that's a platonic solid and prism is not a platonic solid it's not regular and what is this 20 faces with all equilateral triangles ecosatran is a platonic shape so what are the platonic shapes two three five six and eight they are called platonic solids again what are the platonic solids regular tetrahedral cube regular octahedron regular dope decahedron and regular ecosahedra so you can remember tetra means four four faces are there octa eight faces are there dodeca dodeca means twelve twelve faces are they are eco means twenty faces and remember again what's the next thing you need to remember the total is 32 here as well as 32 yeah then easily you can find out the number of uh faces we know edges and vertices so remember octa means 80 octa means 8 dodeca means 12 picosa means twin so we covered all theory related to solids so what are the things we discussed the sum of the number of faces and the number of vertices of a solid with straight edges is two more than the number of edges so that's the euler's relationship solids having identical regular polygonal phases and with the same number of phases meeting at every vertex are called platonic solids the five types of regular tetrahedron cube regular octahedral regular dodecahedron and regular ecosahedrons are the only solids that are platonic solids so remember these words and we know the shapes you are getting so remember all these and number of faces edges and vertices so you can remember easily for ecosahedron the total is 32 and 20 faces dodecahedron 32 is the total and 12 faces are there octa-octahedron eight phases are there and cuban cuboid both got 
,,same number of faces and vertices so practice and try to make all these solids and figure out number of edges vertices and faces

AlgebraicExpression,flXVRy1hjf4,hello grade 8 children today I am here to teach you mathematics relevant to your textbook so what's the first unit in your textbook that's called number patterns so 
,,this is an interesting topic and we'll create number patterns using numbers so let's take 1 2 3 what are those those are digits so here we call these are counting numbers as well counting numbers so one two three like that we can't write all numbers so that's why we put three dots after this so if any pattern if you can't write 
,,it all you have to put three dots we can create different number patterns from these counting numbers so let's take different patterns check the first one one three 
,,five seven nine what are those we call these are odd numbers numbers less than ten only if you take odd numbers you have to write down 11 13 like that but this is the number set less than check so that's why here we put curly brackets and write down 1 1 3 5 7 9 so here you can't see 3 dots this is not continuing now we can find 
,,a next term by adding 2 to the previous so here how do you get 3 from 1 we can add 2 3 plus 2 you get 5 5 + 2 7 7 + 2 9 so since the exact number of terms in this number pattern can be specified therefore it is a finite number time so here certain numbers are there so remember this term finite number pad tick the same thing 1 3 
,,5 7 9 odd numbers less than 10 in this number pattern what's the first term the first number in the number pattern we call the first term so in this one what's the first term second term is 3 third term five fourth term seven and fifth term is now let's take these numbers 2 4 6 8 10 12 what are those those are even numbers so we can divide these numbers by 2 the remainder is 0 so here you see two three dots that means this number pattern continues what you call that that's called in finite 
,,number pattern so what's the first term in this sequence or number buggy that's 2 the second term is 4 36 4 8 and the fifth term so you know how to identify terms in the number pad and what are the two words you learn finite number pattern L in finite number pattern let's take this one 5 8 11 14 17 so when you take two numbers next to each other what do you call that consecutive term so here 5 & 8 are consecutive terms when you take 8 and 11 those are also consecutive terms so you can take 
,,any 2 you can take any two terms next to each other those are called consecutive terms so 14 and 17 also consecutive terms so we'll take that one and see the pattern how you get a it from five we need to add three 8 plus 3 you get 11 11 plus 3 14 14 plus 370 so how can we find out this number so you can take any two terms consecutive terms in the number pattern if you take this is the next term and the one before that that's called previous term we can take the difference so how do you get 
,,this number 11 minus 8 or 8 minus 5 so what you call that number common difference so you are learning another term that's common difference how you get the common difference you need two consecutive terms and take the difference when you are taking the difference don't subtract 5 minus 8 that's wrong so next term minus the previous term so we'll do that so you can either take 8 minus 5 Oh 11 minus 8 you are getting same answer or 14 minus 11 or 17-14 so that's how we find out the common difference let's take this one find the common difference of the following number pattern's now you know we can take the difference between two consecutive terms so you can take any two numbers so I'll take these two then what's the difference 16 minus 12 you get this one what's the common difference these two 36 minus 30 that's six when you take these two twenty minus ten that's ten look at this question write down the first five terms of the following number patterns you have given the first term and the common differences you can start from the first seven common difference is three means you need to add three to the previous term 7 + 3 10 10 plus 3 13 13 plus 3 16 16 plus 3 19 one two three four five and you can put three dots to show that it is continuing next one first term is 14 then common difference is plus four means adding four to the previous one four plus 14 plus 480 18 plus four 22 22 plus four 26 26 plus four 30 next one first term six and common difference six so that means multiples of six so starting from 6 6 plus 6 12 12 plus 6 18 18 plus 6 24 24 plus 6/13 this one first term is 12 and the common difference is eight at eight to that 12 plus 8 20 20 plus eight twenty eight twenty eight plus eight 36 36 Plus eight forty four one two three four five can put three dots after that look at this one right down the next two terms of the following sequences so you need to identify the pattern 712 so what's the common difference 12 minus 7 adding fine so that means in this number pattern the common difference is +5 so that means add 5 to that 27 plus 5 32 32 + 5 30 silver this one identify the common difference first you get server last 7 so what you do 41 is the last term so you add 7 to that you get 48 48 plus 750 this one what's the common difference how do you get 12 from 9 adding 3 let me you can start from here 21 plus three twenty four twenty four plus three twenty seven this Molly plus five 16 plus five you get 20 bar then you can 
,,start from here 36 plus five 41 41 plus five 46 this one have you get thirty from twenty four adding six to that so that means 48 plus 6 54 54 plus six that's 60 this one following number pattern is created multiplied the previous term by 2 now this is multiplication 2 times 2 you get 4 4 times 2 8 8 times 2 16 16 times 2 32 so 
,,this is the number pattern so I can write this one starting from 2 4 8 16 32 now look at this 1 2 4 8 10 20 a different number pattern following number pattern is created first added to and then multiplied by 2 so added to 2 plus 2 you get 4 times 2 8 then adding 2 8 plus 2 10 10 times 2 20 so this is also another number pattern so 2 4 8 10 20 now look at these so first 3 terms are the same but fourth term and fifth term those are different so from these two patterns we observed even though the first 3 terms are the same can create different number patterns so same for three terms but you can create different number pants now look at this one added 3 to the previous term 3 plus 3 you get 6 6 plus 3 9 9 plus 3 12 12 plus 3 15 so here what are the numbers three six nine twelve fifteen now first three terms are the same 369 but this is 18 and 21 so how can you create that pattern first multiplied by two and then added three multiplied by two you get six then added 3 6 plus 3 9 then multiplied by 2 again 9 times 2 18 18 plus 3 21 so this one is 3 6 9 18 21 so first three terms are the same but you can create different number patterns fill in the blanks to generate different number patterns so what can we do hi plus 5 10 10 plus 5 15 that means adding 5 15 20 25 30 look at this one you can do another partner we can do multiply by 2 and add 5 5 times 2 10 10 plus 5 15 and what's the next number 15 times 2 30 30 plus 5 35 35 times 2 you get 70 this one 7 14 21 multiples of server so that means adding 7 to that so 21 plus seven twenty eight twenty eight plus seven 35 35 plus 7 42 now create another number pattern different one see first three terms try to create another one this one I can do multiply by 2 and then add 7 multiplied by 2 first and then at 7 so multiply by 221 times 242 add seven more T naught now again x - 2 times 9 18 so 2 times 9 18 2 times 4 8 + 1 98 now we'll discuss what is general term of the number pattern take this number pattern two four six eight ten twelve means even numbers so you want to write down the general term of the multiples of two now we'll try to do that so term number term and pattern okay what's the first term in this sequence or number pattern that's how can I write down two I can write 1 times 2 or 2 times 1 second term second term is 4 
,,try to write down number 4 - x - third term 6 what's the pattern I can write this one as 2 times 3/4 1 8 2 times 4 now see your pattern 10th term I need no tense term so 10th term is what 2 times 10 by looking at the pattern we can get 2 times 10 because first term is 2 times 1 second term is 2 times 2 so temp term 2 times 10 that's 20 then what about nth term n means any term I can write 2 times N or when you write without this multiplication I can write - so what's the enter to win we call this as general term so nth term is the general term of the number pattern so what you can write for multiples of Oh general term is 2 what are the numbers for n you have to start from one n equals 1 first term in equals 2 second term so likewise when you substitute in values we can find out any term so you need general term to find out the terms now what are these numbers 3 6 9 12 15 18 multiples of 3 write down the general term of the multiples of 3 so we'll try to do the same thing like before first term first term is 3 what's the pattern I can write 3 times second term is 6 3 times 2 this number and this one is the same third one 9 3 times 3/4 1 
,,12 3 times 4 then what about temperature I can write 3 times 10 that becomes 30 and what about the general term nth term three times in oh I can write down three so 
,,what's the general term of multiples of 3 is 3 and so I can write down this one as 3 n so we found out the general pattern for multiples of 2 that's 2 it general term for multiples of 3 that's 3 n now this one feel the table below by observing the previous pattern multiples of 2 2 multiples of three general term is 3/8 can you identify then what about multiples of four that's foreign so you saw the patent two three four what about multiples are fired five multiples of 7 this is 7 in multiples of chain chain in and multiples of 11 obviously that's a lemon now the reverse process finding terms using general term if you know the general term how can we find out these terms so in this example first three terms first three terms means N equals one N equals two and in equals three so what you do take the general term substitute one for first term that's three to get the second term you substitute n equal to 3 times 2 6 when N equals 3 you get the third term so that's what about tenth term general term is trillion so tenth term is 3 times 10 that's previous question which tell me 60 now the end term is given 60 and you are asked to find out what's the end value so what you do we equate general term is trillion and that's equal to 60 then how you solve this you can divide this by 3 to get in so 60 divided by 3 what you get n equals 60 divided by 3 you get 20 so 20th term is 60 or in other words we can say 20 multiple of 3 is 60 now the general term is given as 5 in you are asked to find out for three terms 11th term and which term is 75 so what you do for the first three you substitute N equals 1 you get the first term N equals 2 
,,you get the second term M equals 3 you get the good so 5 10 15 are the first three terms and then 11th term next one you are asked to find out the 11th term so how we find out the LMR term substitute 11 so 5 times 11 you get 55 so 11th term is 55 this one the third part which term is 75 means nth term is given 75 so you equate in term is 5 in general term that's equal to 75 so how you find out n divided by 5 75 divided by 5 you get 15 so 15 multiple of 5 is 75 this one you have given the general term is 11 find the 10th term so how you find out the 10th term substitute 10 for and 10th term is equal to 11 times 10 hundred 10 next 120th term so what you 
,,do substitute N equals 20 general term is 11 and that's given and you asked to find out the 20th term substitute in s 20 multiplied by 2 you get 22 put 1 0 220 this 
,,one the third part which term is 121 now the reverse process you'd have given the in term you also find out the in value and the fourth part also same way you asked 
,,to find out which term is 77 so we'll do that substitute then to get n you divide by 11 get 11 for it so 11th term is 121 what about 77 when you divide by 11 you get in ass so so seventh term is 77 fill in the blanks now you have given different number patterns and you asked to write down the first term and the change Roger so observe the first one four eight twelve sixteen multiples of four that means addition multiples are four that means adding four what's the first term for what's the general term for em then 9 18 27 36 multiples of 9 starting from 9 9 18 27 36 so what's the general term 9 in 1 2 3 4 this is also number pattern but you're adding 1 
,,to that so what's the general term starting from 1 we can write 1 in 8 16 24 those are multiples of 8 starting from 8 so the general term is a 10 identify this multiples of 12 starting from 12 you can write 12 in 1 3 5 7 9 11 find the general term for odd numbers what are even numbers 2 4 6 8 so we found out the general pattern 
,,for even numbers multiples of 2 what's that that's 2 in now we'll try to find out the general term for odd numbers what's the first term if it's even numbers what's 
,,the first term but in our pattern the first term is 1 so what can you see you have to subtract 1 to get this one second term even numbers when you consider the second term is 4 but in this one that's 3 how you get 3 from 4 4 minus 1 third term for the even pattern six this one five you can subtract and get five one from the term fourth term is eight for even numbers in this one seven 8 minus 1 is 7 tenth term you get 2 times 10 20 odd numbers what's the 10th term one less than that so we observed a pattern one less than that so I can write 20 minus 1 that's 19 xx - 2 times 20 that's 40 but we know that's this is 1 less than that this is 39 so what's the general term we found out general term for even numbers that's 2 in so what's the pattern 2 n minus 1 so we can straightaway find out the general term for odd numbers that's 2 n minus 1 we can get odd numbers by subtracting 1 from all even numbers so remember now what's the general term for odd numbers 2 n minus 1 using that now we'll try to find our 23rd odd number to do that you need to know the general term so what's the general term for numbers 2 n minus 1 if you want twenty third term you substitute N equals 23 so 2 times 23 minus 1 so what's that you get 46 minus 1 forty hi 45th so what it means here 23rd odd number is 45 find the 36th odd number so what's the general term for numbers to win - what if you want 36 substitute 36 for in 2 times 6 12 1 remaining 2 times 3 6 + 1 7 72 minus 1 you get 71 36th odd number is 71 find the 18th odd number so what's the general term 2 n minus 1 18 term you substitute 18 for 2 times 8 16 1 remaining so 36 minus 1 you get 35 18th odd number is 35 which odd number 33 now the reverse process we know the general term is 2n minus 1 for numbers so we can substitute to win minus 1 is equal to 33 now 
,,is that linear equation simple algebraic equation you know already how to solve that so what you do you can get rid of this minus 1 by you can get rid of this minus 
,,one by adding 133 plus one so what you get here 34 is equal to two it to get em you can divide this by two so when you do that you can get n m equals 2 times 1 2 4 14 that's 7 so 17th odd number is 33 which odd number is 81 now you need to get the general term so what's general term general term is 2 n minus 1 now that's equal to 81 now solve that equation Advan first to get rid of this minus 1 you get 82 is equal to 2 in then you need to divide this by 2 to get n N equals 41 so 41 or term 
,,is 81 which odd term is 17 same thing take the general term equal to 70 get rid of this minus 1 that means adding 1 you get 18 is equal to 2 in then divide by 2 what you get you get 9/9 odd number is 17 now you need to know what R square are numbers so look at this diagram starting from 1 then 2 rows and 2 columns you can create a square so two times two that's four then three rows and three columns you can create the next square number four rows and four columns you can get their next one 
,,now we'll try to find out the general term for square numbers here is the pattern of circles forming squares which lengths and widths are the same what's the first term that's one second term for we'll try to write down the pattern first term I can write one times one second terms I can write 2 times two third term nine that's three times three if it's eight eighth term I can write by looking at this pattern eight times eight what's that 69 tell nine times nine that's 81 then what about enter this should be n times in so n times n you can write down as in squared so what's the general term for square numbers you can take as in squared now using the general term of the square number can you find the tenth square number so what's the generator in squared 10th term means we substitute check ten square are same as ten times ten you get hundred so tenth square number is 100 this one find the 12 square how you do take the general term n squared and it's not stood 12 12 times 12 that's unread 44 so 12 square number is 144 find the 15 square number write down the general term substitute 15 15 times 15 is 225 so 15 square number is 225 now we'll 
,,take triangular numbers look at the picture for starting from 1 you need 3 circles to create the next triangle what about the other one you need 6 circles to create 
,,the next triangular number next 1/4 110 to create the fourth triangular number so what's the first term first term is 1 second term is 3 third term 6 fourth term 10 
,,what about fifth term can you see the pattern right like this this is one how can you get three I can write 1 plus 2 6 1 plus 2 Plus 3 you get 6 10 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus 4 then what about fifth number 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus 4 plus 5 sum of numbers up to 5 so what's the number that means adding 5 to the previous term 10 plus five you get 15 as a fifth term of the triangular numbers now we can find out this one using a method now we'll take this one if you want adding one up to four when you take first and the last you can get one plus four you can get five to plus three you can get high so when you pair up the numbers like this you can get five in two methods either 2 plus 3 or 1 plus 4 so we can easily find out this as 5 is the number when you add you are getting 2 times of that so 5 times 2 that's 10 so this is the 
,,fourth triangular number so if you want fourth you add 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus 4 how we get the number this is the easiest way to do pair up the numbers like this and then see how many times you are getting the number so in the number is 5 and 2 times you are getting that's 10 we'll take another one if you want 8 triangular number 
,,you have to add 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus like that up to 8 when you pair up like this 1 plus h you get 9 2 plus 7 9 3 plus 6 9 4 + 5 9 how many times you are getting nine one two three four four times you're getting nine so what's the number 36 so eight triangular number is 36 now 10th triangular number what you do 1 plus 2 plus up 
,,to 10 so when you pair up how many sets you can get think about a pattern now previous one we got 4 into 9 is equal to 36 4 is yeah how many digits are there eight 8/2 so we can think about this is 8 divided by 2 you get 4 what about 9 9 you are getting think about first and last 1 plus 8 you did not so we'll try to use that pattern in the next one what's the total 1 plus 10 you are getting 11 2 plus 9 also 11 so how many Elevens you can you will get we can see 10 numbers that they are 10 divided by 2 5 times you are getting 11 so 5 times 11 oh I can write 5 as 10 divided by 2 and how you get 11 first and the last one 1 plus J now can you see the pattern 11 is obtained by adding the first term and the last term the following are 5 such terms so how you create that 10 divided by 2 now what is 10 number of terms and this is the first term and this is the last / - I can rewrite this as this 10 times 10 plus 1 is 11 over 2 so what's the formula you can find the number of terms multiplied by first and the last term addition divided by two so we'll try to apply this formula to find out any triangular number take this one one two eight eight triangular number what's the pattern again we found from the previous one number of terms into first Plus last divided by 2 number of terms 8 divided by 2 and x first 
,,and last one plus 8 again i can write 8 times 9/2 so when you simplify what you get 2 times 1/2 times 4 36 1 2 20 mins xx triangular number so I can write 20 divided by 2 here x 1 plus 20 this is same as 20 into 21 divided by 2 when you simplify you get 210 this one 50th triangular number 50 numbers are they are and divided by 2 1 plus 50 50 times 51 divided by 2 you get 25 times 50 baht so multiplication 25 times 51 means first multiply by 20 and then 5 2 times 1 is 2 and 2 times 5 ten high times 1/5 and 5 times 5 25 so when you add it you get thousand 275 now you need to find out the generator so what's the pattern if there are n digits in the next number is one more than that n plus 1 if the previous number is in you're adding 1 to that n plus 1 divided by 2 so what's the general term for the triangular number 
,,n times n plus 1 divided by 2 here you don't need to write down multiplication side brackets also ok but if you think that this is not talking you can write as in times n plus 1 divided by 2 so we'll try to find out any triangular number using the chain rule to find the 10th triangular number so what's the general term for triangular numbers in times in plus 1/2 now if you want 10th one you substitute 10 10 is n 10 plus 1 over 2 so 10 times 11 over 2 that becomes 50 so general term is n into n plus 1 over 2 for triangular numbers find the 20th triangular number so general term ending to n plus 1/2 so you need xx that means in equals 20 so 20 into 20 plus 125 so you get 10 times 21 210 find the fortieth triangular number you need the general term n into n plus 1 divided by 2 when this is 40 so 14 241 over 2 divided by 2 you get 20 that means multiply by 2 and put a 0 2 times 1 to 2 times 4 8 44th triangular number same as before to take the general term and substitute 44 now substitute 44 44 into 45 44 + 1 then x 22 so 45 x 22 you get 900 plus 45 945 so 945 is the 44th triangular number find xxx triangular number general term so the triangular numbers are n into n plus 1 divided by 2 so if this is xxx triangular number substitute N equals 30 fifteen times 31 so 31 into 15 10 and 5 multiply by 1 and then multiply by 5 add it together you get 465 is the 30th triangular number find the hundredths triangular number general term is n into n plus 1 divided by 2 in this hundred substitute hundred here you get 50 times hundred one so put 0 and x 5050 is the hundredth triangular number 1 + 2 + 3 up to 15 from this sequence which triangular number do you get we observe the pattern 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 fourth triangular number 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 v triangular number so if this is up to 15 this is 15th triangular number up to 28 adding 1 + 2 + 3 up to 20 so what is the triangular number that's xx from this sequence which triangular number one up to 27 so that's 27th triangular this one up to 19 so this is 19th triangular find the sixteenth triangular number if the fifteenth triangular number is 120 so we know the pattern fourth triangular number 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus 4 then to get the fifth one you have to add 5 to that now 16 1 you need so fifteenth one is 120 so how do you get the 16th one 
,,"from 15th one you need to add which number either 15 or 16 you have to add 16 to that so 120 plus 16 you get 136 this one find the 21st triangular number if the 20th one is given 210 you are asked to find out 21st one so which number you need to add 210 plus 21 so that's one here 3 2 231 find the 10th triangular number the 9th triangular number is 55 it's a similar way ninth one is 55 and you are asked to find out the tenth one so how do you do ad turn to that get 65 find the 80th triangular number if the 79th one is given as 3,240 have you get that adding 80 to that so at eighty three thousand three hundred twenty that's the 80th triangular number now we'll try to find out pattern in between square our numbers and the triangular numbers so what are these 1 3 6 10 15 21 are triangular numbers let's take 1 + 3 is 4 so 4 is the square number that's the second square number and here 3 plus 6 you get 9 that's the third square number what about this one 6 + 10 you get 16 so what's that that's the fourth square number I can write this one is 2 squared second square number third square number 3 squared 16 is 4 square number now try to identify "
,,a pattern what's one that's the first triangular number so if I put a symbol like this is first triangle enough 3 is the second triangular number so when you add these two you are getting second square number I put a square to represent the word square what about this one second triangular number and this is third triangular number you are getting third square number find out a relationship this is third triangular number this is fourth triangular number you are getting fourth square number have you seen the pattern 3 4 3 + 1 4 2 + 1 3 1 + 2 2 2 consecutive triangular numbers when you add you get this square number so last square number if this is 4 this is fourth square number if this is 3 this is third square number and this this is 2 this is second square number so what's the pattern when you take any triangular number twenty first triangular number plus twenty second triangular number what you get we get 20 second square number now we'll use that pattern to identify this 
,,one fifth triangular number and sixth triangular number what you get what's the pattern you get sixth square number so you can write what's this number here six square then what about tenth one and eleventh triangle you are getting xi square number you can write 10 1 plus xi 1 you get xi square Arnim 21st and the 22nd but you get 21st triangular number and 22nd triangular number you get 22nd square number 20 or we can write in numbers 22nd square 33rd triangular number and 34th triangular number you are getting 34th square you can do this is 33 33rd triangular number and 34th triangular number you are getting thirty fourth square no so that's the relationship between triangular numbers and the square numbers now we will look at example number 1 in your textbook write the terms of each of the following number patterns the number pattern of the prime numbers between 1 and 17 written in ascending order so what are prime numbers only divisible by 1 and itself what's the lowest prime number 2 so you can write down to then what's the next prime number 3 5 7 11 13 14 15 16 then 17 but can we write down 17 it says in between in between means between means 1 and 17 not included so you can't write 17 there so ascending order means lowest to highest second one the number pattern of the odd number starting from one written in ascending order just the odd numbers 1 3 5 7 11 13 all numbers so what we do we have to put three dots to represent this is continuing third one the 
,,number pattern starting from 1 and followed by the terms two and one written alternatively so as to when one separately starting from one and followed by the terms so starting from one followed by the terms two and one written alternately 2 1 2 look again 1 2 so that's another number pad so we can put three dots to represent this is continuing exercise 1.1 fill in the blanks in the number pattern 1 3 5 7 9 what's the first term 1 second term is 3/4 - 1 2 3 4 that's seven in the number pattern 4 8 12 16 20 multiples of 4 the first term is 4 second term that's 8 and the third term is 12 question number two write the terms of each of the following number 
,,patterns the number pattern of the even numbers between one and nine written in ascending order so what's the first number even numbers 2 4 6 8 10 10 you can write because this is in between these 1 & 9 so this is in ascending order so that's up to this point next one the number pattern of the multiples of 6 from 6 to 36 written in ascending order so multiples of 6 to 36 means you can write 36 as well 6 times 2 12 6 times 3 18 24 6 times 5 30 6 times 6 36 the number pattern of the even numbers greater than 7 written in ascending order greater than 7 means above 7 so what's the lowest even number 8 starting from 8 you can write 8 10 12 like that so this is continuing with 3 dots the number pattern of the prime number starting from 2 written in ascending order so starting from 2 what are the prime numbers 2 3 5 7 like that this is not ending in finite number pattern so you can put three dots question number three copy the below given statements in your exercise book and mark the correct statements with a correct or incorrect symbol we'll take the first one the terms of a number patent have to be in ascending order tick ten eight six like that that's not in ascending order that's descending order that's also a number pattern so the first one is wrong because no need to be always in ascending order second one the terms of a number patent have to be different from each other no because five five five this is also number pattern so no need to be different to each other so here this is also wrong third one if the tenth term of two number patterns are different then the two number patterns are different to each other so think about you have two number sets number patterns tenth term here you got five hundred something here the tenth term is two hundred so different so different means the two 
,,number patterns are different so it says if the tenth term of two number patterns are different then the two number patterns are different so that's true example number one consider number pattern of the multiples of two starting from two written in ascending order so when you write down the number pattern this is two four six eight like that multiples of to find 11th term so what's the general term we know multiples of two the general term is two ends then using the general term you can answer these questions eleventh term so have you find out the 11th term substitute 11 for you get 2200 third term 2 times 103 you get 206 then the last part find which term is hot so 128 of this number pattern that means we know the general term is to win that's given as 728 so how we find out in divide this by to say 128 divided 
,,by 2 2 times 3 6 6 4 12 and 4 for 8 360 fourth term that's multiple of 2 is 728 example number 2 the general term of the number pattern of the multiples of 3 starting from 3 and written in ascending order is 3 so already given so we can write down 3 6 9 12 like that so nth term is given or the general term is 3 in first part find the 13th term so I will find out the 13th term substitute 13 in 9 so 39 then part to find which term is 87 so 87 is equal to three yen so how do you find out n divided by three so in so I'll rewrite this in other way rock three and means eighty-seven divided by 3 you get in eighty seven divided by three twenty ninth term is 87 in other words twenty nine multiple of three is 87 example number three in the number pattern of the multiples of four starting from four and written in ascending order with general term for so general term is given for then what's the chapter tenth term means and B equals can write substitute and nickel step four times 10 that means what part two what is the 11th term so 11th term just substitute in equals 11 four times 11 you get 44 which term is hundred so this is continuation so this is about multiples of four four which term is 100 so in this one in term is given for n means given 100 divided by four to get and when you divide by 4 you get 25 so 
,,25 fifth multiples of 4 is 100 is 43 a term of this number pattern what are the reasons for your answer okay we'll check whether 43 in this number pattern for N equals 43 you divide by four what happens you get ten yeah one and here nothing and three remaining out of four you're getting a fraction for n what is n means number of terms can you get a fraction for a number of terms you can't get a fraction so that's why so 43 is not in the number pattern so here we can write in either fraction there are 4 43 is not in this exercise 1.2 copy the table given below and complete it number pattern first term and the generator so what's the first term here hi these are multiples of 5 so what's the general term 5 in multiples of 2 that's 2 with multiples of 3 3 multiple of ten that's ten named this is 10 20 multiples of 10 
,,starting from 10 you can write 10 in 8 16 24 32 multiples of 8 starting from a twister this is 8 n these are multiples of 7 starting from 7 7 and what about this one multiples of 12 starting from 12 that's 12 in and 1 2 3 4 multiples of once so starting from 1 this is 1 in oh you can write without one just in question number to 
,,write the number pattern of the multiples of 5 between three and thirty-three written in ascending order so starting from three to 33 in between so what's the first 
,,multiple of five five five times to 10 five times three 15 20 25 30 35 but you can't write 35 this should be in between 3 and 33 so up to this point so this is a finite number partner question number three in the number pattern 11 22 33 of the multiples of 11 starting from 11 and written in descending order what is the general term we already know the general term is 11 and what is the 9th term you substitute in equals nice 11 times 9 that's 99 which term is 121 now we know the general term 11 M equals 120 1 when you divide by 11 you get N equals 11 11th multiple of 11 is 125 fourth one in the number pattern 9 18 27 36 of the multiples of 9 starting from 9 and written in ascending order what is the general term now you already know multiples of 9 the general term is 9 end what is the element job substitute in equals 1199 third part which term is 217 e now we know the general term is 9 in equate to 270 so when you divide by 9 what you get xxx term is 270 question number five in the number pattern with general term hundred in so you have given general term as hundred what is the eleventh term so 11th term means you're substituting in equals eleven hundred times you never you get 1100 part two which term is 500 that means 100 N equals 500 when you divide by hundred you get fifth term is 500 question number six what is the smallest multiple of three larger than 100 which term is it in the number pattern of the multiples of three starting from three okay so larger than 100 101 check whether it's divisible divided by 3 3 times 3 9 4 11 you can't you can't divide by 3 102 3 times 3 9 12 12 is divisible by 3 so what's the lowest number multiple of 3 after 100 that's 102 which term is it in the number pattern of the multiples of 3 starting from 3 so 3 6 9 like that they are asking which term is 102 so that means we know these are multiples of 3 what's the general term 3 n so we can equate 3n equals 102 so what's a divided by 3 you get 34 so 34 multiple of 3 is hundred - question number 7 what's the nth term that's basically general term of the pattern of the even numbers greater than 1 but less than 200 greater than 
,,1 what's the lowest multiple of 2 that's 2 for each like that what's the largest number less than 200 you can't write 200 so one before that 198 this is in ascending order smallest to largest the smallest value of n is 1 we know n V equals 1 you get the first what is its largest value that means you are that means you need to find the value of n 498 so we can write 2 N equals hundred ninety-eight divided by 2 so that means 99th term is 198 question number eight it has been estimated that in a country having a population of 2 million people the population will increase by 2 million every 25 years estimate the population of the country in 200 years so first thing we need to find out how many years are there how many steps are there for 200 years so every 25 years it's increasing so find out how many times it's changing 200 divided by 25 is 8 so that means 8 times it's changing so starting from 2 million so I'll write millions here so starting from 2 after first 25 years this becomes 4 million adding 2 million every 25 years so they're asking if this is 200 years not the population if this is 200 years that means if this is 200 years that means 8 times this is increasing so that means 8 turn 8 term of this sequence so after 50 years this becomes 6 million so this is the sequence we know these are multiples of 2 so what's the general term that's 2 when so you need 8 term what's the eighth term 2 times 8 that's 16 so these are in millions so we can write 16 million 
,,people after 200 years example number four in the pattern of the odd numbers starting from one what is the general term so one three five seven what are those odd numbers we found out even numbers the pattern is 2n odd numbers you can get it from subtracting one from even numbers so what's the general term of odd numbers - in - 
,,we'll do the second part part 2 what is the 72nd term so we know the general term is 2 n minus 1 so 70 second term is n V equals 72 so substitute you get 2 times 72 
,,minus 1/2 times 2 for 2 times 7 14 minus 1 you get 143 so 70 second term is 143 third part which term is 51 this is about odd number so general term is 2 n minus 1 that's equal to 55 add 1 to get rid of this one and then you get 2n equals 52 divided by 2 you get 2 times 2 4 4 12 that's six twenty sixth term is 51 exercise 1.3 in the pattern of the odd numbers starting from one and written in ascending order what is the twelfth term so what are the numbers 1 3 5 those are the odd numbers what's the general term for numbers we know that general term is 2 and minus 1 you can use that general term you are asked to find out 12th term 12 term means you substitute 12 in and you get 23 for that and what's the fifteenth term 15 term you substitute N equals 15 30 minus 1 you get 29 part 3 which term is 89 is all about odd numbers so we can write down n star is 89 add 1 you get 90 equals to n divided by 2 you get 90 divided by 2 45 part 4 which term is the greatest odd number less than 
,,100 what's the odd number greatest or number 99 so 99 is the largest or number less than 100 question number 2 find the value of the sum of the 34th term of the pattern of the even number starting from two and the 34th term of the pattern of the odd number starting from what so there are two patterns here what's the first pattern even numbers so starting from two so two four six like that so you are taking thirty fourth term of the even number and the thirty fourth term of them odd numbers 
,,what are numbers one for what are numbers one three five seven so they asking thirty fourth after odd number as well and first you need to find out thirty fourth term separately I'll take the total because you need the sum okay so we know the general term of the even numbers is to it then which term you need thirty fourth term N equals 34 you get sixty eight in this sequence odd numbers what's the general term one less they're even numbers to win minus one so what's thirty fourth term of that two times 34 minus 1 you get 67 now they asking what's the sum of these two values so 68 plus sixty seven hundred thirty-five exercise 1.4 what is the 10th term of the square number pattern starting from 1 and written in ascending order can you remember the general term of a square number general term of square numbers N squared now they asking temperature so starting from here you have to always look at the starting point so 1/4 like that so when you take the square numbers 1 squared 2 
,,squared 4 3 squared 9 so what's the 10th term 10th term you substitute 10 10 squared means 10 times 10 hundred question number two what is the tenth term of the triangular number pattern starting from one and written in ascending order so what are triangular numbers 1 plus 2 3 3 plus 3 6 6 plus 4 10 10 plus 5 15 and what's the general term of triangular numbers we found that general term for triangular numbers are in n plus 1 over 2 now we need till term 10th triangular number substitute 10 for n 10 times 10 plus 1 divided by 2 or you can write 10 times 11 divided by 2 2 times 5 11 times 5 is 55 question number 3 a certain number greater than 1 less than 50 which is a term of the square number pattern starting from 1 so 1 2 squared is 4 so like wise this is less than 50 and written this is in green and written in 
,,ascending order is also a term of the triangular number pattern starting from 1 and written in ascending order so in triangular numbers 1 1 plus 2 3 3 plus 3 6 like 
,,that 10 15 these are triangular numbers so one term is in both number partners what is this term so they are asking what is this term we know what's the general term of square numbers we know that's N squared what's the general term of triangular number in n plus 1 divided by 2 if one number in both number patterns these two are equal so we can take N squared is equal to in n plus 1 over 2 now what can I do I can multiply both sides by 2 to get cancel out I get 2 N squared is equal to expand brackets you get N squared n into n n squared n into 1 that's plus N when you take this term to this side 2 N squared minus n square what you get these are like terms I can ride to n square minus N squared is equal to n so N squared is equal to n so I can divide this by n you get N equals 1 so only number belongs to both is N 
,,equals 1 so we can write N equals 1 is there term belongs to both of these number factors square number as well as a triangular number question number 3 a certain number greater than 1 and less than 50 which is a term of the square number pattern starting from 1 L written in ascending order is also a term of the triangular number pattern starting from 1 and written in ascending order so we'll take square numbers first starting from 1 for 2 squared 9 16 4 squared 5 squared 25 6 squared 36 7 
,,squared 49 because up to 49 because this is less than 50 if you take triangular numbers when you take triangular numbers starting from 1 1 plus 2 3 3 plus 3 you get 
,,6 6 plus 4 10 10 plus 55 15 15 plus 6 21:21 plus seven twenty eight twenty eight plus eight 36 36 Plus 9 45 and 45 plus ten 55 you can't write 55 because this is less than 50 so these are the square numbers and these are the triangular numbers and they asking one number is there in both sequence greater than one so don't consider one day are other than one there's another number which numbers in both sequence 36 so 36 is the term in both number patterns which square number is it one two three four five six six square number which triangular number is it one two three four five six seven eight eight triangular question number four the sum of the fourteenth and fifteen terms of the triangular number pattern starting from one is a square number show that this statement is true and find which term it is of the square 
,,number pad fourteen and fifteen triangular numbers and this is the sum can you remember the pattern we observed first triangular number and the second triangular number is equal to the second square number if you take eight one and ninth number of the triangular numbers the sum is equal to the ninth square number now they're asking fourteenth triangular number and the fifteenth triangular number is which one fifteen square number so when you take this one this is the square number you get 15 square number so is this statement correct the sum of two triangular numbers these are consecutive two triangular numbers that's equal to a square number so the statement is true can dried statement is true and find the term it is of the square number pattern find which term so which term is that fifteen square question number five write the total number of triangles in each figure in order and see whether you can identify the pattern the pattern of the total number of triangles in the figures in the the given order is identical to the pattern of triangular numbers starting from one L written in ascending order find the total number of triangles in the eighth figure that is drawn according to this pattern so we need to find out how many triangles are there first diagram how many triangles are there just one triangle this one one two and we can take the bigger one that's three this one one two three four five six what about this one first we'll count small numbers small triangles one two three four if you take two at a time one two three so 4 plus 3 7 and then 7 8 9 and the bigger one that's 10 so these are the number of triangles inside these diagrams the pattern of the total number of triangles in the figure in the given order is identical to the pattern of the triangular number starting from 1 and written in ascending order so we found out these are triangular numbers find the total number of triangles in the eighth figure so we'll see what's the total number of triangles so we can find out that term we already know in into n plus 1/2 if you want the a trigger so that means eighth term in equals 8 8 times 8 + 1 9 divided by 2 2 times 1/2 times 4 that means 36 so you can write there are 36 triangles in the eighth trigger question number 6 sigh uni buys a till and start saving money by putting 1 rupee into it on the first day so 1 so 1 rupee first day on the second day she puts 2 rupees so second day she puts 2 rupees means the total is 2 plus 
,,1 333 rupees so increasing 3 plus 3 6 and so how much money is in the till by the end of the tenth day now what's this button these are triangular numbers 1 3 6 next day 4 rupees 6 plus 4 10 so these are triangular numbers you can apply the general term so what's the general term of triangular numbers and mean 2n plus 1 divided 
,,by 2 now they ask what's the value and of 10th day so 10th term turn into 11 divided by 2 divided by 2 you get 55 that means 55 rupees in the 1030 so siren approached 55 rupees in the tank miscellaneous exercise in the pattern of the odd number starting from 1 commencing from the first term if the first two terms then the first 
,,three terms then the first four terms are added and continued accordingly a special type of numbers is obtained what is the special name given to these numbers find 
,,the number that is obtained if 15 of these terms are added in order to in order starting from the first term so read it carefully in the pattern of the odd number starting from 1 1 3 5 like that 7 commencing from the first term if the first two terms first is 1 first 2 terms what's the addition of first 2 terms you get for first 3 terms five five plus three eight eight plus one nice first four terms nine plus seven 16 what you get what are these numbers these are square numbers so what is the special name for this these are square numbers find the number that is obtained if 15 of these terms I added that means you're asking to find out the fifteenth - 
,,so 15th term you can use the general term so general term of the square numbers is equal to N squared the fifteenth term is 15 squared that means 15 times 15 220 question number two milk things brought to a shop to be sold were arranged on a rack in the following manner ten teens on the lowest shelf and every other shelf having 
,,one chin less than the number on the shelf below one ting on the top most shop so one next one adding so two three like that what's the lowest one that's ten things 
,,so this is like a triangle okay be right this way first shelf one second shelf two teens third shelf three teens like that last shelf the bottom shelf that's ten find a number of milk tins that were brought to the shop so that means adding all these numbers so what's the sum you can add 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus 4 plus 5 plus 6 plus 
,,seven plus eight plus nine plus ten can you remember what's the pattern there this is like one to ten addition that means this is like tenth trying unit number finding tenth triangular number so without adding up to ten you can just do this is tenth triangular number what's the generator general term of the triangular number is 
,,n into n plus one Oh - it's a substitute ten ten into eleven divided by 2 you get fifty five tins are there by two all the milk tins on the four topmost shelves were sold within two weeks find the number of milk tins that were sold so first four means 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus 4 that means fourth triangular number will substitute to 
,,the formula in equals 4 4 times 5 divided by 2 you get 10 so this is the number of teens sold within two weeks so what's the so they're asking the number of milk teens that were sold so number number of teens sold is question number three what is the sum of the integers from 1 to 31 - like that they are asking what's the sum of 
,,all digits up to 30 so we know 1 + 2 + 3 up to 30 is the 30th triangular number general term of the triangular number is n into n plus 1 divided by 2 now substitute 
,,30 there what you get divided by 2 you get 15 times 31 multiply 30 1 times 15 multiply 10 and 5 you get 5 times 1 5 5 times 3 15 465 so sum of all digits 1 - 30 is 465 so we covered all theory related to number patterns let's your first unit we'll see what we did so we did an expression in in obtain for the intern how to find out the general term and then we did always in should be a positive whole number starting from 1 you can't get fraction 4 in then the next one general term of multiples of 2 you got to win general term of odd numbers subtract 1 from that that's 2n minus 1 general term of square numbers that's N squared finally we did general term 
,,of triangular numbers that's n into n plus 1 over 2 and also we observed another thing when you add two consecutive triangular numbers you will get a square number if it's first one and second one addition of triangular numbers you get second square number eight one and ninth one triangular numbers you get nine square not so remember all these and practice with all exercises and examples when you practice you can master in number patterns

AlgebraicExpression,wbgUs02rmkM,hello friends today we'll learn about the algebraic identities that we use in class eight and class nine as well right so the first algebraic identity is for x plus 
,,y whole square right so what does that mean which means x plus y is to be multiplied by x plus y so that is what the meaning of square is so if we apply distributive property this x will first multiply the second bracket after that this y will multiply the second bracket so once we expand this we get so x square plus 2xy plus y 
,,squared you may change the order also you may write x square plus y square plus x so this result is always true which means x plus y both square can be written as x 
,,square plus y square plus 2x now we need not do these steps every time we get a question like this so in a question if we have x plus y whole square we will straight away apply this so identities help us save all those steps but as a shortcut we can do something like this right so let's understand with an example so if i have 2 
,,a plus 3 d whole square right so this is 2 a plus 3 b whole square so if i apply the identity this is x square so the first term i have here is x a square plus nine 
,,b square plus so this is the answer we get on expanding this using identity property so that's not required now so we can straight away find the answer like this so 
,,one thing some students feed x plus y whole square its answer should be x square plus y square right so let's see if this is okay or not let me take an example i take x is equal to 7 and i take y is equal to 3 so if this is true then this should be equal to 7 square plus 3 square right x plus y whole square if somebody says this is x squared plus y squared then this should be 7 squared plus 3 square now this is 10 squared is equal to this so 100 is equal to 58 which is obviously false because as for the identity there has to be one more term in this one more term so that is 2 x y so in this particular question 2 x y will be 2 into 7 into 3. so this will be 42 so now in 58 if i add 42 my left hand side becomes equal to the right so the correct identity is x plus y whole squares x square plus y square plus 2 x right so this is the first identity which is very naturally used now on to the second identity you have x minus y both square plus each other minus the remaining steps so if i apply the distributive property so x will first multiply the second bracket then minus y will multiply the second fraction remember this can be written like this x minus y into x minus 5 so if i expand this this x first multiplies the second bracket then minus y it multiplies the second factor so now the answer will be if 
,,i rearrange the terms like this so x minus y whole square right so that is equal to x square plus y square minus 2 x y so what is x square y and here we have minus 2xy so that is the only difference in the two identities so let me take an example so if i have 2 a minus 3 b square now this is of the format x minus y whole square 
,,this is equal to x square so now my answer is 4a squared plus 9b squared minus 18 so basically identifier x squared plus y is difference so now when we learn this so many students say x minus y whole square the answer should be x square minus so this should be equal to 9 square minus 7 square so 4 is equal to 32. is now as per the identity this is x minus y square so the first term is x square plus y square minus 2 a b so that should give you the correct answer this is 81 plus 49 minus 126. so 130 minus 126. and you know that 4 is the correct answer why because 9 minus 7 is 2 2 square right obviously in such an example you will not apply identity to calculate nine minus seven whole square this is only an example given to you just to reiterate the point that a wrong identification if somebody writes it like this this is x square minus y square this is absolutely we connected things x square plus y square minus x y so apart from this we have the third identity which says x plus y into x minus one period x plus right so x plus y and this y will multiply the second direction is this is not x minus y square that is something different this is x square minus y square so this is the identity number three so for example if we have to calculate 105 into 95 so i can write 105 as 100 plus 5 and i can write 95 
,,as 100 minus 5 now this is of the format x plus y into x minus 5 your x is 100 and your y is 5 so as for this identity your answer should be a square or x square minus y squared all right so this is 10 000 minus 25 it does so this is how you practically so square which is identity number one so this is x square plus y square minus plus 2 x y so x plus y whole square is x square plus y square plus 2xy so this is 1 0 0 so this is how you apply various identities to calculation this is identity number three this is an application of identity number one the point to be noted is in identity one and two you have a square of a number here we have to find one 
,,zero one square in identity it is not square these are two different numbers but yes so then you can apply the identity had this question be 99 square so we could have written this like 100 minus 1 square so now this is a second identity x minus 5 square remember whole square comes in identity 1 so this is a square plus b square minus a b right so this is 10 000. plus one minus x square plus y square minus two x y right so this is how we apply these identities in finding right so various squares for multiplication of two numbers now the identity number four identity number four says x plus a into x plus 3 till now in the three identities we have only two variables x and y here we have three variables x a and b right so we're dealing with three variables here if you apply distributive property x will multiply x plus b then a will multiply x plus b so this is identity number four so you have three variables here for example if i have something like x plus 3 into will be x square plus a plus b has to be done which is 3 plus 4 7 multiplied by x plus that now in this particular question sometimes you might get negative numbers here so x minus 3 into x plus so how do we find the solution now you can now again this is of the format x plus a into x plus b so this is x square plus x minus negative 1 supposing you have x minus 3 minus so this is of the format x plus a and this is x plus b so the answer you'll get is x square plus now a plus b into x minus 3 minus 4 so you get x square minus 7 x plus two negative numbers when they are multiplied together you get a positive answer so you get plus 12 as the answer so this is how you need not remember a new formula when one of the numbers is negative or both the numbers are negative you can apply the same formula just visualize like this that a is 
,,now a negative number which is minus three and b is also negative number which is minus four so let's see an application of this identity so let's find the product of one zero four and one but we can't write in that pattern as well so here we will use the identity number four 104 can be written as hundred plus four and under three can be written as hundred plus three now this is of the format x plus a in x plus 3 right where x is 100 is 4 and b is 3 so the answer is x squared plus a plus b 
,,which means you have to do four plus three multiplied by x x is now 100 here plus these two numbers have to be four multiplied three squared so this is ten thousand 
,,plus seven hundred and twelve so that so this is how we apply these four identities and using in finding the product of some numbers or finding the square or something right so this is majorly used in class a we learn thank you so much for watching please do subscribe to our channel please do watch more videos on maths from class 6 to class 12. also we put in some videos related to vedic math thank you so much for watching

AlgebraicExpression,ctqviXu-mTE,hey guys in this video I'm going to talk about factorizing algebraic expressions so what is factorizing well that's to break something into its factors so if you have a number like say 55 for example if you were to factorize 55 you would break it into say think of two factors like 5 times 11 so you've just factorize 55 into 5 times 11 or you could have 1 x 55 and that's a 55 factorize that's actually all of the factors of 55 you can also factorize you can also factorize algebraic term so if you have like 3 X well factors of 3x are 3 and X so 3 times X so that's factorizing are numbers and terms and then if you have an expression well you need to take out the highest common factor so let's have a look at an example so let's say we have 3 lots of X plus 15 and I need to factor out that expression so I need to take out the highest common factor so let's look at 3 exits factorize that oops so 3 x equals 3 times X and then if I factorize 15 well this can be 1 times 15 or it can be 3 times 5 so let's have a look at the factors of 15 that 1 3 5 and 15 so now is there a common factor there yes it's the 3 so that is actually the highest common factor and I need to take that out of this expression and what I mean by take that out well take it out of each term or divide each term by by 3 so what I do with that term at that common factor is I put it out the front of the expression and then inside the brackets I need to put some brackets I put the rest of the the expression in those brackets so if I'm taking the 3 out of the 3x or divide that by 3 left with X I divide 15 by three you're left with five so that's that expression factorized I've taken out the highest common factor this is useful when you're dealing with fractions and longer terms and equations where it might be easier to factorize and then do some canceling or get rid of get rid of some things to simplify an expression so so we need to get the hang of this before we move on to more complicated questions all right let's have a look at some more examples okay so you can have all different types of expressions that you can factorize so you might have lots of unknowns so you might have six a B for example - a squared B and then you need to factorize that so let's have a look the factor so the factors of six a B well that's going to be six times a times B and then a squared B it's going to be eight times a times B so can you see any common factors in there well we've got an a here and 
,,an a here and we've got to be here and a B here so the highest common factor is actually combination of a and B so that's going to be a whoops I mean to put that times so the highest common factor is actually a B and then we need to tat what goes in the back is what's left over in each term so 6 AB if we divide that by a be we're just left with 6 I've got a negative and then if we take a be out of a squared B on left with is a okay so and then you can always double check you can expand it back out to make sure you get the same thing so 6a B 6 times a B is a B and then a B times a is a squared B so you should end up with what you started with so that's 
,,kind of a way to double check that you got the right answer all right ok let's have a look at another example so you can have something that looks like this PQ R so 
,,for example you might not have any numbers at all you just have a lots and lots of letters and you need to decide which letters either come factors say this looks a 
,,bit you know a bit nasty lots of different letters but actually what you really need to do is look for the letters that are common in each term so no keys in here so there can't be I see a Q and a Q so so the Q must be a common factor and then R and know are there so the only common factor there must be Q so put the Q out the front and in brackets it's the letters that are left over so P R and then plus if I taken out Q I'm left with an R T and then negative s W all right so that's the factorization of that expression let's just do a couple more so let's do 25 P squared for example minus 10p so now factors of 25 P now you need to start possibly you can either write down all the factors or perhaps you can do some work out in your head here and think what's common between 25 and 10 so I know that 5 goes into 25 and 
,,5 goes into 10 but we need the highest is there a higher one I'm not sure so I think it might be 5 that is called the highest common factor between 25 and 10 and then and then that's a P squared and a P so actually so P is in both so it's going to be 5 P is the common factor and then if you divide 25 by 5 years with 5 and then taking a pee you've got one P left and then minus 10 P divided by 5 feet well all you're left with is 2 so 10 P cancel the peas and cancel the 5 and you're fit to there okay so hopefully this is all making sense and then just one more example something let's say I don't know you could have higher indices so you might have something like 6 P to the power of 4 minus 12 P so it don't be don't be too afraid of these indices all that's saying is that's for lots of PP times P times P times P okay 
,,so I know that come factor between 6 and 12 or 6 goes into 12 twice so 6 is is coming factor there and then I've got a P and a P so 6p is the highest common factor and then if I take 6p out of six P to the power 4 and but that's just P to the power 4 not 6 to the power 4 as well so I've got P to the power of 3 left and then minus 2 12 divided by 6 is 2 and that P is in the common factor so that's the factorization of that term 6p bracket P to the 3 minus 2 okay so that's our that's a few examples of factorizing algebraic expressions please let me know if there's any details I missed or you need to maybe go over something that didn't make sense I was I 
,,will see you next time bye

AlgebraicExpression,fRs52U_CDdg,okay so we're gonna work on solving algebraic expressions are go so for the very first one they've given us three models here and they want us to create our expression from this the first thing we're gonna do is figure out what this is increasing body okay so we know it starts at how many blocks in the first one three and then the next block has four and then the next block has five okay so we're increasing each time by how much that's right we go up by one so when we go to make an expression okay we have something is equal to we have our variable which you guys usually call n okay and the number in front end is how much we increase by so I'll do it in blue okay so I'm gonna call it the increasing number that's what this value is here this unknown okay and then we usually add what's called a constant term is what 
,,we start with okay that's what most of these are gonna be made up of when we do this the problem is this is figure one what we want to do to make this easy in order 
,,to figure out what we actually start with we want to go to figure zero we want to go back one okay so I'm gonna move this down a bit we want to actually figure out a figure zero according to this pattern I figure zero how many blocks would we have well if it's always going up one that's right we would go down one or it would be 
,,going up one from here so how many blocks would we have to start only have one two and I'm just using this to drag blocks out I'm going to move it away now okay okay so we would actually have two to start so that's actually telling us I figure zero that's what our starting point is so we used to go back one to figure out how much we start with okay so how many do we start with the number two okay and then this arrow saying increasing number this increasing number is much we're going up by well how much does it go up by every time one so this number here is the number one so our expression is actually 1 n plus 2 and that's the expression for this one right here okay so now let's say in this question or they asked us for oh I don't know they want us to find out what was your question here it was W is equal to something right let's say we want to figure out when there's gonna be 50 blocks okay right so one will there be 50 blocks okay so remember this n stands for what figure we're on okay that's what the N stands for technically so this n is what a figure number we are figure one figure two figure three okay and just to prove it let's say 
,,we're at figure two how many blocks are in Figure 2 4 so let's take this expression and plug 4 in for n ok so we're gonna say is equal to 1 times figure 2 alright we replace the n with 2 does that make sense what we just did there for Figure 2 plus 2 well it's 2 times 1 that's what that means to to know because forced a total we're checking to see if there's 4 this is figure 2 though so n stands for what figure than broom we are so I replaced the end with figure tip 2 times 1 is and then 2 
,,plus 2 is is that right are there four blocks in Figure 2 there's four blocks so it tells us from our expression so we want to find out when will there be 50 blocks 
,,so this notice I haven't written anything on this side what we actually do here is we write that number on this side of the expression so our expression was one n plus two and we want to know when there's 50 okay so we want to know when there's 50 blocks all to so here what we have to do is we have to isolate okay so have you heard of bed mess usually when we isolate been masks usually goes from left to right we do brackets exponents division multiplication addition subtraction when we're isolating we usually do what kind of known it's not exactly we usually refer to it as reverse bed mats so normally what would we deal with first we normally in this question we would deal with the multiplication right and that's what we did here we deal we dealt with one times two first well in this case we deal with the addition first and when we're isolating we're moving the addition part to the other side okay when I move it to the other side you know what if it comes with that processes 
,,what do you guys do balancing an equation okay so what we do here is we have to balance an equation so this equals sign think of it like in the middle and whatever I do to the right side I have to do to the left side so the goal is to get n all by itself so I want to eliminate this positive two okay what would make positive two 
,,zero what number subtract two so my next line I need to subtract two so on my right side I'm gonna have one n plus two minus two but whatever I do the right side what I have to do the exact same to the left side so I have 50 minus two so notice I did it to both sides okay and then we simplify what is 50 minus two so this side becomes 48 is equal to 1 and what is two minus two plus zero okay what's one end plus zero one end right there's nothing to it one n is equal to 48 okay I have to get 
,,N by itself this technically says one times n what's the opposite operation of multiplication division so I need to now divide both sides by to number one okay and what will happen is they'll they usually call it can sing hell but it creates a one when I divide both of these by one it just makes the value of one ok so just keep 
,,this set in line so now I just have in here they've kind of cancelled out and what's 48 divided by 148 so what figure number would we be at when we have 50 blocks figure 48 we'll be at 50 blocks okay did that make sense on how to create and isolate

AlgebraicExpression,CT9iX5osAs4,hello grade 8 children today I am here with another new topic we'll see what's the topic about you have done numbers two plus three and a half minus five oh you have done point three plus 95 so all these are with numbers so we call this is number theory then you have done straight lines circles squares parallel lines and angles 
,,all are these geometry what about letters what are these two x plus three Y minus five plus three X letters and numbers combination we call that algebra so today we 
,,are doing about algebra so what's the topic chapter five algebraic expression so we'll find out what are the terms involved in this uni and what are the concepts look at this one the price of a coconut is 48 rupees the distance from Colombo to Gul is hundred kilometers there are 31 days in the month of January Ravinder gets 80 points in mathematics course so what are they is 48 130 180 what are those those are numbers if I ask you a question what's the height of a student in grade 8 class so we can't give a specific value usually the height of the students in the class will be different from one another so therefore we need to define a term called variable so what's variable changing values of height as it is not a fixed number so when you don't get a fixed number when the value is changing we call those are variables we use algebraic terms or expressions to denote changing values so we'll take height as a letter so we use algebraic expression like x today not changing values any letter this one profit varies from one day to another day from Nima's three-wheeler so it's changing all the time it can be named as I'll put a receipt a so what's a it's a variable because it's changing all the time this one radius of three circles are three centimetres four centimetres and five centimetres respectively when we consider radius of the circle we can take this one is R that's a variable we can use a letter so what's the R value we can write R equals three centimeters R equals four centimeters that our equals five centimeters so what's the variable they are our that's the radius of the circle this one city does a bias certain number 
,,"of string hoppers to sell in his boutique every day if we do not know the number exactly can show it as another variable we'll take simple B where B is an unknown set we don't know exactly the amount of string hoppers that city dancer buys look at this one in the figure above shows three containers of the same size all three containers contain an equal amount of liquid it can be considered as what you can use another letter H because it is an unknown constant because we don't know exactly what's the water level is so here what's the variable H height of water so lowercase letters such as a b c or you can put X Y Z so any simple lowercase letters we can use to represent variables so it can be an unknown constant or a variable look at this one the daily income of poachers fruit shop can be stated as X so what is X they are jail income he saved his income by 2,000 rupees a day find the remaining amount of money what's the total income X he's saving to thousand rupees each day so what's the remaining amount you can write in terms of X X is the total value daily income subtract 2000 so the remaining amount is X minus 2000 so this is an algebraic expression so what are the terms terms in this algebraic expression we can write x an mm so those are called terms of algebraic expression so what are the terms "
,,you learn now you learned about variable and we can use simple letters for variables and the next term is terms of an algebraic expression look at this one the price of a coconut is extra base the price of 8 coconut so what you do you have to multiply by 8 so one coconut is x and x 8 so what's the value you get 8x rupees so what are the terms you can say 8x is an algebraic term and the number in front of the letter here X is the variable the number in front of the letter is called coefficient so what's the coefficient in this term 8 8 is the coefficient of the algebraic term we learned about variables terms and coefficient now look at this one combination of algebraic terms 5x plus 3y minus 4z that's called algebraic expression so what are these 5 x 3y minus 4 are the algebraic terms and what about this one the number in front of the letter what you call that coefficients coefficients and terms the width of the rectangle is X its length is 7 its length is 7 meters more than the rich right the algebraic expression for the length so how can we write down length 7 more than that ex-mo more means in maths plus addition X plus 7 is the length so what's the algebraic expression for length X plus 7 if the length of the rectangle is wild now they have given this one is y if this one is y write down the algebraic expression for width we know the width is 7 meters less than the length so we can write by -7 if you take length as Y that's Y minus 7 is the weight the price

,,a and B by 3 and subtract from 10 from 10 means 10 minus this value filling the gaps in the following table algebraic expressions are there as you break terms so you have to write down only algebraic terms so what are the algebraic terms 7 x + 3 by what's the coefficient 7 & 3 what are the I do break terms here 6a + 3 B here you don't write down these constants algebraic terms means only terms with letters what are the coefficients 6 & 3 here Excel why hyphens are 1 and 1 in this one 3 a coefficient is 3 this one - 3 X + 7 5 coefficients are -3 here and so this one you get a fraction but here this is an algebraic term 2x over 3 you can write X in the numerator and 3 by over 5 also an algebraic term then what's the coefficient you have to take the whole thing the fraction 2/3 three fits this one this is an algebraic term 5x over 7 and minus 2y over 3 so what's the coefficient there five over seven is the coefficient of x term and minus two-thirds is the coefficient of weiter look at this question the cost of an arranges extra pays the cost of an apple is y rupees the cost of a mango is zero peas build algebraic expressions for the following price of two oranges and five mangoes oranges is X so 2x plus because this is both together five mangoes one mango easy five mangoes 5z price of two mangoes and seven apples two mangoes is to Z and seven apples Apple is why rupee so 7 y cost of six oranges and eight apples six oranges one orange is X plus six six and eight apples one Apple is why that's eight why price of five oranges seven apples and three mangos five oranges that's 5 X 7 apples 7 y then 3 mangoes 3z question number five cost of one orange one apple and two mangoes one Apple is why and one orange is X and two mangoes - Z - look at this one right down the algebraic expression for the total cost to buy three kilos of sugar two kilos of Thailand five kilos of flour we are one kilo of each product is a rupees be rupees and C rupees respectively so what are the values total cost we need three kilos of sugar so sugar is a so three a five kilos then two kilos of Dar Daly's be rupees to be and five kilos of flour flour is C rupees of five C next one one kilo of red dollies extra peas and one kilo of yellow dollies why rupees write down an algebraic expression for the extra mounts pen for buying five kilos of yellow da then three kilos of red that means the price is high when you buy five kilos of yellow da so what's the difference five 
,,kilos of yellow doll yellow one is by rupees 5 i- three kilos of red on red dollies extra piece per kilo so 3x so the difference is this well the capacity of a bucket days M liters and bucket B is in liters you need to use 12 buckets of a and eight buckets of B at once to fill a tank what is the capacity of the track so what's the total amount of a buckets yeah 12 a buckets so M liters are there so 12 M then what about from B buckets so need eight buckets of B each bucket contained in liters so eight and so the capacity of the tank is 12 m + 8 in the father's age in one of the families years the age of the mother is beers the daughter's age is Sears give the sum of ages of the father and mother in the form of an algebraic expression fathers ages a mother's ages B so the total is a plastic give the sum of the age of the mother and daughter in the form of an algebraic expression mother's age is B daughters ages the total of the ages of the father mother and dot all three of them a plus B plus C write the sum of the total age of the three above after 10 years in the form of an algebraic expression so we have to add 10 for each value 10 and 
,,10 and 10 for all three people that means 30 so the total value is a plus B plus C plus 30 so after 10 years this is the total value manufacturers men extra piece to make a table the manufacturer made a profit of twice as much as the cost price and sold it to a retailer the retailer solely to the consumer with a profit of by rupees right the profit of the manufacturer in the form of an algebraic expression so how can you write down an algebraic expression manufacture a spend X to make a table that's the cost value the manufacturer made a profit of twice as much as the cost price so what's the profit to X so write the profit of the manufacturer in the form of an algebraic expression err so that's 2x give the selling price of the table by the manufacturer in the form of an algebraic expression so the profit is 2x and the cost price is X so what's the selling price X plus 2x when you add it that's 3x so that's the selling price right the selling price of the retailer to the consumer in the form of an algebraic expression now the retailer sold it to the consumer with a profit of Y rupees so this is the price this retailer bought that means 3 X and he keeps by rupee profit so you have to add Y so this is the selling price of the retailer to the consumer the shape shown in the above is a square and a rectangle made out of matchsticks give the perimeter of the square in the form of an algebraic expression one side is given X for sides and there X plus X plus X plus X 
,,what's the perimeter for X give the perimeter of the rectangle in the form of an algebraic expression how you find out the perimeter you have to add all these lengths so a plus 2b plus a plus 2b a and a you are getting 2 a 2b and 2b when you add 2 plus 2 4 that's 4 B give the full length of the matchsticks used to construct the 
,,above images in the form of an algebraic expression so total length so length for the squares for X and length for this one is 2a plus 4b subtract the total length of the matchsticks used to make the square from the total length of the matchsticks used to make the rectangle in an algebraic expression so you have to subtract the 
,,lengths of matchsticks used to make the square from this one so what's the total here two way plus 4b and subtract the lengths for this one that's 4x look at this one give the perimeter of the equilateral triangle in the form of an algebraic expression equilateral means all sides I equal a and a n a what's the perimeter 3a right the perimeter of the write angular triangle in the form of an algebraic expression so just add all the lengths together we'll do that X plus X plus 2 plus X plus 1 
,,now you can simplify like terms you can add X X X 3x 2 & 1 that's right the total perimeter of the above diagrams in the form of an algebraic expression so this is the perimeter of the write angular triangle and is the parameter for the equilateral triangle so add it together 3 E + 3 X + 3 multiplying an algebraic expression by 
,,a number so we'll see how we can multiply the algebraic expression by a number width of the rectangle is X this is the width and the length is 1 determine the perimeter of the rectangle x + y + X + 1 so you can write down 2 times X plus y of x + alright separately x + y X plus y when you simplify you get 2 x + 2 I now I want to 
,,just separate these two parts this part separately and this part separately what's the length of this part when you separate this what's the length of this one x + y you get the same length here X + 1 so double of this x + y so length of one part is X plus y length of 2 parts you multiply by 2 so 2 times X plus 1 but we took the same diagram finding perimeter fully and taking separately you have to get the same answer so in both methods the perimeter of the same figure is equal so we can write down 2 x + y is equal to two x plus 2y now look at this one when there's a number in front you are multiplying both these X terms by two so when X plus y is x to both the terms x + y x - so now we observe when there's a number in front of an algebraic expression you have to multiply all terms with that number a box contains 
,,a red glass balls and B blue glass balls determine the total number of glass balls in such high boxes number of total ass balls in a box was that a plus B number of 
,,total glass balls in five boxes you have to multiply 5 times a plus B then number of red colored balls in a box separately there are a red color glass balls so number of red color balls in a box is a number of red glass balls in five boxes that's five B multiplied by five if you take separately blue ones how many blue ones are there be blue ones for five boxes you get five be blue ones in five boxes so what can you say about this one the total the total is now we can write total is 5 a + 5 
,,B the answer received in either of the two methods should be equal so in this case five times a plus B is equal to 5 a plus 5b now look at this one when you multiply by the constant each term you get this one remove the brackets of the following algebraic expressions now we can use that knowledge you gain from the previous two questions there's a number in front this is a minus B is the algebraic expression so what you do multiply the first term as shown by the first arrow so this is the first arrow multiply this value here 3 times a 3 and then multiply the second term as shown by the second arrow I'll put numbers this is one red one pink one is 1 and 
,,the other color I'll take blue so this one multiply this one that's two three times minus B minus 3b now we'll follow that multiply and give me the answer this one with this you get 5x this one with this five times minus y minus five now try first this one seven times m 7m then this one seven times n plus seven ten times P 10 P 
,,plus 10 times Q 10 Q here the arrows are used to show the order to multiply so here always first one we can take first one and this is the SEC and why remove the brackets using arrows now now you can do that I mean there's a number in front of the algebraic expression you have to multiply all terms in the algebraic expression inside the bracket by the outside number yes with this this with this 3 into X 3 X 3 into 2 y + 6 1 now do this 1 7 into a 7 a 7 into minus 4 B that means minus 28 eleven times tu-22m 11 times n 11 4 times 3 P 4 times 3 12 P 4 times minus 2q so that's minus 8q this one 6 times X 6 X 6 times minus 11 by minus 66 1 8 times 3 24h 8 x k8 now look at this one you get three terms but same thing you have to multiply each and every term by the outside number this one three times five a 15 a three times to be six be three times c plus 3 C now do that four times X for X for x - y - y 4 times 7 that's + 28 8 times 2 16 a 8 times 7 56 be 8 times C that's 8 say look 
,,at this one 2 times X - x - x - 7 y minus 14y 2 times 3 z 6z 4 times P 4 P 4 times minus 3q - 12 Q 4 times 2r 8 11 times M 11 M 11 times 3 n 33 and 11 times 2 11 times 2 22 with l22 multiplying an algebraic expression by a negative number so now there's a negative number in front so we'll practice first with negative minus 3 times a minus 3 minus 3 times B minus 3 B negative into positive always you get a negative answer negative 5 times X negative 5x negative 5 into negative Y now negative into negative positive plus 5 minus 1 into 3 minus 3 minus 1 into minus 2 B plus 2 B minus into plus minus and here 5 times 2 10 2 times 2 4 that's plus because minus into minus plus and you get B here 2 times 7 here - into plus minus 14 C now you know how to multiply so plus into plus plus plus into minus minus minus into plus minus and minus into minus plus now we'll remove the brackets so you need to first multiply the first one when this number minus 3 a minus 3 times B minus 3b minus 
,,5 X and here so minus 5x minus 5 minus y you get plus 5i we did that minus 3 a and here minus 3 a you get here - nothing means 1 so this is like 1 minus 1 into 3 a minus 3 minus 1 into minus 2 B that's plus 2b this one this one minus 2 times 3 a what's the value minus 2 times 3a minus 6a this one - two - 2b plus 4b and here - two times seven you get minus 14c remove the brackets now so use arrows to multiply minus 3x minus - plus 6y this one when you multiply minus - plus 3 times 2 6 minus 
,,3 times minus 7 plus 20 months what this one you have to multiply all three terms minus 5 a minus - plus 5 times 4 20 get be your minus 5 times C minus 5 see this one multiply minus 8 times a minus 8 a - eight - seven be multiplication + 56 8 times 7 56 B question number 5 - 7 into minus X plus 7 X minus 7 into 2 y minus 14y - 7 into minus c plus 7z here minus 11 times 2 X minus 22 X minus 11 times -3 plus 33 yeah do all these multiplications try 4 times X 4 X 4 times minus 7y minus 28 y 4 
,,times 5 20 minus 3 times a minus 3 minus minus plus 21 B minus in 2 plus minus 24 6 here minus 11 times 2 minus 22 X here minus minus plus 11 times 3 plus 33 Y here 
,,you get minus 22 this one multiply minus 6 times 2 minus 12 minus 6 minus 7 plus 42 and minus 6 and minus 5 plus 13 this one minus 10 into minus 3 plus 30 minus 10 times chobe - 20 B and minus 10 times sake - 10 see what about this one - 4 times 3 H minus 12 which minus 4 times minus 4 plus 16 K minus 4 times minus 4 plus 60 now we're do multiplying an algebraic term by another algebraic term earlier we multiply by a constant now multiplying by an algebraic term 3x + 4 y how we multiply 3x 
,,times 4 1 so what we do we multiply that numbers first 3 times 4 12 and then x + y so without writing we can write without writing multiplication sign 12x what this 
,,one multiplication 7b into foil we can multiply separately the number 7 times 4 and then be a 7 times 4 28 be a it is better to write down then letters in order 28 a B but this is not wrong VA is okay but it's better it is good to write the letters in English at alphabetical order this 1 minus 3 by minus 5 X so we can multiply minus 3 and minus 5 first and then Y and X minus 3 times minus 5 plus 15 y X you can write 15 X Y to a times 7 B now we'll multiply at once 2 times 7 14 a into B a B 
,,you can write at once 3 X into 5 y 3 times 5 15 X into y X Y now there's a bracket minus sign minus 7 times 3 minus 21 a times B a B this one Phi times -3 minus 15 M times n m in here minus 4 times minus 3 plus 12 a and B you can write a B for x minus seven minus twenty eight Y into X Y X or what's the better one x1 multiplication of an algebraic expression by an algebraic term find the area of the following two rectangles separately so what's the area of the rectangle this one is length into breadth or length into width so area of the rectangle is any times X so what's that the X what's the area of the other rectangle length is B width or break is X B times X VX sum of areas you can just add it a X plus B X now when you combine the two rectangles now you are getting a big rectangle two rectangles are merged in the above diagram what's the length of this rectangle length is a here B here a plus B what's the area of the rectangle now length is a plus B and the with operate is 
,,X so X into a plus B as same rectangles are merged areas are equal now what's the area we got before a X plus B X so we can write a X plus B X is same as X into a plus B now sick how do you get this one so when you multiply the expression here can you see you get a X plus B X it is required to multiply all the terms inside brackets given by the outside term remove the brackets using arrows first one is this second one is this a 2 X a X a into - why - a why B into X BX be in 2 - 3 y - 3 B by C into a see a or a see C into 7 B 7 BC so here you can write AC as well is C + 7 BC when you remove brackets using an arrow first draw an arrow and write it then draw the next arrow and write it we'll do that separately X into a exhale Oh a X X into minus B minus BX X into 2 C 2 CX of XE y into p YP y into 2q minus 2 Q minus 2 y qi qi y into our are Y now try into p a p a into 3 q 3 a key a into for our for a 2 a into X 2x - 3 y that is -6 a why this 1 3 b into m 3b 3b into 4 12 B 5 a into 2 X 10 X 5 a into minus 3y minus 15 a why here - -5 a into z5 a 0 minus 3 into X minus 3 X minus into - now you get plus 6 a 1 plus 6 a expand brackets without using arrows no will do without arrows 3p into x 3p x 3p into minus 2 y minus 6 P for a into 2 where 8 a 4 into minus 3n minus 12 a in this one minus 4 into X minus 4 a X minus 4 times minus 3/12 a y minus 11 8 into 2 B minus 22 a be minus 11 a into minus 3 C you get plus 33 a see this one 7 a mintue l 7m n 7m into 428 look at this diagram area of the entire rectangle length is X with this a so what's the area a times X shaded area now can you see this square with length a a into a or we can write a square area of the unshaded part so you have to subtract total area that's a X minus the shaded area e squared sum of two algebraic expressions when you are adding you have to consider like terms so like terms only you can add or subtract when you consider these two terms what can you do you can add a terms with a 2a and 
,,3a you can add and then 3b and 5b separately so what do you get 5a + 5 + 3 8 at the time of addition or subtraction you have to add or subtract the like terms remove brackets and simplify taking like terms so first you have to multiply and then simplify here without arrows we'll do 2 times X 2 X 2 times y - 1 and then you have to add this 3x so I'd like terms 2x + 3 X you get 5x + 2 y right as it is here five times a five wave hi x minus B 5 B and plus seven B is there five way you can add 
,,separately yeah - five plus seven what's the value plus two so take the difference and put the sign of the bigger number plus two that's me here multiply by 4 8 X 4 
,,times y 4y now what are the like terms 8 XL minus 5x that's 3x plus 4 here you have to multiply both these terms here 3 times X 3 X 3 times y 3 by here 2 times X 2 X 2 times y 2 now add the like terms 3x + 2 X you get 5 X 3 y + 2 y you get high five do it separately 2 times a 2 a 2 times -3 b -6 b plus 5 times a highway by x - Oh Big Ten now I'd like terms - and five seven that's seven minus six and ten take the difference + OB this one seven times - 14 X 7 times y 7y this one three times X minus three x + -3 y add the like terms 14 -3 11 X 7 - 3 + 4 y this one 3 x - 6 a 3 times 5 15 b + 7 e + 10 B what are the like terms a terms 6 + 7:30 15 minus 10 plus 5 so 5 b minus 5 times 7 -35 a minus 5 times -3 plus 15 plus 40 a now like terms add 40 - 35 5 a + 15 subtraction of two algebraic expressions you have to do the same thing right the first algebraic expression in brackets right the second algebraic expression in another brackets remove both brackets and simplify three-year you nothing means just multiply by one yeah - is there so that means this is minus 1 multiplied by minus 1 minus 1 times a minus a minus 1 times minus 2 B you get plus 2 B now like terms added 3 and minus a 2 a 4 B plus 2 B you get 6 this one subtract this from this so that means you have to write this one first 12x plus 7 1 so here just multiply by one 12x plus 7 1 minus this means open brackets with minus 1 minus 1 times 7 minus 7x minus 1 times minus 2 plus 2 I like terms you get 12 minus 7 5 x 7 + 2 9 5 subtract 2x minus 3 from this so from means first this one so 6x + 7 when there's a minus sign change the sign minus 2x and minus minus becomes plus 3 like term 6 and minus 2 4 X 7 + 3 that's 10 subtract this value from this so first you write here so 3p plus 8q - open brackets with minus 1 - P last - q + + 7 3 
,,p + - b - p8 q + 2 Q thank you and our terms you get only this one so that's 7 simplify so that here multiply and first open brackets and then simplify 4 times a 4 4 times -3 minus 12 minus 2 times a minus 2 a minus 2 x - 7 + 14 now like terms that for a and minus 2 a 2 a minus 12 and plus 14 you get plus 2 open brackets first 5x - 5 minus 3 times X minus 3 X minus 3 and minus 2 you get 6 y 5x + 3 X 2 X - 5 I + + 6 Y you get Y this one has a minus 2 in front so when you are multiplying be careful - 2 times 3 - 6 Z minus 2 and minus plus plus times foil the Savoy here you get minus 8b add like terms minus 6a + 4 you get minus 2 a 4 B and minus a 2 B minus 4 B this one Phi P into 2 Q 10 PQ or QP 5 P into 4 20 P here - 3 P into Q minus 3 P Q minus 3 P into 2 minus 6 peace now these are two like terms 10 P Q minus 3 P Q you get 7 PQ 20 P minus 6 P you get plus 14 substituting the values in the edge break expression so now we will see how we can find out the expression with substituting values so what's the first one determine the value of 5 a plus 4 when a equals 3 so substitute a equals 3 there so what happens five times three plus four so 
,,what's five times three 15 15 plus four you get 19 look at this expression seven A plus 2 B now you get two letters so substitute these two values equals three and B equals three so 7 M plus 2 B is the expression so we'll substitute 7 times is 3 7 times 3 plus 2 times B equals 3 so 7 times 3 21 2 times 3 6 21 plus 6 27 look at this one now you get three unknown letters 5 a 2 B 7 C values are given a equals 5 B equals 3 and C equals -2 substitute 5 into a is 5 2 times 3 and say x minus 2 so 
,,minus 7 x minus 2 5 times 5 25 minus 2 times 3 minus 6 and here minus minus becomes positive seven times 2 plus 14 now simplify 25 minus 6 you get 19 19 plus 14 33 determine the value of the following expressions when x equals 2 and y equals minus 3 we substitute 8 times X is 2 y equals minus 3/8 times 2 16 5 times minus 3 minus 15 16 minus 15 you get 1 here 12 times 2 minus 3 times minus 3 12 times 2 24 minus into minus plus 2 so 3 times 3 9 9 plus 4 13 so you get 33 now look at this one so same values you have to plug what are the values x equals 2 and y equals -3 9 mean 2 2 plus XY means X into y so 2 into minus 3 y equals minus 3 9 times 2 18 minus 6 you get 12 2 times X X is 2 5 times minus 3 plus 11 2 times 2 4 minus 15 plus 11 so 4 minus 15 you get minus 11 minus 11 and plus 11 you get 0 this one 4 times X 
,,X is 2 2 times minus 3 plus 8 4 times 2 8 minus 6 plus 8 8 minus 6 2 2 plus 8 10 here X is 2 y is minus 3 plus 2 minus 7 times minus 3 2 times minus 3 minus 6 here plus 2 is they are already according to Bodnar's you have to multiply first minus into minus plus 21 minus 6 plus 2 minus 4 minus 4 plus 21 you get 17 determine the value of the following algebraic expressions when a equals 3 and B equals 5 so what you do first first we'll open brackets and then substitute 3 times 2 6 6 8 3 times 3 you get 9 so 9 B now substitute after you multiply now substitute the value 6 times 3 9 times 5 because B equals 5 and a equals 3 6 times 3 18 9 times 5 45 what's the addition 63 in this one you have given the same question we'll try in a different way earlier we multiplied and then simplify now we'll do we'll simplify inside brackets and then multiply by three so three is there two times a is 3 B equals 5 now simplify inside 3 times 2 6 3 times 5 15 3 times 6 plus 15 21 now multiply 3 and 21 3 times 1 3 3 times 2 6 so you are getting the same answer get the same as if simplify inside brackets or without removing bracket so you can do any method first you can multiply and simplify and then substitute or simplify inside the brackets and then multiply by the outside number remove the brackets and substitute the values so first remove the brackets 7 a plus 14 B substitute the values 7 times 3 plus 14 times 5 say 1 times 3 21 here 5 times 425 times 1 5 and 7 add it you get 91 
,,this one 4 times 3 12 a and 8 B substitute the values of 12 times 3 minus 8 times fun now simplify 12 times 3 36 8 times 5 40 36 minus 40 you get minus here 11 times 2 22 a plus 11b so 22 times a 3 because 566 plus 55 hundred twenty-one this one 9 times 3 27 a 9 x -2 18 B now multiply 27 times 3 and 18 times fun 3 times 7 21 two remaining 3 times 2 6 plus 2 81 minus 5 times 8 44 remaining so you get 90 81 minus 90 you get minus 9 determine the value when a equals 3 B equals -2 and C equals 
,,1 so just substitute the values 2 times 3 7 x minus 2 make sure you put brackets when you get negative numbers 3 times 1/6 minus minus plus 14 plus 3 so 6 plus 3 9 9 plus 14 23 this one 5 times 3/2 x minus 2 and 4 into 1 15 minus 4 plus 4 minus 4 plus 4 get canceled out you get 15 11 x equals 3 B equals -2 and C equals 1 according to what must do the multiplication first 11 times 3 33 minus 2 times minus 2 plus 4 and you get minus 3/4 minus 3/1 33 plus 130 in this one first simplify and then substitute values of the following algebraic expressions when a equals 5 because 3 and C equals -2 so you have given this expression so what you do first open brackets 2 where 2 B 3 B 3 C then what you do simplify the terms add the like terms to a you have to write as it is 2b and 3b becomes Phi B and 3c here now substitute the values equals 5 B equals 3 and C equals -2 2 times 5 10 5 times 3 15 minus 60 so but you get 10 minus 6 4 4 plus 15 19 this one first open brackets 3 a 3 times minus B minus 3 B 4 times B 4 B 4 times C minus 4 C here because there's a negative sign now I'd like terms 3-year you can't simplify minus 3 and plus 4 that's plus 1 B or B minus 4 C now substitute the values 3 a means multiplication 3 times a 3 times 5 B is 3 4 times minus 2 first multiplication according to but must 5 times 3 15 minus 4 minus 2 plus 8 so you get 8 plus 3 11 11 and 15 you get 26 this one first open brackets 3a plus 3b here to be and -2 C 5 C 5 a so each one you have to multiply by the outside number now like terms 3a and 5a 8 a 3 B and plus 2 B 5 B -2 C + + 5 C plus 3 C now multiply 8 times a what's the value for a a 5 3 minus 2 I'll write down here equals 5 B equals minus 3 B is 3 and C equals -2 C equals -2 so a is 5 B 3 C minus 2 8 times 5 14 15 here and -6 15 minus 6 you get 9 9 plus 40 49 this one 7 a 7 B minus 7 C and then plus 2a minus 2b minus 2 C when you multiply by 2 add like terms 7 + + 2 9 e 7 B and minus 2b + 5 b minus 7 and minus 2 minus 9 see now my tip life is five B's tricky and C is minus 2/9 times 5 45 five times three 15 and minus minus becomes plus nine times two eighteen now add all together 1018 one remaining five six seven so 78 is the answer this one you get fractions but same procedure just substitute the values for a eight over be sixteen over C so now substitute equals 2 so 4 over 2 8 / BBS for 16 over C C is 8 now you have to simplify first 4 divide by 2 you get 2 8 divided by 4 you get 2 16 divided by 8 you get 2 2 + 2 + 2 6 this one substitute the values a equals 2 2 divided by 2 B is 4 4 divided by 4 C equals 8 8 divided by 8 simplify division first 2 divided by 2 is 1 4 divided by 4 is 1 8 divided by 8 is 1 1 plus 1 plus 1 you get 3 this one substitute a B means a times B 2 times 4 plus BC means B times that's 4 times C means 8 minus C times a C is 8 and a equals to 8 32 16 so 32 minus 16 is 16 16 and 8 addition you get 24 now we will look at remove exercise complete the table given below algebraic expression is given unknown term of the algebraic expression coefficient of the unknown term terms of the algebraic expression and final column is mathematical operations in the order they appear in the algebraic expression so first of all what's the unknown letter X coefficient is the number in front of the letter that's three and these are called algebraic terms and what is the operation plus and multiplication is three times X now we look at the next one what's the letter here Y what's the coefficient of that term to what are the algebraic terms to Y and 4 and what's the operation first multiplication and then addition next one what's the algebraic letter B coefficient 4 and terms for P and minus hundred and the operation for times P that means multiply and then subtract this one P is the letter coefficient nothing means one terms PN minus 10 and what are the operations used 1 times P times and then - what's the later here in coefficient is + 3 terms 3 n n minus 7 and operation first multiply and then subtract question number two the length of a table is two meters more than its breadth write an algebraic expression for the length of the table by taking its breath as V when you take this table B is the bread length is 2 meters more than its brick so what's the expression B plus 2 back to write

,,the amount for all these items from 500 so that's the balance that now being received exercise 5.1 there are three members in a family the ages of the mother the father and the son are given in X Y Z respectively using this information construct algebraic expressions for the sum of their ages mother x your ages of the mother x father Y and son Z so that's the total bar to the sum of the ages after five years so we have to add five for each one 5 Plus 5 Plus 5 15 so X plus y plus Z that's 50 part 3 the difference between the ages of the father and the son father is y and son is Z the Y minus C and the sum of the ages of the mother and the father when the son was born so when the Sun was born means now Z years before C years before means we have to subtract C from X as well as Y so X mother's age now see as before you have to subtract see what's father's age then Y and subtract C and when you simplify that you get X plus y minus C minus C means 1 and 1 minus 2z question number 
,,2 the price of a newspaper was P rupees if the price increased by Phi rupees construct algebraic expressions for the new price of the newspaper earlier be now increased by five P plus five second part the price of two newspapers after the increase in price so what's the value after increase P plus five and for two newspapers you have to multiply by two so we'll simplify this 2 times P this is same as 2 P plus five you can expand and simplify 2 P plus J part 3 the profit gain from a newspaper with the new price so what's the selling price the new price is this 2 P plus 10 and what's the cost cost price is Q rupees so you have to subtract Q them part for the profit gate from 10 copies if our rupees is spent for the distribution of each copy in addition to the printing cost now you have to find out the profit gain from 10 copies now we'll find out for one copy this is the profit and this one is the profit you have to subtract Q from the new price that's the profit for one newspaper now we have to consider 10 newspapers 10 newspapers is this much and then you have to subtract R is this spent for the distribution of each copy so to distribute 10 copies that's 10 are V liters of what is stored in a tank peel it is a water flows out and Q liters of water flows into the tank for our so we'll just mark it so this is the tank think about this is the tank V is there P liters of water flows out P liters flows out and quli it as a water flows into so inside that's cuba per 
,,our construct an algebraic expression for the volume of water in the tank after three hours so this is for one number what's the amount of water amount of water is equal to so here V is already there and you are adding Q amount of water per hour and removing P amount of water from the tank so this is the amount of water in one other so what's the amount of water in three hours so here V is a fixed value Sophie is already there so in three hours you are adding 3q and removing three feet this is for one Nava and this is for three hours so the answer is V Plus 3 Q minus 3p liters question number 4 there are 700 seats in an auditorium X number of first-class tickets which are thousand so we'll write down all together 700 X number of first-class tickets each thousand rupees why number of second class tickets which are 
,,500 each and Z number of third class tickets which are 300 inch were used issued for a drama construct algebraic expressions for the total number of tickets issued first was the total number of tickets X tickets here Y here and Z number of tickets that's X plus y plus C the number of seats which are not occupied all together 700 seats are there when you subtract X plus y plus C you get the seats that are not occupied third one the income from the show tickets X tickets first class so you get thousand X from that Y tickets second class with 500 rupees 500 y and C number of tickets third class 300 Z that's the income and fourth part the remaining amount 
,,"when half the income generated from the issue tickets and 100,000 is paid to the producer of the drama okay so here this is the income from their tickets the remaining amount when half the income generated half the income generated is you have to divide this by two so half the income is what half of that so thousand divided by I'll write down first thousand X plus 500 y plus 300 Z divided by 2 half of it so what's that 500 X 500 divided by 2 255 and 150 Z that's the half of the income half "
,,"of the income generated from the issued tickets and 100,000 is paid to the producer of the drum so the half the amount is this much 100,000 rupees also he needs to pay to the producer so what's the remaining amount you can't write remaining amount please so when it comes to half given means half remaining so this much of money is there and you have to subtract 100 100,000 rupees from that example number one simplify so there's a constant term in front so you have to multiply so without arrows we'll try 2 times a 2 a 2 times B 2 B 3 times 3 X 9 X 3 times y 3 y 3 times 4 12 X 3 times 7 minus 7 minus 21 8 times 8 64 y 8 times 7 56 X + 8 x q8q exercise five-point to fill in the blanks so expand brackets multiplied with the in front of number inside all the terms 2 times X 2 X 2 times 7 14 5 times 6 31 5 times a by this 8 times 4 32 given 8 x - y - 8 y this one 6 times X 6 6 and the other one is - 6 y 3 times X 3 X this is done and 3 times Z 3 Z + 3 x - 5 - 50 question number 2 simplify 5 times a 5 a pi times 4 27 times X 7 X 7 times 5 35 6 x - 12 X 6 times 4 2004 times 4 16 say 4 times 7 28 pi times y 5 by minus 5 times 2 check 3 times 3 9 minus 3x 2 times M 2 m 2 times n - n - x - 4 p 4 times X 4 times y 28 2 times X 2 X 2 x - 4 y -2 cuba question number 3 the daily wages of a person is extra piece and overtime payment for an hour is y rupees if he did 2 hours of overtime on each of the 5 days he worked write an algebraic expression for his salary for the 5 days with overtime payments okay read it carefully and try to get it the daily wages of a person is X over time payment for an hour is y if he did 2 hours of overtime work on each of the five days he worked every day two of us extra write an algebraic expression for his salary for the 5 days with overtime payment so what's the five day salary normal salary is X daily that means 5 days 5 X plus overtime payment every day Y rupees for one hour 2 hours daily so 2y 5 days 2 y times 5 that's 10 Y bar "
,,to do to the loan he has taken 150 is deducted from his daily wages construct an algebraic expression for the emoti receives in hand for the five days and simplified so what's the amount a floor for five days everyday 150 rupees so five days 150 times fun what's that pi times 0 25 750 rupees so when you deduct that amount what's the amount received in head ammount in hand this is the total income 5x plus 10y and he needs to pay a 750 for the Lord so this is the amounting hat a teacher bought three gift passes for three students who came first in the third term test each parcel contained five books two pens write an algebraic expression for the price of one such parcel by taking the price of a book is a rupees and the price of the pen is B rupees so what's the price of one parcel one book is a rupees so five books 
,,are there five e one pen is B rupees two pens are there are two part to write the total price of all three gift parcels as an algebraic expression and simplify it so for three parcels you have to multiply this by three now simplify x 3 3 times 5 15 and 3 times 2 6 so this is the amount for three parcels question number five on a packet of tea the mass of the tea is mentioned as P grams and the mass of the packet as cue grams obtain an algebraic expression for the mass of 20 such packets and simplified so what's the total mass for one packet total mass is P grams for T and Q for the packet that's the total mass for one packet so 20 packets are there so 
,,for 20 packets you have to multiply this by 20 so when you simplify you get 20 P plus 20 Q part to the above 20 packets are packed in a box which is of mass tigran's so 20 such packets so this one full set in a box obtain an algebraic expression for 12 such boxes and simplified okay if if you take one box what's the mass of one 
,,box this value and there's extra t grams for the box that's for one box there are twelve such boxes so for twelve boxes you have to multiply this by twelve x - 2 x - 4 - x so 240p x 2 same thing 240 q + 12 example number two simplify now you get negative numbers in front so negative 2 times a negative 2 a negative two x plus 6 negative 12 here minus 5 times 6 minus 30 minus into minus plus you get 5x this one nothing they are means this is just like 1 minus x 2 where minus 2m minus into minus plus 3 this one minus 4 times 2 minus 8x minus 4 times 3 minus 12 1 minus 4 times minus 2 plus 8 see exercise 5.3 simplify minus 3 times X minus 3 X minus 15 minus 4 X minus two x plus 1 minus 2 minus 8 minus 2 X minus 6 EI minus into minus plus 36 yes this is like 1 minus X minus 5 this is also like 1 here minus 1 into X minus X minus into minus plus so plus this 1 minus 2 times 8 minus 16 minus 2 times X minus 2 X minus 2 y 6 times 3 18 but this is minus minus 6 times minus 2 plus 12 and then minus 18 again here 1 is there - into a - C - into - c-plus see here you get 3 X minus 3 times 6 minus 18 minus into minus plus 3 times 2 6 minus 3 x + 3 B you get minus 9b first one done - 3 X and here - 3 times 4 minus 12 minus 3x is there minus into minus plus 12 here - 2 y is there - 2 times 2 minus 4 and this one -

,,by a number each term of the algebraic expression needs to be multiplied by the number that is the coefficient of each algebraic term should be multiplied by the given number and simplify so make sure that you multiply by the coefficient when multiplying an algebraic term by an algebraic term there our coefficients are much like first and then the unknowns are multiplied when multiplying an algebraic expression by an algebraic term every algebraic term of the algebraic expression needs to be multiplied by the given algebraic term by substituting values for the unknown terms of an algebraic expression we obtain a numerical value for the algebraic expression so when you are simplifying either you can simplify brackets first and then multiply or expand brackets and then substitute the values so practice all these questions examples and exercise and thorough with algebraic expressions
,,
AlgebraicExpression,c0NgtjfTJBo,so the topic is about algebraic expressions so we will see how different types of algebraic expressions are expressed and then how we can add them and subtract them 
,,so before that we need to see some basic properties on algebraic expressions so there are totally many different types of algebraic expressions to start with the first algebraic expression is a monomial a monomial is an algebraic expression which has only one term so for example and you break expression with only one table for example if I just take 3 X 5 X square and minus 7 X or I take 11 so all these are monomials because they are just written with only one term so same way if I just say binomial it is an algebraic expression with two terms is called a binomial so let's start with monomial and the next is binomial and then comes trinomial and so on 
,,and so forth so binomial is an algebraic expression with to terms so this is the definition for a binomial expression so for example if I just take 2x minus 3 I identify here that there are two terms one is 2x and 1 is negative 3 so the combination of two terms written in an expression form is called a binomial expression so an 
,,an expression written with only one term is called a monomial expression so I would like to take one more example where 5x squared minus 7 also is a binomial if I have two unknown variables say 2x plus 3x square is also a binomial where the first term is 2x and the second term is 3x square let me take one interesting example where x squared plus 3x minus 4x square now here I identify that this is not in the binomial form but I can make it converted into binomial expression because these two terms can be further simplified to reduce to one particular term so that you get two terms reduced after simplification so this indirectly is a binomial expression 
,,in the way that when I just take X square minus four X square is minus 3x square and plus 3x written out here so the simplification of X square and negative 4x square gives me minus 3x squared plus 3x fixed and return as the second term which makes me understand that this is the first term and the second term because it has two 
,,terms in the expression this is an example of a binomial expression whereas if you take the unsimplified form it doesn't form a binomial expression so this these are the various examples for binomial no once monomial and binomial has been discussed the third thing what is there in the in the definition is trinomial and you all can guess what a trinomial is based on the definitions which we have taken they're an algebraic expression with one term is monomial with two terms is binomial so with three terms will be a trinomial so the definition is quite easy algebraic expression with three terms and even there are so many examples which we can take out here if I take an example where five minus three X plus seven X square is a triangle because it has three terms as it can be clearly seen the first term is five second 
,,term is negative three X and the third term is seven X power 2 so these three terms makes this algebraic expression to be called as a trinomial or a trinomial expression so this there are many many examples which we can take in mathematics related to trinomial yes so these are the three basic examples which are taken one is the 
,,monomial binomial and trinomial so there are many expressions where you can have more than three you can have four five six so generally any expression which has more than three terms is called a multinomial so we need to we need not we cannot take the number of terms defined for any number of expressions where the terms are increased to a larger extent it is what meaningful to take one term is monomial two terms as binomial three terms as trinomial but when you have n number of terms it is called a multinomial so an algebraic expression with n terms with n greater than three is called a multinomial where for n equal to 1 to 3 is already defined for monomial binomial and trinomial so let's see an example for example I take an algebraic expression 3 minus 4x plus 5 X square plus 7 X cubed minus 9 X power 4 minus 9 
,,X power 4 plus 2x power 5 now this algebraic expression let's see how many terms are there and we'll count by the process 1 2 3 4 5 6 so this is an algebraic expression with 6 terms which is called a multinomial with 6 terms so this is an example of a multinomial consisting of 6 terms yes now based on all the various types of algebraic expressions which we have seen starting with monomial binomial trinomial and multinomial we will now see how we are going to add or subtract the different algebraic expressions using the like terms and unlike terms so first initially we will see what exactly is a like term and what exactly is the or they are like terms so when we discuss about like terms the terms with where the degree is same are called the like terms so if the degree is same then the terms are like terms so when I say degree the highest power of the unknown variable say for example I take 3 X minus 5 X square 4 X 7 X cube so in this case I find that the degree of this term is 1 because the power of X is 1 here now when I take here the degree of the second term is 2 because the power of the unknown variable that is X s 2 if I take here the degree of this term is 1 because X has its power as 1 when I take this term its degrees 3 because of X cube now in this case I identify that the first term and the third term are having the same degree so these two are said to be the like terms so the first term and the third term have same degree 1 therefore according to the 
,,definition of like terms 3x and 4x are called like terms so whenever we have any problem where we need to identify the like terms we just search for the degree and if the degree is same they're like terms and if the degree is not same they are not the like terms so when we define the like terms similar fashion we can define the 
,,unlike terms if the degree is not saying that the terms are unlike terms so here when I take 3 X and minus 5 x squared these two are having two different degrees therefore these two are unlike terms these two are like terms 3x + 7 X cube are unlike terms because the degree of this is one and degree of this is 3 so let's take it 
,,as a different example definition and then see many examples of unlike terms so let's see the definition of unlike terms the way we are sinful like those so unlike terms of the terms whose degrees are not same so let's take the definition the terms whose degree are not same they are different are called unlike terms say for example 5x + 7 X cube I find that the degree of 5x is 1 and the degree of 7 X cube is 3 so these two are with different degrees so these two are called the unlike terms 
,,so therefore they are unlike terms the reason being with two different degrees so after we understood the concept of like terms and unlike terms the concept of like 
,,terms is very much useful when we add or subtract the two algebraic expressions or more than two algebraic expressions because when we add two algebraic expressions 
,,we write all the like terms in column wise and let's see how we are going to do that so the topic here is adding off and you brake expressions so before we proceed with how they're going to add we're going to take certain rules into consideration step one we write all like terms together write all like terms of each algebraic expression one below the other so we're at all like terms one below the other how many our algebraic expressions we have that is the first step we're going to follow step two after we write all the like terms one by one one below the other we add the coefficients of each term individually and then write the power of X besides add 
,,the respective coefficients of like terms and like the exponent whichever is the degree respectively so after that we obtain the sum of two or more than two algebraic expressions so these are the two important steps we need to follow before we proceed with adding so let's see how we can do that with an example in a stepwise process for example I wanted to add say my algebraic expression a initially is 2x minus 5 plus 7 X square and my algebraic expressions say another algebraic iteration of me is 4 plus 3x minus 2x square now in this case I see that the like terms are not put one below the other so we are going to rearrange and then add using the step 
,,one no so in this case I first take a initially I have this let me write them in higher order form so first I write the highest degree which is 7 X square then I get the next degree which is 2x then I write the next which is a constant so let's maintain a chronological order where we start with the highest degree to the lowest degree 2 1 0 the degree of this term is 2 the degree of this term is 1 and the degree of this term is 0 similarly I take the expression B where the highest degree of 
,,the term is negative 2x square and the next highest degree is 3x and the next highest is 4 so this is how I write them likewise term so all the like terms are written one below the other and then only I can add so once I add the two expressions the left-hand side becomes a plus B and when I add the terms here I use the step to rule which says that add the respective coefficients of like terms and write the respective X 4 and besides so the respective coefficients in the first like terms are 7 and minus 2 so I simply add 7 and minus 2 and then I pull the coefficient the respective coefficient whatever is besides that then I add the respective coefficients for this and then write the X then I add the respective coefficients of the last terms and then we get this then finally what I do is I recently fie this by adding further where 7 plus minus 2 is 7 minus 2 which is 5 X square and then plus I get 2 plus 3 which is 5 X so 5 X and this will be negative 5 plus 4 which is negative 1 so overall this is what I get for the sum of two algebraic expressions so the expression a and expression B when I add them I get 5x squared plus 5x minus 1 using two important steps which we have discussed to you now this can be applied for any problem so any problem we take into consideration we should be able to add the two expressions based on two simple process roots next let's see one more example which is quite different and let's see how we can do that in the same step 1 step 2 process so let's take another example where I take the expression P as 4 X cubed minus 7 X plus 5 X square plus 3 is one of the expression which I have taken and let 
,,me take another expression say Q is 2 X minus 5 X cube less nine now these are the two different expressions but one thing what I identify between the two expressions is this does not form at chronological order where I have a degree here as 3 then degree 2 then degree 1 and degree 0 but I have degree 3 degree 2 is missing but degree 1 is there and the degree 0 term is there so even these type of terms can be added with the same rules what we have taken in step 1 and step 2 so let's see how we are going to do that without getting confused so when I take the expression P I write in the chronological order as I told you the first in the example in the previous example always maintain a chronological order of writing the term so first I take the highest degree term which is 4x cubed then the next highest degree term 
,,is 5 X square then the next highest degree is negative 7x and the next is degree 0 which is 3 and I maintain the same chronological order for the next algebraic expression writing all like terms together column wise so for the second expression Q the highest degree term is minus 5x Q then the next highest degree is degree to which I don't find that term is missing out here so I just put it blank I don't write anything below X square then I take the next highest degree which is degree 1 where I write this as plus 2x plus 9 so the the value below below Phi X square is kept vacant because I maintain the like term column wise rule so in this case without disturbing the stone we just add them in this manner so when I add I get P plus Q is 4 minus 5 of X cube plus no because I don't have any term this is the term which 
,,comes directly falling in here so this will be directly 5 X square any term without any term being here then comes minus 7 plus 2 times of X plus 3 plus 9 so adding 
,,the like coefficients together using the step to process now this would be nothing but 4 plus -5 is negative 1 of X cube Phi X square is as it is directly without any further simplification this is negative 5 X plus 2 n which is the final answer for the sum of two given expressions so this is how we do for any problem where we have some degrees missing so we just keep them vacant so whenever you find any degree missing out here we just keep that vacant that whole of the column is kept back 
,,int and jump to the next degree and then right in this process now let's go to the next example now the two examples what we have seen have been with only two algebraic expressions which we have added in both of the cases now what happens when we have more than two algebraic expressions can we add three algebraic expressions together can we add four algebraic expressions together yes so let's see one problem where you have more than two algebraic expressions and you need to add them say for example I have a as 2x minus 3 plus 4 X square and B is X minus 2 plus 5 X cube and I see is 1 plus X cube now I wanted to add these three algebraic expressions using the step one and step two brass process together so the three algebraic expressions are equally added in the same manner as we have added to algebraic expressions the rules do not change they are the same yes so the first rule says we are going to maintain the chronological order so I take the highest degree which is X cube out of all the three expressions so nothing is I don't have any term containing the OP degree three so I just keep it vacant then I write the next highest degree which is four X square after the vacant place and the next highest degree is 2x and the next highest is negative three same way for the next algebraic expression be the 
,,highest degree term is 5 X cube which are right in the first of course this is vacant here because there is no the X cubed term an algebraic expression a next the next degree is for the the degree of two is missing so I can I keep this vacant then I go to the next which is X and then minus two so this is how I maintain the chronological order the x squared term missing so this is kept vacant then I have my algebraic expression for C which is 1 plus X cube so I write the like term X cube below this and this one here I don't have any term of X square or X so I just keep it wicked now I have to add them so what I do is I just add the left-hand side which 
,,is a plus B plus C then I add the right-hand side which has these two terms with coefficients added respectively then because I don't have any terms below this this 
,,is the term which directly falls into which is 4 X square and then I add the X terms which can be added as 2 plus 1 times of X then I have all the constants in each 
,,of the expression so I have all the three terms in the form minus 3 minus 2 plus 1 then finally the simplification of each of the coefficients further gives me the sum of all three algebraic expressions so this is 6 X cube plus four x squared plus 3x minus five plus one is minus four so therefore the sum of all the three algebraic expressions given as ABC would be 6x cubed plus 4x squared plus 3x minus 4 so this is how we add so we will see subtraction of algebraic expressions the way we have seen adding of two algebraic expressions it is quite same the only difference being that when we add we put place when we subtract we put minus so let's take one 
,,example directly and see how the two algebraic expressions can be subtracted one from the other so in case of subtraction let me take the algebraic expression a as 2x minus 1 plus X square and the algebraic expression be as 2x squared plus 4x plus 3 now I wanted to find a minus B so whenever I subtract B from a I write the algebraic expression a first and then the algebraic expression B but unlike in addition of two algebraic expressions the freedom is there in writing any algebraic expression initially but but when it comes to subtraction alright the first times you like expression a initially and then below that the algebraic expression B the two steps are the same what we have seen for the previous two eggs are the previous examples we write all the like terms together and then subtract instead of adding because here the binary operation is subtraction so let's take the algebraic expression in chronological order where the highest degree is x squared then the next degree is 2x and the next is 1 but below this okay I'm writing this so I take a as this and below this I write the algebraic expression B in chronological order as 2 X square plus 4 X plus 3 with all like terms together in column-wise now the only additional rule I include a subtraction of two algebraic expressions is when I subtract all the signs of the second expression change plus becomes minus and minus becomes plus so when I have plus B it becomes minus plus 2x square becomes minus 2x square for X becomes minus 4x and plus 3 becomes - so all plus signs become minus or any other minus sign you find here becomes plus so using that V and only subtract so subtraction of the two expressions is subtraction of each of the terms of the expressions the like terms subtraction of each of the like terms of the given expressions 
,,so when I have these two expressions it is nothing but subtraction of the coefficients of each of the expressions then I have 2 plus minus 4 of X then I have negative 1 of negative 3 so this is how I get subtracting each of the expressions then this will be 1 minus 2 is minus 1 X square and 2 minus 4 is minus 2 of X minus 1 minus 3 is minus 4 so my algebraic expression a minus B is finally obtained as negative X square negative 2x negative 4 so this is how I get the difference of two algebraic expressions or subtraction of two algebraic expressions yes next if suppose I have a combination of addition and subtraction together if suppose I have say I wanted to find if suppose I have the algebraic expression a s to X square minus 1 plus 3x an algebraic brief as 1 minus X cube and I flexy as 2x minus 3 yes so in this 
,,case I wanted to find the sum of two algebraic expressions minus the third expression so this problem is a combination of both addition and subtraction so we use the same process we can do either by adding first a plus B and then subtracting that expression with C or you can do altogether but I suggest let's go step by step process because it's easy and simplifying in a step-by-step process so when I have a plus B so let me first find a plus B and then for next I subtract C from that obtained expression so we all know that a plus B is nothing but addition of two expressions so first let me write the expression a in chronological order plus 3x minus 1 and then let me write the expression B below that with the like terms minus x cube plus 1 oh I should have I should be leaving some space here because the highest degree of these two expressions is 3 so leaving a space I get here minus X cubed plus 1 but these two places left vacant now I am going to add these two so addition of 
,,these two expressions gives me a plus B on the left hand side and when I add the like terms here there's no like term in the expression a corresponding to expression B so therefore directly I have this minus X cube entering in the first term then I don't have anything below this so that comes directly as 2 X square plus 3x minus 1 plus 1 would be 0 so the constant vanish in case of addition of these two expressions so therefore I get a plus B as negative X cubed plus 2x squared plus 3x now 
,,this is the expression I got in chronological order for a plus B but when I want to find a plus B minus C I just write C below this and I subtract these two expressions indirectly I get this so let's write the expression algebraic expression C in chronological order where I have 2x and I have negative 3 but I don't have any of these terms with degree 3 and degree 2 and C so I just keep them vacant then in this case because I need to subtract I I have to subtract therefore I change all the signs of U minus minus and minus becomes plus all the signs become opposite so in this case being minus minus and plus therefore the left-hand side reduces to a plus 
,,B minus C and the right-hand side because there is no term below this I directly have minus X cube entering in here and then the C similar is the case with 2x square which enters in directly then I have 3x minus 2x which is X and this is plus 3 which is the answer for a plus B minus C so like this we can add or subtract together or you can add all terms you can take four expressions and do addition and subtraction there are many things which we can do out here so this is how we obtain the addition and subtraction of algebraic expressions

AlgebraicExpression,20BYGqGufY8,are they grenades and welcome to worksheet cloud maths my name is Joe Milligan and I'm going to take you through some facts about algebraic expressions first of all 
,,how to write them then how to simplify them and then how to evaluate them okay if at any stage you don't understand anything and you want to ask a question remember 
,,to just send an email to that email address at the bottom of your page and somebody will get back to you right first of all we have to look at what an algebraic expression actually is it indicates a sequence of calculations that can also be described in words or with a flow diagram so for example multiply a number by 2 and add 6 to the answer that is in words as you can see this would be the flow diagram for that sentence and it's an unknown number x bar 2 and added 6 and that as an algebraic expression would look like that X plus 2 or sorry x times 2 plus 6 okay that would be the expression it's written an algebraic form okay so your expression would 
,,actually look like this 2x plus 6 remember the X is the unknown value you can call that unknown value anything you'd like you can call it a or b or Y or CID but for 
,,today's lesson we're going to refer to unknown values as X okay now you try see if you can write that as an expression two times a number added to three times the same number okay did you get that 2 times X plus 3 times X and if we make it simpler it would just be 2x plus 3x okay right let's go on let's break this down two times a number added to three times the same number okay now give it give the unknown number a name like I said earlier you can give it any name you like but today we are going to call it X so both are no numbers have the same value and they can both be called X if you choose to use y both of them would be called Y okay so these words then translate to 2 times X plus 3 times X as an algebraic expression and can also then be written 2x plus 3x which just looks a whole lot tidier okay let's try one more half a number subtracted from five times of that number it would be 5 X minus 1/2 X you might have written half X minus 5 X but let me explain to you why it's the other way around okay we break this one down we've got half of a number subtracted from 5 times that same number okay if the same number is we're dealing with only one unknown value so we can give it them both the same name and we will call it X again and so we are then we need to look at the word from in this case yeah because we are subtracting 1/2 X from 5 times X so we need to write it 5x minus 1/2 X it would be like me asking you to subtract 2 from 3 if you were to write that it would be 3 minus 2 okay let's go on you can try these now all on your own so you can pause the video and you can try them out and then we'll go over them together right let's see what you did the first one is a number less 7 again you can call it a B why is it whatever you'd like to call it we're going to call it X again and that would be X minus 7 see this time wasn't from 7 it was a number less 7 that means you subtract the 7 from the number okay half of a number added to 6 that would be 1/2 X plus 6 or 6 plus 1/2 X remember adding we can write it any which way we lack any way around okay the next one times a number divided by 2 would be 9x divided by 2 next one 3 times a number increased by 4 you've got it 3x plus 4 and then 1/4 of a number subtracted from 8 remember these are from again let's have a look it would be 8 minus 1/4 X well done guys I'm sure you got those all rights right now we're going to look and see how we can simplify the expressions okay five times a number add it to six times the same number and then subtract 4 wow that seems like quite a long sentence but let's go through it slowly 5x plus 6x minus 4 now because you've got 5x and a 6x those are both the same unknown numbers so we could say we can put them together and say it's 11x minus 4 can you see that you've got an unknown number of that X and that X 5 of those and 6 of the same things you'd get 11 of them if I were to say to you for 5x and 6x then you could say I've got 11x it would 
,,be the same kind of thing see right now you can try try those ones pause the video again have a go and we'll go over them together right let's see how you did two times a number subtracted from 3 times the same number would give you 3 minus 2x is the and then it would be the same as just plain X because you've got three X's and 
,,you - includes from that you left with 1x right the second one for added to a number and subtract 2 times the same number let's see what happens yeah we've got 4 plus an unknown X minus 2x so yeah we've got a positive x and a negative x so if you have minus 2x and you add on an X you she just got EXO it would be four minus X let's go over that one just one more time you've got a positive excellent you - in two x's from it you would end up in with a negative x so it'll be 4 minus X instead of 4 plus X right let's go over the next one and number added to 7 and 3 times that number is subtracted let's see what happens ya X plus 7 minus 3 X again you've got a positive X if there's nothing in front of it it means it's positive and see how you've got a minus 3 X so you adding an X 1 to your minus 3 X so then you would end up with 7 minus 2x you could possibly also write it minus 2x plus 7 it just looks a little bit more messy right so far we've looked at writing algebraic expressions from words and how to simplify the expression now we're going to look at how to evaluate these expressions ok we can only evaluate an expression if we are given the value of x and remember the X is the unknown number so we can't give an expression of value unless we are actually given the value of that X so let's have a look at so if we are told X is equal to 3 then we can work out the value of the expression 2x minus 1 and how do we do this well we would substitute the 3 into the expression in the position of X so it would be 3 2 times 3 minus 1 so we would write it like that or we can write it like that the only reason I wrote it like that was because the X looks sits next to the tooth so it's the same thing 2 times 3 and then minus 1 okay because we now have an actual value we can carry out the operations and the expression to find the answer so 2 times 3 would be 6 and 6 minus 1 would give me 5 rights have you got it so let's go over that again we can only substitute in when we are given the value of the X so we the value up here we are told that X is equal to 3 so 2 times 3 would give me 6 6 minus 1 is 5 and that would be the value of that expression right let's go on to your turn now I want you to find the value of the expression X minus 2 X where X is equal to 2 you can pause the video and 
,,you can try that out and then we'll go over it okay so what's the value of your expression for let's break it down we've got 8 minus 2x where the X is equal to 2 so 
,,it's 8 minus 2 times 2 that's 8 minus 4 and so the value of your expression is 4 okay try those on your own grab a piece of paper write them down pause the video and work them out okay how well did you do 8 minus 2 X where X is equal to 3 we're going to substitute the 3 in for the X so it would be 8 minus 2 times 3x minus 6 which gives me 2 5x minus 7 where X is equal to 2 same thing we're going to go 5 times 2 2 is in place of the X which gives me 10 minus 7 is 3 one thing here you have to write out the whole expression so I can't just write 5 times 2 because I've got an equal sign so my equal sign tells me that what is on this line is actually exactly the same value as to what is on that line so if I left off the 7 5 times 2 does not give me 5x minus 7 it doesn't equal that so we must just be very careful with how we write things down see okay number three 1/2 X where X is 10 half of 10 we all know is 5 3 times 2 X where X is 4 again we're going to substitute in for the X where it's 4 it will be 3 times and in brackets 2 times 4 so we'll do that first then we'll go 2 times 4 is 8 3 times 8 is 24 the next one 3x plus 2x again we substituting in 3 X + 2 X X here is 5 so 5 3 times 5 plus 2 times 5 will be 15 plus 10 and that gives you 25 I hope you all got that but let's look at the next thing remember when we simplified the expression while that last one we could probably simplify so in question 5 was 3x + 2 X where X was equal to 5 so because your variables are the same your unknowns are the same can add them together before you substitute it in so we got 3x + 2 X and that's the same as 5x remember when we simplify the expressions we looked at putting those together okay so X is equal to 5 and we can then multiply it 5 times 5 and we end up with 25 so the answer to that expression would be 25 that is the same answer as what you got when you did when you didn't simplify the expression and you kept the two terms apart it would be 3 times 5 + 2 times 5 which is 15 plus 10 and you also end up with 25 can you see you got the same answer so you could do it either way around you would end up with the same answer right let's look at see if it works for another example where 2 X + 4 X + X is equal to 3 we've got 2 times 3 plus 4 times 3 that's 6 plus 12 and it gives me an answer of 18 or we could go to X plus 4 X is 6 X 6 times 3 is 18 can you see same answer so whichever way suits you to work it out you can work it out like that you're going to get the same answer either way around right let's draw on everything you have learned today to try these ok you can pause the video again try those art and we'll go over them together right let's see how you did 2 times a number subtracted from 3 times the same number we've got 3 X minus 2 X and that would eggs we haven't been given the the value of the X so we can just simplify them right for added to 2 times a number and subtract the same number is 4 + 2 X - X would be 4 + X a number subtracted from 7 and 3 times that number is added it's 7 - x + 3 X and that would give you 7 minus 2 X right it's just revised what you've gone over today what we've learned so you've learned how to first of all write an expression in words then you learned how to simplify the expression and how to evaluate the expression when given a value for the unknown number see I made a little mistake here it's hard to simplify the expression not and expression and how do you evaluate the expression when given a value for the unknown number now you can try the activity that is being posted and then you can check it with the memo thank you for joining us today great and I hope you've understood everything just remember if you haven't understood anything at all you can email in and the email address has been on each side so you can go back and check it it is also an activity worksheet and somebody will get back to you with an answer or an explanation thank you for listening today

AlgebraicExpression,8hzPIKmCHUA,"Oh no! A power cut. Let me just get a candle. Ouch! I think I hit a table. Where is... oh, here. Do you know there are some people who have"
,,mastered the art of navigating in darkness. And they are also trained to read
,,and write in the dark. These mighty people are the blind. And they do this with the unique
,,writing system called Braille. I am so excited to tell you about the
,,"amazing story of this invention. Thank god it's back. Come friends, zoom in! The history of this unique writing system"
,,goes all the way back to the early 1800s. Several soldiers in the French Army were
,,using lamps to read the combat messages. A terrible decision. As the light shinning from the lamps told
,,the enemies where the French soldiers were. A man named Charles Barbier saw this problem. And developed a night writing system
,,for the soldiers. It was a system with 12 raised
,,dots in a cell. Which could be read with fingertips. And it helped the soldiers read without
,,"attracting any unwanted attention. Then in 1821, Charles Barbier was invited,.. ..to introduce the night writing system to a"
,,"class of young blind students. However, there was one flaw in this system. It was just impossible to feel all"
,,"the dots with a single touch. Still, it was enough to inspire one"
,,"student, a curious little boy. Named Louis Braille. Braille was blinded at a very young age,"
,,in an accident. When he was playing with an awl
,,"and punching holes in leather. But a physical disability, was no bar"
,,for Braille's bright spirit. Soon he was back in the workshop
,,"with his imagination. And this time, instead of leather,"
,,Braille was punching dots on paper. He worked tirelessly for years to modify
,,Charles Barbier's night writing system.. ..for his fellow blind individuals. And soon enough the hard work of this
,,little genius bore fruit. Braille simplified the night writing system. And reduced the 12 raised dots to 6! This meant that a single letter could now
,,"be recognized with a single touch. Now, that was a big improvement, kids. Because it made reading for the"
,,"blind much easier and faster. They were absolutely delighted. For the next 5 years, Braille refined the"
,,"writing method which was already in use. Finally, in 1829, Braille published a book.. ..explaining the entire Braille code,"
,,"for writing and reading. Despite the great advantages of it,"
,,Louis Braille's own university.. ..refused to adopt the system. But there was no stopping him. He soon started spreading Braille
,,"amongst the students. After being appointed as a teacher. This Braille move by brave... I mean, this brave move by Braille,.. ..helped the students immensely. And in 1854, 2 years after"
,,"Louis Brailles death. The rising demands from the students,.. ..made the university adopt the"
,,Braille writing system officially! Since then the Braille writing system
,,has spread throughout the world. And has been giving vision to the
,,"blind in the form of literacy. Oh! there it goes. That was my last copy of the Braille guide. I'll probably go and get some more. Oh, but wait. Stay right here. TRIVIA TIME! Do you know about these yellow things on"
,,the floor? Probably in train stations. These are actually helping hands
,,for blind people. Enabling them to find their way
,,"and avoid obstacles. And these are known as Braille for feet. Wait! This isn't a train, is it? What is this? Why am I here? Oh look! That's our friend"
,,Louis Braille passing by. Did you know? An asteroid has been
,,"named 9969 Braille.. ..to honor none other than Louis Braille. There it goes. So kids, you see how 1 man's invention"
,,helped so many blind people worldwide! Oh wait! May be he can help me find
,,my way back to earth. Don't forget to tune in next time.

AlgebraicExpression,nn_6exr-ShA,in this video you will cover algebraic expressions a topic covered in class 8 math okay moving on let's understand what an expression is to begin with an expression 
,,is nothing but a combination of variables and constants of one or more terms and what does that mean so lets it that's better understood with an example like you see on the right side we have an expression for X square minus 5y plus 10 it has three terms the terms being for X square being the first term minus 5y being the second term and +10 being the third term and a term is nothing but a part of the expression that is separated by the plus or minus signs so for X square minus 5y and plus 
,,10 these become the three terms of the expression for x squared minus 5y plus 10 for instance if you had an expression of the form a minus 4b plus 5c then a would be one term minus 4b would be the second term and plus 5c would be the third term easy enough digging in further we need to understand what a coefficient is what are like terms and what are constants let's look at this expression here for X square minus 5y plus 2 a B minus 4 B a and minus 10 so again we have five terms right or x 
,,squared minus 5 y plus 2 a B minus 4 B a minus 10 so in this example the coefficients would be 4 minus 5 plus 2 and minus 4 let's take a look at what like terms are 
,,like terms are the terms with the same variables raised to the same power now here which are the same variables raised to the same power we see a b and b 8 right these are the same variables and they are raised to the same power a is raised to the power 1 b is raised to the power 1 same goes here b is raised to the power 1 and a is raised to the far one that makes two a B and minus 4 B a like terms and constants are nothing but terms without any variables associated with them so my understand becomes a constant in this scenario now let's understand different types of algebraic expressions we have what are called monomials binomials trinomials polynomials sounds pretty easy based on the name of each cuz mono means one by means to try corresponds to three poly corresponds to multiple right so in the similar fashion 
,,the description is also associated with the same meaning so monomial means an algebraic expression comprising of one nonzero term for example 7a is an example of a monomial 3x square is an example of a monomial because it comes each comprises of one nonzero term similarly a binomial consists of two nonzero terms same way we have seven plus five be three X minus four X Y cube each consists of two terms right two nonzero terms seven being one of them five B being the second term in the first 
,,expression the second expression we have three X being the first term and minus four X Y cube being the second term a trinomial comprised of three nonzero terms so in this example these two examples consists of three terms that makes each of them a trinomial and a polynomial consists of one two or more nonzero terms so a monomial is a also a final polynomial a binomial is also considered a polynomial and a trinomial is also considered a subset of a polynomial so in this example three x squared would be a polynomial 3x minus 4 XY cubed would be considered a polynomial all of these would be considered polynomial because by definition a polynomial can serve one two or more nonzero terms all right moving so let's take a look at how we add and subtract polynomials let's take a look at the example given here we're trying to add two expressions here for X cubed plus or 5y minus 10 and 5 X square Y minus 15 minus 6 X cube minus 2 y so if what we have to do here is that we add the where we group the like terms together and each of these expressions we figure out which other like terms right we notice that 4x cubed and minus 6x cubed are like terms similarly 5y and minus 2y electrum so we group them together and then we form the addition that gives us the result which is -2 X cubed plus 5 X square y plus 3y minus 25 similarly we have a little variation in the question here where we've been asked what must be subtracted from 5x minus 6 X cubed minus 10 to give this result which is 4 X cubed plus 12 so it's nothing but saying what must be subtracted from a if you consider this to be a to give C so it's nothing but saying a minus B equals C so what is B right so B becomes a minus C so if this was a and this was C we subtract 4x cubed plus 12 from - from 5x - 6 X cubed minus 10 so of course we changed the signs of 4x cubed + 12 that makes it minus 4x u minus 12 and that's the result which is minus 10x cubed minus 5x minus 22 and that's the answer now moving on let's take a look at how to multiply polynomials so we have an example given here for a minus 1 times minus 2 a plus 7 so what we have to do is we take each term of the first expression and we multiply it with each term of the second expression so we take four a and multiply it with minus 2 a plus seven and then the second second term which is minus one and multiply it with minus 2 a plus seven so that's how we open the brackets solve them that gives us minus eighty square because for a times minus 2 e is minus 80 square and then plus 28 a plus 2 we because minus 1 minus 2 acre just last way minus 7 and that's the answer which is minus 8a squared plus 38 minus 7 here's another example we've been given the base and height of triangle in terms of expressions as minus 4 X plus y and X minus 3 y applying the formula 
,,for triangle which is 1/2 base times a height we inject and the expressions that we've been provided we simplify it to get this answer which is nothing but half times a multiplying the each of the terms of the first expression with the second expression and that gives your area in square units easy enough and then last but not the least we look at how to divide polynomials so one thing you need to remember is that when we divide terms with the same bases we subtract the exponents if you haven't seen one of my other videos you may want to take a look at it which talks more about about X powers and exponents and come in handy for this particular slide okay so we have to simplify this expression here which is 40 a square B minus 16 a B square plus 24 a cubed b cubed which is the expression and they've asked us to divide by 8 a B so what we have to do is when you are subdividing two expressions and dividing an expression by one term that term gets divided by each of the associated terms of the numerator so it becomes 40 a square B divided by 8 AP - 16 a B Square minus 8 a couple divided by eight a B plus 24 a QB cube divided by 8 a B and then now when you divide a square B divided by a B that is nothing but b and b cancel out a square divided by a gives us a that gives us 5 a because 40 divided by 8 is 
,,5 16 by 8 is 2 a B squared divided by a B gives us B and then 24 a cubed b cubed divided by 8 a B is nothing but 24 by 8 is 3 a cube by a is a 3 a raised to the power 3 minus 1 by applying this rule where we subtract the exponents and that gives you a final answer which is fine 8 minus 2 B plus 3 a square B Square that's a folks keep on solving additional examples and you will be an expert at all the normals as well please subscribe to my channel and keep watching and sharing and liking these videos appreciate your inputs and thoughts and comments thanks so much see you soon

AlgebraicExpression,GYevDfFTCUs,hello grade 9 students today I am here to teach you an algebraic you need that's algebraic expressions chapter 5 we'll take algebraic expressions 3x plus 7 what is this one 3x plus 7 is the algebraic expression and what is 3x 3x is the algebraic term and what's the coefficient of the algebraic term that's 3 so what you call this number this is the constant term 7 so in algebra you need to know what is algebraic expression algebraic term and the coefficient of the algebraic term and the constant look at this algebraic expression 3 a + 5 b -11 write down the algebraic terms in the algebraic expression here 3 a is an algebraic term and 5 B you can't write minus 11 minus 11 is a constant write down the constant term that's minus 11 expanding brackets in algebraic expressions you have done this before in grade 8 how you expand multiply the first term with first and this one second so 3 times X 3 X 3 times 4 plus 12 all the elements inside the brackets must must be multiplied by 3 
,,this is an algebraic expression with algebraic term is 3x so this is the algebraic term the coefficient of algebraic term is 3 and the constant term is 12 now expand this minus 5 times a minus 5 a minus 5 times minus 4 you get plus 20 when multiplying by negative number the terms inside the brackets changed the sign look at here a was positive law - five earlier this was - value now this is Plus expand brackets 3 times a 3 a 3 times 2 + 6 here 5 times X 5x - 5 times 4 26 times a 6 a plus 6 
,,times 1 6 minus 7 times X minus 7 X minus 7 times minus 4 plus 28 minus 3 times 5 minus 50 minus 3 into minus y plus 3 y here - 11 times 3 minus 33 - 11 x minus m plus 11 m take these questions eight times like 8 times X 8 X 8 x - 4 - 32 here 4 times a 4 - 4 times 1/2 so what is 4 times 1/2 that means 2 so minus 2 6 times 2 X 12 X minus 6 this one 5 times 3 15 p phi x cubed minus 5 q this 1 minus 2 times X minus 2 X minus minus plus plus 22 what 1/2 times 4 X here you can do separately 1/2 
,,times 2 X here you get 2 X 1/2 times 8 you get 4 so plus Oh expand brackets a times X X a times 4 4 B times X BX B times minus 3 minus 3 this one C X plus C C times 
,,1 that's C P times Q P Q minus P times 4 you can write minus 4p when you are writing the term write the number first M into M M square M into 4 for M P into P P squared P into minus Q minus P Q 2 way times a 2 a squared 2 a times B 2 a 3 X into X 3x squared 3 X into minus 2 minus 6 X here what happens - is there - 2 P times M minus 2 will write MP in order alphabetical order M first minus 2p times minus 4 plus 8 P here again - values minus 3 X into X minus 3 X square minus 3 X into minus y 
,,plus 3 X 5 - 2 y into Z minus 2 y Z minus 2 into 3 minus 6 Y this 1 minus px - + - + P Y what about this one a square into a square a B and minus 3a X into X x squared X into - y - x - y or first we have to write down the number -2 X Y X into five that's five X we don't say X 5 5 X is the correct way of writing substitute the values in the algebraic expression what we do we can substitute the values given a equals 2 there so the algebraic term is three so how do you do that first write down the expression substitute a is 2 3 times 2 + 7 6 plus 7 that's 13 determine the value of x squared + 5 X minus 11 when x equals 3 what is x squared means 3 times 3 
,,so 3 squared 5 times 3 minus 11 9 plus 15 minus 11 15 minus 11 is 4 9 plus 4 30 what's the expression given here 5x minus 4y plus 7 you asked to find out when x equals -2 and y equals minus 3 substitute 5 times minus 2 y times minus 3 5 times minus 2 minus 10 minus minus plus 12 plus 7 minus 10 plus 12 plus 2 2 plus 7 that's 9 find the value of the algebraic expression by substituting the values for the unknown letters given below a squared minus a is given 3 so that means 3 squared minus 3 3 squared is 9 9 minus 3 you get six seven X minus three y plus four x equals 4 that means 7 times 4 y equals to 7 times 4 28 3 times 2 6 28 minus 6 22 22 plus 4 you get 26 this one you have to substitute a fraction we'll see a equals 1/2 so that means 4 times 1/2 B equals 3 3 times 3 2 times 2 so you get 2 plus 9 minus 9 9 9 get cancel out and you get to them expand brackets and simplify as much as possible first expand brackets 2 times a 2 a 2 times minus B minus 2 B plus 3a plus 21 now 
,,I'd like terms 2 & 3 8 that's 5 8 and - to be there plus 21 here first expand brackets 3x - 6 5 I plus 5 here constant terms we can simplify 3 X plus 5 by minus 6 and plus 5 is minus 1 here 6a plus 6b you know nothing means this is like 1 minus a plus v6 a - a highway 6 b + B it's 7 B expand and simplify 3x + 3 y here 2x minus 2y like terms add 3x and 2x becomes 5x 3 y + minus 2y that's plus y 1y you don't need to write 1 here 5 a minus 10 B minus 3 a minus into minus plus 12 B 5 a and minus 3a 2a minus 10 10 plus 12 plus 2 so plus 2b this one nothing means this is like 1 so a minus 3 multiply these 2 minus M square R and minus - plus 5 m now what are 
,,the like terms you can't simplify further this 1 minus 3 X minus minus plus 6 y + 7 x + 7 by minus 3 X and + 7 X that's 4 X 6 plus 7 13 y 2 x 3 6 6 minus 2 y here nothing means this is like what x + 6 X + X 7 X minus 2 n + y -1 Y that's minus y into a a squared - 3 a 2 times 3 6 a 2 times 4 8 what are the like terms these 2 a squared plus 6 and minus 3 you get plus 3 a + 8 this one x squared minus XY + 3 X +6 so you can't simplify this one further minus 3x minus minus plus 15y plus 7x minus 7y what are the like terms 7x minus 3x that's points 15 minus 7 plus 8y there's a minus sign minus 7 e minus into minus plus 7 b minus three b minus minus becomes plus 3 times 3 9 a what are the like terms 90 + -7 a you get to it 7 b minus 3 B that's for be here three terms but you can do the same thing multiplied by 5 5 X minus 5 bi plus 15 is is this one and then 3 X + 3 y 5x + 3 X 8 X - 5 bi plus 3 by - 2 y + 15 there this one - way - 4 B plus 3 a + 3 B let 2a and 3a 5b 5a plus 3a 8 minus 4 B plus 3b that's - 1b or just you can write B this one 5x - 5 by this 1 minus 3 X plus 3y minus minus plus and 11 Y is there 5x + 3 X - 3 X 2x - 5 plus 3 minus 
,,2 y 11 minus 2 plus 9 substituting fractions - algebraic terms X is half you asked to find out 4 X plus 5 so substitute 4 times 1/2 plus 5 here you can see you can simplify the denominator with the numerator 1 and here so you get 2 + 5 that's 7 equals 1/3 9a plus 2/9 times 1/3 + 2 here 3 times 1/3 times 3 3 + 2 you get 5 x equals 2/3 now 9 x + 1 9 times 2/3 plus 1/3 times 1/3 times 3 so 3 times 2 6 6 + 1 7 here 11 minus 3 when a equals minus 2/3 11 minus 3 times minus 2 over 3 will put brackets here 3 + 3 get cancel out you get 11 minus into minus plus 11 plus 2 answer yes 13 equals 1/2 B equals 1/3 so this should be simple B so we'll substitute the values for a equals 1/2 we cause 1/3 2 times 1/2 times 2 so what's the answer 2 + here are 3 in one three two one so one day three to plus one you'll get three six a six times 1/2 minus 3 times 1/3 substitute a and B two times three three get cancelled out so what's remaining 3 here 1 3 minus 1 is 2 8 E is 1/2 B is 1/3 2 times 1/2 times 4 3 times 1/3 times 2 here 4-2 ours is to 18 times 1/2 six times one thirty two and nine three bit too so what's the final answer nine minus two answer is seven if x equals 2/3 and y equals 1/2 find the value of the following algebraic expressions 6 times 2/3 2 times 1/2 3 times 1/3 times 2 2 times 1/2 times 1/2 times 2 4 here plus one times one one four plus one you get five this one 9 times X what is X X is 2/3 4 times 1/2 3 times 1/3 times 3 2 times 1/2 times 2 so 3 times 2 is 6 2 times 1 is 2 6 minus 2 same question another part 12 X is 2/3 - why why is half substitute 3 times 1/3 times 4 4 times 2 eight here - when to get canceled out you get one there 8 + 1 9 9 X is 2/3 minus 2 times 1/2 3 n here 3 3 times 2 6 2 + 2 get cancelled out you get minus 1 6 - 1 answer is 5 find the value of value if P equals 1/3 so substitute 1/3 for P simplify first 3 times 2 6 2 + 4 that's 6 9 P minus 2/9 times P is 1/3 minus 2 here simplify 3 + 3 3 - 2 you get 12 P P is 1/3 + 3 3 times 1 3 times 4 4 + 3 you get 7 3 P plus 11 3 into 1/3 + ulema 3 + 3 get cancel out 1 plus 11 is 12 so you need to simplify the fractional part that's multiplication and then do the addition find the value if M equals to 4 times 2 + 11 8 plus 11 that's 19 6 times 2 plus 5 multiplication first 12 + 5 17 10 times 2 - 1 xx - 1 that's 19 8 times 2 plus 10 8 times 2 16 + 10 26 find the value when x equals 2l y equals 1/3 for X is 2 y is 138 plus 1/3 how can you write you can write 8 full parts and 135 X plus 3 by 5 X that's not bad by 2 3 y 1/3 is there 3 3 get cancelled out so 10 plus 1 the answer is either 1 another one 8 times 2 minus 6 times 1/3 3 and here too you get 6 8 times 2 16 minus 2 answer is 14 again this one 10 times 2 minus 9 times white why is 1/3 3 times 1/3 times 3 10 times 2 20 minus 3 answer is 17 find the value of M equals 1/2 and in equals 1/2 for these expressions 8m a miss half in Miss 152 times 4 here are 5 times 2 4 times 1 4 2 times 1 2 4 minus 2 you get to do the same thing 16mm is 1/2 it needs 152 with 16 you get eight five and five get canceled out 8 minus 1 is 7 10 mm is half a Miss 152 and ten five five and this 1 so 5 plus 1 you get 6 6 times mm is 1/2 minus 15 times n that's one field to end is 3 5 times 3 15 so you get 3 minus 3 answer is 0 binomial expressions what is 
,,bi means two so expressions means when you get two terms 3x plus 4y is binomial expression X minus 5i so all these are binomial expressions so there are two terms in all these expressions due to one term or both of these terms are algebraic terms these are called binomial algebraic expressions so here one term is constant and the other one is algebraic term here both terms are algebraic terms product of two binomial expressions now X plus 2 is a binomial expression X plus 3 or so another binomial expression now we'll try to multiply these two so this is the product of both binary expressions or binomial expressions expand the brackets and simplify as much as possible now we'll try to do that using this method so we are multiplying here X plus 3 they are we can write x plus 2 here X plus 2 this way row wise X plus 
,,3 column wise X plus 2 so we can use multiply row and columns X into X we know this is X square X into plus 3 plus 3x this one 2 into X plus 2 X 2 into 3 plus 6 so what's the answer when you multiply using this method you get x squared - 3 X 2 X + 6 now simplify I can simplify these two - 3 + 2 5 X + 6 so that's how we can multiply using this method now we'll do the same thing X + 3 is there x + 5 X into X x squared X into 5 5 X 3 into X 3 X 3 into 5 15 so what are the values you are getting here when you multiply you get x squared - 5 X 3x + 15 so when you simplify you get 8x plus 15 - the same thing a plus 4a plus 4a into a a square into 4 4 a 5 into a 5 a 5 into 4 20 so when you multiply you get all these terms so a square plus 4 plus 5a plus 20 so when you can so you can add these to phibn for where you get 9e and this is 20 similar to that one y + 3 y + 7 Y into y Y square my into 3 3 by 7 into y 7y 7 into 3 20 so what's the answer Y squared 3 by 7 y + 20 bucks so these 
,,two terms you can add you get 10 buy and here are twenty one this one now - so a minus two so you can write in one color - to a +3 here a squared - 2 way here plus 3 a + -6 - into + - now what are the terms you are getting a squared minus 2a plus 3 and minus 6 so simply 5 3 - 2 + 1 that's a minus 6 this was X - 5 X - 2 so we need to multiply X into X X square X into minus 5 minus 5 X here you get minus 2 X minus 2 into minus 5 that's + step write down the terms and simplify x squared minus 
,,5 minus 2 minus 7 and you'll get 10 here similar to that one a minus 7 a minus 3 a into a a square minus 7 8 - 3 times a minus 3 a minus 3 times minus 7 plus 25 so what are the terms you are getting a squared minus 7 a minus 3 a + 21 a squared - 7 + -3 minus 10 plus 21 expand and simplify so we'll take the whole expression multiplied with this and this so you get a into a plus 2 here 3 with a plus 2 now expand brackets a into a square plus 2 a 3 into a 3a plus 6 so you get a squared 2a and 
,,3a v b +6 this one through the same thing the whole expression multiplied with this one X into X minus 2 5 into X minus 2 then expand brackets x squared minus 2x plus 5 X minus 10 so x squared minus 2 plus 5 that's plus 3x minus 10 this one this whole expression with this end this p with p + 5 + -7 b 3 plus 5p squared plus 5p minus 7 P minus 35 so you get P squared minus 7 and plus 5 minus 2p minus 35 this one Y with Y minus 3 and minus 4 with Y minus 3 so this term multiplied by these two 
,,terms Y squared minus 3y minus 4y plus 12 so you get Y squared minus 3 minus 4 minus 7y then you get plus expand and simplify again we can write a plus 3 expression 
,,with a plus 7 with this now expand a square plus 3 plus seventy plus 21 but you get a squared 3 a + 7 a 10 a plus 21 what about this one y with y + 7 + 4 with y + 7 
,,now multiply Y into y y square and 4y plus 28 four times seven simplify y squared 7 plus 4 11 y plus 28 this one a minus 3 times M plus 4 times M minus 3 M into M M 
,,squared minus 3 M 4 M minus 12 so you get M squared minus 3 plus 4 plus M minus 12 what about this one p + 7 x p + + 8 x p + 7 you get P squared + 7 p 8 b + 56 p square 7 p + 8 P 15 P Plus 56 look at this one P with P minus 8 and the other one is minus 3 with P minus 8 expand brackets you get V squared minus 18 minus 3 P plus 24 P square 8 + 3 11 so this is minus 24 there this one X with X - 4 - 7 with X - 4 x squared minus 4 X minus 7 X + 28 x squared minus 4 X and minus 7 X minus 11 X and here plus 28 here 4 into 6 + P + + P into 6 + p expand separately 24 + 4 p here 6 P plus P squared so 24 is there here 6 plus 4 10 plus P Square what about this one 4 is there 7 - why - why with 7 - what 4 times 7 28 here - 4 y minus 7y plus y square answer is 28 minus 4 minus 7 minus 11 y + y squared there this one a with a - 
,,8 + 8 with a minus 8a squared - 8 8 plus 8 a + 64 minus 64 a squared - 8 e + 8 a get cancel out you get minus 68 so this one P into P minus 4 and plus 4 with P minus 4p squared - 4 p + 4 P minus 16 yeah also me the term get canceled out P squared minus 16 is what seven with seven plus M minus M with seven plus M when you simplify expand brackets 49 + 7 m - 7 M minus M Squared so what's the value 49 minus M Squared because this these two terms get cancelled out so what are these actually can you remember difference between two squared terms so you get square terms here and here this one give it to a plus three minus five it to a plus three to a squared 
,,plus 3a minus 10y minus fifteen simplify you get 2a squared - 7 8 - 15 question number 19 expand using the arrow now we'll use another method we call it rainbow method or foil so I'll show you how to do that at once without writing separate brackets this one first with first number so that's F a into a that's a square that's F first with first that's the arrow number one now we are taking oh-oh means outside values so outside here with outside that's the second one a with eight get 8a that's outside I mean inside with inside so inside with inside that's number three three with you get three that's I thought 1l l means last with last two last week last 
,,that's fourth one three with eight you get 24 that's so we call this method is foil method first with first outside with outside inside with inside last with last oh they call it rainbow meter this is like a rainbow this one this one this one rainbow so we can call it rainbow method now we'll practice rainbow method or foil method you put the arrows first first with first why square then Oh outside numbers so why then inside 7y and l-last values 28 y squared plus 11 y plus 28 now do the same thing this one p square then the second one is this +7 p third one is minus 2p fourth one is minus 14 simplify you get 7 minus 2 plus 5p this one use rainbow or foil method first with first then outside numbers inside numbers and then last two values simplify you get M Squared 8 minus 7 plus M minus 56 that's why first with first 48 this with this 8 be inside six feet and outside numbers last last numbers P Square this one 48 + 8 + 6 14 P plus P squared rainbow method a squared + AC plus 
,,a B plus C can you simplify this one you can't simplify no like terms are there this one M squared plus 7 minus 2m minus 14x squared plus five M minus 14 this one three-year plus 24x squared + 8 simplify like terms you get 3a + 80 1124 and this one reimu bitter or foil method M squared minus 8 M minus 3 M plus 8 times 3 20 simplify you get 11 m in the middle and here you get 24 they're the same thing you have to use foil of rainbow method P into 7 7 P P into P P squared 11 times 7 77 11 now add these to get 18 P plus P squared plus 77 this one y squared minus 2y plus 2y minus 4 meter term get cancel out minus 2y plus 2y get cancel out you get Y squared minus H squared plus 7 h minus 7 Beach - 49 me turtle get cancel out h squared - 49 this one use rainbow method 12 x - 12 x - 24 12 X 2 X + x squared so 24 there 12 + 2 14 and you get x squared expand brackets using areas now we'll use another method to expand brackets x no Mielec specials so x + 2 X + 3 so we think about the area of a rectangle so X + 3 we write like this this way x + 2 we can fill each area and add it together so X into X x squared X into 3 3 X 2 into X 2 X 2 into 3 6 so what's the total area of the rectangle areas of each rectangle add up to gether X square plus 3 X plus 2 X plus 6 you get 5 X so you can use this method as well considering areas of rectangles because here what is the total area X plus 3 into X plus 2 length into breadth now look at this one X plus 3 one side X plus 4 the other side so fill the areas x squared 4 X 3 X + 12 so what's the total area x squared + 4 X + 3 X + 12 when you add these two together you get 7x plus 12 this one what's the area this is x + 6 + x + 4 multiplication of these two so fill this x squared this is 6 X 4 X + 24 add it together x squared plus 6 X plus 4 X plus 24 is equal 
,,to x squared + 10 x 6 + 4 + 24 they're given that the following equations show that the above equation is true for a equals 3 so we'll do left hand side and right hand side and see whether both are equal so take the left hand side and substitute a equals 3 3 + 2 7 + 3 10 3 + 2 5 10 times 5 50 now we'll take the right hand side and substitute a squared + 9 a plus 40 equals 3 3 squared 9 times 3 + 14 9 9 times 3 27 + 14 what's the value 9 + 7 16 22 through four five so that's also fifty so you can say this is equal so left hand side is equal to right hand and this is so therefore it's true given that the following equation show that the above equation is true for x equals five take the left hand side and substitute five five plus two pi + 3 5 + 2 7 5 + 3 8 8 times 7 56 now take the right hand side x squared + 5 X plus 6 substitute x equals 5 5 squared pi times 5 + 6 here 25 5 times 5 25 + 650 + 6 56 so we can see left hand side is equal to right hand side so therefore the statement is true for x equals 5 given that the following equations show that the above equation is true for x equals 7 so take the left hand side and substitute x equals 7 7 minus 3 7 minus 2 4 times 5 20 now we'll take right hand side and substitute x squared minus 5x plus 6 x squared that means 7 squared minus 5 times 7 plus 6 49

,,x plus 2 so you can write x if you take X as this one this is plus 2 and x + 4 we'll take other way round we'll take + 4 is bigger than + 2 so this is plus 4 and here X plus 2 now we'll find out the area's inside X into X x squared 4 times X 4 X 2 times X 2 X + 2 times 4 8 so what's the total area of the rectangle x squared + 4 
,,X + 2 X + 8 so when you add it you get 4 plus 2 6 X + 8 so we'll see whether you got the same answer before x squared plus 6x Plus 8 now we will take Part B X plus 1 and X plus 3 so we will take X + 3 this side and X plus 1 this will be X into X x squared 3 into X 3 X 1 into X 1 X + 1 into 3 that's 3 so what's the total area x squared + 3 X + 1 x + 3 so when you add it you get 3 plus 1 4 x + 3 now we'll check it x squared + 4 X + 3 now part e P minus 4 and P minus 3 so we'll take if this is P so we take 3 here so P minus 3 and P minus 4 this way so P into P P squared P into -3 minus 3 P here - 4 P minus 4 times minus 3 plus 12 so what's the answer you 
,,get P squared minus 3 P minus 4p n plus 12 so when you simplify what you get you get P squared minus 7 P plus trap now we'll check whether it's current P squared minus 7 P plus 12 so that's the same answer we got in part one question number three expand and simplify each of the following products of binomial expressions so we'll use foil method X into X X square minus 5 X 2 with X 2x and minus 10 so what's the answer x squared minus 3x minus 10 this one X into X X square X into minus 7 minus 7 X 3 into X 3 X 3 into minus 7 minus 21x squared minus 4x minus 21 this one M squared minus M plus 6 m and minus 6 you get M squared plus 6 and minus 1 you get plus 5 M minus 6 this one X with X x squared X with plus 3 3 X minus 2 with X minus 2 X minus 2 with 3 minus 6 now simplify the like terms you get x squared plus 3x minus 2 X you get X minus 6 here x squared plus 5x - 5 X - 25 middle term get cancel out so you get x squared minus 25 this one M squared plus 8 M - him and what's the last her -1 into 8 you get minus 8 so M Squared 8 minus 1 plus 7 name - baked this one x squared - 4 X then minus 3 xn + 12 x squared minus 4 and minus 3 minus 7 X 
,,plus 12 this one y squared minus 5 by -2 yn plus 10 simplified further y squared minus 7 by last time this one M squared - 2 X - 8 m and what's the last one + 16 now simplify you get M squared minus 10 M plus 16 minus 2 and minus 8 you get minus tip this one X into 2 2 X X into minus X minus x squared minus 3 times 2 minus 6 and here minus and minus becomes plus 3x now simplify 2x and 3x 5x minus x squared minus 6 this one pi times X 5 X Phi x minus 4 minus 20 minus 6 times X minus X square and minus 6 times minus 4 you get plus 4 X so 5x + 4 X you get 9x minus 20 minus X square this one multiply 2 with 3 that's 6 2 with - X - 2 X - X with 3 - 3 X - X 
,,with - X plus X square simplify this one 6 - 5 X + X square question number 4 join each of the expressions in column a with the corresponding simplified expression in column B so we take the first one x + 2 X + 1 x squared 1 X 2 X + 2 so when you simplify you get x squared plus 3x plus 2x squared + 3 X + 2 this is this one x + 3 X - 4 x squared - 4 X + 3 X - 12 so when you simplify you get - X - 12 so that's the last one X plus 5 and X minus 2 x squared minus 2x plus 5 xn minus 10 get x squared plus 3x minus 10 x squared plus 3x minus 10 is ya X minus 3 X minus 3 X minus 3 X minus 3 you get x squared minus 3x minus 3x and plus 9 so what you get x squared minus 6 6 last night whereas that one here so you can connect that one the last one should be this one we'll check it X minus 5 and X plus 5 x squared plus 5x minus 5 xn minus 25 so plus 5x and minus 5x get canceled out you get x squared minus 25 so that's this one verify that X plus 5 into X plus 6 is this one for each instance given below so first part is x equals 3 take left hand side X plus 5 X plus 6 a substitute x equals 3 3 + 5 3 + 6 8 & 9 9 times 8 72 the next one right hand side right hand side is x squared plus 11x plus 30 substitute x equals 3 3 squared plus 11 times 3 last 30 three squared is nine eleven into three 33 plus 30 33 plus thirty sixty three sixty three plus nine you get 72 now same thing you got from left hand side and right hand side so we can say true for x equals three now what's the 
,,next part second part x equals -2 so that's the same question and x equals -2 so take the left hand side substitute x equals -2 minus two plus 5 minus 2 plus 6 the answer pi minus 2 3 6 minus 2 for 4 times 3 12 right hand side x squared that means minus 2 squared plus 11 x minus 2 plus 13 minus 2 squared is 4 11 x minus 2 minus 
,,22 plus 30 30 minus 22 you get 8 8 plus 4 so left hand side is equal to right hand side so therefore we can say true 4 x equals -2 verify this one for each instance 
,,given below so first one is x equals 1 take left hand side and substitute 1 minus 2 1 plus 3 minus 1 into 4 you get minus 4 take the right hand side x squared that means 1 square plus 1 minus 6 1 squared is 1 plus 1/2 2 minus 6 minus 4 so you get the same answer left hand side is equal to right hand side therefore it's true for 
,,x equals what now what's the second part x equals 4 so take the left hand side substitute x equals 4 4 minus 2 4 plus 3 2 & 7 so you get 14 right hand side x squared so 4 squared plus 4 minus 6 16 plus 4 minus 6 20 minus 6 you get 14 so both are the same so you can write left hand side is equal to right hand side so both sides are equals we can write true for x equals question number 6 verify that this statement for each instance given below so this is the third part x equals 0 take left hand side x is 0 substitute 0 minus 2 0 plus 3 you get minus 2 times 3 minus 6 right hand side x squared x squared it means 0 squared plus 0 minus 6 you get minus 6 so you get the same answer left hand side is equal to right hand side we can say therefore true for x equals zero question number seven verify this statement for each 
,,instance so this is another question you have to substitute x equals two so we'll take left hand side is equal to x equals 2 2 minus 2 and 4 minus 2 2 minus 2 0 0 times 2 you get 0 right hand side 2 squared minus 6 times 2 plus 8 4 minus 12 plus 8 8 plus 4 12 12 minus 12 you get 0 so left hand side is equal to right hand side so therefore this is true for x equals 2 verify this statement when x equals 3 take left hand side substitute 3 2 minus 3 4 minus 3 minus 1 1 you get minus 1 right hand side x squared that means 3 squared minus 6 times 3 plus 8 you get 9 minus 18 plus 8 8 plus 9 17 17 minus 18 minus 1 so you get the same answer so left hand side is equal to right hand side they are both true for x equals 3 verify this one when x equals minus 2 same thing take left hand side substitute x equals -2 2 minus minus to make sure that you put brackets - - - that becomes 2 plus 2 here 4 + 2 4 into 6 that's 24 right hand side x squared so minus 2 whole thing's square minus 6 into minus 2 plus 8 minus 2 times minus 2 plus 4 minus - here plus 12 plus 8 so 12 plus 12 24 so you're getting the same answer left hand side is equal to right hand side so true for x equals -2 question number 8 worded problem the length and width of a rectangle piece of decorative paper are 15 and 8 we'll try to draw that 15 and 8 2 strips of bread X centimeters each are cut off from the length and the breadth so this one so excellent cut off cut off from length X length cut off from WIC using a figure obtain an expression for the area of the remaining portion so what's the remaining portion this one so this one is the remaining portion so how we find out the remaining portion we can find out the full area - this one or you can find out the new length and the new width of the rectangle the full length is 15 and you 
,,cut expert so what is this side 15-6 this width or breadth is 8 cut out expert so this becomes 8 minus 6 so you need the shaded area shaded area the rectangle with 15 minus 6 and 8 minus X so basically you need the multiplication so remaining portion is 8 minus X into 15 minus X now use foil 8 times 15 8 times 5 48 times 1/8 + 4 12 minus 8 X minus 15 XL plus X square minus minus becomes plus 120 minus 8 minus 15 minus 23 X plus x squared so this is the area of the remaining portion so consider X less than 8 means if this is more than it you get a negative length so rectangle length cannot be negative another question question number 9 a rectangular flowerbed of length X meters and breadth 2 meters is shown in the figure two meters are reduced from its length and X meters are added to its breadth and then construct an expression in terms of X for the area of the new flowerbed by using a figure so now this is two meters are reduced so what's the what's this one X minus two now 
,,what's the height X added so this is the new length two plus X now this is the new flowerbed so what's the area X minus 2 into 2 plus X that's the new area now multiply X into 2 2x X into X x squared minus 2 into 2 minus 4 and minus 2 into X minus 2 X so you get 2x and minus 2x get canceled out x squared minus miscellaneous exercise write an expression for the shaded area in the given figure and simplified so this is a composite figure so you can divide into two parts we'll divide from here so we can find out this rectangle and this rectangle then add so what's the area of this one and this one so we'll take the first one first area is X plus 3 into X 
,,plus 2 use foil x squared plus 2x + 3 X + 6 you get x squared plus 5x plus 6 now the second part X plus 1 and X plus 2 so you get x squared plus 2x plus 1 x + 2 you 
,,get x squared plus 3 X plus 2 now you have two areas what's the total area so total area is equal to add these two 1 and 2x squared plus 5x plus 6 plus x squared 3x 
,,plus 2x squared x squared 2x squared 5x + 3 X 8 X 6 + 2 8 another one so you asked to find out the shaded part so we can do subtract the small area from the bigger one so we can do shaded area is equal to what's the bigger one x + 18 2 X + 5 what's the small area so inside rectangle X plus 1 and X plus 2 now we will do separately and subtract x squared + 5 X + 8 X + 40 now subtract this one put brackets x squared + 2 X + 1 x + 1 times 2 that's 2 now subtract these two you get x squared + 8 
,,+ 5 13 x + 40 then subtract x squared is there 2 x + 1 X you get 3 x + 2 now expand bracket six squared plus 13x plus 40 minus x squared minus 3x minus 2 so x squared minus x squared 0 13 X and minus 3x you get 10 X 40 minus 2 you get 38 and the last question find the values of a and B so you have given this statement X plus a into X plus 4 is x squared plus BX plus 12 now we'll expand and see what you get on the right left hand side what you get on the left hand side x squared plus 4x plus a X + 4 that's given equals 2x squared B X plus 12 now we'll write down X term separately can take X out I can write 4 plus a plus 4a is equal to x squared plus BX 
,,plus 12 these two I equal so you can compare the coefficients ya X term X coefficient is 4 plus a what's the X coefficient there that's big what about this one constant term for a is equal to 12 from this you can find a substitute here and find B so divided by 4 a equals 12 divided by 4 that's 3 now substitute 3 here 4 plus 3 you get B so B equals 7 so a equals 3 and B equals 7 we covered all theory part in expanding brackets substituting values in algebraic expressions so practice all these exercises and examples and thorough week as you break expressions

AlgebraicExpression,CMK8cTOSilU,hello great 9 students today we will talk about another unit in your syllabus let's take number 12 can you write this number 12 as a product of two numbers so you can write one time another way of writing I can write this one as 2 times 6 again 3 times 4 then again 4 times 3 is same as 3 times 4 6 times 2 is same as 2 times 6 so what are these numbers we can write any number as a product of two numbers so we call these are factors so what are the factors of 12 if we can write down set off factors of 12 in this form so we can write curly brackets and write all the factors inside 1 2 3 4 6 and 12 so we can write number 12 in terms of these numbers we call these a factor so what's today's listen today's lesson is about factors so that's chapter 6 factors of algebraic expressions now you know how to find out the factors let's take number 24 what are the factors so starting from 1 1 times 24 again how can you write down 24 2 times 12 3 times 3 times 8 and 4 times 6 do we have now 
,,the factors again come 6 6 times 4 so when you write all the factors of 24 we can start from 1 you can write 2 3 4 6 8 12 and 24 so here you know I mean brackets so 
,,these are all called factors and again when you look at factors we can form another set that's called prime factors what are the prime factors in this set so what are the prime numbers 2 & 3 so I can write if you want prime factors I can write as 2 n 3 don't take 1 as a prime number the lowest prime number is 2 now we'll take algebra expressions now it's 3 how can you write down 3 I can write starting from 1 1 times 3 oh I can write 3 times then what are the factors in 3 I can write number 
,,1 and 3 a + 3 now we'll take 5 a B now try to write down all the factors starting from 1 1 times 5 a B then I can take number 5 then 5 times a B now I can combine with a letter and write 5a times 5a times B oh I can connect be with five and write five B times a then what are the factors in five maybe one five then I can write a 
,,B what is 5a 5b a B and 5e so I can't write factors of five baby all these numbers and expressions now we'll take this one find the common factor of the algebraic expressions a B and a C what is common mean common means belongs to both these expressions we'll try to do separately and see what's the common factor a B so already be is there I can write this - it a times B a B what about AC C is already there I can write a now compare these two what can you see you can see this one is common the common factor is written within the circle so what can you write about the common factor common factor is hey let's take this expression 2 ax + 6 X 5 now you need to be careful you have to take all factors and see what's common now if you take X only that's not the common factor sometimes you need to take two or more factors 
,,we can take X look at these two numbers 2 & 6 2 is common so we can take 2 as well so I can take instead of taking 1 X I can take two weeks out so 2x times either what about 6 X Y I can take 2x + 6 is 2 times 3 and y remain now can you see the common one inside the circle 2x is the common factor now we will take this one 7 XY + 
,,21 X Y Z so when you are trying to find our factors first look at number 7 and 21 what's common 7 is common so we can take 7 then look at carefully the letters X is 
,,there and why is there so we can't write 7 X Y in one part and what's the other one 7 X 1 7 X Y times 1 what about this mark if you take 7 X Y out have you get 21 this is 3z now can you see this one is the common bond for both expressions so what's the common factor 7 X take this one a squared B and a B squared so when you take 
,,this one what's common a letter is common B letter is common so we will take a B when you take a B 1 is remaining there when you take a B 1 B is remaining there so what's the common one common factor is a this one now you get three expressions try to find out the common bond for all three three six nine what's common we know that three is common X is there in all three expressions and Y is not there so we'll take three X out three x times y 3x times then how you get 6 3 times 2 so 2 Z so check again 3 X into 2 Z you get 6x z what about this mod when you take 3 X out to get 9 this is 3 and this is P now we see 3 X is common for all these three expressions that's called a common factor so common factor is 3x now in this one is slightly different so you are getting expressions now try a X plus y so this is one expression so that's a factor so I can write x plus y one expression into a here also X plus y is one expression into B so what's the common one there we can see the common one is this expression so you need to remember when you're trying to factors it can be just a number or letter or expression so I can take X plus y out so that's the common factor take this one X into 2 a plus B Y into 2 a plus B so what's common we'll take this one so I can write to a plus B into X here I can write to a plus 
,,B with what so what's common this is the common part so common factor is to a plus B another one now try a into X minus 2y B into X minus two my so these two expressions are the same so which one is the common you can easily get the common factor so we can see X minus 2y into a and here X minus 2y into B so what's the common one this one is the common you can write X minus 2y is the common factor not the one look at carefully a - to win into five p7q into a - tool five and seven there are no common factors PQ also not common so that means we can take a - to win with 5p here a - to win with 17 so we see this is the common factor this one another question a squared X - 3 1 b squared x - 3 by so a squared B squared no common factors we can write x -3 by into a squad in this one X -3 by into B Square so which one is common so the common factor is this one belongs to both these expressions so I can write X minus 3y is the common factor now we'll look at rules related to factor so 
,,we have to do three rules in this unit so we'll take the first one eliminate the common factor of the algebraic expression X plus a lie now eliminate means taking out so when you take these expressions you can take a letter out a is common so I can write taking a out a and then what's remaining when you take a out X is remaining from this one and the plus sign is there Y is remaining from the other one you can check again multiplying these two you need to get this far into X plus a into y ax plus IVA so we can take a letter out from this so that's the first rule when you get an expression taking one letter out from the expression so rule number one if 
,,there's two expressions like this one letter is common take it out so that's how you factorize now we'll use that rule in these examples look at carefully these two 
,,expressions what's common 7 and 14 a number is common there seven is common when you take seven out what's remaining X is remaining from this one and then the sign comes here 14 you already have taken seven out seven times two so this becomes two what about this one three six what's common P and Q both are not common so three take it out what's remaining P plus 6 you get 3 times 2 so this is 2 Oh cute this one a B a plus AC what's common is common take it out what's the remaining part B plus C look at carefully the next one 3 and minus MN m miss come on take it out 3 minus and here which one is common this common take it out so what you write here so when there's no number here means that's 1 so remember that X means 1 next when you take X out you can write 1 there 1 plus what this one a squared plus a B 1 is common check it out a plus B write down the below algebraic expressions as product of two factors so that means take the common letter or number out from these expressions now you have 3 so you have to do the same thing look at all three expressions and take the common 112 p 8q and for look at the numbers what's the common 1 4 4 8 12 4 is common check it out what's remaining 3 P minus 4 already taken from 8 so that's 2 and here I told you when only one number is there that means 4 times 1 so 4 
,,already taken you get one then this one 20x minus 15y 35 so what's common there 5 is common check it out remaining part you inside 4x3 by and this one m-miss come on take it out the remaining part 7m minus 2 and here and this one only come on take it out a plus B minus C this one eight six three there are no common numbers only 
,,X you can take so 8 X 6 Y and when you take X out that's 3 Z what about this one he is common when you take a out this is a B squared + C squared remain so that's how we factorize when you get three expressions and only one letter or number is common now look at this one write down a 2x + y + 2 b x + y algebraic expression as product of two factors okay we'll take separation in this one a into x plus y so you can write the two factors like this what about this one - b into x + 5 so we can write 2 B into X plus 5 now what's the common factor we can see this is the common bond for both expressions so here you get an expression is common so you can take it out so that's the second rule so in second rule you can take one expression out so what we do when you get a into X plus y 2 B into X plus y this X plus y you can 
,,check it out we can take X plus y out and write down the remaining part inside the other bracket so a plus 2b so that's the second rule so remember that first rule says you can take a letter or number just one here you can take an expression out from the algebraic expressions now we'll try to use that theory in these expressions so eliminate the common factor and write down the below expressions as product of two factors so when you look at these two expressions we can see a minus B is common so make sure that you put brackets and the remaining part also you have to write inside brackets when you take a minus B out this becomes X and this is three bar 
,,so X plus three by this one what's comma the whole expression is common a plus seven is common take it out what's remaining two P Q this one tryna X minus y is common take it out the remaining parties is God plus this one what's common this one is common so 2 plus 7y is common take it out and write down the rim look at carefully this one P minus 2q is common check it out and write down the remaining part 7 M plus N squared this one what's common X minus 3 5x minus 3y take it out and the remaining part 11 a plus 3b insert several questions are there related to that so try to do those M plus n is common what's remaining to be minus 11 Q here also X minus 3y common and 7 plus 8 M is the remaining part always the same here comes so a plus 2b when you take it out what you get x squared plus y squared this is also this 
,,is common to P plus 3 is common take it out and then remaining part you write inside now will look like this one now what happens earlier you got two expressions now you have four expressions so how we do that how we try to find out the common factor when you get four terms so we'll take two at a time we'll take first two separately and the next two separately so I can write in here X plus a I and this one is B X plus B bar then you take this expression what's common is come and take it out and then I can write x plus y there this one B is common I can take it out and write X plus y now try to write down factors so what are the factors of this X plus y and in this one X plus y and so what's the common factor so common factor for both is X plus so here the common factor is X plus y what's the other two terms are the two terms are the end here B now you are learning the third rule what's that when you get four terms you can take two at a time and then factorize again when four 
,,"terms are found take two terms at a time and find a factor so here take these two separately these two separately factorize and then finally you will end up with two expressions again the car take the common factor out X plus y is , take it out and you can write down remaining part as a plus take this question factorize so when "
,,you are factorize you have to take two terms at once so when you take these two take 5 out 5 is comma take it out remaining parties X plus 2 1 now a is common plus say take it out what's remaining X plus 2 1 now X plus 2 y is common take it out and the remaining part that's 5 plus you write in the other bracket this one when you take these 2 is common what's the remaining part B plus C these 2 Plus 3 is comments then B plus C so B plus C is common check it out what's the remaining part a plus 3 now look at this one positive so when you take first 2 a is common take it out what's remaining if last 3 these 2 plus 5 is common take it out you get a plus 3 
,,now a plus 3 is common take it out and the remaining part you write in the other bracket if last high look at this one I'll take this one as negative so when you take these two what's common is common so what's remaining B minus C so here 3 is common which one we need to take plus 3 or negative 3 plus 3 when you take you get the same term B minus C now we can see B minus C is common take it out and the remaining part that's a plus 3 in the other bracket look at this one when you take first 
,,2 is common take it out the remaining part is 3 plus Q now what - so we need to get minus sign out - a it's common so what's remaining 3 plus Q now again 3 plus Q is common take it out q what's remaining B - hey these ones from these two a is common take it out this is X plus minus minus so I can take minus 9 out then this becomes plus inside - x plus becomes minus X plus y into a - this one when you take two at a time is come and take it out a minus 2 there which one is common there what we take minus or plus look at carefully when you take plus X out what's remaining X minus plus 6 out you get a minus 2 so then we can see a minus 2 is common so be careful when you have one positive and one negative sometimes you need to take the minus out sometimes not so in this case you don't need to take - out you can write x + X and then a minus 2 is remained then a minus 2 is common and you can write this as a plus X this one you take these two out so what's common this one I can take 
,,X out l- then this one which one we can take - 7 o + 7 so think about this minus sign in the first place if you take - out you are getting -7 out you are getting ill - f that's what we need not a - L other way around so you have to get the same factor in the first one to factorize further so we can take - 7 out what's remaining 
,,there this is L - so what's common now it'll minus M is common check it out the remaining part is X - so in this one just I have given two expressions just to see you can take either plus or minus sometimes you can just take the positive number sometimes you can take that negative one so here if you take Elm out what's remaining - seven in this one if you take minus M out what should be there - seven right because minus into minus becomes plus seven so when you ask to find out the common factor if you if you take just Ament seven you can't find out common factor so that's why so you need to be tricky so to get plus it can be both - so em if you take em that's seven positive into positive positive button to get the common factor there you need to take minus MN minus seven then we can see minus seven is common so in this one what's the common ones - now the next one find the factors of the following algebraic expressions a X plus B by plus a y plus B X now we discussed when you have four terms you take first two separately and the next two separately but what happens here when you take first two separately you can't see any common factors 
,,what we can do there we can interchange the terms so that we get factors now B by and ax no common term so I can switch this term here and this term there because X 
,,is common there so I'll switch that so first term I can write as it is instead of B by I can take this term here BX then a by and I can write this term there now see whether you can apply the previous rule rule number three when you take these two separate here and these two separately you can see that now X is common take it out and you can write this as a plus B what about this one plus wise they gain a plus now a plus B is come on take it out and write down this as X plus so when you can't factorize the first two what you do interchange the terms so the factors can be found by interchanging terms now here also AP and 6q there are no common terms so 
,,what we do I can take a queue there so write down that AP plus EQ now this term here and six feet already there and I can write 6q last take first two is common check it out then V plus key remain then this one plus six is common take it out and P plus Q is remain then P plus Q take it out and the remaining part is a plus six so that's how we factorize now take this one also three a and B X can you find factors you can't find factor so what you do you interchange these two this so I can rewrite this as 3 a + ax and three b + PX then take us two separately and the last two separate yet factorize what's common there a is common when you take a out 3 plus X is remaining from these 2 B is common three plus six remain no three plus six is common so you can take 3 plus 6 out and write down the remaining factor inside so you'll get 3 plus into a plus B now we need to talk about factors of trinomial quadratic expressions so you're learning three terms trinomial tri means three by means to try means three so something about treat quadratic expression what are cod Hritik expressions have you heard about that this word quadratic means when you get 
,,maximum power is two we call those are contracting expressions so in this expression you get three terms that's why it's trinomial why this is quadratic you get power to so there are three terms to this expression as X square term is there this is a quadratic expression so we are trying to factorize when you get three terms with a square term so when three terms of x squared plus five x plus six are converted to four terms can factorize by taking two at a time so we did three rows what's the third one when you get four terms take two terms at once and factorize but three terms there so if we can't split one term to two you get four terms so that's our 
,,idea how can we factorize trinomials three terms you split into four terms so how you're going to do that so this is the method so step number one is here take first you have to write in order square term first and X term then and the constant term third and what we do we multiply first and the last term's x squared into six what you get 6x squared here the sign is important so plus sign so you need to observe the sign so you are getting plus 6x squared then what you do you are trying to find out factors of 6 X square so we'll first look at the number what are the factors of 6 we know that's 1 into 6 2 into 3 that's all so try to find out the factors and then what you do when you multiply here when you add these two can you get the middle term 1 & 6 both positive so what 4 plus 1 and plus 6 you get plus 7 but the 
,,middle term is plus 5 so you can't take 1 & 6 so what about 2 & 3 2 + 3 you get 5 so first you need to identify when you add the factors are we catching the middle term yes we are getting the middle term by these two factors so that means these are the correct expressions so how can you write 6x squared I can write 2x into 3x not just 2 times 3 you get 6 so 6x squared means 2x times 3x then when you add the factors 2x and 3x you are getting 5 X so what we do when you get quadratic trinomial quadratic expressions you are splitting the middle term into two parts so I can rewrite this as x squared instead of 5x I can write plus 2x + 3 X now we get four terms take two at a time and factorize X is common take it out it's plus two is remaining three is common take it out again X plus two is remaining now X plus two is common take it out so what's what's the remaining part X plus three so what's the step first multiply the first and the last and try to find out all factors and how you select the correct factors when you add the factors you need to get the mediator so here this expression both are pluses all three terms are pluses now we'll look at these expressions now we have to we get same type of questions all positive so how can we factorize rearrange it already they are x squared 7 X term and the constant 12 into x squared 12 x squared what's the sign positive sorry what are the factors of 12 1 into 12 2 into 6 3 into Oh now select the appropriate factors what's 
,,the suitable one to get 7 how can we split 7 1 and 12 can you do that No 2 & 6 you can't because you get 8 3 & 4 so that means you can drive this is 3 x + 4 X so this is the ofoh these are the appropriate factors so 3 X + 4 X so I can split 7 X into 3x + 4 X now take two at a time and Trice when you take X out you get X plus 3 there when you take 4 you get X plus 3 because 4 times 3 12 now X plus 3 is common you take it out then you get X plus now try this one a squared plus 8 a plus 50 so 
,,when you multiply these two you get plus 15 a square so the sign is positive what are the factors of 15 1 15 3 times 5 what is those are the factors now see how you 
,,get the middle term 8 a can we take 1 and 15 no we have to take 3 & 5 because 3 + 5 8 so this is a squared so you need three eight times five ways so these are the two factors appropriate to this one so I can split 8a using that 3 & 5 a take two at a time and factorize is comma and take it out a plus 3 is remaining five and fifteen plus five is comma and take it out and a plus three also remaining then a plus 3 again come on take it out and you can write the remaining part inside brackets so the factors are a plus 3 and a plus now try these ones similar wave all these pluses x squared into 18 18 x squared this is plus what are the factors of 18 always 
,,"start from 1 and C then 2 with 9 3 with 6 those are the factors now select the suitable factors is it 1 and 18 or 2 & 9 Oh three and six which one two one nine two plus nine is so we have to select this one so how can you write 18x squared this is 2 X n 9 X now we'll split the middle term - 2 X + 9 X take two at a time and factorize X's , and take it out that's X plus 2 9 is , and take it out that's X plus No X plus 2 is common what's the remaining part X plus this one amen 14 M squared + 14 40 mm M square factors of 14 one with 42 with 7 those are the factors which one is suitable to get 9 2 & 7 so we can write two women 7 M both positive so I can't split instead of 9m that's 2 M + 7 name now take two at a time and factorize I can take em out and the remaining part inside brackets here 7 out and you get same thing in + 2 M plus 2 when you take it out M plus 7 is remaining these ones now in this one can you see the number first but this is also in order square term then the middle one is there it's just the simple one without the square term and a constant so you can do this way as well no need to rewrite the square term first same thing 16 times P squared plus 16 P Square what are the factors of plus 16 sign is important this is plus 16 plus 16 times plus 1 16 times 1/2 times 8 4 times Oh now which one is suitable for + 4 8 16 and 1 17 so you need to select that select these two factors to 1/8 so this becomes 2 p + 8 P this botha positive now we can split the "
,,middle term to 2p + 8 take two at a time rule number three now when you get four terms take two at a time and factorize take two out - his comments you get 8 + P when you take P out you get 8 plus P okay they need + P take it out you get 2 + now what's the difference you get a negative sign so here positive negative positive what's the earlier one something positive something again positive now what's the pattern here squared term positive the middle term negative and the last term positive now we'll see how we can do when the signs are different the middle term of the expression is now - 7e not +7 e but you follow the same procedure a squared + 12 you get positive 12 a squared so you need positive 12 but when you add the factors you need to get minus 7e so how can you get positive values and when you add you need to get negative values first we'll write down factors factors of 12 1 and 12 to 6 and 3/4 but you can take plus into plus as well but we know that negative times negative is positive so if we put negative money into negative 12 you get positive 12 negative 2 into negative 6 again positive 12 so either you can take both pluses or both minuses in this case you need to take minus value because when you add 3 & 4 you get plus 7 but we need minus 7 so you need to take minus 3 and minus 4 minus 
,,3 minus 4 you get minus 7 so these are the two appropriate factors so yeah you need a square yard.this is 3 and minus 4 now we can split the middle term minus 3 minus 4 plus 12 take two at a time and factorize a a minus 3 know which one we take you can take plus 4 or minus 4 if you take plus 4 what happens you are getting minus 
,,ay inside but we need plus a so always check the previous factor so we need to take minus 4 out to get a here if you take minus our this becomes minus 3 now we get same factor a minus 3 and what's the remaining 1 a minus now we'll apply that in these examples middle term is negative but the last term is positive 12x squared one 
,,and 12 just one factor what are the other factors to with six three with this is plus but the minute term is negative means you need to take both negatives minus eight how you get minus 8 minus 2l minus six so these are the two appropriate factors so you can write 2x + 6 X so split the middle term into - 2 X - 6 x + 2 and take two at a time so when you take X out this is X - 2 which one we take minus 6 or + 6 you need to get positive X inside so we need to take - six out X minus 2 so X - 2 
,,is there X minus 6 this one plus 14y Square 1 and 14 and what are the other factors 2 + 7 that's all middle term is minus 9 definitely we know that both should be - 
,,and to get Y squared this should be both wise so minus 2 y x - 7 y you get 14 y square now split the middle term take two at a time and factorize take Y out the remaining fact Y minus 2 here we have to take minus seven now to get positive y ya then this becomes minus 2 so y minus 2n y minus 7 this one all the terms in order square term then the single term and the constant 16 M square what are the factors 1 and 16 2 with 8 4 & 4 middle term is negative 10 so we have to select the appropriate one so to get M Square and this should be M na minus 2 m and minus 8 mu get minus 10 so you are we are splitting the middle term into 2 minus 2 m minus 8 M plus 16 tape 2 at a time I'm out you get a minus 2 yeah take minus 8 out - - because minus 8n - Joe you get plus 16 M minus 2 there come on what's the remaining 1 - 8 this 
,,one P squared into 30 30 P Square what are the factors of 31 and 32 with 15 3 with 10 can we get 4 no then that's odd what about 6 6 times 5 so that means I can write pi times 6 when you go in order I can write 5 times 6 so those are the factors but the middle term is negative both numbers should be negative what are the suitable want to get 17 - 17 I can take 2 and 15 this boat should be negative this is P and P they are to get P squared now let's play the middle term minus 2p minus 15 B 30 day two at a time now do it take P out what's remaining P minus 2 here which one we take minus 15 you can take to get plus P P minus 2 P minus 2 into P minus 30 now what happens when you get different factors here can you proceed no that means something wrong with your previous step so make sure you need to get the same factor to proceed further this one the constant first and the square term last so you don't need to rearrange it what are the factors of 16 Y square factors of 61 16 to wait for for what are the suitable ones to get minus 10 minus 2 n minus 8 and this becomes Y n Y now I'm splitting the middle term minus 10 by 2 minus 2 y and minus 8y take 2 at a time and factorize what's common there 2 is common and I can write 8 minus 5 in this 1 minus y is common 8 minus y minus into minus is plus now we get same factor so 8 minus y and the other one is too - why some more questions try 21 with y square 21 y square what are the factors of 21 1 with 21 3 with 7 and you the middle term is minus 10 we can't take 1 and 21 so definitely we know these two both mega- and we can write wise as well spread the middle term and factorize by taking two at a time this one you can take 3 out and the remaining part 7 minus y this one you can take Y out are we taking - yr plus y out we need plus 7 so we need to 
,,take minus y out 7 - why Cemil - why is comma and take it out the remaining part is 3 - what this one K squared into 15 so 15 K square factors of 15 1 15 3 5 now we 
,,need to select appropriate factors to get minus 60 so 1 + 15 you get 16 so this both should be negative to get negative 16 here so K squared you get minus 1 KN minus 15 K split the middle term you don't you can write 1 K or without one also correct take two at a time man factorize take K out K minus one is there yeah that's why 
,,it's important to write one if you take K out you are getting one there yeah we can take -15 out the remaining part is K minus one so K minus one is common take it out the remaining part is K minus 15 and also you can multiply and see whether you are getting the previous expression so here K into K likewise you can check with the yawns is correct factors of 48 what are the factors are 48 one with 48 two with 24 three with 16 and 4 with 12 so likewise you can write down factors but no need to write down all if we can find out at once - 19 how we get 19 from these two by ID adding the numbers because we saw that if it's minus and then plus you need both 
,,- so we can select the we can select 3 and 16 as the factors to get 19 both should be - to get + 48 so split the middle term into minus 3h and minus 16 H take 2 at a time when you take it out you get h minus 3 here you need to take -16 out to get plus h then minus 3h minus 3 is common take it out and write X minus H minus 60 factors of 32 now to get minus 18 one with 32 two with 16 here when you are trying to find our factors just see whether you get this number we see that already it's there so you don't need to find all factors we can see 2 and 16 becomes 18 this should be minus 2 MN minus 16 so the factors are -2 ml - 16 M now take two at a time and factorize stick em out you get a minus 2 there when you take -16 out a minus 2 okay now a minus 2 is come on let's take it out and write down the remaining fact that M minus 16 this one you need 19 years squared what are the factors of 1919 is a prime number so in prime numbers you can't find other factors always 1 net itself so 1l 19 we are getting 19 and 120 so both should be negative and this is minus 1 in length - 19 split the middle term into one meal and 19 years take two at a time and factorizes please come and take it out you get L minus 1 it's good to write 1 then you can easily see when you take a lout the remaining part is 1 your 19 - 19 when you take that's ill - 1 so L minus 1 is common take it out L minus 19 is remaining now what's the change the middle term is plus and the last term is negative so 
,,so far what are the things we did we did all terms positive second one we did middle term negative but the last term is positive now we are trying to learn how to factorize when the middle is positive and the last term is negative so same procedure you multiply the first and the last but now you are getting minus 18x squared earlier both cases these two you got plus as the final valid now you are getting minus 18 first without considering the sign what are the factors of 81 and 82 with 9 3 
,,with 6 now just check this is not about adding now because to get minus one number should be positive and the other one should be negative so one positive one negative and the product you get negative and how do you get the middle term now the middle term is +7 positive value if we take plus 9 and minus 2 you can get +7 so in this case when you get a negative on what we do try to try out the factors the bigger number should be positive to get +7 you need plus 9 and minus 9 minus 2 so first 
,,select the appropriate one and put plus father bigger factor so here minus 18x squared is obtained when multiplying the first term and the final term since the middle term is plus 7x the larger factor of both factors must be positive now we can split so to get x squared this should be X and X now I can split 7 X into minus 2 XL 
,,plus 9 X take 2 at a time when you take a South you get X minus to take plus nine out X minus two here we need to take plus because X first that's positive x minus 2 is common take it out and the remaining part we write ya now we'll apply that rule in these examples now we can see the middle term is plus and the last one is negative so when you multiply always you get a negative value so negative 10 a square so factors of 10 110 to 5 and then to get +3 one should be plus and 1 should be negative but the bigger number should be positive so when you select this one this is plus and this is minus plus 5 and minus 2 you are getting plus 3 then this is a so that's how we find out the appropriate factors so a squared minus 2a and +5 it take two at a time and factorize when you franchise you get a minus 2 when you take plus five this is a minus 2 again a minus 2 is common take it out and write V plus 5 next one minus 30 be square factors of minus 31 32 with 15 3 with 10 think about 
,,without writing can you get the middle term 7 plus 7 definitely not with want 1 and 32 with 15 you are not getting 3 with gel you're getting server so we can think about 3n +7 means the bigger number is plus and the smaller one is negative to get B squared both should be peace now we can't split the middle term 2 minus 3b plus 10t Plus 2 and last row separately here we can take me out this one you can take 10 out now B minus 3 is common and here V Plus now try to find out the factors at once -20 C square what are the factors of 21 and 22 with 10 now c2 with tail are we getting it yes so two with 10 the middle term is positive means the bigger number is positive and they're smaller one is negative to get C squared this should be C and C now let's pick the middle term minus 2c plus 10 C minus 20 take two at a time take C out you get to C minus 2 plus 10 out you get C minus 2 then C minus 2 is common what's remaining c plus now here the constant term is first doesn't matter as long as the this term in the middle it's okay you can get this for R term first all last minus 12 P Square middle term is plus 4 think about factors one with 12 2 with 6 2 with 6 you can get 4 so I'm not writing all factors now I'm writing appropriate one to at six but plus four is there this is plus and minus so to get P squared this is PE n now I can't split the middle term okay two at a time and factorize you can take two out you get 6 minus P plus P there are six minus P 6 minus fields come on remaining one plus this one 21 minus K squared minus 21 K squared what's the suitable one to get for one with 21 3 with 7 3 & 7 you are getting 4 so 3 with 7 
,,plus 4 means this is Plus this is minus and to get case come on it should be case now you can do fast you don't need to write down all factors at sea we are you get 
,,plus 4 now take two at a time threes comment there 7 minus k plus K is common and you get 7 minus K so 1 minus K it's comma and take it out you get 3 plus K now what happens in this one the term is also negative and also the constant term is also negative so we'll revise what we did we did oh positive then we did middle term positive negative and the last term positive and the third one we did middle term positive and the last term negative now we are doing middle term negative as well as Laster negative so in this case you got all positive this is a middle term negative this is last term negative now you are getting middle term and last term both are 
,,negative so what we do same procedure when you multiply first and the last you get minus 10 May square this is also minus like previous one factors of minus 10 to get minus 3 think about factors one with chain 2 with 5 2 & 5 relates to 3 so we'll write 2 & 5 now what happens is this is a nd middle term is negative means you need to get the bigger one negative negative 5 and plus 2 you get negative 3 so middle term is negative means select the bigger one negative so he'll say the middle term is negative 3a the larger factor of both factors must be negative so we can use that one to split the middle term C squared minus first we'll write plus to a minus 
,,B minus T here don't think that I can in this one here you can write minus five way first and then write to a you get the same answer so don't worry about which one 
,,to write first you can write any two factors first if you can't see the factors then what you do you can interchange the terms when you take first two you get a that's a plus two minus five common for both so I can take minus five out then you get a plus 2 a plus two is common and you get a minus so in this case also when negative is in the middle term you have to select the larger factor negative now we'll use that one to factorize now straight away we will try to find out the factors without writing all -12 factors of 12 to get 4 1 12 to 6 to 6 you get four middle term is negative means bigger number should be negative this is 6 6 n minus 6 X + 2 X so x squared + 2 X - 6 6 - 12 when you take first 2 you get X X plus 2 when you take - out - 6 6 - 6 out you get X plus X plus 2 X minus 6 this want to get minus 20y 
,,squared the middle term - 8 1 + 22 with 10 to tell you get 8 so 2 + 10 y middle term is negative means the bigger one is negative split the middle term I can write the 10 Y first as well we'll do that it was always I took the smaller one first but you don't need that take first - and you can see why is common when you take 2 out you get Y minus 10y minus 10 is common take it out and write down the remaining factor y + 2 this 1 minus 22 factors of - 22 1 with 22 you are not getting 9 - with 
,,11 to any level you are getting so - with 11 - means in the middle bigger one is - and this is positive so you can write this one and the middle term - 2 Z minus 11 
,,see take two at a time and factorize then you take Z out that's the plus two minus eleven out that's Z plus 2z + 2 is common and you get Z minus eleven this one - 20 M Squared when you mod their first and the last middle term is - it means this is minus one name factors of 21 with 22 with ten and four with five four and five differences one and the middle term is negative means bigger number is negative and this is positive select the middle term and take two at a time and factorize so I'll take four plus four out you get em - but so a minus 5 into M plus 4 this one h squared into - 26 - 26 H square one with 26 - with 13 - and 13 you get 11 this is minus 11 you'd have to take the difference so - for the larger number and this is positive splitting the middle term 2 plus 2 H and minus 13 H ok first two terms you get H comma when you take these two you can take minus 13 out and h plus 2 is common and h minus 13 remaining this one again quadratic me all these are trinomial quadratic expressions three terms and the square term is there - 30 M Squared 1 and 32 with 15 you need - 13 so - with 15 the middle term is negative so the bigger number larger number negative and this one is positive here K squared into 30 not M square so this should be k squared so k k is there now split the middle term K squared 
,,+ 2 k + -15 K then you take first two plus two when you take - 15 now that's K + 2 k plus 2 is common and K minus 15 is remain now look at this one write the following algebraic expressions they're squared terms now slightly different so you have given expressions then you are asked to write as square terms so what can you see about these numbers for 16:9 25 49 64 ol square numbers 2 times 2 4 4 times 4 16 so we can easily write in terms of a square number x squared is already there so for I can write 2 times 2 if I write 2x whole thing squared you get the same thing 2 times 2 for X into X x squared so final answer is 4x squared so this is a square term so this is the expression and you get a square term now try this one 16 P squared how can you write as a square term 16 means 4 times 4 so I can write 4p whole thing square 9m squared 3 m whole thing square 25 is 5 times 5 5h whole thing square 49 7 times 7 7 else whole thing square 64 means a times eight 8k whole thing square 36 6 times 6 6 P squared + 81 means 9 times 9 9 a whole thing's crap now we know how to write down any expression as a square term right as difference between two 
,,squared terms difference means subtraction you have given two expressions and both we need to write as square terms x squared already a square term you can write as 
,,it is minus 4y squared we read that before 4 is 2 times 2 so I can write 2y whole thing square so difference between means this is negative so 2 squared terms with minus sign in the middle in the next one 9 minus a squared 9 how can you write as a square term 3 squared and a squared already yeah this 125 5 squared + 4 a squared 
,,4 is 2 times 2 so I can write 2 a whole thing square this 116 4 times 4 so this is 4 8 whole thing squared + 9 is 3 and 3 so 3 B whole thing's 81 9 times 9 9 X whole thing squared 49 means 7 into 7 7 y whole thing square 36 means 6 times 6 right like this and 121 is can you remember square terms square numbers 11 times 11 seventh one a squared B squared I can write a B whole things got 64 times 4 so 4 squared x squared is also square so I can write as it is and 144 is 12 times 12 12 square 
,,this one 4 is 2 times 2 so I can drive to Y whole thing square 81 is 9 times 9 16 again a square number 4 times 4 169 so you need to know square terms 2 times 2 4 3 
,,times 3 9 4 times 4 16 so like that 169 is 13 times 13 13 Q squared so in this one we did writing any expression in terms of difference between two squared terms now look at this one find the factors of the difference between two squared terms now you have given this one a square term is they are in a constant term what's missing when you compare with trinomials we got three terms one a squared and the next one should be hater now nothing means you can take the middle term as zero so we can rewrite this question as a squared plus 0 a minus four and proceed as before like factorizing trinomials will do that a times minus four minus four square a square 
,,factors of -4 and the middle term is 0 so 2 well 2 2 a and 2 way but both are the same so one is positive and one is negative when you add you are getting 0 a now we will try to split that 0 you can write plus 2 a and minus 2 a and when you take the first 2 separately you get a plus 2 and here are negative sign and 2 is common a plus 2 then a plus 2 come on you get a minus 2 so this is a long process when now you have two terms but when you are trying with zero term in the middle it takes time so what we can do we can find out an easy way so I'll explain when you get two terms how we can factorize now we'll take the same question a squared minus 4 here a squared term and here 4 is also square term now can you see that we can rewrite this as 2 squared difference between two squared terms so a squared + 2 squared so when you get two squared terms what we do we can write two factors like this and think about how you get a squared that's a and a how you get 4 that's 2 and 2 so you write down the factors and one factor is positive and one factor is negative so that's really easy when you get two terms and both terms are square terms so what you call that difference between two squared terms when you get difference between two squared terms you can write the first one here and the last one for you get to 
,,enter so this number so when you write down the square term these two comes yeah and one is minus and the other one is positive now we can factorize all these using 
,,difference between two squared terms 16 first you have to write as a square term 16 is 4 times 4 so I can write as 4 square what's the next step then put two brackets x squared is X and X this is 4 and 4 one is positive and one is negative so you can switch this factor first and this one last so one factor is always positive and the other one is negative so in this one 49 you can write 7 squared so what are the factors why why this is -7 + +7 this one 36 you can write 6 squared so 6 first and then P so what are the factors 6 minus PN 6 plus B now try to factorize using difference between two square terms first thing you have to write a square terms 7a 
,,whole thing square R and 5b whole things well then easy you write 787 in first and the second term is 5 B 1 is negative and one is positive this one 81 9x whole thing squared 49 7y whole thing square now write down the 2 well it's 9x here and seven by one is positive and one is negative this one try 144 12x whole thing square twelve times twelve hundred forty four five and five twenty five how do you write down the factors with two brackets first term here and then last term here and one is positive other one is negative now it's easy two terms you can end both are square terms if both are square terms you can apply this not for all factorization 11y whole things crash then you can straight away write 9x and then other term is eleven by one is positive and the other one is negative some more questions a squared B 
,,squared I can write a B whole thing square 25 five C squared so when you take the difference a B first and five C next one means positive one is negative this one 121 is 11 P whole thing square 49 is 7 Q whole thing square so how you write down the factors p 7q one is positive and a other one is negative what about this one right as a square term 4x whole thing squared and 13 my whole thing squared right down the tube records first term first and the last second one is positive one is negative here also write as a square term a B whole thing square and C D whole thing square one is positive one is negative so here we use difference between two squared 
,,terms now what happens can you write down this as a square term - a square - is not a square number what we do there when you get something like this with two numbers we can take the common one out so eliminate the common factor two first then what you get when you eliminate that one so we will take the same question I'm taking 
,,two out two is common a squared - 25 now but we know 25 is a square number now we can use difference between two squared terms I can rewrite this as a squared and five squares now - is there what are the factors of this a a here five five one is positive and one is negative so it's easy when you get extra term try to eliminate that and then think about applying difference between two square terms in this one what's common I can see a you can take it out then you get a squared - 49 both these are squared numbers you can apply difference between two squared terms I can write this one as plus 7 n minus 7 now try to factorize these ones you can take the common term out I can take 4 out what's remaining 25 y squared and here for is there I can write what's the before that I'll write down there when you take 4 out I can write this as a square term so 25 5 into 5 so 5 by whole things square now write down the factors X X X is the term I don't take the square term 5 by is the other term then this is plus and this is negative in this one what's common I can take 4 out when you take four that's 4 a squared minus 4 times 9 9 B squared now 4 & 9 both are square terms I can write this is as to a whole thing squared and this one has 3 B whole thing squared then take the difference between two squared terms for is or we they are the two factors are two we plus 3 B and 2a minus 3b so you have to do this step to identify the factors so you have to write down square terms and then we take these two terms this one X is common take it out 4x squared minus 9 y squared and then write as a square term 2x whole thing squared and 3 by whole things square then apply difference between two square terms 2x + 3 y + 2 X - 3 well how we do this one right as a square term I can write this one as a square squared whole thing square B 4 how can you write B squared whole things square now apply difference between two squared terms a squared plus B squared and a squared minus B Square can you factorize further plus one we can't when you get to square term with plus we don't know how to factorize but we know the difference between two square terms that that means when you get square terms with minors we know how to factorize so you can factorize a squared plus B squared here again you can factorize one is 
,,positive the other one is negative so in your plus billion a minus B so if you do up to this point you are getting half marks so you need to factorize completely find the value using factor knowledge look at these two 7.5 is common take it out what's remaining 2.7 and 7.3 now we can simplify inside brackets so 7.5 times addition of these two numbers 7 + 3 10 7 + 2 9 and 10 so you get to just multiply this by 10 it's easy move the decimal place one place to right so you like 75 as it what about this one look at carefully 9.3 is common check it out what's remaining three-putt 9.3 so this is three point five and six point no add these two you get ten one 
,,remaining 6 plus 3 8 6 plus 3 9 9 plus 1 again just multiply by 10 nine point three times ten nice now using factorization method you can find out values otherwise you have to multiply all these decimals and then add it so which one is easy use this method again twelve point five is common take it out what's remaining twelve point five and here minus two point five now the subtraction so what's 12 point five minus two point five you get ten so ten times twelve point five you move one place 
,,to the right the answer is hundred twenty-five this one you get two squared terms apply the difference between two squared terms one means plus and the other one is 
,,"negative when you add these two get fifty then what about this one when you subtract you get four four times 50 that's two hundred so it's easy to apply the difference between two squared terms to find the answers this one difference between two squared terms so I can write one factor positive one factor negative so when you add these two you get 200 what's the subtraction you get 6 so 6 times 200,000 200 in this one also you get difference between two squared terms so one is positive one is negative then when you add these two you get 10 multiplied when you subtract you get five five times ten Yonsei is 50 look at this one now you get how many expressions one two three four what's that rule number three when you get four expressions take two at a time and factorize these two we'll check what's the common 12.3 is "
,,calm take it out what's remaining four point five and five point five when you take class to seven point seven is common you get four point five and five point five 
,,now when you add what you get two point three yeah this is same four point five plus five point five you get ten you know also you get 10 now we see ten is comma and check it out what's remaining 20.3 yen seven point seven now when you add these two what you 7 + 3 10 and 10 again 10 times 10 you get 100 so as there are four terms take two terms at a time and factors this one how many terms are there 1 2 or 3 4 so we'll follow the same procedure we'll take these two and these 28.7 is common 
,,"take it out what's remaining 4.6 l 5 points from this you can take 1.3 out what's remaining four point six and five point four no and these two 6 plus 4 10 five plus four so you get 10 here what about this one same thing so you get 10 now two expressions 10 is common take it out what's remaining eight point seven and one point three so 10 times what's the addition 10 times 10 you get now we'll look at review exercise in your textbook so you need to know how to factorize expressions just normal expressions and then we did trinomials and then difference between two squared terms right each of the following algebraic expressions as a product of factors so you have to take the common term out L write down the remaining part inside brackets what's common here 8 and 12 will see 4 is common take it out remaining part you write insult this one 9 and 18 9 is , take it out remaining part a plus 2y inside brackets 3 M plus 6 3 is common take it out so 6 is 3 times 2 so you get M plus 2 "
,,20 and 30 10 is common to a minus 3b this one for his comma P minus 5 5 Q so 4 times 5 you get minus 24 times minus 5 you get minus twenty twelve and four I can take fallout 3 - ok this one no three expressions three terms are they are so C common for all three three is common take it out the remaining part you write inside brackets 3 times 5 you get 5 B 3 times 12 minus 8 4 4 is common 3 8 minus 2 B plus 1 because I can write this one as 4 times 1 9 minus 3 minus 6 3 is common 3 minus B minus 2 C so you get 9 minus 3b minus 6 see these two you can take forward or minus 4 does not matter you can take any term so I look like I can take 4 out you get minus 3x inside plus y all I can't change the terms and write down by minus 3x same answer - - both they are that means common for both - for we'll take it out then you get this one in plus P this one which one we can take either minus or plus we take minus three out if you take minus 3 this becomes positive - - because - - you get positive take a out remaining part B plus C you can take P out and then not P there what's the value here one because just P means 1 P 1 minus Q 3 terms are there a is common take it out b + c - take this 1 3 you can take it out and also x is common so we can take 3x out so what's remaining this becomes 1 plus 2 what what about this one B is command + 3 so 3 B you can take it out you can write 2 a minus 3 C multiply and see whether you get the term 3 B 2 minus 3 C you get minus 9 PC here for P you can take it out for P that means a plus B minus 1 because 4 P when you take it out one is remaining in this one you can take X out you get x squared + 2 em 
,,you can take it out 3-2 in in remaining this one six is also common is also common I can take six six out six is out that means one - two 1s and one T example number one factorize 3x plus 6y plus KX plus 2k y four terms what's the method take two at a time and factorize from these two I can take three out you get X plus 2y from 
,,these two I can take plus K out X plus two now we see X plus 2y is common and then the remaining part you write inside brackets example number two similar way four terms you can take first two and last two separately if you take this one you can take a out so a minus three is there when you take B out a minus three there so a minus three is common what's remaining a plus B example number three see a method X is comma and take it out you get X plus y now what happens both - you can take - one out because XY only one is common take one out you get X plus one X plus y and the remaining part X minus one exercise six point one factorize each of the following algebraic expressions of so you get four terms take two at a time he's common you get X plus y last three is common X plus y so X plus YN EI plus three nice two is common you get X minus eight here plus three is common then you get X minus eight so X minus eight ten a plus three what about these two Emmys come on take it out you get P minus Q minus n so which one we take - a no plus in you need positive P so we'll take minus n P minus Q P minus Q and a - this one which one is common in his common take it out get K Plus both negative you can take negative B out k plus L you are getting so k plus L is comment and the remaining part is B minus P this one take two at a time and factorize X take it out you'll get X plus four when you take minus three Y out that's X plus four again X plus four is common remaining part you write separately this one when you take these two Y is come and take it out Y minus 7 so in this one do we take minus 2 or plus 2 you take minus 2 to get positive by inside this becomes minus because minus minus becomes so y minus 7 and y minus 2 this one again take two at a time and see whether you can factorize here is comma and take it out this one too is common you get same thing a minus eight and plus two this one B you can check it out B plus 5 minus - you can take minus 2 out you get positive here because positive into negative is negative so B plus 5 and B minus 2 this one okay two at a time and factorize here or so two at a time and actress this one 5 is comma take it out when you take five this is one one plus six here minus y will take it out then this becomes 1 plus X 1 plus X n PI - what this one when you take a out X minus 1 here to get plus X will take minus one out X minus one again minus minus plus six minus one and a minus an example number one now this is these are trinomial quadratics have you factorize multiply the first and the last you get plus 6x squared and try to factorize plus 6x squared and when you add the factors you need to get plus five six one six two and three two three you are getting fine so 2x and 3x are the appropriate factors so you can split the middle term to 2x and 3x now we can take three at a time and factorize you get X plus 2 here when you take 3 out you get X plus 2 X plus 2 is common for both take it out and 
,,write X plus 3 as the other factor this one middle term is negative and the other one is positive so what you do when you find out the factors the larger factor should be negative so we'll try to find out positive 12x squared and find out the factor so that the difference is minus 8 or the addition tell me this is the second part we did this is minus this is plus means both the factors are negative so here find both negative factors to get positive 12x squared so what are the suitable factors 6l 2 so 6 & 2 you get minus 6x + -2 X now we'll split the middle term and take 2 at a time and factorize so here you can take minus 2 out and write X minus 6 so X minus 6 is common what's remaining X minus 2 example number 3 now the middle term is positive and their last term is negative then what we do now you are getting the difference when you take the difference you need to get plus 2 that means larger factor is positive so we'll do multiply these two you get my knee minus 15y squared find out the factors of -15 the difference is +2 15 is 5 & 3 so this positive the bigger one should be positive so this is plus and this is minus so I can write the middle term as plus 5i + -3 bar take two at a time and but right here I can take minus 3 out this becomes y plus 5 Plus 5 is common you get Y minus 3 example number 4 both negative so what's the situation both negative means when you multiply you're getting negative and the difference is minus 1 so the bigger number the bigger factor is negative here so what are the suitable factors to get minus 1 5 & 4 bigger one should be negative - 5 en plus boy now I split the middle term take two at 
,,a time I can't take +4 out now we see a minus 5 is common and the remaining part you right here exercise six-point tuna factorize the quadratic expressions given below so now we will try to do at once + + means the addition comes here so we can write 18x squared factors of 18 to get 9 6 & 3 so 6 X set 3xo split the middle term and take two at a time and factorize now see we are getting the same factor if something happens that means you are not getting the same so you have to go back and check again this one plus 30 by square factors of 30 to get 11 6 & 5 the buta pluses split the middle term into ante two at a time and now see what factors are the same here by plus six are there that's common take it out and remaining part you write inside the bracket this is also positive positive 24 a square factors of 24 to get 10 6l when you are doing sums you can easily get the factors correct factors at one six and Oh both positive we split the middle term and Factor s plus 6 here when you take plus 4 plus 6a plus 6 is common and the remaining part you right here this one 15 so you get 15 B squared when you multiply plus 15 B squared what are the 
,,factors of plus 15 to get minus 8 so minus 8 means both factors are negative both factors negative means 5 and 3 B minus 5b so you can get minus 3b minus 5b that's 50 take two at a time and factorize minus minus plus so B minus 3 is come and you get me - this one middle one negative last one positive me same thing so 6 6 square 
,,and the factors this is negative middle term is negative so that means both negative factors so you can't get 6 and one because you get minus 6 and minus 1 minus 7 so 3 & 2 both are the appropriate factors now split the middle term and fat rice X is common and here 2 is common minus minus plus X minus 3x minus 2 this 1 plus 20 and middle term is minus 12 so plus 20 M square factors of plus 20 but the middle term is negative means both negative what are the factors 10 + 2 4 & 5 you're not getting 10 + 2 10 and 2 both negatives you get 12 so M squared minus 10 name - 2 wim plus 20 so take two at a time and factorize when you take minus 2 world you get minus here and M minus 10 and if minus 2 oh you can do at once this one different last term is negative means one factor is positive and the other factor is negative so you need to get one here so one here means this one the larger factor is positive so how do you get larger factor positive so that means minus 12 what are the factors 6 & 2 it doesn't work for 1 3 so larger factor should be positive so you get me to the top Bonnie that means for a minus 3 then you take two at a time - 3 out you get a plus 4 gate take a plus 4 out you are getting a minus 3 now the next one - 24 P squared when you multiply last term negative means the larger factor is positive but the middle term is positive 24 8 times 3 so this is plus and this is minus then only you get plus 5p so P squared + 8 P minus 3 P minus 24 take two at a time and you take P out that's this minus 3 out you get P plus 8 so P + 8 + P minus 3 this one last term is negative when you multiply you get 16 we are what are the factors middle term is plus means the larger factor is positive 16 is a 10 choose larger factor is positive there is positive 8 and negative 2 P split them at middle term 8 P minus 2 P minus 16 state two at a time and factorize you get B plus 8 and B minus 2 this one same thing final value is negative means one is positive and one 
,,is negative how we find this is one factors of 12 4 & 3 middle term is negative means larger one is negative and the other one is positive in fact right so you write the middle term in terms of minus 4 L plus 3 and take first 2 separately and the last 2 separately so you get X here X minus 4 when you take +3 out what's remaining you get X minus 4 so X minus 4 is common take it out and the remaining part is X plus 3 this one last number is negative means you take the difference minus 40 a square the middle term 40 is 8 times 5 always think about the middle term and try to find out the correct factors 8 and 5 middle term is minus means the bigger one is 
,,negative now split the middle term into minus 80 that's five you take two at a time and factorize a minus eight e minus 8 is comma and the remaining part is a plus this is also same negative 10 our square factors of negative 10 that means we have to take the difference 10 means 5 and 2 middle term is negative means negative 5 r+ 500 splitting the middle term take two at a time you can take plus 2 out - hi then R minus 5 is common you get R plus 2 as their other factor this one both positive so that's easy plus 9y square R that means addition when you add the factors you are getting plus 6 what are the factors 3 + 3 so you get 3 by n 3 Y so Y squared is plus would pluses Y squared + 3 y + 3 y + 9 and take two at a time you get y plus 3 when you take 3 out that's also y + 3 now y plus 3 is common you get y plus 3 so you can write instead of this y plus 3 squared doesn't matter either you can keep like this or write as a square term this one positive as a middle term is negative so what's the condition both factors are negative 25 what are the factors five and five but both are negative so K squared - 5 K minus 5 K was 25 Dave two at a time and factorize you can take minus five out because you need plus K inside no okay - five again K minus five you can write as a square term this one four plus four X 
,,plus X square same things now so x squared meter term is plus means both pluses so plus 2 X n plus 2 X split the middle term 2 + 2 X + + 2 X and then take two at a time what's common to is commas 2 plus X and here also X is comma 2 plus X now 2 plus X is common and the remaining one is also 2 plus X I can write this one as a square term like this when you multiply you get positive 36 x squared middle term is plus 15 so that means addition what are the factors to get plus 15 12 + 3 + 3 15 so this is positive and this is also positive now split the middle term - 12 X + 3 X and you can take 12 out 3 + X when you take X out 3 + + X again now 3 + 6 come on 
,,take it out you get 12 plus X for the next factor this one middle term is negative this the constant term is positive what it means both factors are negative what are the factors that means addition we have to think about adding the two factors you need to get 11 36 and high but both factors are negative because the middle term 
,,is negative now split the middle term when you take two at a time 6 is common and a is common I'll take - a out because I need plus five minus a ok so five minus a is common for both and the remaining one is six minus a this one last one is positive and the middle term is negative that means both the factors are negative so what are the factors of plus 54 think about it 9 + 6 6 + 9 54 and when you add 6 plus 9 you get 15 so 9 and 6 but middle term is negative means both negative so we can split the middle term like this fat rice so you get 9 out 9 times 6 so you get here why when you take minus y out 6 minus y so 6 minus y is common take it out and raining part 9 - Wow example number one now you get two terms and we did difference between two square terms we can see 25 is a square number so write this number as a 
,,square term then how we write down the factors we write X and X to get x squared 5 and 5 to get 5 squared and 1 factor is positive and the other factor is negative this one again difference between two squared terms I can write 9 as 3 square then you can straight away apply difference between two square terms one is positive and one means negative example number three two terms so again same thing how can I write Phi l squared as a square term I can write to a whole thing square 49 seven squared difference between two squared terms two ways one term and the other one is seven one is positive one is negative here one is there is one a square number yes 
,,we can write 1 square is 4 P squared I can write to bead whole thing squared so this is difference between two squared terms so you can write down the two factors one is the first term 2 B is the second term one factor is positive the other factor is negative example number five so fact rise 2 x squared minus 72 now can you write as a square number 2 is not a square number so if that means first you need to find out the common factor for both you can take two out and right this is 36 now 36 is a square number so you can write as difference between two squared terms so I can write two factors one is X mine +6 and the other one is X minus six now find the value so you can use difference between two squared terms so what are the two factors one term is 33 the other one is seventy one factor is positive one factor is 
,,negative what's this value 50 50 times what's the difference difference is 6 plus 7 13 so 16 50 times 16 so take 0 and multiply by 5 5 times 6 33 remaining 5 times 1 5 5 + 3 8 so the answer is 800 example number 7 you get fractions but don't worry you can write it as a square term how can I write this fraction as a square term I can write x over 2 whole thing square once is a square number 9 you can write 3 square then this is difference between two squared terms so what are the factors you can write x over 2 minus 1 over 3 or x over 2 plus example 8 1 minus so I can write 1 squared 4 1 how can I write this one as a square term 3x over 4 whole thing squared because 16 is 4 times 4 and 9 is 3 times 3 difference between two squared terms one one the other term is 3x over for one term is positive one term is negative exercise 6.3 factorize the expressions given below so all these are difference between two square tiles hundred is 10 square so you can write one is positive and the other one is negative again this one right as a square that's six squared one factor is positive and the other factor is negative what about this one 9 squared is 
,,81 we can write as one factor positive the other factor negative here 4 + B squared 4 I can write 2 squared apply difference between two square terms one factor positive the factor negative this one four squared and a square one factor is positive and the other factor is negative you can write the negative 1 first as well 64 is 
,,8 squared when you write down the two factors you get this one is positive the other one is negative all these are two terms and we can see square terms will try to 
,,factorize here already this one is a square term this one you have to rewrite as a square term like this now apply the factor rule one factor is positive the other factor is negative this one you have to write both as a square term first and write down one factor positive the other one negative hundred this is square number I can write an X whole thing squared + 1 s1 square so what are the factors 10 X plus 1 and X minus 1 here 25 is 5 square this is already there so what are the factors 5m + n 5m - 49 is 7 square a t-bar you can write 9p whole thing square after you write down as a square term only you can write down the factors so 7 + 9 p 7 - 9 P this one I can't write 5 a bead whole thing square this is 3c whole thing square now write down 5 a b +3 c 5a b minus 3 c miscellaneous exercise factorize the following algebraic expressions by changing the order in which the terms appear as required yeah because we can't factorize these two so we need to change will change these two X minus BX minus a y plus B Y now take two at a time X out you get a minus B here I can take minus y out eight minus B your - - here plus a minus B is common you 
,,get X minus y as the other factor now look at this one what can you see yeah like terms are there so you don't need to take two terms apparel here but rice here first will simplify 9 P plus 3 P 12 P these two you get minus 8 Q now fact rice two expressions take the common term out for is come and take it out you get 3p minus 2q 
,,now we'll take this one you get trinomial quadratic expression but the order is not correct we need square term we need this one the middle term and here I'll rewrite this as square term first and X term and then the constant now multiply these 2 you get negative 12x squared find the factors of minus 12x squared to get plus one 
,,last one is negative means we take the difference difference is plus one so the larger factor is positive what are the factors four and three larger factor is positive means this is plus four and minus three now split the middle term you get this tail two at a time and here minus three out you get X plus four X minus 3 this one 
,,is the order correct no so constant term I can take this one a square term last and the middle term minus 3 K now when you multiply first and last you get minus o K 
,,square meter term is negative means the larger factor is negative so 4 times 1 and we take the difference so minus 4 n plus 1 so 4 minus 4 K plus 1 K minus K squared now take two at a time take 4 out you give 1 minus K when you take K out this is also 1 minus K so 1 minus K is come on you can write down o plus K as the other factor question number 2 factorize the following algebraic expressions two terms are there so T is not a square number so we'll take the common factor out what's the common factor to take it out so you get 4x squared minus 25 now 25 and 4 both are squared numbers I can rewrite as a square times 5 squared is 25 now I can write down 
,,the 2 factors as 2 X is the first term 5 is the other 1 is positive the other one is negative this one 3 I can take it out what's in answer here keep on now 81 is a 
,,square number that's 9 square now you can write down as difference between two squared terms X minus 9 and X plus 9 this one take the common term out is common I can it be is common for that common so what's remaining is squared B squared here one is remaining no I can write this one as a B whole thing squared + 1 square 1 squared is 1 now apply difference between two squared terms a B plus one a B this one you can take three out one minus four Q square now you can apply difference between 
,,"two square terms 1 squared is 1 - Q whole thing squared is 4 Q squared now write down the two factors 1 plus 2 Q 1 minus 2 Q find the value so we can use factorization to find these values because all these are square terms so we'll apply the formula difference between two square terms one means positive one is negative 23 + 3 26 here you get 20 put 0 and x - 2 times 6 12 2 times 2 4 + 1 5 here 45 + 5 + 45 - 5 are the factors 45 + 5 is 50 45 minus 5 is 40 so when you multiply you get 2,000 "
,,this 102 squared - 2 square so you can use difference between two squared terms hundred - plus 200 - - - you get 104 here here you get hundred it's easy to multiply 
,,by hundred move two places to the right so with two zeros yeah so ten thousand four hundred fourth one join each algebraic expression in column a with product off its factors in column B so we need to do separate here and find out the answer from the right hand side so we'll take the first one x squared minus X minus 6 this means one last term - means you need to get one plus and one minus middle term is - means the bigger factor is - so what are the factors last six x squared 3 n - bigger 
,,"one is - so I can write x squared - x will put 1 X so I can split the middle term 2 - 3 X and + 2 X and take two at a time get X - 3 when you take + 2 out that's X minus 3 so X minus 3 is common the other factor is x + 2 X - 3 and X plus 2 this one this one four terms so we take two at a time take two at a time X is , take it out here minus 3 is comma and take it off so what are the factors x + 5 + X - 3 yeah you get here this one two terms you can take common terms out first 2x is common when you take that you get x squared minus 4 now our difference between two squared terms so 2x is there you can write 4 as 2 squared now apply difference between two squared terms you get X plus 2 and X minus 2 where's that here so I can connect here the other one 4x squared minus 9 m squared I can rewrite as square terms 2x whole thing squared + 3 M square what are the factors to X plus 3 m 2x minus 3 where's there yeah definitely the other one is this one but this is the fraction yeah x squared over 25 you can write it as a square term x over 5 so x over 5 I'll do it here thing squared + 1 square now x over 5 plus 1 and x over 5 minus 1 it's already "
,,there so we did all so all answers are okay so we complete all factorization methods related to your textbook so what are they we did when you get common factor you 
,,can take it out that's rule number one sometimes you get expression as a commenter that's rule number two and when you have four terms you take two terms that factorize and then we did factorization trinomial quadratics and difference between two squared terms so practice with all these example and exercises to improve your knowledge in factorization

AlgebraicExpression,VqfeXMinM0U,Hello everyone can you all tell what comes
,,in to your mind as soon as you hear the word mathematics.
,,"Some might say numbers..some say addition subtraction .. Shapes like circle, triangle"
,,etc. Yes! You all are right...but math is much
,,more than this. Math is part of our everyday life. For example
,,"when we wake up in the morning, our first action is to look at our clock. Then when"
,,we go for breakfast ask for 2 slices of bread We will again be using maths if we dial number
,,to phone. We all love shopping and here too maths plays an important role say if there's
,,a discount then you can see how much it would be if it was maybe 20% off or something. So
,,like this there are many incidents where math is used & hence is so important to learn and
,,understand. But do we really know what mathematics is?
,,Is it only about numbers & shapes? No.
,,There are many more interesting things that we can learn as the word mathematics itself
,,means the things that are learned One of the very first things that we learnt
,,in our childhood is numbers and its counting. We ve also learnt some basic operations that
,,we apply on them. Like addition of numbers.subtraction multiplication
,,"& division the answers that we get are called sum, difference, product & quotient."
,,Now the area of mathematics where numbers are combined with some basic operations & their
,,"calculation s????.. forms a different branch in math called arithmetic, the operations"
,,are called arithmetic operations. The word arithmetic itself means number.
,,Now as time passes we gain more knowledge. So in this session we are going to learn one
,,of the most important branches of math known as algebra which is the foundation for many
,,other topics & a great subject for getting your brain to think differently and sharply.
,,So what is algebra? Is it same as arithmetic? Lets understand it.
,,We know that in arithmetic we can easily say 8+2=10 & 7-5=2 but suppose someone asks the
,,same question in some other way i.e. how much amount do we add to 8 to get total of 10?
,,Or how much should we remove from 7 to get balance of 2. Look at this 8 + ___ . 10
,,7 - ___ .. 2 okay so the answers for these blank place are 2 & 5 resp ? right.
,,Here what we are actually doing? We are finding the value of the empty place
,,which we don?t know yet hence this empty place also called as unknown.
,,But every time we cannot use words like empty place or unknown.
,,Hence in algebra we denote this unknown value..i.e. this empty place by an alphabet & it can be
,,any letter a..b..cor xyso on. So instead of keeping it
,,"So, Algebra simply means finding the value of unknown numbers"
,,I am sure you have now understood the difference between arithmetic and algebra Lets take an example to learn few more things
,,"in it. Suppose, you have a small stationary shop,"
,,"where you sell one pencil for 3 bucks. Customer1 comes and asks for 5 pencils, costomer2"
,,asks for 7 pencils customer3 directly gives you 12 bucks and asks to give as many pencils
,,as you can for 12 bucks. Price of 1 pencil no of pencil amount
,,3 5 ___ 3 7 ___
,,3 ___ 12 Friends here price for a pencil is a fixed
,,amount and what is unknown to us is either no. of pencils or total amount for the same.
,,"Let us first find the unknown values. Now, can you tell what should be the total"
,,amount for 5 pencils in case of customer 1. It is 3*5 = 15 right? Similarly for 7 pencils
,,the amount will be 21 bucks. So what did we do exactly? We have multiplied
,,price of a pencil with number of pencils sold to get the unknown total amount But for 3rd customer .in 12 bucks what will
,,"be the number of pencil? How to find that, all we have to do is divide"
,,the total amount 12 by price of a pencil i.e. 3 and that will give us 4. Observe the table and understand that here
,,cost of pencil is a constant value while the number of pencils purchased by each customer
,,varies and as a result their total amount is also different. So if we denote num of pencils by x & total
,,amount as y ????????in general we can
,,write it as 3x = y Friends 3x simply means that 3 multiplied
,,"by x or sometimes 3 dot x, dot also represents multiplication. Now note that here x & y are unknowns whose"
,,value is not fixed & its varying hence in algebra unknown numbers are also known as
,,variables. And the fixed number here price for a pencil
,,"is known as constant. Now if we concentrate only on 3x, we can see"
,,that we have constant 3 & the variable x& both are combined with an operation.. multiplication.
,,So such type of expressions that involve variables and constants & are combined with the fundamental
,,"operations, it is called as algebraic expression. Therefore 3x is an algebraic expression and"
,,y is also an alg exp as y is a variable and can be written as 1* y
,,And when such algebraic expressions are equated i.e. we put an equal to sign between them
,,", then this whole thing is called an equation. Lets have some more examples of algebraic"
,,expression: I had some money I gave 16 bucks to one of
,,my friend now I have 56 bucks left. How can we form an algebraic expression of
,,this statement? Here the money I had is unknown  so this is the equation and this is expression.
,,These are some examples of equations and expressions match them correctly. Sum of 2 numbers is 15 X = y + 3
,,Mr. x is 3 years elder than Mr. y 7y
,,I had some mango & gave 3 to my brother
,,X - 3 Price for one chocolate y bucks
,,Price for 7chocolates is X + y = 15 Friends in our upcoming sessions we ll be
,,learning in detail about the algebraic expressions and equations. So thats all for this session in our next
,,session well learn more on algebra. But if you have any doubts or anything for this session
,,do let us know in the common below. Also like and share the same. You may help someone needy

AlgebraicExpression,sgtKab2ynrY,mathematics it isn't as scary or difficult as it sounds but for many it's the subject they absolutely i hate mathematics but i love counting my money okay but however the best thing about maths is that once you get the hang of it it can be your most scoring subject so in today's video i'm going to be sharing with you seven effective tips to tackle mathematics like an expert so let's begin tip number one make time to practice each day if you want to bring high marks in mathematics then hard 
,,work is the key every day make a habit to spend half an hour or one hour on this subject try not to study hours and hours straight this may create stress tip number 
,,two start by solving examples in every maths textbook you will get a lots of example or sample questions for a detailed explanation i have taken my brother's ncrt math textbook the most common mistake we often do is we just ignore the examples and directly start with the exercise questions so friends once you've understood a particular chapter's introduction try to solve each examples without seeing the solution if given and later compare the answers and check where you went wrong so friends through my personal experience 85 percent of question in your maths examination comes from this type of exercise or sample one tip number three clear all your doubts it's easy to get doubts in maths don't let your doubt store in your mind get them cleared as soon as you get one doubt so take help from your teacher your friends your parents your tuition teacher etc just clear your doubts tip number four note down all your formula memorize formula carefully if you can memorize it don't worry just write it on a plain sheet of paper then keep that sheet of paper in front of you whenever you are doing maths i prefer to stick this on my study table even on my wall in a short time a picture of this sheet will be created in your mind and you will be able to solve the problem with a better understanding tip number five review incorrect answers carefully you can learn a lot from your mistake in mathematics review your process where and how did you go wrong checking answers can help you better understanding as well as to increase your confidence level tip number six try to help someone else sometimes explaining a concept to another person can help you understand it more so try to help your friend who is struggling with maths problems which you know very well to solve tip number seven take math seriously and 
,,stay motivated another reason people struggle with maths is that they do not take it seriously they feel it's okay to be bad at maths or just laugh it off so embrace math instead of disregarding it mathematics is not about numbers equations computations or algorithms it is about understanding don't worry about your difficulties 
,,in mathematics always remember the expert in anything was once a beginner so do lots of practice work hard dream big and never give up so that's it all for today's video thank you so much for watching if you found this video helpful make sure to give it a big thumbs up and share it with your friends and for more awesome videos subscribe to my channel and press that bell icon for my latest updates see you in my next video bye

AlgebraicExpression,kPzUmFNi2-4,introduction to algebra so far we have learned about numbers and geometrical shapes what we have learned so far comes under arithmetic and geometry now we are going 
,,to learn a new branch of mathematics called algebra the main feature of algebra is the use of letters are all feybelle to the present numbers letters represent not only a particular number a letter may stand for an unknown quantity by learning the method of the remaining unknowns we develop powerful tools to solve the complicated puzzles and so many problems that arise in our daily life to understand the basics of algebra we need to perform certain activities now let us see an activity this is a matchstick now let us make some patterns with these matchsticks which will help us to understand some important concepts of algebra now we are going to make a 
,,pattern with a matchstick we are going to make a triangle with matchsticks so how many matchsticks are required to make one triangle to three matchsticks to make a triangle three matchsticks are required so now I wanted to make one more triangle that is two triangles to make two triangles how many matchsticks are required for one triangle three matchsticks and for two triangles four five six we need six matchsticks to make two triangles here is a table which lets us to know how many matchsticks are required to form the Ricoh so by looking at this table we understand the basic pattern now to know that and number any number you view any number of triangles for example I wanted to know how many matchsticks are required for ten triangles here a basic thing we are observing it so for every number it is three times for 
,,every number for example four triangles for four triangles it is three times the number of triangles so for example ten triangles three into ten thirty matchsticks are required so what about the number you take that number is multiplied with three that is three times two the number of triangles you get the number of matchsticks 
,,so we can write that formula here number of matchsticks required number of matchsticks required is equal to 3 into number of triangles in this way we can find out the number of matchsticks required to the required number of triangles variable now let us learn about variable here is a piece to make this space we need two black stickers to make one face two stickers are required to make two phases two phases how many stickers are required one two three four so we write two phases four stickers as we have seen the matchsticks activity in the same way we write number of phases to in such case number of stickers for and the pattern becomes 2 into 2 two phases two stickers again we take number of phases three stickers 6 2 into 3 in this way we can write for n number so remembers now if we wanted to formulate it we don't know the number of phases but we wanted to tell how many number of stickers required for example for six phases 2 into 6 12 for 10 pieces 2 into 10 20 stickers for 
,,12 phases 2 into 12 24 stickers for young faces so we don't know that exact number of the phases so we use the letter M M is a variable it also acts like a number that means all the automatic operations like addition subtraction multiplication division everything applies to this letter as like other numbers but this is not a constant number okay so M for an n number of phases 2 into M because everywhere - 2 into the number of phases then we get number of stickers so here 2 into number of phases the m3 so we kept here so here it becomes 2 here 2 into M means to M it is not 2 plus cm 2 into M means to M so here M is the variable that is number of faces to M for example I wanted to know how many stickers are required for 8 faces so here 2 m in place of Y M we substitute 8 2 into 8 16 stickers so here this M is a variable expressions with variables let us see some example here our second expressions in the form of statements here we have some statements let us see some expressions with variables here we have some expressions in the form of statements now see how to express these statements in algebraic expressions so here the first one I have rupees five more than what Geeta have more than what Geeta have five more than what data so we don't know what is data having but five more so just we give the variable Y - what gate ahem Gita have 5 theta have five so I have more than what data have so more than y plus 5 this is the thing I have y plus 5 in this way we can convert the statements into expressions now we see how to write statements for expressions here are some expressions now see how to write the statements for this 2p he ronnie has twice the money then Seema - P Seema the money Seema having his P so Ravi is having twice - peep rules from geometry and mensuration perimeter of a square we know that perimeter of a polygon is the length of all its sides now perimeter of a square is equal to square four sides four sides for example you take a variable yes first side so perimeter of a square is equal to side plus side plus side plus side so side plus side plus side plus side that is four sides four into yes so here we got the expression for s because the perimeter of a square side left side left side left side so all the sides of a square will be of same value so we make four into side any of the side so here for s the S is a variable so we will substitute the value for example side is equal to three centimeters the side is equal to three centimeters so 4 into 3 12 centimeter is the perimeter of the square so in this way we can make the expressions using variables now we can understand more about 
,,the patterns from even our thematic now let us see that even of a pattern here so here is an even number two and it's pattern is written as 2 into 1 and look at 4 it can be written as 2 into two and six can be written as 2 into 3 & 8 2 into 4 and 10 2 into 5 and 12 2 into 6 & 4 14 2 into 7 & 4 16 2 into 8 so these are the patterns for these even numbers so from this table we can understand that first even number is 2 into 1 the pattern for even number 10 is 2 into 5 the even number 14 2 into 7 so we can write this pattern for any number so far n number what is the pattern for number and we don't know that number and it is a variable we don't know the value so what is the pattern for that 2 into n 2 n so this is the pattern so for empty number for 16 number 2 into 8 4 and number 2 n is the pattern simple equations 
,,just recall these faces example so there we found how to find out the number of stickers required for set a number of faces so there we got a rule to M so M is the number of faces by using this variable we can find out the number of stickers required for a required number of faces say for example here is a question how many faces can be made with 10 stickers 10 stickers so how many faces can be made with 10 stickers 10 so how to find out 2 I am equal to 10 so how is this equal to M is equal to 10 10 stickers how many faces the number of faces becomes that M we use the variable M 2 M is equal to 10 now we have to see that which value satisfies this yep 
,,that means we have to find out the value of this variable M okay let us find out say for example we take the trial and error method to see whether this equation is balanced or not if M is equal to 1 2 into 1 equal to 10 so this is not satisfied this is not an equation at all because 2 into 1 to 2 is not equal to 10 now let us substitute M is equal to 4 then 2 4 8 and it is not equal to 10 now let us take m equal to 5 so in place of this 4 we write 5 2 5 10 equal to 10 so here this condition is satisfied 2 m is equal to 10 this is satisfied here that means M is equal to 5 so this is an equation made with some variables so when we substitute 5 in place of M this condition is satisfied LHS and RHS of an equation L edges left hand side and our hitches right hand side of an equation for example 2 m is equal to 10 we can call this as an equation when it is balanced on both the sides on left hand side and on right hand side so here we don't know the value of M say the U of M and its product with two must be equal with ten then only you call it as an equation otherwise this is not an equation say for example two in place of M we keep for twelve 
,,to ten two four eight it's not equal to ten so this is not any question for a simple equation both the left-hand side and right-hand side should be of equal value so you can compare this left-hand side and right-hand side of an equation with a common balance now let us substitute five in place of M two into five equal to ten so 
,,now it is ten so it is balanced on both the sides here the left-hand side and right-hand side having the same an equal value so only these kind of things are called 
,,as equations if we write four plus five greater than or three plus six not equal to eight these are not equations you cannot consider these as equations

AlgebraicExpression,fUOdon3y1hU,algebraic expressions and equations good day students welcome back to my classroom for today's lesson you are going to learn how to differentiate expression from equation translate variable expressions and equations into algebraic expressions and equations and vice versa and lastly identify a variable in non-algebraic expression and equation let us begin let's cover brain exercise let's take a look at this one we have the sum of eight and nine can you translate this into a numerical expression great job we have here the keyword sum which represents addition this means that we need to add eight and nine so that is eight plus nine and this is an example 
,,of a numerical expression next one we have the sum of four and a number again our keyword here is sum which means addition this means that we need to add 4 and a number here we do not know the value of a number therefore we are going to represent it by a letter let's say letter n so that is four plus n this is an example of algebraic expression next one we have the sum of four and the number is seven again our keyword here is the word sum which means addition and we need to add four and a number which is four plus n and the word is represents equal sign therefore four plus n is equal seven this is an example of algebraic equation now do you know what is the difference between algebraic expression and equation let's go and take a look let us discuss the differences between expression and equation in algebraic expression it is a mathematical phrase for example we have this sum of 4 and a number and as we can see this is not a complete sentence while the algebraic equation is a 
,,mathematical sentence for example we have the sum of four and the number is seven another one is algebraic expression has no equal sign while in algebraic equation it has equal sign which represented by the word is lastly in an expression a value of the letter or the symbol can change for example here we have 4 plus n we can say that the value of n is 5 so that would be four plus five or we can say that the volume n here is nine so that would be four plus nine or let us say it is equal to so that would be four plus two on the other hand in algebraic equation the value of the letter or the symbol cannot be changed it has a fixed volume or fixed answer here n four plus n equals seven we cannot say that the value of n is nine as it will not say that the equation is correct if we say that the value of n here is two the equation would be wrong what if we say that the value of n here is three or plus three equals 7 and that is the correct value of m wonderful now that you know the 
,,differences let's move on to the parts of algebraic expression the first one is the variable the variable is any letter or symbol that represents a number here the variable is letter x the next one is the coefficient the coefficient is the constant value used with the variable it is the factor or the number being multiplied to a variable here the coefficient is two we can always find the coefficient before the variable the next one is the constant the constant is the fixed value that does not change here the constant is number five and lastly we have the term the term is a number or variable a product or quotient of a number and variables separated by 
,,plus or minus sign here in a given example we have the plus sign and it separates two terms which are 2x and 5 remember that addition and subtraction only separate terms while division and multiplication do not separate terms now that you already know the parts and the differences between equation expression let us go and translate some verbal expressions here we have a number plus 3 first one that you need to know is what is the missing here the missing here is a number this means that we 
,,are going to represent it by a variable any letter that we would like to let's say i want letter m the next keyword here would be the word plus which means edition so that is m plus three so our algebraic expression here is m plus three now let's have another example we have the sum of a number and three again let's take a look 
,,for some keywords here the keywords that we have is the word sum which means addition therefore we need to add a number which can be represented by a variable let's 
,,say letter m and the number 3 so that is m plus 3 very good let's have another one we have m increased by 3 here we already have a variable which is m so let us write m next we have the keyword increase by increase by represents addition so that would be a plus sign and lastly the number three next one we have three added to m so again we already have a variable which is m and we need to add 3 to it so that is m plus 3 next one we have 3 more than m again our variable here is m and the word more than represents addition and we have three so that is m plus three now let us identify which are the variables coefficient constant and the number of terms here in our given algebraic expression the variable here is the letter which is and very good next one let us take a look for the coefficient again the coefficient is the number that we see before the variable as we can see there is no number before a variable here but it doesn't mean that we do not have a coefficient remember that a coefficient is a factor or a number multiplied to a variable all variables that do not have a number beforehand has a coefficient of one because it means one times m which is equals m so the coefficient here is one next one the constant here is very good it is three and let's count the number of terms since this algebraic expression is separated by a plus sign or addition our terms here are m and 3. so we have two turns great job let's have another example next one we have a number minus seven again we have here a number which can be represented by a variable so let us say letter f our next keyword here is the word minus which represents subtraction and there is 7 so that is f minus seven next one we have the difference of f and seven so again let's take a look for some keywords we have different and the difference represents subtraction so we need to subtract f and seven all right let's have another example we have f decreased by seven so our variable here is f and we need to decrease this one which represents subtraction by seven next example we have seven subtracted from f so our variable here is is the letter f and we need to subtract seven from it to that will be m minus seven and lastly we have seven less than f and our variable again here is letter f and our keyword is less than which means subtraction 7 so that is f minus seven now let's identify the variable here again our variable is the letter which is very good is letter f and now let's take a look for the coefficient since there's no number before our variable here therefore the coefficient here is one next one is the constant the constant here is negative 
,,seven now let's count the number of terms so we have here minus that separates the term so we have f and seven so that is to turn all right let's go to our next example this time we have a number time two again we have here the missing value which is a number so now let's represent it by a letter let's say letter n times which means multiplication two in an algebraic expression we do not use the multiplication sign as it confuses us into a variable x instead of using the multiplication sign the number we just simply combine the number and the variable so that would be 2 n next example we have twice of n here our variable is n and our keyword is the word to white which means to time so that is two times n therefore that is to n on to our next example we have n multiplied by two here our variable is letter n and our keyword is multiplied by two so we need to multiply n by two so that would be two n next one we have the double of n here our keyword again is double which means times two so we need to times two the letter n so that is two n all right next one we have the product of n and two so our variable here is n and our keyword is product which is the answer for multiplication this means that we need to multiply n and 2 so that is 2 m now let us identify the variable the variable here obvi is the letter and while the coefficient is 2 as it is the number before the variable next one is the constant as we can see we do not have a constant here while the number of terms since there's no addition or subtraction that separates the term we only have one term now let's move on to our next example next one we have a number divided by five again we have the missing volume which is a number so let us represent this by a variable f and we need to divide this by five so we can write this as n divided by five next one we have the quotient of n and phi so again our keyword here is equation which means division so it means that we need to divide n and five so that is n divided by five next one we have one fifth of n so it means that we need to multiply one and n so that is one-fifth n but it can also be written as n over five okay next one we have the ratio of n to five our variable here is n and our clue word here is the ratio we all know that we can represent ratio by a fraction so 
,,that would be n is to five or n over five which also means and divided by five now our variable here is the letter n while the coefficient here is one fifth as this 
,,is the factor or the number being multiplied to the variable n next one is the constant here we cannot see a constant so that would be zero or not well the number of terms since there's no addition or attraction with separate t terms this means that we only have one term great job now that you already know some basics this time 
,,let's try to translate a verbal expression with more than one operation into algebraic expression let's have our first example six more than twice a number so again 
,,we need to take a look for some clues in order for us to translate this one so our clue word here as we can see we have two white a number and we all know that that 
,,means two times a number or a variable so we can say that is two a and next one we have six more than and that is plus six so therefore our expression here is two a 
,,plus six wonderful now let's identify the variable here is a good job well the coefficient here is 2. next one the constant is 6 and we have here two terms which are two a and six let's have another example this time we have 18 less than half a number now let's take a look for some favorite we have here 18 less than and we all know that lessons mean subtract so that is minus eight next one we have have a number and that means one half times a number or a variable so that would be one half y now if we combine them together we have one half y minus eight so that is 18 less than half a number so here our variable is y well the coefficient here is one half well the constant is negative 18 or minus 18. and the number of terms here are two that is one-half y and eighteen now let's have another example we have one plus twice a number is ten so our first clue right here is to rise a number and that means three times a variable so we can say it is to re b next one we have one plot and that means plus one if we combine that together we have three b plus one and we still have more to translate here we have the word estet which means that equals ten so that is three b plus one equals ten so here we have the variable b while the coefficient here is three the constants are one and ten and the number of terms here are three which are three b one and ten this time let us translate an expression into a verbal or word sentences or phrases here we have b plus eight divided by two so first we have b plus eight we can write this one as the sum of b and eight and next we have divided by two so that would be divided by two now we have the sum of b and eight divided by two wonderful let's have another example here we have three n plus 25 equals 31. first let's try to translate plus 25. we can translate this 
,,one as 25 added two but i will use 25 added two next we have three n this means that three times n but we can also say to rise of n and lastly we have equals 31 which means s31 so now we have 25 added tutorials of n is 31. good job students you made it this far now here are the things that you learned today you

AlgebraicExpression,Rr0Os2iteV4,you have two options the first one is a B's the second option is to a B if you could figure out the result is to a B hello friends welcome back to the shorter world 
,,this is our new series where we're gonna cover every chapter and this is our first chapter algebra and today we are starting it's part one which is basic algebra formulas oh you call it formally okay no issues are occurring to me for the correct you say formulas or formally but we'll cover everything about basic algebra so without wasting time let's begin the first formula is a plus B whole square which is equal to s qua plus 2 a B plus B Square this is very very basic formula but still you will find many people doesn't understand how does it come so if you also don't know how to prove this simply multiply a plus B into a plus B you'll get to know this the next one is a minus B whole square which is equal to a square minus 2 a B plus B Square the next one is a square minus B Square which is equal to a minus B into a plus B my dear friends these are the most basic formula from which we can derive any other formula so that's why let's revise it once again the first one is the a plus B whole square which is equal to a square plus 2 a B plus B square but second is a minus B whole square which is equal to a square minus 2 a B plus B Square and the third one is a square minus B Square which is equal to a minus 3 into a plus B now we know all these three formulas but do we know what is the significance of 
,,this and how to utilize this in our practical life probably no so let's say you have to find out the square of 52 how would you deal with this my dear friends let's 
,,use the first Formula a plus B whole square which is equal to a square plus 2 a B plus B square if you compare here is equal to 50 and B is equal to 2 so simply we'll take the square of a that means 50 square which is to 5 double 0 and 2 into a into B so 2 into 50 into 2 which is equal to 200 and at the end B square which means 
,,"2 square 2 square is 4 now simply add all this 2,500 plus 200 plus 4 it's 2700 and for that said my dear friends this is as simple as this now let's try to modify the same formula which we had seen which was a plus B whole square if I try to write a plus B whole square is equal to a minus B whole square now we need to do some modification this so that this expression should be correct right now if you look at the first part a plus B whole square is equal to a square plus 2 a B plus B Square right the second part says a minus b whole square which means a square minus 2 a B plus B Square so if I simply add plus 4a B to the right-hand side this expression would be exactly equal to the left hand side right so now I can write a minus b whole square plus 4 a B so the similar thing can be done in the second expression as well a minus B whole square if I modify this in different manner it would become a plus B whole square minus 480 this is what many people will say and the formula but this is exactly the same thing which we had written earlier or you can say this is just a modification of that now let's move on and try to figure out what would "
,,be the value of a plus B plus C let's say that variable C and if we are supposed to take the square of this this is equal to the square of each variable that means a square plus B square plus C square plus 2 into a B plus BC plus C that means 2 times of all this now this is one formula you can consider C with negatives and B with negative sign or both with negative sign or a with negative sign it's up to you first of all let's say consider B with negative sign in this case wherever you get 
,,B just put minus B instead of B so you'll find the expression like this in the same manner if you put C with negative sign you'll get this expression if you put both B and C with negative sign you'll get this expression so we are not doing anything we're just putting B or C or anything whatever you want with negative sign and your expression will get modified my dear friends now let's try to figure out the cube of a plus B a plus B whole cube is equal to a cube plus B cube plus 3 a B into a plus B if I consider this with negative sign and the expression would become like this now in the same way the cubic expression can be written as a cube plus B cube is equal to a plus B into a square minus a B plus B Square this is another form of writing this now if you change the sign of a cube plus B cube to a cube minus B cube the expression would become like this my dear friends we have seen all kinds of basic formulate now it's time to practice all those things so let's begin with the first question you'll be given five seconds solve this and this is one of the very very basic question you have two options the first one is a B's the second option is to a B if you could figure out the result is 2a be excellent had you not chosen no shoes because it's very difficult to remember each and every formula by looking at for the first time now let's move on to the second question a one expression is written this expression is equal to which one of the following we have two options one is a cube plus B cube the second option is a cube minus B cube you don't have any time limit to solve this you just pause the video and think try to recall the formula you'll come to know about the answer just pause the video and once you figure out just resume it if you could figure out the first option a cube plus B cube great work now it's time to give you some homework you need to solve all the basic questions without using calculator and width formula do not try to solve directly the first question is 79 square minus 29 square let me give you a hint this is in the form of a square minus B Square now the next one is 48 a square the hint is 
,,you need to solve this as 50 minus 2 whole square and the third one is 221 square and this is in the form of a plus B plus C whole square which means here you can figure out as 200 plus 20 plus 1 square now here are the list of all the formulas don't forget any one of them so you what you can do is you can take a snapshot of this and save it in your mobile phone or your laptop my dear friends in the next video we'll be covering algebra part two if you're going to get notified please subscribe to channel and press the notification bell as well if you like this video please give a thumbs up if you have any doubts I finna give any suggestion post your comments in the comment box and if you find this video is good for any of your friends colleagues or your schoolmates let's share the video with those guys but as of now thank you so much for watching this video and please state

AlgebraicExpression,gxOp8T-akvQ,from a childhood is from our childhood itself okay most of us are very fear about the multiplication tables sro so you may or without many of the people will say sir it is very calculate very tough to learn the tables why because we can't able to can buy hat them see I am going to explain you one beautiful technique today that is how to calculate multiplication tables up to thousand in the mind you will feel little crazy see we don't know even the tables up to tall or certain properly but this guy is saying that I can make you learn up to the tables thousand is it possible yes it is exactly possible but with a small change in your attitude see remember one thing if you are thinking something is difficult it will be difficult counting but if you try in a little different manner but to make it easy yes it is possible to calculate even thousand not own without ten thousand tables also in the mind provided condition there should be some practice now we'll start how to calculate up to one hundred tables first first see here suppose if automatic blind 110 is no mind I want to multiply 24 into six times do you know 24 table no even I don't know but even you don't know 24 tables you can easily calculate in the mind how see here what is six twos tool but don't take that well take it as 1.8 and keep in the mind take it as 120 and keeping them mind for some time you have to say to the mind so 120 yes my please - one ready for some time here right now what is six fours on 
,,24 120 plus 24 how much exactly this 144 one more example I want to multiply 36 into five times do you ever feed him 36 table no even I do not know but how see here 
,,what is five threes 15 but don't take a spoof thing take it as 150 and keep the mine for some time theta is 150 and keeping the mind for some time what is in spice 30 what is it and how is there in the mind 150 150 plus 30 it's 180 suppose I need for the six six times what is six force 24 but take it as 240 you made it went out 
,,why we need to take it as 240 here why because we are multiplying with the digit it is in de which is in the tens place which is in the tenths place that's why we are going to multiply with the Oh that's why we are imagining the nimble ass 240 right I'm just keeping a zero at the end that's it why because we are dealing with the digit which is in the tens place now what is his force 24 take it as 240 so keep it Kate - what in the mind now what is six six thirty six to forty in the mind plus 36 its 276 similarly 30 let us take some 83 into nine about to multiply 80 3 into 9 now what is in nine eight seventy to take it as exactly 720 720 keep in the mind 720 plus 27 sm1977 so 700 us 27 747 one more example I want to multiply 89 89 7 - 1 5 so what is 1864 but it has six forty six forty plus 72 six forty plus 72 how much seven one two so most of you people are maybe feeling difficult in our adding the numbers like this in the mind see here 640 + 72 you are feeling little difficult in this one why because it is crossing some 100 if it is below 100 it is not a problem but whenever the addition some is causing some handle you are feeling difficult now see here how to deal it with easily now remember 640 plus 72 anyhow the last digit will be coming as it is asana why because we are going to add it with zero zero plus Treleaven to only we'll get so for some time ignore about the last digit - of course it should be in the mind for some time but for some time just keep it aside why because we no need to bother why because is going today we are going to get that digit as it is now concentrate on the remaining part 64 plus 7 how much 64 plus 7 yes 71 it is easy right so our answer is completely 7 12 one more example suppose say some 79 into some 779 into seven now the same rule we are going to follow seven sevens 49 but don't think it has 49 494 90 plus 63 490 plus 63 remember how to add 490 per sec ste 3 in the mind 490 plus 63 means 0 plus 3 now we get 3 as it is at the end so just keep it aside now what is 49 plus 6 49 plus 6 is 55 so my answer 55 + 3 as it is so answer is finally 553 like that we can calculate okay you tell me this time oh it is 99 so okay now it 99 five times what is finite okay this time I'm not going to ask you what is financed or what is financed again simply you have to say 450 plus 45 hey sir 450 plus 45 it is 495 similarly 78 eight times I want to multiply don't say this time it's 756 with latest agnes price history 
,,like that simply 560 plus 64 560 plus 64 is how much exactly 624 560 plus 64 0 plus 4 will get 4 as it is now 56 plus 6 is how much 62 stay tuned for 6:24 like that 
,,you need to calculate in the mind okay so similarly you tell me what is finally ninety nine nine times this time what is ninety nine nine times so yes exactly 8n plus 81 8m plus 81 is how much 891 okay so now you tell me if at all if anybody asked you really right so how many tables do you know until now okay if it is like this 
,,you know up to 99 tables for naught yes we know tonight night it was not even 99 you mean Oh hundred also so you can say yes gladly you can say proudly that we learnt now until 100 tables but my friend not only hundred tables but I am going to extend this thing to even thousand also how let us see friends let us extend the same 
,,formula same technique to even up to thousand tables also suppose I want to multiply some 346 into say some three I want to multiply 346 three times right you may think it is it is a little difficult but actually it is not now you see what is 3 3 times 3 3 times is 9 but don't take it as 9 take it as 900 this one take it as 900 
,,why this 3 is in hundreds place that's why I am asking you to take it as 900 keep 900 in the mind for some time ok don't eat no keep for some time 900 now what is 3 
,,force 203 first 12 but take it as take it as yes 120 why because it is in tens place so there is 900 in the mind and this is 149 hundred plus 120 what is that 900 plus 120 is 1020 1020 keep in the mind for some time again 1020 1020 plus 18 1020 plus 18 yes simply 1038 this will be your answer one more example I want to calculate for for 547 into say some eight times five forty seven eight ten so on too much multiplying in the mind now you tell me what is a it finds 40 but Dignitas 40 hundreds okay 40 and is nothing but four thousand okay four thousand keep in the mind now what is an eighth force thirty-two take that three twenty-four thousand plus three twenty four thousand three twenty four thousand three twenty plus 56 four thousand 320 plus 56 how much 4350 sorry how much it is four thousand three hundred plus 
,,"56 it is four thousand 376 one more example 679 eight times I want to multiply 679 eight times H is a 48 take it as 4,800 that is 4,800 keeping the mind 4,800 for some time what is in sevens of 56 taken as 564 thousand eight hundred plus 560 how much 5,000 three 16s on own yes for five thousand three sixty-five thousand three sixty plus 72 five thousand three sixteen plus 72 five thousand 432 five thousand 432 I'm adding in the mind only see here I will tell you the steps eight six up 48 so 4,800 first add this 4,800 to the next one eight seven fifty six data is 560 so I am adding these two first 4,800 plus five 65 thousand three hundred sixty-four this one again I am adding the last one eight nine the 72 so adding 72 here how much I will get 5432 simply zero plus two will get to as it is but what is 536 + 7 543 simply okay even this small side is the same way 547 into 8 so 8 fisa 40 take - 1408 Roger that it would take it as 3 20 how much will get 4,000 320 first add two numbers then go for the third one now what is a terms of 56 so what is the answer 4 3 7 6 like this you need to calculate in the mind even similarly say some big number 8 9 82 8 times okay 6400 come with me have a say along with me six thousand four hundred players seven twenty six thousand why because it is tens place six thousand four hundred plus 7 27 thousand 127 thousand 120 Plus 64 seven thousand 184 exactly similarly say 9 9 9 into 9 9999 this time it will be the same amount same way 8100 my in the mind 8100 8100 + 8 10 8100 + 8 10 eight thousand nineteen eight thousand nine ten that is 8910 8910 + 81 8910 + 81 8990 1 this will be you answer now you tell me if we calculate like this is it easier I'm not to calculate 99 turbulent ervil's yes it is very easy but you need practice for this one okay you should be "
,,little faster in doing the additions okay right even know suppose if it is a big number okay and if want to be if it is a big number - maybe the single-digit how can we calculate that one we'll discuss now in the next technique

AlgebraicExpression,CT9iX5osAs4,hello grade 8 children today I am here with another new topic we'll see what's the topic about you have done numbers two plus three and a half minus five oh you have done point three plus 95 so all these are with numbers so we call this is number theory then you have done straight lines circles squares parallel lines and angles 
,,all are these geometry what about letters what are these two x plus three Y minus five plus three X letters and numbers combination we call that algebra so today we 
,,are doing about algebra so what's the topic chapter five algebraic expression so we'll find out what are the terms involved in this uni and what are the concepts look at this one the price of a coconut is 48 rupees the distance from Colombo to Gul is hundred kilometers there are 31 days in the month of January Ravinder gets 80 points in mathematics course so what are they is 48 130 180 what are those those are numbers if I ask you a question what's the height of a student in grade 8 class so we can't give a specific value usually the height of the students in the class will be different from one another so therefore we need to define a term called variable so what's variable changing values of height as it is not a fixed number so when you don't get a fixed number when the value is changing we call those are variables we use algebraic terms or expressions to denote changing values so we'll take height as a letter so we use algebraic expression like x today not changing values any letter this one profit varies from one day to another day from Nima's three-wheeler so it's changing all the time it can be named as I'll put a receipt a so what's a it's a variable because it's changing all the time this one radius of three circles are three centimetres four centimetres and five centimetres respectively when we consider radius of the circle we can take this one is R that's a variable we can use a letter so what's the R value we can write R equals three centimeters R equals four centimeters that our equals five centimeters so what's the variable they are our that's the radius of the circle this one city does a bias certain number 
,,"of string hoppers to sell in his boutique every day if we do not know the number exactly can show it as another variable we'll take simple B where B is an unknown set we don't know exactly the amount of string hoppers that city dancer buys look at this one in the figure above shows three containers of the same size all three containers contain an equal amount of liquid it can be considered as what you can use another letter H because it is an unknown constant because we don't know exactly what's the water level is so here what's the variable H height of water so lowercase letters such as a b c or you can put X Y Z so any simple lowercase letters we can use to represent variables so it can be an unknown constant or a variable look at this one the daily income of poachers fruit shop can be stated as X so what is X they are jail income he saved his income by 2,000 rupees a day find the remaining amount of money what's the total income X he's saving to thousand rupees each day so what's the remaining amount you can write in terms of X X is the total value daily income subtract 2000 so the remaining amount is X minus 2000 so this is an algebraic expression so what are the terms terms in this algebraic expression we can write x an mm so those are called terms of algebraic expression so what are the terms "
,,you learn now you learned about variable and we can use simple letters for variables and the next term is terms of an algebraic expression look at this one the price of a coconut is extra base the price of 8 coconut so what you do you have to multiply by 8 so one coconut is x and x 8 so what's the value you get 8x rupees so what are the terms you can say 8x is an algebraic term and the number in front of the letter here X is the variable the number in front of the letter is called coefficient so what's the coefficient in this term 8 8 is the coefficient of the algebraic term we learned about variables terms and coefficient now look at this one combination of algebraic terms 5x plus 3y minus 4z that's called algebraic expression so what are these 5 x 3y minus 4 are the algebraic terms and what about this one the number in front of the letter what you call that coefficients coefficients and terms the width of the rectangle is X its length is 7 its length is 7 meters more than the rich right the algebraic expression for the length so how can we write down length 7 more than that ex-mo more means in maths plus addition X plus 7 is the length so what's the algebraic expression for length X plus 7 if the length of the rectangle is wild now they have given this one is y if this one is y write down the algebraic expression for width we know the width is 7 meters less than the length so we can write by -7 if you take length as Y that's Y minus 7 is the weight the price 
,,of a pen is extra pays the cost of a pencil is why rupees the price of a book is 0 please so what about price of three prints one is X and 3 you have to multiply by 
,,3 3 X 3 times X you don't need to write down the multiplication sign you can write 3x price of 4 pencils one pencil is why 4 pencils for y price of several books one book is zero Peas seven books 7z give the cost of buying all the above in the form of an algebraic expression so the total cost we can add it together 3x plus 4y plus 7c that's an algebraic expression write the terms of this algebraic expression so you have given an algebraic expression what are the terms 3x for bi and 7z coefficient of 3 X we know what is coefficient means the number in front of the letter that's 3 coefficient of 4y what's the number in front that's four coefficient of 77 is the coefficient there build algebraic expression for the following statements we'll try to write in terms of letters you can take these letters given add 7 to the double of X what if double means 2 times X so adding 7 to double of X means 2x 2x plus 7 subtract 6 from the 3 times of X but if three times means 3x 3x and you have to subtract 6 subtract 3 from the sum of x and y sum of x and y means the addition X plus 1 and subtract 3 divided by y how you divide we can write x over 1 divide X by y and subtract from seven so that turns that you have to subtract from seven that means seven - so we'll write seven minus x over Y not X over Y minus 7 because from 7 you have to subtract this amount divided the multiplication of a and B multiplication of a and B by 3 means a B divided by 3 divided the multiplication of 
,,a and B by 3 and subtract from 10 from 10 means 10 minus this value filling the gaps in the following table algebraic expressions are there as you break terms so you have to write down only algebraic terms so what are the algebraic terms 7 x + 3 by what's the coefficient 7 & 3 what are the I do break terms here 6a + 3 B here you don't write down these constants algebraic terms means only terms with letters what are the coefficients 6 & 3 here Excel why hyphens are 1 and 1 in this one 3 a coefficient is 3 this one - 3 X + 7 5 coefficients are -3 here and so this one you get a fraction but here this is an algebraic term 2x over 3 you can write X in the numerator and 3 by over 5 also an algebraic term then what's the coefficient you have to take the whole thing the fraction 2/3 three fits this one this is an algebraic term 5x over 7 and minus 2y over 3 so what's the coefficient there five over seven is the coefficient of x term and minus two-thirds is the coefficient of weiter look at this question the cost of an arranges extra pays the cost of an apple is y rupees the cost of a mango is zero peas build algebraic expressions for the following price of two oranges and five mangoes oranges is X so 2x plus because this is both together five mangoes one mango easy five mangoes 5z price of two mangoes and seven apples two mangoes is to Z and seven apples Apple is why rupee so 7 y cost of six oranges and eight apples six oranges one orange is X plus six six and eight apples one Apple is why that's eight why price of five oranges seven apples and three mangos five oranges that's 5 X 7 apples 7 y then 3 mangoes 3z question number five cost of one orange one apple and two mangoes one Apple is why and one orange is X and two mangoes - Z - look at this one right down the algebraic expression for the total cost to buy three kilos of sugar two kilos of Thailand five kilos of flour we are one kilo of each product is a rupees be rupees and C rupees respectively so what are the values total cost we need three kilos of sugar so sugar is a so three a five kilos then two kilos of Dar Daly's be rupees to be and five kilos of flour flour is C rupees of five C next one one kilo of red dollies extra peas and one kilo of yellow dollies why rupees write down an algebraic expression for the extra mounts pen for buying five kilos of yellow da then three kilos of red that means the price is high when you buy five kilos of yellow da so what's the difference five 
,,kilos of yellow doll yellow one is by rupees 5 i- three kilos of red on red dollies extra piece per kilo so 3x so the difference is this well the capacity of a bucket days M liters and bucket B is in liters you need to use 12 buckets of a and eight buckets of B at once to fill a tank what is the capacity of the track so what's the total amount of a buckets yeah 12 a buckets so M liters are there so 12 M then what about from B buckets so need eight buckets of B each bucket contained in liters so eight and so the capacity of the tank is 12 m + 8 in the father's age in one of the families years the age of the mother is beers the daughter's age is Sears give the sum of ages of the father and mother in the form of an algebraic expression fathers ages a mother's ages B so the total is a plastic give the sum of the age of the mother and daughter in the form of an algebraic expression mother's age is B daughters ages the total of the ages of the father mother and dot all three of them a plus B plus C write the sum of the total age of the three above after 10 years in the form of an algebraic expression so we have to add 10 for each value 10 and 
,,10 and 10 for all three people that means 30 so the total value is a plus B plus C plus 30 so after 10 years this is the total value manufacturers men extra piece to make a table the manufacturer made a profit of twice as much as the cost price and sold it to a retailer the retailer solely to the consumer with a profit of by rupees right the profit of the manufacturer in the form of an algebraic expression so how can you write down an algebraic expression manufacture a spend X to make a table that's the cost value the manufacturer made a profit of twice as much as the cost price so what's the profit to X so write the profit of the manufacturer in the form of an algebraic expression err so that's 2x give the selling price of the table by the manufacturer in the form of an algebraic expression so the profit is 2x and the cost price is X so what's the selling price X plus 2x when you add it that's 3x so that's the selling price right the selling price of the retailer to the consumer in the form of an algebraic expression now the retailer sold it to the consumer with a profit of Y rupees so this is the price this retailer bought that means 3 X and he keeps by rupee profit so you have to add Y so this is the selling price of the retailer to the consumer the shape shown in the above is a square and a rectangle made out of matchsticks give the perimeter of the square in the form of an algebraic expression one side is given X for sides and there X plus X plus X plus X 
,,what's the perimeter for X give the perimeter of the rectangle in the form of an algebraic expression how you find out the perimeter you have to add all these lengths so a plus 2b plus a plus 2b a and a you are getting 2 a 2b and 2b when you add 2 plus 2 4 that's 4 B give the full length of the matchsticks used to construct the 
,,above images in the form of an algebraic expression so total length so length for the squares for X and length for this one is 2a plus 4b subtract the total length of the matchsticks used to make the square from the total length of the matchsticks used to make the rectangle in an algebraic expression so you have to subtract the 
,,lengths of matchsticks used to make the square from this one so what's the total here two way plus 4b and subtract the lengths for this one that's 4x look at this one give the perimeter of the equilateral triangle in the form of an algebraic expression equilateral means all sides I equal a and a n a what's the perimeter 3a right the perimeter of the write angular triangle in the form of an algebraic expression so just add all the lengths together we'll do that X plus X plus 2 plus X plus 1 
,,now you can simplify like terms you can add X X X 3x 2 & 1 that's right the total perimeter of the above diagrams in the form of an algebraic expression so this is the perimeter of the write angular triangle and is the parameter for the equilateral triangle so add it together 3 E + 3 X + 3 multiplying an algebraic expression by 
,,a number so we'll see how we can multiply the algebraic expression by a number width of the rectangle is X this is the width and the length is 1 determine the perimeter of the rectangle x + y + X + 1 so you can write down 2 times X plus y of x + alright separately x + y X plus y when you simplify you get 2 x + 2 I now I want to 
,,just separate these two parts this part separately and this part separately what's the length of this part when you separate this what's the length of this one x + y you get the same length here X + 1 so double of this x + y so length of one part is X plus y length of 2 parts you multiply by 2 so 2 times X plus 1 but we took the same diagram finding perimeter fully and taking separately you have to get the same answer so in both methods the perimeter of the same figure is equal so we can write down 2 x + y is equal to two x plus 2y now look at this one when there's a number in front you are multiplying both these X terms by two so when X plus y is x to both the terms x + y x - so now we observe when there's a number in front of an algebraic expression you have to multiply all terms with that number a box contains 
,,a red glass balls and B blue glass balls determine the total number of glass balls in such high boxes number of total ass balls in a box was that a plus B number of 
,,total glass balls in five boxes you have to multiply 5 times a plus B then number of red colored balls in a box separately there are a red color glass balls so number of red color balls in a box is a number of red glass balls in five boxes that's five B multiplied by five if you take separately blue ones how many blue ones are there be blue ones for five boxes you get five be blue ones in five boxes so what can you say about this one the total the total is now we can write total is 5 a + 5 
,,B the answer received in either of the two methods should be equal so in this case five times a plus B is equal to 5 a plus 5b now look at this one when you multiply by the constant each term you get this one remove the brackets of the following algebraic expressions now we can use that knowledge you gain from the previous two questions there's a number in front this is a minus B is the algebraic expression so what you do multiply the first term as shown by the first arrow so this is the first arrow multiply this value here 3 times a 3 and then multiply the second term as shown by the second arrow I'll put numbers this is one red one pink one is 1 and 
,,the other color I'll take blue so this one multiply this one that's two three times minus B minus 3b now we'll follow that multiply and give me the answer this one with this you get 5x this one with this five times minus y minus five now try first this one seven times m 7m then this one seven times n plus seven ten times P 10 P 
,,plus 10 times Q 10 Q here the arrows are used to show the order to multiply so here always first one we can take first one and this is the SEC and why remove the brackets using arrows now now you can do that I mean there's a number in front of the algebraic expression you have to multiply all terms in the algebraic expression inside the bracket by the outside number yes with this this with this 3 into X 3 X 3 into 2 y + 6 1 now do this 1 7 into a 7 a 7 into minus 4 B that means minus 28 eleven times tu-22m 11 times n 11 4 times 3 P 4 times 3 12 P 4 times minus 2q so that's minus 8q this one 6 times X 6 X 6 times minus 11 by minus 66 1 8 times 3 24h 8 x k8 now look at this one you get three terms but same thing you have to multiply each and every term by the outside number this one three times five a 15 a three times to be six be three times c plus 3 C now do that four times X for X for x - y - y 4 times 7 that's + 28 8 times 2 16 a 8 times 7 56 be 8 times C that's 8 say look 
,,at this one 2 times X - x - x - 7 y minus 14y 2 times 3 z 6z 4 times P 4 P 4 times minus 3q - 12 Q 4 times 2r 8 11 times M 11 M 11 times 3 n 33 and 11 times 2 11 times 2 22 with l22 multiplying an algebraic expression by a negative number so now there's a negative number in front so we'll practice first with negative minus 3 times a minus 3 minus 3 times B minus 3 B negative into positive always you get a negative answer negative 5 times X negative 5x negative 5 into negative Y now negative into negative positive plus 5 minus 1 into 3 minus 3 minus 1 into minus 2 B plus 2 B minus into plus minus and here 5 times 2 10 2 times 2 4 that's plus because minus into minus plus and you get B here 2 times 7 here - into plus minus 14 C now you know how to multiply so plus into plus plus plus into minus minus minus into plus minus and minus into minus plus now we'll remove the brackets so you need to first multiply the first one when this number minus 3 a minus 3 times B minus 3b minus 
,,5 X and here so minus 5x minus 5 minus y you get plus 5i we did that minus 3 a and here minus 3 a you get here - nothing means 1 so this is like 1 minus 1 into 3 a minus 3 minus 1 into minus 2 B that's plus 2b this one this one minus 2 times 3 a what's the value minus 2 times 3a minus 6a this one - two - 2b plus 4b and here - two times seven you get minus 14c remove the brackets now so use arrows to multiply minus 3x minus - plus 6y this one when you multiply minus - plus 3 times 2 6 minus 
,,3 times minus 7 plus 20 months what this one you have to multiply all three terms minus 5 a minus - plus 5 times 4 20 get be your minus 5 times C minus 5 see this one multiply minus 8 times a minus 8 a - eight - seven be multiplication + 56 8 times 7 56 B question number 5 - 7 into minus X plus 7 X minus 7 into 2 y minus 14y - 7 into minus c plus 7z here minus 11 times 2 X minus 22 X minus 11 times -3 plus 33 yeah do all these multiplications try 4 times X 4 X 4 times minus 7y minus 28 y 4 
,,times 5 20 minus 3 times a minus 3 minus minus plus 21 B minus in 2 plus minus 24 6 here minus 11 times 2 minus 22 X here minus minus plus 11 times 3 plus 33 Y here 
,,you get minus 22 this one multiply minus 6 times 2 minus 12 minus 6 minus 7 plus 42 and minus 6 and minus 5 plus 13 this one minus 10 into minus 3 plus 30 minus 10 times chobe - 20 B and minus 10 times sake - 10 see what about this one - 4 times 3 H minus 12 which minus 4 times minus 4 plus 16 K minus 4 times minus 4 plus 60 now we're do multiplying an algebraic term by another algebraic term earlier we multiply by a constant now multiplying by an algebraic term 3x + 4 y how we multiply 3x 
,,times 4 1 so what we do we multiply that numbers first 3 times 4 12 and then x + y so without writing we can write without writing multiplication sign 12x what this 
,,one multiplication 7b into foil we can multiply separately the number 7 times 4 and then be a 7 times 4 28 be a it is better to write down then letters in order 28 a B but this is not wrong VA is okay but it's better it is good to write the letters in English at alphabetical order this 1 minus 3 by minus 5 X so we can multiply minus 3 and minus 5 first and then Y and X minus 3 times minus 5 plus 15 y X you can write 15 X Y to a times 7 B now we'll multiply at once 2 times 7 14 a into B a B 
,,you can write at once 3 X into 5 y 3 times 5 15 X into y X Y now there's a bracket minus sign minus 7 times 3 minus 21 a times B a B this one Phi times -3 minus 15 M times n m in here minus 4 times minus 3 plus 12 a and B you can write a B for x minus seven minus twenty eight Y into X Y X or what's the better one x1 multiplication of an algebraic expression by an algebraic term find the area of the following two rectangles separately so what's the area of the rectangle this one is length into breadth or length into width so area of the rectangle is any times X so what's that the X what's the area of the other rectangle length is B width or break is X B times X VX sum of areas you can just add it a X plus B X now when you combine the two rectangles now you are getting a big rectangle two rectangles are merged in the above diagram what's the length of this rectangle length is a here B here a plus B what's the area of the rectangle now length is a plus B and the with operate is 
,,X so X into a plus B as same rectangles are merged areas are equal now what's the area we got before a X plus B X so we can write a X plus B X is same as X into a plus B now sick how do you get this one so when you multiply the expression here can you see you get a X plus B X it is required to multiply all the terms inside brackets given by the outside term remove the brackets using arrows first one is this second one is this a 2 X a X a into - why - a why B into X BX be in 2 - 3 y - 3 B by C into a see a or a see C into 7 B 7 BC so here you can write AC as well is C + 7 BC when you remove brackets using an arrow first draw an arrow and write it then draw the next arrow and write it we'll do that separately X into a exhale Oh a X X into minus B minus BX X into 2 C 2 CX of XE y into p YP y into 2q minus 2 Q minus 2 y qi qi y into our are Y now try into p a p a into 3 q 3 a key a into for our for a 2 a into X 2x - 3 y that is -6 a why this 1 3 b into m 3b 3b into 4 12 B 5 a into 2 X 10 X 5 a into minus 3y minus 15 a why here - -5 a into z5 a 0 minus 3 into X minus 3 X minus into - now you get plus 6 a 1 plus 6 a expand brackets without using arrows no will do without arrows 3p into x 3p x 3p into minus 2 y minus 6 P for a into 2 where 8 a 4 into minus 3n minus 12 a in this one minus 4 into X minus 4 a X minus 4 times minus 3/12 a y minus 11 8 into 2 B minus 22 a be minus 11 a into minus 3 C you get plus 33 a see this one 7 a mintue l 7m n 7m into 428 look at this diagram area of the entire rectangle length is X with this a so what's the area a times X shaded area now can you see this square with length a a into a or we can write a square area of the unshaded part so you have to subtract total area that's a X minus the shaded area e squared sum of two algebraic expressions when you are adding you have to consider like terms so like terms only you can add or subtract when you consider these two terms what can you do you can add a terms with a 2a and 
,,3a you can add and then 3b and 5b separately so what do you get 5a + 5 + 3 8 at the time of addition or subtraction you have to add or subtract the like terms remove brackets and simplify taking like terms so first you have to multiply and then simplify here without arrows we'll do 2 times X 2 X 2 times y - 1 and then you have to add this 3x so I'd like terms 2x + 3 X you get 5x + 2 y right as it is here five times a five wave hi x minus B 5 B and plus seven B is there five way you can add 
,,separately yeah - five plus seven what's the value plus two so take the difference and put the sign of the bigger number plus two that's me here multiply by 4 8 X 4 
,,times y 4y now what are the like terms 8 XL minus 5x that's 3x plus 4 here you have to multiply both these terms here 3 times X 3 X 3 times y 3 by here 2 times X 2 X 2 times y 2 now add the like terms 3x + 2 X you get 5 X 3 y + 2 y you get high five do it separately 2 times a 2 a 2 times -3 b -6 b plus 5 times a highway by x - Oh Big Ten now I'd like terms - and five seven that's seven minus six and ten take the difference + OB this one seven times - 14 X 7 times y 7y this one three times X minus three x + -3 y add the like terms 14 -3 11 X 7 - 3 + 4 y this one 3 x - 6 a 3 times 5 15 b + 7 e + 10 B what are the like terms a terms 6 + 7:30 15 minus 10 plus 5 so 5 b minus 5 times 7 -35 a minus 5 times -3 plus 15 plus 40 a now like terms add 40 - 35 5 a + 15 subtraction of two algebraic expressions you have to do the same thing right the first algebraic expression in brackets right the second algebraic expression in another brackets remove both brackets and simplify three-year you nothing means just multiply by one yeah - is there so that means this is minus 1 multiplied by minus 1 minus 1 times a minus a minus 1 times minus 2 B you get plus 2 B now like terms added 3 and minus a 2 a 4 B plus 2 B you get 6 this one subtract this from this so that means you have to write this one first 12x plus 7 1 so here just multiply by one 12x plus 7 1 minus this means open brackets with minus 1 minus 1 times 7 minus 7x minus 1 times minus 2 plus 2 I like terms you get 12 minus 7 5 x 7 + 2 9 5 subtract 2x minus 3 from this so from means first this one so 6x + 7 when there's a minus sign change the sign minus 2x and minus minus becomes plus 3 like term 6 and minus 2 4 X 7 + 3 that's 10 subtract this value from this so first you write here so 3p plus 8q - open brackets with minus 1 - P last - q + + 7 3 
,,p + - b - p8 q + 2 Q thank you and our terms you get only this one so that's 7 simplify so that here multiply and first open brackets and then simplify 4 times a 4 4 times -3 minus 12 minus 2 times a minus 2 a minus 2 x - 7 + 14 now like terms that for a and minus 2 a 2 a minus 12 and plus 14 you get plus 2 open brackets first 5x - 5 minus 3 times X minus 3 X minus 3 and minus 2 you get 6 y 5x + 3 X 2 X - 5 I + + 6 Y you get Y this one has a minus 2 in front so when you are multiplying be careful - 2 times 3 - 6 Z minus 2 and minus plus plus times foil the Savoy here you get minus 8b add like terms minus 6a + 4 you get minus 2 a 4 B and minus a 2 B minus 4 B this one Phi P into 2 Q 10 PQ or QP 5 P into 4 20 P here - 3 P into Q minus 3 P Q minus 3 P into 2 minus 6 peace now these are two like terms 10 P Q minus 3 P Q you get 7 PQ 20 P minus 6 P you get plus 14 substituting the values in the edge break expression so now we will see how we can find out the expression with substituting values so what's the first one determine the value of 5 a plus 4 when a equals 3 so substitute a equals 3 there so what happens five times three plus four so 
,,what's five times three 15 15 plus four you get 19 look at this expression seven A plus 2 B now you get two letters so substitute these two values equals three and B equals three so 7 M plus 2 B is the expression so we'll substitute 7 times is 3 7 times 3 plus 2 times B equals 3 so 7 times 3 21 2 times 3 6 21 plus 6 27 look at this one now you get three unknown letters 5 a 2 B 7 C values are given a equals 5 B equals 3 and C equals -2 substitute 5 into a is 5 2 times 3 and say x minus 2 so 
,,minus 7 x minus 2 5 times 5 25 minus 2 times 3 minus 6 and here minus minus becomes positive seven times 2 plus 14 now simplify 25 minus 6 you get 19 19 plus 14 33 determine the value of the following expressions when x equals 2 and y equals minus 3 we substitute 8 times X is 2 y equals minus 3/8 times 2 16 5 times minus 3 minus 15 16 minus 15 you get 1 here 12 times 2 minus 3 times minus 3 12 times 2 24 minus into minus plus 2 so 3 times 3 9 9 plus 4 13 so you get 33 now look at this one so same values you have to plug what are the values x equals 2 and y equals -3 9 mean 2 2 plus XY means X into y so 2 into minus 3 y equals minus 3 9 times 2 18 minus 6 you get 12 2 times X X is 2 5 times minus 3 plus 11 2 times 2 4 minus 15 plus 11 so 4 minus 15 you get minus 11 minus 11 and plus 11 you get 0 this one 4 times X 
,,X is 2 2 times minus 3 plus 8 4 times 2 8 minus 6 plus 8 8 minus 6 2 2 plus 8 10 here X is 2 y is minus 3 plus 2 minus 7 times minus 3 2 times minus 3 minus 6 here plus 2 is they are already according to Bodnar's you have to multiply first minus into minus plus 21 minus 6 plus 2 minus 4 minus 4 plus 21 you get 17 determine the value of the following algebraic expressions when a equals 3 and B equals 5 so what you do first first we'll open brackets and then substitute 3 times 2 6 6 8 3 times 3 you get 9 so 9 B now substitute after you multiply now substitute the value 6 times 3 9 times 5 because B equals 5 and a equals 3 6 times 3 18 9 times 5 45 what's the addition 63 in this one you have given the same question we'll try in a different way earlier we multiplied and then simplify now we'll do we'll simplify inside brackets and then multiply by three so three is there two times a is 3 B equals 5 now simplify inside 3 times 2 6 3 times 5 15 3 times 6 plus 15 21 now multiply 3 and 21 3 times 1 3 3 times 2 6 so you are getting the same answer get the same as if simplify inside brackets or without removing bracket so you can do any method first you can multiply and simplify and then substitute or simplify inside the brackets and then multiply by the outside number remove the brackets and substitute the values so first remove the brackets 7 a plus 14 B substitute the values 7 times 3 plus 14 times 5 say 1 times 3 21 here 5 times 425 times 1 5 and 7 add it you get 91 
,,this one 4 times 3 12 a and 8 B substitute the values of 12 times 3 minus 8 times fun now simplify 12 times 3 36 8 times 5 40 36 minus 40 you get minus here 11 times 2 22 a plus 11b so 22 times a 3 because 566 plus 55 hundred twenty-one this one 9 times 3 27 a 9 x -2 18 B now multiply 27 times 3 and 18 times fun 3 times 7 21 two remaining 3 times 2 6 plus 2 81 minus 5 times 8 44 remaining so you get 90 81 minus 90 you get minus 9 determine the value when a equals 3 B equals -2 and C equals 
,,1 so just substitute the values 2 times 3 7 x minus 2 make sure you put brackets when you get negative numbers 3 times 1/6 minus minus plus 14 plus 3 so 6 plus 3 9 9 plus 14 23 this one 5 times 3/2 x minus 2 and 4 into 1 15 minus 4 plus 4 minus 4 plus 4 get canceled out you get 15 11 x equals 3 B equals -2 and C equals 1 according to what must do the multiplication first 11 times 3 33 minus 2 times minus 2 plus 4 and you get minus 3/4 minus 3/1 33 plus 130 in this one first simplify and then substitute values of the following algebraic expressions when a equals 5 because 3 and C equals -2 so you have given this expression so what you do first open brackets 2 where 2 B 3 B 3 C then what you do simplify the terms add the like terms to a you have to write as it is 2b and 3b becomes Phi B and 3c here now substitute the values equals 5 B equals 3 and C equals -2 2 times 5 10 5 times 3 15 minus 60 so but you get 10 minus 6 4 4 plus 15 19 this one first open brackets 3 a 3 times minus B minus 3 B 4 times B 4 B 4 times C minus 4 C here because there's a negative sign now I'd like terms 3-year you can't simplify minus 3 and plus 4 that's plus 1 B or B minus 4 C now substitute the values 3 a means multiplication 3 times a 3 times 5 B is 3 4 times minus 2 first multiplication according to but must 5 times 3 15 minus 4 minus 2 plus 8 so you get 8 plus 3 11 11 and 15 you get 26 this one first open brackets 3a plus 3b here to be and -2 C 5 C 5 a so each one you have to multiply by the outside number now like terms 3a and 5a 8 a 3 B and plus 2 B 5 B -2 C + + 5 C plus 3 C now multiply 8 times a what's the value for a a 5 3 minus 2 I'll write down here equals 5 B equals minus 3 B is 3 and C equals -2 C equals -2 so a is 5 B 3 C minus 2 8 times 5 14 15 here and -6 15 minus 6 you get 9 9 plus 40 49 this one 7 a 7 B minus 7 C and then plus 2a minus 2b minus 2 C when you multiply by 2 add like terms 7 + + 2 9 e 7 B and minus 2b + 5 b minus 7 and minus 2 minus 9 see now my tip life is five B's tricky and C is minus 2/9 times 5 45 five times three 15 and minus minus becomes plus nine times two eighteen now add all together 1018 one remaining five six seven so 78 is the answer this one you get fractions but same procedure just substitute the values for a eight over be sixteen over C so now substitute equals 2 so 4 over 2 8 / BBS for 16 over C C is 8 now you have to simplify first 4 divide by 2 you get 2 8 divided by 4 you get 2 16 divided by 8 you get 2 2 + 2 + 2 6 this one substitute the values a equals 2 2 divided by 2 B is 4 4 divided by 4 C equals 8 8 divided by 8 simplify division first 2 divided by 2 is 1 4 divided by 4 is 1 8 divided by 8 is 1 1 plus 1 plus 1 you get 3 this one substitute a B means a times B 2 times 4 plus BC means B times that's 4 times C means 8 minus C times a C is 8 and a equals to 8 32 16 so 32 minus 16 is 16 16 and 8 addition you get 24 now we will look at remove exercise complete the table given below algebraic expression is given unknown term of the algebraic expression coefficient of the unknown term terms of the algebraic expression and final column is mathematical operations in the order they appear in the algebraic expression so first of all what's the unknown letter X coefficient is the number in front of the letter that's three and these are called algebraic terms and what is the operation plus and multiplication is three times X now we look at the next one what's the letter here Y what's the coefficient of that term to what are the algebraic terms to Y and 4 and what's the operation first multiplication and then addition next one what's the algebraic letter B coefficient 4 and terms for P and minus hundred and the operation for times P that means multiply and then subtract this one P is the letter coefficient nothing means one terms PN minus 10 and what are the operations used 1 times P times and then - what's the later here in coefficient is + 3 terms 3 n n minus 7 and operation first multiply and then subtract question number two the length of a table is two meters more than its breadth write an algebraic expression for the length of the table by taking its breath as V when you take this table B is the bread length is 2 meters more than its brick so what's the expression B plus 2 back to write

,,by a number each term of the algebraic expression needs to be multiplied by the number that is the coefficient of each algebraic term should be multiplied by the given number and simplify so make sure that you multiply by the coefficient when multiplying an algebraic term by an algebraic term there our coefficients are much like first and then the unknowns are multiplied when multiplying an algebraic expression by an algebraic term every algebraic term of the algebraic expression needs to be multiplied by the given algebraic term by substituting values for the unknown terms of an algebraic expression we obtain a numerical value for the algebraic expression so when you are simplifying either you can simplify brackets first and then multiply or expand brackets and then substitute the values so practice all these questions examples and exercise and thorough with algebraic expressions

AlgebraicExpression,NybHckSEQBI,"Hi! This is Rob. Welcome to Math Antics. In this lesson, we're going to learn some really important things about a whole branch of math called Algebra. The first thing you need to know is that Algebra is a lot like arithmetic. It follows all the rules of arithmetic and it uses the same four main operations that arithmetic is built on: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. But Algebra introduces a new element... the element of the unknown. When you were learning arithmetic, the only thing that was ever unknown was the answer to the problem. For example, you might have the problem 1 + 2 = what? The answer isn't known until you go ahead and "
,,"do the arithmetic. Now the important thing about Algebra is that when we don't know what a number is yet, we use a symbol in its place. that symbol is usually just any letter of the alphabet. A really popular letter to choose is the letter 'x'. So in arithmetic, we would just leave the problem like this: 1 + 2 = ""blank"" and we'd write in the answer when we did the addition. But in Algebra, we'd write it like this:  1 + 2 = x The 'x' is a place holder that stands for the number that we don't know yet. What we have here is a very basic algebraic equation. An equation is just a mathematical statement that two things are equal. An equation says, ""the things on this side of the equal sign have the same value as the things on the other side of the equal sign."" In this case, our equation is telling us that the known values on this side (1+2) are equal to what's on the other side, which happens to be the unknown value that we are calling 'x'. One of the main goals in Algebra is to figure out what the unknown values in equations are. And when you do that, it's called ""solving the equations"". In this equation, it's pretty easy to see that the unknown value is just 3. All you have to do is actually add the 1 and 2 together on this side of the equation and it turns into 3 = x, which is the same as x = 3. So now we know what 'x' is!  It's just 3. That almost seems too easy, doesnt it? And that's why in Algebra, you are usually given an equation in a more complicated form like this: x - 2 = 1. This is exactly the same equation as 1 + 2 = x, but it has been rearranged so that it's not quite as easy to tell what 'x' is. So in Algebra, solving equations is a lot like a game where you are given mixed-up, complicated equations, and it's your job to simplify them and rearrange them until it is a nice simple equation (like x = 3) where it's easy to tell what the unknown values are. We're going to learn a lot more about how you actually do that (how you solve equations) in the next several videos, but for now, let's learn some important rules about how symbols can and can't be used in algebraic equations. The first rule you need to know is that the same symbol (or letter) can be used in different algebra problems to stand for different unknown values. For example, in the problem we just solved, the letter 'x' was used to stand for the number 3, right? But 'x' could stand for a different number in a different problem. Like, if someone asks us to solve the equation, 5 + x = 10. In order for the two sides of this equation to be equal, 'x' must have the value '5' in this problem, because 5 + 5 = 10. So 'x' (or any other symbol) can stand for different values in different problems. That's okay, but what's NOT okay is for a symbol to stand for different values in the same problem at the same time! For example, what if you had the equation: x + x = 10? This equation says that if we add 'x' to 'x' we will get 10. And there are a lot of different numbers we could add together to get 10, like 6 and 4. But, if we had the first 'x' stand for 6 and the second 'x' stand for 4, then 'x' would stand for two different value at the same time and things could get really confusing! If you wanted symbols to stand for two different numbers at the same time, you would need to use two different symbols, like 'x' and 'y'. So in Algebra, whenever you see the same symbol repeated more than once in an equation, it's representing the same unknown value. Like if you see a really complicated Algebraic equation (like this), where 'x' is repeated a lot of different times, all of those 'x's stand for the same value, and it will be your job to figure out what that value is. Okay, so for any particular equation, we can't use the same letter to represent two different numbers at the same time, but what about the other way around? Could we use two different letters to represent the same number? Yes! - Here's an example of that. Let's say you have the equation: a + b = 2 What could 'a' and 'b' stand for so that the equation is true? Well, If 'a' was 0 and 'b' was 2, then the equation would be true. Or, we could switch them around. If 'a' was 2 and 'b' was 0, the equation would also be true. But there's another possibility: If 'a' was 1 and 'b' was also 1, that would make the equation true, right? So, even though 'a' and 'b' are different symbols, and would usually be used to represent different numbers, there are times when they might happen to represent the same number. Oh, and this problem can help us understand something very important about how symbols are used in Algebra. Did you notice that there were different possible solution for this equation? In other words, 'b' could have the value 0, 1, or 2 depending on what the value of 'a' was. If 'a' is 0 then 'b' must be 2 If 'a' is 1 then 'b' must be 1 If 'a' is 2 then 'b' must be 0 'b' can't have two different values at the same time, but it's value can change over time if the value of 'a' changes. In Algebra, 'b' is what's called a ""variable"" because it's value can 'vary' or change. In fact, in this equation, both 'a' and 'b' are variables because their values will change depending on the value of each other. Actually, it's really common in Algebra to refer to any letter as a variable, "
,,"since letters can stand for different values in different problems. But at Math Antics, we'll usually just use the word ""variable"" when we're talking about values that can change or vary in the same problem. Alright, so far we've learned that Algebra is a lot like arithmetic, but that in includes unknown values and variables that we can solve for in equations. There's one other really important thing that I want to teach you that will help you understand what's going on in a lot of Algebra "
,,"problems, and it has to do with multiplication. Here are the four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Although in Algebra, you'll usually see division written in fraction form, like this. In Arithmetic, all four operations have the same status, but in Algebra, multiplication get's some special treatment. In Algebra, multiplication is the 'default' operation. That means, if no other arithmetic operation is shown between two symbols, then you can just assume they're being multiplied. The multiplication is 'implied'. For example, instead of writing 'a' times 'b', you can leave out the times symbol and just write 'ab'. Since no operation is shown between these two symbols, you know that you're supposed to multiply 'a' and 'b'. Of course, you can't actually multiply 'a' and "
,,"'b' until you figure out what numbers they stand for. The advantage of this rule about multiplication is that it makes many algebraic equations less cluttered and easier to write down. For example, instead of this: a * b + c * d = 10 You could just write: ab + cd = 10. You can also use this shorthand when you are multiplying a variable and a known number... like 2x, which means the same thing as 2 times 'x' or 3y which means the same thing as 3 times 'y' Since the symbol and the number are "
,,"right next to each other, the multiplication is implied. You don't have to write it down. Finally some good news! Now I never have to write down that pesky multiplication symbol again! Oh yeah!! Ah, not so fast... there are some cases in Algebra where still need to use a multiplication symbol. For example, what if you want to show 2 x 5? If you just get rid of the times symbol and put the '2' right next to the '5', it's going to look like the two-digit number twenty-five, which is NOT the same as 2 x 5. So, whenever you need to show multiplication between two known numbers, you still have to use the times symbol, unless... you use parentheses instead. "
,,"But aren't parentheses used to show grouping in math? How can you use that to show multiplication? Ah, that's a good question. Parentheses are used to group things, "
,,"but whenever you put two groups right next to each other, with no operation between them, guess what operation is implied. Yep!  Multiplication! For example, if you "
,,"see the this, it means that the group (a+b) is being multiplied by the group (x+y). We could put a times symbol between the groups, but we don't have to because it's the default operation in Algebra. The multiplication is just implied. So, going back to our problem: 2 x 5 If you wanted to, you could put each of the numbers inside parentheses like this, and then you could get rid of the multiplication sign. Now this can't be confused with the number twenty-five, and since the groups are right next to each other, you know that you need to multiply them. Of course, it might seem strange to have just one thing inside 'group' symbols like this, but it's okay to do that in math. An alternate way that you could do the same thing would be to put just one of the numbers in parentheses, like this. Again, you won't confuse this with a two-digit number and you know that multiplication is implied. Okay, so we've learned that Algebra is a lot like arithmetic, but it involves unknown values or variables that we need to solve for. And we learned that in Algebra, the multiplication sign is usually not shown, because it's the default operation. You can just assume that two things right next to each other are being multiplied. But why do we even care about Algebra? Is it good for anything in the 'real world'? or is it just a bunch of tricky problems that keep students busy in school? Actually, Algebra is very useful for describing or ""modeling""  things in the real world. It's a little hard to see that when you are just looking at all these numbers and symbols on the page of a math book. But, it's a lot easier to see when you start taking algebraic equations and graphing their solutions. Graphing an equation is like using its different solutions to draw simple lines and curves that can be used to describe and predict things in real life. For example, there's a whole class of equations in Algebra called ""linear"" equations because they form straight lines when you graph them. Those sorts of equations could help you describe the slope of a roof or tell you how long it will take to get somewhere. Another class of algebraic equations, called ""quadratic"" equations can be used to design telescope lenses, or describe how a ball flies through the air, or predict the growth of a population. So Algebra is used all the time in fields like science, engineering, economics and computer programming. And even though you might not need Algebra to get by in your day to "
,,"day life,... ...so divide both sides by 3. That means x = 42. So... in three... two... one... YES!! Alright... now to see how much butter I need. It's still a very useful part of math. Thanks for watching Math Antics,"

AlgebraicExpression,20BYGqGufY8,are they grenades and welcome to worksheet cloud maths my name is Joe Milligan and I'm going to take you through some facts about algebraic expressions first of all 
,,how to write them then how to simplify them and then how to evaluate them okay if at any stage you don't understand anything and you want to ask a question remember 
,,to just send an email to that email address at the bottom of your page and somebody will get back to you right first of all we have to look at what an algebraic expression actually is it indicates a sequence of calculations that can also be described in words or with a flow diagram so for example multiply a number by 2 and add 6 to the answer that is in words as you can see this would be the flow diagram for that sentence and it's an unknown number x bar 2 and added 6 and that as an algebraic expression would look like that X plus 2 or sorry x times 2 plus 6 okay that would be the expression it's written an algebraic form okay so your expression would 
,,actually look like this 2x plus 6 remember the X is the unknown value you can call that unknown value anything you'd like you can call it a or b or Y or CID but for 
,,today's lesson we're going to refer to unknown values as X okay now you try see if you can write that as an expression two times a number added to three times the same number okay did you get that 2 times X plus 3 times X and if we make it simpler it would just be 2x plus 3x okay right let's go on let's break this down two times a number added to three times the same number okay now give it give the unknown number a name like I said earlier you can give it any name you like but today we are going to call it X so both are no numbers have the same value and they can both be called X if you choose to use y both of them would be called Y okay so these words then translate to 2 times X plus 3 times X as an algebraic expression and can also then be written 2x plus 3x which just looks a whole lot tidier okay let's try one more half a number subtracted from five times of that number it would be 5 X minus 1/2 X you might have written half X minus 5 X but let me explain to you why it's the other way around okay we break this one down we've got half of a number subtracted from 5 times that same number okay if the same number is we're dealing with only one unknown value so we can give it them both the same name and we will call it X again and so we are then we need to look at the word from in this case yeah because we are subtracting 1/2 X from 5 times X so we need to write it 5x minus 1/2 X it would be like me asking you to subtract 2 from 3 if you were to write that it would be 3 minus 2 okay let's go on you can try these now all on your own so you can pause the video and you can try them out and then we'll go over them together right let's see what you did the first one is a number less 7 again you can call it a B why is it whatever you'd like to call it we're going to call it X again and that would be X minus 7 see this time wasn't from 7 it was a number less 7 that means you subtract the 7 from the number okay half of a number added to 6 that would be 1/2 X plus 6 or 6 plus 1/2 X remember adding we can write it any which way we lack any way around okay the next one times a number divided by 2 would be 9x divided by 2 next one 3 times a number increased by 4 you've got it 3x plus 4 and then 1/4 of a number subtracted from 8 remember these are from again let's have a look it would be 8 minus 1/4 X well done guys I'm sure you got those all rights right now we're going to look and see how we can simplify the expressions okay five times a number add it to six times the same number and then subtract 4 wow that seems like quite a long sentence but let's go through it slowly 5x plus 6x minus 4 now because you've got 5x and a 6x those are both the same unknown numbers so we could say we can put them together and say it's 11x minus 4 can you see that you've got an unknown number of that X and that X 5 of those and 6 of the same things you'd get 11 of them if I were to say to you for 5x and 6x then you could say I've got 11x it would 
,,be the same kind of thing see right now you can try try those ones pause the video again have a go and we'll go over them together right let's see how you did two times a number subtracted from 3 times the same number would give you 3 minus 2x is the and then it would be the same as just plain X because you've got three X's and 
,,you - includes from that you left with 1x right the second one for added to a number and subtract 2 times the same number let's see what happens yeah we've got 4 plus an unknown X minus 2x so yeah we've got a positive x and a negative x so if you have minus 2x and you add on an X you she just got EXO it would be four minus X let's go over that one just one more time you've got a positive excellent you - in two x's from it you would end up in with a negative x so it'll be 4 minus X instead of 4 plus X right let's go over the next one and number added to 7 and 3 times that number is subtracted let's see what happens ya X plus 7 minus 3 X again you've got a positive X if there's nothing in front of it it means it's positive and see how you've got a minus 3 X so you adding an X 1 to your minus 3 X so then you would end up with 7 minus 2x you could possibly also write it minus 2x plus 7 it just looks a little bit more messy right so far we've looked at writing algebraic expressions from words and how to simplify the expression now we're going to look at how to evaluate these expressions ok we can only evaluate an expression if we are given the value of x and remember the X is the unknown number so we can't give an expression of value unless we are actually given the value of that X so let's have a look at so if we are told X is equal to 3 then we can work out the value of the expression 2x minus 1 and how do we do this well we would substitute the 3 into the expression in the position of X so it would be 3 2 times 3 minus 1 so we would write it like that or we can write it like that the only reason I wrote it like that was because the X looks sits next to the tooth so it's the same thing 2 times 3 and then minus 1 okay because we now have an actual value we can carry out the operations and the expression to find the answer so 2 times 3 would be 6 and 6 minus 1 would give me 5 rights have you got it so let's go over that again we can only substitute in when we are given the value of the X so we the value up here we are told that X is equal to 3 so 2 times 3 would give me 6 6 minus 1 is 5 and that would be the value of that expression right let's go on to your turn now I want you to find the value of the expression X minus 2 X where X is equal to 2 you can pause the video and 
,,you can try that out and then we'll go over it okay so what's the value of your expression for let's break it down we've got 8 minus 2x where the X is equal to 2 so 
,,it's 8 minus 2 times 2 that's 8 minus 4 and so the value of your expression is 4 okay try those on your own grab a piece of paper write them down pause the video and work them out okay how well did you do 8 minus 2 X where X is equal to 3 we're going to substitute the 3 in for the X so it would be 8 minus 2 times 3x minus 6 which gives me 2 5x minus 7 where X is equal to 2 same thing we're going to go 5 times 2 2 is in place of the X which gives me 10 minus 7 is 3 one thing here you have to write out the whole expression so I can't just write 5 times 2 because I've got an equal sign so my equal sign tells me that what is on this line is actually exactly the same value as to what is on that line so if I left off the 7 5 times 2 does not give me 5x minus 7 it doesn't equal that so we must just be very careful with how we write things down see okay number three 1/2 X where X is 10 half of 10 we all know is 5 3 times 2 X where X is 4 again we're going to substitute in for the X where it's 4 it will be 3 times and in brackets 2 times 4 so we'll do that first then we'll go 2 times 4 is 8 3 times 8 is 24 the next one 3x plus 2x again we substituting in 3 X + 2 X X here is 5 so 5 3 times 5 plus 2 times 5 will be 15 plus 10 and that gives you 25 I hope you all got that but let's look at the next thing remember when we simplified the expression while that last one we could probably simplify so in question 5 was 3x + 2 X where X was equal to 5 so because your variables are the same your unknowns are the same can add them together before you substitute it in so we got 3x + 2 X and that's the same as 5x remember when we simplify the expressions we looked at putting those together okay so X is equal to 5 and we can then multiply it 5 times 5 and we end up with 25 so the answer to that expression would be 25 that is the same answer as what you got when you did when you didn't simplify the expression and you kept the two terms apart it would be 3 times 5 + 2 times 5 which is 15 plus 10 and you also end up with 25 can you see you got the same answer so you could do it either way around you would end up with the same answer right let's look at see if it works for another example where 2 X + 4 X + X is equal to 3 we've got 2 times 3 plus 4 times 3 that's 6 plus 12 and it gives me an answer of 18 or we could go to X plus 4 X is 6 X 6 times 3 is 18 can you see same answer so whichever way suits you to work it out you can work it out like that you're going to get the same answer either way around right let's draw on everything you have learned today to try these ok you can pause the video again try those art and we'll go over them together right let's see how you did 2 times a number subtracted from 3 times the same number we've got 3 X minus 2 X and that would eggs we haven't been given the the value of the X so we can just simplify them right for added to 2 times a number and subtract the same number is 4 + 2 X - X would be 4 + X a number subtracted from 7 and 3 times that number is added it's 7 - x + 3 X and that would give you 7 minus 2 X right it's just revised what you've gone over today what we've learned so you've learned how to first of all write an expression in words then you learned how to simplify the expression and how to evaluate the expression when given a value for the unknown number see I made a little mistake here it's hard to simplify the expression not and expression and how do you evaluate the expression when given a value for the unknown number now you can try the activity that is being posted and then you can check it with the memo thank you for joining us today great and I hope you've understood everything just remember if you haven't understood anything at all you can email in and the email address has been on each side so you can go back and check it it is also an activity worksheet and somebody will get back to you with an answer or an explanation thank you for listening today

AlgebraicExpression,LDIiYKYvvdA,"Hi, Im Rob. Welcome to Math Antics. In the last two Algebra videos, we learned how to solve simple equations that had only one arithmetic operation in them. But often, equations have many different operations which makes solving them a little more complicated. In this video, were going to learn how to solve equations that have just two math operations in them. one addition or subtraction operation, and one multiplication or division operation. And the concepts you learn in this video will help you solve even more complicated equations in the future. Now as you might expect, equations that have two arithmetic operations in them are going to require two different steps to solve them. In other words, to get the unknown all by itself, youll need to undo two operations. But that doesnt sound too hard, right? I mean we learned how to do undo any arithmetic operation in the last two videos. And thats true.  But there are a couple of reason that make two-step equations a little trickier to solve. The first is that there are a lot more possible combinations of those two operations. And the second is that, when theres more than one operation, you have to decide what order to undo those operations in. Uhhello! If you need to know what order to do operations in, just follow the Order of Operations rules! You DID watch that video, didnt you? I sure did! But the Order of Operations rules tell us what order to DO operations not what order to UNDO them! UhWellthen could we REVERSE the order since were UN-doing operations? Now thats a good idea. Well of course it is! When solving multi-step equations, thats basically what were going to do. Using the Order of Operations rules in reverse can help us know what order to undo operations in, but it can be a little tricky actually putting it into practice. So to see how it works, lets start by solving a very simple two-step equation:  2x + 2 = 8. In this equation, the unknown value x is involved "
,,"in two different operations addition and multiplication (which is implied between the first 2 and the x) And to undo those two operations, we need to use their inverse operations subtraction and division. But the question is, which one should we do first? Like many things in life, the order we decide to do things in can make a big difference. Ah, come on! Theres gotta be an easier way! [voice from off screen] First socks, then shoes. Fortunately, in math, we have a special set of rules that tell us what order to do operations in. Those rules tell us to do operations inside parentheses (or other groups) first. And then we do exponent, and then multiplication and division, and last of all, we do addition and subtraction. Those are the rules you need to follow when simplifying mathematical expressions or equations. But solving an equation is different because we are trying to UNDO any operations that the unknown value is involved with so that the unknown value will be all by itself. So when solving equations, the best strategy is to apply those Order of Operations rules in reverse. Using the reverse Order of Operations is not the only way to solve a multi-step equation, but its usually the easiest way. Just like its much easier to take your shoes and socks off in the reverse order that you put them on! Ahhhhh!  Are you sure its socks before shoes? Since the Order of Operations rules tell us to DO multiplication before we DO addition. We should UNDO addition before we UNDO multiplication. So first, we undo the addition by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation. On the first side, the plus 2 and the minus 2 cancel each other out, leaving just 2x on that side. And on the other side we have 8 minus 2 which is 6. Next, we can undo the multiplication by dividing both sides of the equation by 2. On the first side, the 2s cancel, leaving x all by itself. And on the other side, we have 6 divided by 2 which is just 3. There weve solved the equation using the Order of Operations rules in reverse, and now we know that x = 3. That wasnt so bad, was it? Lets try solving another simple two-step "
,,"equation that has division and subtraction in it: x/2 - 1 = 4. Again, were going to apply the Order of Operations rules in reverse to undo the subtraction and the division operations. Since we would normally DO the subtraction last, were going to UNDO it first. To undo the subtraction, we add '1' to both sides of the equation. On the first side, the minus 1 and the plus 1 cancel out, leaving just x over 2 on that side. And on the other side, we have 4 plus 1 which is 5. And then, to undo the divided by 2, we need to multiply both sides by 2. On the first side, the 2s cancel, leaving x all by itself. And on the other side, we have 2 times "
,,"5 which is 10. So our answer is x = 10. Those examples are pretty easy, right? But solving two-step equations gets a bit trickier thanks to a little something in math called groups. Do you remember how parentheses are used to group things in math? And our Order of Operations rules say we are supposed to do any operations that "
,,"are inside parentheses first. In other words, we need to do operations that are inside of groups first. Well guess what? That means that when were solving equations and UN-doing operations, we need to wait to do groups LAST of all. To see what I mean, lets solve this equation, which looks very similar to the first one we solved. The only difference is that a set of parentheses has been used to group this x + 2 together. And even though that might not seem like much of a change, it makes a big difference for our answer. Thats because, in the original equation, this first 2 is only being multiplied by the x, but in the new equation, its being multiplied by the entire quantity (or group) x + 2. And thats going to change how we solve it. Were still going to follow our Order of Operations rules in reverse, but "
,,"now that the x + 2 is inside parentheses (which means that its part of a group), were going to undo THAT operation last. Since we are supposed to DO operations in "
,,"groups first, that means were going to UNDO operations in groups last. So in this problem, we should start by undoing the multiplication that's implied between the "
,,"2 and the group (x + 2) To do that, we divide both sides of the equation by 2. On the first side, the 2 on the top and the 2 on the bottom cancel, leaving the group "
,,"(x + 2) on that side. And on the other side, we have 8 divided by 2 which is 4. That looks simpler already!  And we can make it even simpler than that, because now that theres nothing else on that side of the equal sign with the group (x + 2) we really dont even need the parentheses any more. Next, we just need to subtract 2 from both sides. On the first side, the plus 2 and the minus 2 cancel out, leaving x all by itself, and on the other side we have 4 minus 2, which is 2. So for "
,,"this equation, x = 2. And now you can see how grouping operations differently in our equation results in different answers. Lets try one more important example. Do "
,,"you remember the second equation we solved?  x/2 - 1 = 4 In this equation, the 1 is being subtracted from the entire x over 2 term. But take a look at this slightly different equation. This looks a lot like the original equation, but now that the '1' is up on top of the fraction line, its only being subtracted from the x and NOT the 2. The x - 1 on top forms a group. Hold on!  How can the x - 1 be a group? I dont see any parentheses or brackets around it. Ah, thats a good question! In Algebra, the fraction line is used as a way to automatically group things that are above it or things that are below it. For example, in this fancy algebraic expression, everything thats on top of the fraction line forms a group and everything on the bottom of the line forms another group. Of course, we could put parentheses there if we wanted to make it really clear, but its not required. Grouping above and below a fraction line is just implied in Algebra. Getting back to our new problem, now that we know that the x - 1 on the top of the fraction line is an implied group, as we learned in the last example, were going to wait and undo the "
,,"operation inside that group last. So the first step is to undo the divided by 2 by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2. On the first side, the 2 on top and the 2 on the bottom will cancel out, leaving just our implied group x - 1 on that side. And on the other side, we have 4 times 2 which is 8. Next, we can undo the operation inside the group by adding '1' to both sides. On the first side, the minus 1 and the plus 1 cancel, leaving x all by itself. And on the other side, "
,,"we have 8 plus 1 which is 9.  So in this equation, x = 9. Alright  As you can see, solving two-step equations is definitely more complicated than single step equations because there are so many different combinations and different ways to group things. But if you just take things one step at a time and remember to UNDO operations using the REVERSE Order of Operations rules, it will be much easier. Just pay close attention to how things are grouped in an equation and be on the lookout for  "
,,"those implied groups on the top and bottom of a fraction line. And, because there are so many variations of these two-step equations, its really important to practice by trying to solve lots of different problems.

,,2 y 11 minus 2 plus 9 substituting fractions - algebraic terms X is half you asked to find out 4 X plus 5 so substitute 4 times 1/2 plus 5 here you can see you can simplify the denominator with the numerator 1 and here so you get 2 + 5 that's 7 equals 1/3 9a plus 2/9 times 1/3 + 2 here 3 times 1/3 times 3 3 + 2 you get 5 x equals 2/3 now 9 x + 1 9 times 2/3 plus 1/3 times 1/3 times 3 so 3 times 2 6 6 + 1 7 here 11 minus 3 when a equals minus 2/3 11 minus 3 times minus 2 over 3 will put brackets here 3 + 3 get cancel out you get 11 minus into minus plus 11 plus 2 answer yes 13 equals 1/2 B equals 1/3 so this should be simple B so we'll substitute the values for a equals 1/2 we cause 1/3 2 times 1/2 times 2 so what's the answer 2 + here are 3 in one three two one so one day three to plus one you'll get three six a six times 1/2 minus 3 times 1/3 substitute a and B two times three three get cancelled out so what's remaining 3 here 1 3 minus 1 is 2 8 E is 1/2 B is 1/3 2 times 1/2 times 4 3 times 1/3 times 2 here 4-2 ours is to 18 times 1/2 six times one thirty two and nine three bit too so what's the final answer nine minus two answer is seven if x equals 2/3 and y equals 1/2 find the value of the following algebraic expressions 6 times 2/3 2 times 1/2 3 times 1/3 times 2 2 times 1/2 times 1/2 times 2 4 here plus one times one one four plus one you get five this one 9 times X what is X X is 2/3 4 times 1/2 3 times 1/3 times 3 2 times 1/2 times 2 so 3 times 2 is 6 2 times 1 is 2 6 minus 2 same question another part 12 X is 2/3 - why why is half substitute 3 times 1/3 times 4 4 times 2 eight here - when to get canceled out you get one there 8 + 1 9 9 X is 2/3 minus 2 times 1/2 3 n here 3 3 times 2 6 2 + 2 get cancelled out you get minus 1 6 - 1 answer is 5 find the value of value if P equals 1/3 so substitute 1/3 for P simplify first 3 times 2 6 2 + 4 that's 6 9 P minus 2/9 times P is 1/3 minus 2 here simplify 3 + 3 3 - 2 you get 12 P P is 1/3 + 3 3 times 1 3 times 4 4 + 3 you get 7 3 P plus 11 3 into 1/3 + ulema 3 + 3 get cancel out 1 plus 11 is 12 so you need to simplify the fractional part that's multiplication and then do the addition find the value if M equals to 4 times 2 + 11 8 plus 11 that's 19 6 times 2 plus 5 multiplication first 12 + 5 17 10 times 2 - 1 xx - 1 that's 19 8 times 2 plus 10 8 times 2 16 + 10 26 find the value when x equals 2l y equals 1/3 for X is 2 y is 138 plus 1/3 how can you write you can write 8 full parts and 135 X plus 3 by 5 X that's not bad by 2 3 y 1/3 is there 3 3 get cancelled out so 10 plus 1 the answer is either 1 another one 8 times 2 minus 6 times 1/3 3 and here too you get 6 8 times 2 16 minus 2 answer is 14 again this one 10 times 2 minus 9 times white why is 1/3 3 times 1/3 times 3 10 times 2 20 minus 3 answer is 17 find the value of M equals 1/2 and in equals 1/2 for these expressions 8m a miss half in Miss 152 times 4 here are 5 times 2 4 times 1 4 2 times 1 2 4 minus 2 you get to do the same thing 16mm is 1/2 it needs 152 with 16 you get eight five and five get canceled out 8 minus 1 is 7 10 mm is half a Miss 152 and ten five five and this 1 so 5 plus 1 you get 6 6 times mm is 1/2 minus 15 times n that's one field to end is 3 5 times 3 15 so you get 3 minus 3 answer is 0 binomial expressions what is 
,,bi means two so expressions means when you get two terms 3x plus 4y is binomial expression X minus 5i so all these are binomial expressions so there are two terms in all these expressions due to one term or both of these terms are algebraic terms these are called binomial algebraic expressions so here one term is constant and the other one is algebraic term here both terms are algebraic terms product of two binomial expressions now X plus 2 is a binomial expression X plus 3 or so another binomial expression now we'll try to multiply these two so this is the product of both binary expressions or binomial expressions expand the brackets and simplify as much as possible now we'll try to do that using this method so we are multiplying here X plus 3 they are we can write x plus 2 here X plus 2 this way row wise X plus 
,,3 column wise X plus 2 so we can use multiply row and columns X into X we know this is X square X into plus 3 plus 3x this one 2 into X plus 2 X 2 into 3 plus 6 so what's the answer when you multiply using this method you get x squared - 3 X 2 X + 6 now simplify I can simplify these two - 3 + 2 5 X + 6 so that's how we can multiply using this method now we'll do the same thing X + 3 is there x + 5 X into X x squared X into 5 5 X 3 into X 3 X 3 into 5 15 so what are the values you are getting here when you multiply you get x squared - 5 X 3x + 15 so when you simplify you get 8x plus 15 - the same thing a plus 4a plus 4a into a a square into 4 4 a 5 into a 5 a 5 into 4 20 so when you multiply you get all these terms so a square plus 4 plus 5a plus 20 so when you can so you can add these to phibn for where you get 9e and this is 20 similar to that one y + 3 y + 7 Y into y Y square my into 3 3 by 7 into y 7y 7 into 3 20 so what's the answer Y squared 3 by 7 y + 20 bucks so these 
,,two terms you can add you get 10 buy and here are twenty one this one now - so a minus two so you can write in one color - to a +3 here a squared - 2 way here plus 3 a + -6 - into + - now what are the terms you are getting a squared minus 2a plus 3 and minus 6 so simply 5 3 - 2 + 1 that's a minus 6 this was X - 5 X - 2 so we need to multiply X into X X square X into minus 5 minus 5 X here you get minus 2 X minus 2 into minus 5 that's + step write down the terms and simplify x squared minus 
,,5 minus 2 minus 7 and you'll get 10 here similar to that one a minus 7 a minus 3 a into a a square minus 7 8 - 3 times a minus 3 a minus 3 times minus 7 plus 25 so what are the terms you are getting a squared minus 7 a minus 3 a + 21 a squared - 7 + -3 minus 10 plus 21 expand and simplify so we'll take the whole expression multiplied with this and this so you get a into a plus 2 here 3 with a plus 2 now expand brackets a into a square plus 2 a 3 into a 3a plus 6 so you get a squared 2a and 
,,3a v b +6 this one through the same thing the whole expression multiplied with this one X into X minus 2 5 into X minus 2 then expand brackets x squared minus 2x plus 5 X minus 10 so x squared minus 2 plus 5 that's plus 3x minus 10 this one this whole expression with this end this p with p + 5 + -7 b 3 plus 5p squared plus 5p minus 7 P minus 35 so you get P squared minus 7 and plus 5 minus 2p minus 35 this one Y with Y minus 3 and minus 4 with Y minus 3 so this term multiplied by these two 
,,terms Y squared minus 3y minus 4y plus 12 so you get Y squared minus 3 minus 4 minus 7y then you get plus expand and simplify again we can write a plus 3 expression 
,,with a plus 7 with this now expand a square plus 3 plus seventy plus 21 but you get a squared 3 a + 7 a 10 a plus 21 what about this one y with y + 7 + 4 with y + 7 
,,now multiply Y into y y square and 4y plus 28 four times seven simplify y squared 7 plus 4 11 y plus 28 this one a minus 3 times M plus 4 times M minus 3 M into M M 
,,squared minus 3 M 4 M minus 12 so you get M squared minus 3 plus 4 plus M minus 12 what about this one p + 7 x p + + 8 x p + 7 you get P squared + 7 p 8 b + 56 p square 7 p + 8 P 15 P Plus 56 look at this one P with P minus 8 and the other one is minus 3 with P minus 8 expand brackets you get V squared minus 18 minus 3 P plus 24 P square 8 + 3 11 so this is minus 24 there this one X with X - 4 - 7 with X - 4 x squared minus 4 X minus 7 X + 28 x squared minus 4 X and minus 7 X minus 11 X and here plus 28 here 4 into 6 + P + + P into 6 + p expand separately 24 + 4 p here 6 P plus P squared so 24 is there here 6 plus 4 10 plus P Square what about this one 4 is there 7 - why - why with 7 - what 4 times 7 28 here - 4 y minus 7y plus y square answer is 28 minus 4 minus 7 minus 11 y + y squared there this one a with a - 
,,8 + 8 with a minus 8a squared - 8 8 plus 8 a + 64 minus 64 a squared - 8 e + 8 a get cancel out you get minus 68 so this one P into P minus 4 and plus 4 with P minus 4p squared - 4 p + 4 P minus 16 yeah also me the term get canceled out P squared minus 16 is what seven with seven plus M minus M with seven plus M when you simplify expand brackets 49 + 7 m - 7 M minus M Squared so what's the value 49 minus M Squared because this these two terms get cancelled out so what are these actually can you remember difference between two squared terms so you get square terms here and here this one give it to a plus three minus five it to a plus three to a squared 
,,plus 3a minus 10y minus fifteen simplify you get 2a squared - 7 8 - 15 question number 19 expand using the arrow now we'll use another method we call it rainbow method or foil so I'll show you how to do that at once without writing separate brackets this one first with first number so that's F a into a that's a square that's F first with first that's the arrow number one now we are taking oh-oh means outside values so outside here with outside that's the second one a with eight get 8a that's outside I mean inside with inside so inside with inside that's number three three with you get three that's I thought 1l l means last with last two last week last 
,,that's fourth one three with eight you get 24 that's so we call this method is foil method first with first outside with outside inside with inside last with last oh they call it rainbow meter this is like a rainbow this one this one this one rainbow so we can call it rainbow method now we'll practice rainbow method or foil method you put the arrows first first with first why square then Oh outside numbers so why then inside 7y and l-last values 28 y squared plus 11 y plus 28 now do the same thing this one p square then the second one is this +7 p third one is minus 2p fourth one is minus 14 simplify you get 7 minus 2 plus 5p this one use rainbow or foil method first with first then outside numbers inside numbers and then last two values simplify you get M Squared 8 minus 7 plus M minus 56 that's why first with first 48 this with this 8 be inside six feet and outside numbers last last numbers P Square this one 48 + 8 + 6 14 P plus P squared rainbow method a squared + AC plus

AlgebraicExpression,v-6MShC82ow,"Hi, Im Rob.  Welcome to Math Antics! In this lesson, were going to talk about the Distributive Property, which is a really useful tool in Algebra. And if you watched our video called The Distributive Property in Arithmetic, then you already know the basics of how the Distributive Property works. The key idea is that the Distributive Property allows you to take a factor and distribute it to each member of a group of things that are being added or subtracted. Instead of multiplying the factor by the entire group as a whole, you can distribute it to be multiplied by each member of the group individually. And in that previous video, we saw how you can take a problem like: 3 times the group (4 + 6) and simplify it two different ways. You could either simplify what was in the group first, OR you could use the distributive property to distribute a copy of the factor 3 to each member of the group, and no matter which way you go, you get the same answer. But in Algebra, things are a little more complicated, because we arent just working with known numbers. Algebra involves unknown values and variables, right? So in Algebra, you might have an expression like this:  3 times the group (x + 6). In this expression, we dont know what value x is. It could be 4 like in the last expression, but it doesnt have to be. It could be ANY number at all!  And since we dont know what it is, that means we CANT simplify the group first in this case. Our only option here is to "
,,"either leave the expression just like it is and not simplify it at all, OR to use the Distributive Property to eliminate the group. Just like in the arithmetic video, we can distribute a copy of the 3 times to each member of the group so the group goes away and we end up with 3 times x plus 3 times 6. The 3 time x cant be simplified any further because we still dont know what x is, but we can simplify 3 times 6 and just write 18. So the distributed form of this expression is: 3x + 18 And even though we cant simplify these expressions all the way down to a single numeric answer without knowing the value of x, we do know that these two forms of the expression are equivalent because they follow the distributive property. So the Distributive Property works exactly the same way whether your working with numbers or variables. In fact, in Algebra, youll often see the Distributive Property shown like this: a times the group (b + c) equals ab + ac Or you might see it with different letters, like x, y, and z, but the pattern will be the same. This pattern is just telling you that these two forms are equivalent. In the first form, the factor a is being multiplied by the entire group. But in the second form, the factor a has been distributed so its being multiplied by each member of the group individually. And if youre looking at this thinking, what multiplication?, remember that multiplication is the default operation which is why we dont have to show it in this pattern. Since the a is right next to the group, it means its being multiplied by the group, and on this other side, since the copies of the a are right next to the b and c, it means they are being multiplied also. And even though this pattern is usually shown with addition in the group, remember that "
,,"it also works for subtraction since subtraction is the same as negative addition. But the distributive property does NOT apply to group members that are being multiplied or divided. Okay, so this is the basic pattern of the Distributive Property. Its usually just shown with two members in the group, but remember that it works for groups of any size. We could have a times the group (b + c + d) and the equivalent distributed form would be: ab + ac + ad Heres a few quick examples that "
,,have a combination of numbers and variables to help you see the patterns of the Distributive property: 2 times the group (x + y + z) can be changed into the distributed form:  2x + 2y + 2z 10 times the group (a - b + 4) can be changed into the distributed form: 10a - 10b + 10 times 4 (which is 40). And a times the group (x - 
,,"y + 2) can be changed into the distributed form: ax - ay + a2 (or 2a which is more proper). So whether youre dealing with numbers or variables or both, the key concept is that the factor outside the group gets distributed to each term in the group. Each TERM in the group? But I thought terms were parts of polynomials, and I "
,,"thought we were WAY past all that by now! Ah - I was hoping you would notice that. And in fact, the members of these groups really are just simple terms in a Polynomial. Well thats what Im here for noticing things. Ooooo! - A butterfly!! Realizing that these groups of things being added or subtracted are really just Polynomials will help you see why the Distributive Property is SO useful in Algebra. For example, in this simple expression:  2 times the group (x + y) the x and the y "
,,"are simple terms in the polynomial x + y. Each of the terms has a variable part but no number part. And if we apply the Distributive Property to the group, we get the equivalent form: 2x + 2y But what if the polynomial was just a little bit more complicated? like this:  2 times the group (3x + 5y) In this expression, each of the terms in the polynomial DOES have a number part that is being multiplied by the variable part. But we can still use the Distributive Property to distribute a copy "
,,of the factor 2 to each term in the polynomial. Wait just a second here! I NOTICED earlier that you said the Distributive Property does NOT work with members of a 
,,"group that are being multiplied, and I also NOTICED that these terms DO have multiplication. Whats up with that? Ah Thats a good question! And it can be a little "
,,"confusing to see how it all works at first. But notice that even though the terms do have multiplication in them, the terms THEMSELVES are being added. So we distributed a copy of the factor 2 to each whole term, but NOT to each part of a term. In other words, we treat each term in a polynomial as a individual member of the group, even if that term has multiplication going on inside of it (which is common since there is often a variable part and number part being multiplied together). Getting back to our example  Distributing the factor 2 to each term gives us 2 times 3x plus 2 times 5y. But this can be simplified even further because we know that 2 times 3 is just 6 and 2 times 5 is just 10. So the distributed form is:  6x + 10y Lets try another example of a factor times a polynomial: 4 times the group (x squared + 3x - 5). First we need to identify the terms of this polynomial so when we distribute the factor, we just make one copy of it for each term. This "
,,"polynomial has three terms: x squared, positive 3x and negative 5. So we distribute a copy of the factor 4 to each term and we get: 4 times x squared (or just "
,,"4 x squared) 4 times 3x which is 12x (since 4 times 3 is 12), and 4 times the negative 5 which is negative 20. So the equivalent distributed form is:  4 x squared + 12x - 20 Lets see another example:  x times the group (x squared - 8x + 2) In this expression, the factor being multiplied by the group is actually a variable, but the Distributive Property works exactly the same way. And it says we can distribute that factor and multiply it by each term of the group individually. The first term is x squared (which is the same as x times x) so if we multiply that by x, well get x-cubed since that would be three xs multiplied together. "
,,"The next term is negative 8x so if we multiply that by x well have negative 8 times x times x which is the same as negative 8 x squared. Last of all we have the term positive 2, and x times positive 2 is just 2x, so after distributing the factor x to each member of the original group, we have the polynomial: x cubed - 8 x squared + 2x See why the Distributive Property is so handy in Algebra? It shows us how to multiply a polynomial by a factor! We just distribute a copy of "
,,"that factor to each of the polynomials terms. So I know what youre thinking if we can distribute something to each member of a group Can we do the process in REVERSE and UN-distribute something? We sure can! Take a look at this polynomial:  4 x cubed + 4 x squared + 4x Notice that each term of this polynomial has a factor of 4 as its number part. In fact it kinda looks like someone distributed a factor of 4 to each term. Since distributing a factor means making multiple copies of it for each member of a group, UN-distributing is going to mean consolidating multiple copies of a factor into a single copy that is multiplied by the whole group. "
,,"So in this case, we can remove the factor of '4' that is being multiplied by each term individually, and then we can consolidate those into a single factor of '4' that is being multiplied by the entire polynomial by using parentheses to turn the polynomial into a group. But mathematicians usually dont call this UN-distributing a 4. Instead they would say that we factored out a 4 from the polynomial. So you can use the Distributive Property both ways. If you get the expression a times the group (b + c), you can distribute a copy of the factor a to each member of the group. But if youre given the expression, ab + ac, you can apply the Distributive Property in reverse and factor out the a so that it is multiplied by the whole group at once. Its important to realize that neither of these changes the value of the expression. Distributing and UN-distributing a factor are just ways of going back and forth between two equivalent forms of an expression. And it works in "
,,"cases where its not quite so obvious too. For example, Look at this polynomial: 8x + 6y + 4z. Notice that each of the number parts of this polynomial is an even number which means it contains a factor of 2. 8 is 2 times 4 6 is 2 times 3 and 4 is 2 times 2 So each of these terms has a common factor of 2 and that means that if we want to, we can factor out that 2. We can apply the Distributive Property in reverse! We remove the 2 from each term and consolidate it to form a single factor thats multiplied by the whole polynomial at once. And it works exactly the same way for variables too. What if we have the polynomial:  a x squared + ax + a Each of these terms has the common factor a so you could UN-distribute or factor out the a. Notice that when we do that to the last term (which was just a) that term becomes a 1 because there is always a factor of 1 being multiplied by any term. Alright, so thats the basics of how the Distributive Property works "
,,"in Algebra. As you can see, it can get pretty complicated for big Polynomials, but the most important thing is to understand how it works in simple cases so you can "
,,"build on that understanding in the future. Being able to recognize the pattern of the Distributive Property and to apply it both directions will allow you to rearrange algebraic expressions and equations when you need to. And remember the key to really understanding math is to try working some practice problems so that you actually use what youve learned in the video. As always, thanks for watching Math Antics"

AlgebraicExpression,nn_6exr-ShA,in this video you will cover algebraic expressions a topic covered in class 8 math okay moving on let's understand what an expression is to begin with an expression 
,,is nothing but a combination of variables and constants of one or more terms and what does that mean so lets it that's better understood with an example like you see on the right side we have an expression for X square minus 5y plus 10 it has three terms the terms being for X square being the first term minus 5y being the second term and +10 being the third term and a term is nothing but a part of the expression that is separated by the plus or minus signs so for X square minus 5y and plus 
,,10 these become the three terms of the expression for x squared minus 5y plus 10 for instance if you had an expression of the form a minus 4b plus 5c then a would be one term minus 4b would be the second term and plus 5c would be the third term easy enough digging in further we need to understand what a coefficient is what are like terms and what are constants let's look at this expression here for X square minus 5y plus 2 a B minus 4 B a and minus 10 so again we have five terms right or x 
,,squared minus 5 y plus 2 a B minus 4 B a minus 10 so in this example the coefficients would be 4 minus 5 plus 2 and minus 4 let's take a look at what like terms are 
,,like terms are the terms with the same variables raised to the same power now here which are the same variables raised to the same power we see a b and b 8 right these are the same variables and they are raised to the same power a is raised to the power 1 b is raised to the power 1 same goes here b is raised to the power 1 and a is raised to the far one that makes two a B and minus 4 B a like terms and constants are nothing but terms without any variables associated with them so my understand becomes a constant in this scenario now let's understand different types of algebraic expressions we have what are called monomials binomials trinomials polynomials sounds pretty easy based on the name of each cuz mono means one by means to try corresponds to three poly corresponds to multiple right so in the similar fashion 
,,the description is also associated with the same meaning so monomial means an algebraic expression comprising of one nonzero term for example 7a is an example of a monomial 3x square is an example of a monomial because it comes each comprises of one nonzero term similarly a binomial consists of two nonzero terms same way we have seven plus five be three X minus four X Y cube each consists of two terms right two nonzero terms seven being one of them five B being the second term in the first 
,,expression the second expression we have three X being the first term and minus four X Y cube being the second term a trinomial comprised of three nonzero terms so in this example these two examples consists of three terms that makes each of them a trinomial and a polynomial consists of one two or more nonzero terms so a monomial is a also a final polynomial a binomial is also considered a polynomial and a trinomial is also considered a subset of a polynomial so in this example three x squared would be a polynomial 3x minus 4 XY cubed would be considered a polynomial all of these would be considered polynomial because by definition a polynomial can serve one two or more nonzero terms all right moving so let's take a look at how we add and subtract polynomials let's take a look at the example given here we're trying to add two expressions here for X cubed plus or 5y minus 10 and 5 X square Y minus 15 minus 6 X cube minus 2 y so if what we have to do here is that we add the where we group the like terms together and each of these expressions we figure out which other like terms right we notice that 4x cubed and minus 6x cubed are like terms similarly 5y and minus 2y electrum so we group them together and then we form the addition that gives us the result which is -2 X cubed plus 5 X square y plus 3y minus 25 similarly we have a little variation in the question here where we've been asked what must be subtracted from 5x minus 6 X cubed minus 10 to give this result which is 4 X cubed plus 12 so it's nothing but saying what must be subtracted from a if you consider this to be a to give C so it's nothing but saying a minus B equals C so what is B right so B becomes a minus C so if this was a and this was C we subtract 4x cubed plus 12 from - from 5x - 6 X cubed minus 10 so of course we changed the signs of 4x cubed + 12 that makes it minus 4x u minus 12 and that's the result which is minus 10x cubed minus 5x minus 22 and that's the answer now moving on let's take a look at how to multiply polynomials so we have an example given here for a minus 1 times minus 2 a plus 7 so what we have to do is we take each term of the first expression and we multiply it with each term of the second expression so we take four a and multiply it with minus 2 a plus seven and then the second second term which is minus one and multiply it with minus 2 a plus seven so that's how we open the brackets solve them that gives us minus eighty square because for a times minus 2 e is minus 80 square and then plus 28 a plus 2 we because minus 1 minus 2 acre just last way minus 7 and that's the answer which is minus 8a squared plus 38 minus 7 here's another example we've been given the base and height of triangle in terms of expressions as minus 4 X plus y and X minus 3 y applying the formula 
,,for triangle which is 1/2 base times a height we inject and the expressions that we've been provided we simplify it to get this answer which is nothing but half times a multiplying the each of the terms of the first expression with the second expression and that gives your area in square units easy enough and then last but not the least we look at how to divide polynomials so one thing you need to remember is that when we divide terms with the same bases we subtract the exponents if you haven't seen one of my other videos you may want to take a look at it which talks more about about X powers and exponents and come in handy for this particular slide okay so we have to simplify this expression here which is 40 a square B minus 16 a B square plus 24 a cubed b cubed which is the expression and they've asked us to divide by 8 a B so what we have to do is when you are subdividing two expressions and dividing an expression by one term that term gets divided by each of the associated terms of the numerator so it becomes 40 a square B divided by 8 AP - 16 a B Square minus 8 a couple divided by eight a B plus 24 a QB cube divided by 8 a B and then now when you divide a square B divided by a B that is nothing but b and b cancel out a square divided by a gives us a that gives us 5 a because 40 divided by 8 is 
,,5 16 by 8 is 2 a B squared divided by a B gives us B and then 24 a cubed b cubed divided by 8 a B is nothing but 24 by 8 is 3 a cube by a is a 3 a raised to the power 3 minus 1 by applying this rule where we subtract the exponents and that gives you a final answer which is fine 8 minus 2 B plus 3 a square B Square that's a folks keep on solving additional examples and you will be an expert at all the normals as well please subscribe to my channel and keep watching and sharing and liking these videos appreciate your inputs and thoughts and comments thanks so much see you soon

AlgebraicExpression,CMK8cTOSilU,hello great 9 students today we will talk about another unit in your syllabus let's take number 12 can you write this number 12 as a product of two numbers so you can write one time another way of writing I can write this one as 2 times 6 again 3 times 4 then again 4 times 3 is same as 3 times 4 6 times 2 is same as 2 times 6 so what are these numbers we can write any number as a product of two numbers so we call these are factors so what are the factors of 12 if we can write down set off factors of 12 in this form so we can write curly brackets and write all the factors inside 1 2 3 4 6 and 12 so we can write number 12 in terms of these numbers we call these a factor so what's today's listen today's lesson is about factors so that's chapter 6 factors of algebraic expressions now you know how to find out the factors let's take number 24 what are the factors so starting from 1 1 times 24 again how can you write down 24 2 times 12 3 times 3 times 8 and 4 times 6 do we have now 
,,the factors again come 6 6 times 4 so when you write all the factors of 24 we can start from 1 you can write 2 3 4 6 8 12 and 24 so here you know I mean brackets so 
,,these are all called factors and again when you look at factors we can form another set that's called prime factors what are the prime factors in this set so what are the prime numbers 2 & 3 so I can write if you want prime factors I can write as 2 n 3 don't take 1 as a prime number the lowest prime number is 2 now we'll take algebra expressions now it's 3 how can you write down 3 I can write starting from 1 1 times 3 oh I can write 3 times then what are the factors in 3 I can write number 
,,1 and 3 a + 3 now we'll take 5 a B now try to write down all the factors starting from 1 1 times 5 a B then I can take number 5 then 5 times a B now I can combine with a letter and write 5a times 5a times B oh I can connect be with five and write five B times a then what are the factors in five maybe one five then I can write a 
,,B what is 5a 5b a B and 5e so I can't write factors of five baby all these numbers and expressions now we'll take this one find the common factor of the algebraic expressions a B and a C what is common mean common means belongs to both these expressions we'll try to do separately and see what's the common factor a B so already be is there I can write this - it a times B a B what about AC C is already there I can write a now compare these two what can you see you can see this one is common the common factor is written within the circle so what can you write about the common factor common factor is hey let's take this expression 2 ax + 6 X 5 now you need to be careful you have to take all factors and see what's common now if you take X only that's not the common factor sometimes you need to take two or more factors 
,,we can take X look at these two numbers 2 & 6 2 is common so we can take 2 as well so I can take instead of taking 1 X I can take two weeks out so 2x times either what about 6 X Y I can take 2x + 6 is 2 times 3 and y remain now can you see the common one inside the circle 2x is the common factor now we will take this one 7 XY + 
,,21 X Y Z so when you are trying to find our factors first look at number 7 and 21 what's common 7 is common so we can take 7 then look at carefully the letters X is 
,,there and why is there so we can't write 7 X Y in one part and what's the other one 7 X 1 7 X Y times 1 what about this mark if you take 7 X Y out have you get 21 this is 3z now can you see this one is the common bond for both expressions so what's the common factor 7 X take this one a squared B and a B squared so when you take 
,,this one what's common a letter is common B letter is common so we will take a B when you take a B 1 is remaining there when you take a B 1 B is remaining there so what's the common one common factor is a this one now you get three expressions try to find out the common bond for all three three six nine what's common we know that three is common X is there in all three expressions and Y is not there so we'll take three X out three x times y 3x times then how you get 6 3 times 2 so 2 Z so check again 3 X into 2 Z you get 6x z what about this mod when you take 3 X out to get 9 this is 3 and this is P now we see 3 X is common for all these three expressions that's called a common factor so common factor is 3x now in this one is slightly different so you are getting expressions now try a X plus y so this is one expression so that's a factor so I can write x plus y one expression into a here also X plus y is one expression into B so what's the common one there we can see the common one is this expression so you need to remember when you're trying to factors it can be just a number or letter or expression so I can take X plus y out so that's the common factor take this one X into 2 a plus B Y into 2 a plus B so what's common we'll take this one so I can write to a plus B into X here I can write to a plus 
,,B with what so what's common this is the common part so common factor is to a plus B another one now try a into X minus 2y B into X minus two my so these two expressions are the same so which one is the common you can easily get the common factor so we can see X minus 2y into a and here X minus 2y into B so what's the common one this one is the common you can write X minus 2y is the common factor not the one look at carefully a - to win into five p7q into a - tool five and seven there are no common factors PQ also not common so that means we can take a - to win with 5p here a - to win with 17 so we see this is the common factor this one another question a squared X - 3 1 b squared x - 3 by so a squared B squared no common factors we can write x -3 by into a squad in this one X -3 by into B Square so which one is common so the common factor is this one belongs to both these expressions so I can write X minus 3y is the common factor now we'll look at rules related to factor so 
,,we have to do three rules in this unit so we'll take the first one eliminate the common factor of the algebraic expression X plus a lie now eliminate means taking out so when you take these expressions you can take a letter out a is common so I can write taking a out a and then what's remaining when you take a out X is remaining from this one and the plus sign is there Y is remaining from the other one you can check again multiplying these two you need to get this far into X plus a into y ax plus IVA so we can take a letter out from this so that's the first rule when you get an expression taking one letter out from the expression so rule number one if 
,,there's two expressions like this one letter is common take it out so that's how you factorize now we'll use that rule in these examples look at carefully these two 
,,expressions what's common 7 and 14 a number is common there seven is common when you take seven out what's remaining X is remaining from this one and then the sign comes here 14 you already have taken seven out seven times two so this becomes two what about this one three six what's common P and Q both are not common so three take it out what's remaining P plus 6 you get 3 times 2 so this is 2 Oh cute this one a B a plus AC what's common is common take it out what's the remaining part B plus C look at carefully the next one 3 and minus MN m miss come on take it out 3 minus and here which one is common this common take it out so what you write here so when there's no number here means that's 1 so remember that X means 1 next when you take X out you can write 1 there 1 plus what this one a squared plus a B 1 is common check it out a plus B write down the below algebraic expressions as product of two factors so that means take the common letter or number out from these expressions now you have 3 so you have to do the same thing look at all three expressions and take the common 112 p 8q and for look at the numbers what's the common 1 4 4 8 12 4 is common check it out what's remaining 3 P minus 4 already taken from 8 so that's 2 and here I told you when only one number is there that means 4 times 1 so 4 
,,already taken you get one then this one 20x minus 15y 35 so what's common there 5 is common check it out remaining part you inside 4x3 by and this one m-miss come on take it out the remaining part 7m minus 2 and here and this one only come on take it out a plus B minus C this one eight six three there are no common numbers only 
,,X you can take so 8 X 6 Y and when you take X out that's 3 Z what about this one he is common when you take a out this is a B squared + C squared remain so that's how we factorize when you get three expressions and only one letter or number is common now look at this one write down a 2x + y + 2 b x + y algebraic expression as product of two factors okay we'll take separation in this one a into x plus y so you can write the two factors like this what about this one - b into x + 5 so we can write 2 B into X plus 5 now what's the common factor we can see this is the common bond for both expressions so here you get an expression is common so you can take it out so that's the second rule so in second rule you can take one expression out so what we do when you get a into X plus y 2 B into X plus y this X plus y you can 
,,check it out we can take X plus y out and write down the remaining part inside the other bracket so a plus 2b so that's the second rule so remember that first rule says you can take a letter or number just one here you can take an expression out from the algebraic expressions now we'll try to use that theory in these expressions so eliminate the common factor and write down the below expressions as product of two factors so when you look at these two expressions we can see a minus B is common so make sure that you put brackets and the remaining part also you have to write inside brackets when you take a minus B out this becomes X and this is three bar 
,,so X plus three by this one what's comma the whole expression is common a plus seven is common take it out what's remaining two P Q this one tryna X minus y is common take it out the remaining parties is God plus this one what's common this one is common so 2 plus 7y is common take it out and write down the rim look at carefully this one P minus 2q is common check it out and write down the remaining part 7 M plus N squared this one what's common X minus 3 5x minus 3y take it out and the remaining part 11 a plus 3b insert several questions are there related to that so try to do those M plus n is common what's remaining to be minus 11 Q here also X minus 3y common and 7 plus 8 M is the remaining part always the same here comes so a plus 2b when you take it out what you get x squared plus y squared this is also this 
,,is common to P plus 3 is common take it out and then remaining part you write inside now will look like this one now what happens earlier you got two expressions now you have four expressions so how we do that how we try to find out the common factor when you get four terms so we'll take two at a time we'll take first two separately and the next two separately so I can write in here X plus a I and this one is B X plus B bar then you take this expression what's common is come and take it out and then I can write x plus y there this one B is common I can take it out and write X plus y now try to write down factors so what are the factors of this X plus y and in this one X plus y and so what's the common factor so common factor for both is X plus so here the common factor is X plus y what's the other two terms are the two terms are the end here B now you are learning the third rule what's that when you get four terms you can take two at a time and then factorize again when four 
,,"terms are found take two terms at a time and find a factor so here take these two separately these two separately factorize and then finally you will end up with two expressions again the car take the common factor out X plus y is , take it out and you can write down remaining part as a plus take this question factorize so when "
,,you are factorize you have to take two terms at once so when you take these two take 5 out 5 is comma take it out remaining parties X plus 2 1 now a is common plus say take it out what's remaining X plus 2 1 now X plus 2 y is common take it out and the remaining part that's 5 plus you write in the other bracket this one when you take these 2 is common what's the remaining part B plus C these 2 Plus 3 is comments then B plus C so B plus C is common check it out what's the remaining part a plus 3 now look at this one positive so when you take first 2 a is common take it out what's remaining if last 3 these 2 plus 5 is common take it out you get a plus 3 
,,now a plus 3 is common take it out and the remaining part you write in the other bracket if last high look at this one I'll take this one as negative so when you take these two what's common is common so what's remaining B minus C so here 3 is common which one we need to take plus 3 or negative 3 plus 3 when you take you get the same term B minus C now we can see B minus C is common take it out and the remaining part that's a plus 3 in the other bracket look at this one when you take first 
,,2 is common take it out the remaining part is 3 plus Q now what - so we need to get minus sign out - a it's common so what's remaining 3 plus Q now again 3 plus Q is common take it out q what's remaining B - hey these ones from these two a is common take it out this is X plus minus minus so I can take minus 9 out then this becomes plus inside - x plus becomes minus X plus y into a - this one when you take two at a time is come and take it out a minus 2 there which one is common there what we take minus or plus look at carefully when you take plus X out what's remaining X minus plus 6 out you get a minus 2 so then we can see a minus 2 is common so be careful when you have one positive and one negative sometimes you need to take the minus out sometimes not so in this case you don't need to take - out you can write x + X and then a minus 2 is remained then a minus 2 is common and you can write this as a plus X this one you take these two out so what's common this one I can take 
,,X out l- then this one which one we can take - 7 o + 7 so think about this minus sign in the first place if you take - out you are getting -7 out you are getting ill - f that's what we need not a - L other way around so you have to get the same factor in the first one to factorize further so we can take - 7 out what's remaining 
,,there this is L - so what's common now it'll minus M is common check it out the remaining part is X - so in this one just I have given two expressions just to see you can take either plus or minus sometimes you can just take the positive number sometimes you can take that negative one so here if you take Elm out what's remaining - seven in this one if you take minus M out what should be there - seven right because minus into minus becomes plus seven so when you ask to find out the common factor if you if you take just Ament seven you can't find out common factor so that's why so you need to be tricky so to get plus it can be both - so em if you take em that's seven positive into positive positive button to get the common factor there you need to take minus MN minus seven then we can see minus seven is common so in this one what's the common ones - now the next one find the factors of the following algebraic expressions a X plus B by plus a y plus B X now we discussed when you have four terms you take first two separately and the next two separately but what happens here when you take first two separately you can't see any common factors 
,,what we can do there we can interchange the terms so that we get factors now B by and ax no common term so I can switch this term here and this term there because X 
,,is common there so I'll switch that so first term I can write as it is instead of B by I can take this term here BX then a by and I can write this term there now see whether you can apply the previous rule rule number three when you take these two separate here and these two separately you can see that now X is common take it out and you can write this as a plus B what about this one plus wise they gain a plus now a plus B is come on take it out and write down this as X plus so when you can't factorize the first two what you do interchange the terms so the factors can be found by interchanging terms now here also AP and 6q there are no common terms so 
,,what we do I can take a queue there so write down that AP plus EQ now this term here and six feet already there and I can write 6q last take first two is common check it out then V plus key remain then this one plus six is common take it out and P plus Q is remain then P plus Q take it out and the remaining part is a plus six so that's how we factorize now take this one also three a and B X can you find factors you can't find factor so what you do you interchange these two this so I can rewrite this as 3 a + ax and three b + PX then take us two separately and the last two separate yet factorize what's common there a is common when you take a out 3 plus X is remaining from these 2 B is common three plus six remain no three plus six is common so you can take 3 plus 6 out and write down the remaining factor inside so you'll get 3 plus into a plus B now we need to talk about factors of trinomial quadratic expressions so you're learning three terms trinomial tri means three by means to try means three so something about treat quadratic expression what are cod Hritik expressions have you heard about that this word quadratic means when you get 
,,maximum power is two we call those are contracting expressions so in this expression you get three terms that's why it's trinomial why this is quadratic you get power to so there are three terms to this expression as X square term is there this is a quadratic expression so we are trying to factorize when you get three terms with a square term so when three terms of x squared plus five x plus six are converted to four terms can factorize by taking two at a time so we did three rows what's the third one when you get four terms take two terms at once and factorize but three terms there so if we can't split one term to two you get four terms so that's our 
,,idea how can we factorize trinomials three terms you split into four terms so how you're going to do that so this is the method so step number one is here take first you have to write in order square term first and X term then and the constant term third and what we do we multiply first and the last term's x squared into six what you get 6x squared here the sign is important so plus sign so you need to observe the sign so you are getting plus 6x squared then what you do you are trying to find out factors of 6 X square so we'll first look at the number what are the factors of 6 we know that's 1 into 6 2 into 3 that's all so try to find out the factors and then what you do when you multiply here when you add these two can you get the middle term 1 & 6 both positive so what 4 plus 1 and plus 6 you get plus 7 but the 
,,middle term is plus 5 so you can't take 1 & 6 so what about 2 & 3 2 + 3 you get 5 so first you need to identify when you add the factors are we catching the middle term yes we are getting the middle term by these two factors so that means these are the correct expressions so how can you write 6x squared I can write 2x into 3x not just 2 times 3 you get 6 so 6x squared means 2x times 3x then when you add the factors 2x and 3x you are getting 5 X so what we do when you get quadratic trinomial quadratic expressions you are splitting the middle term into two parts so I can rewrite this as x squared instead of 5x I can write plus 2x + 3 X now we get four terms take two at a time and factorize X is common take it out it's plus two is remaining three is common take it out again X plus two is remaining now X plus two is common take it out so what's what's the remaining part X plus three so what's the step first multiply the first and the last and try to find out all factors and how you select the correct factors when you add the factors you need to get the mediator so here this expression both are pluses all three terms are pluses now we'll look at these expressions now we have to we get same type of questions all positive so how can we factorize rearrange it already they are x squared 7 X term and the constant 12 into x squared 12 x squared what's the sign positive sorry what are the factors of 12 1 into 12 2 into 6 3 into Oh now select the appropriate factors what's 
,,the suitable one to get 7 how can we split 7 1 and 12 can you do that No 2 & 6 you can't because you get 8 3 & 4 so that means you can drive this is 3 x + 4 X so this is the ofoh these are the appropriate factors so 3 X + 4 X so I can split 7 X into 3x + 4 X now take two at a time and Trice when you take X out you get X plus 3 there when you take 4 you get X plus 3 because 4 times 3 12 now X plus 3 is common you take it out then you get X plus now try this one a squared plus 8 a plus 50 so 
,,when you multiply these two you get plus 15 a square so the sign is positive what are the factors of 15 1 15 3 times 5 what is those are the factors now see how you 
,,get the middle term 8 a can we take 1 and 15 no we have to take 3 & 5 because 3 + 5 8 so this is a squared so you need three eight times five ways so these are the two factors appropriate to this one so I can split 8a using that 3 & 5 a take two at a time and factorize is comma and take it out a plus 3 is remaining five and fifteen plus five is comma and take it out and a plus three also remaining then a plus 3 again come on take it out and you can write the remaining part inside brackets so the factors are a plus 3 and a plus now try these ones similar wave all these pluses x squared into 18 18 x squared this is plus what are the factors of 18 always 
,,"start from 1 and C then 2 with 9 3 with 6 those are the factors now select the suitable factors is it 1 and 18 or 2 & 9 Oh three and six which one two one nine two plus nine is so we have to select this one so how can you write 18x squared this is 2 X n 9 X now we'll split the middle term - 2 X + 9 X take two at a time and factorize X's , and take it out that's X plus 2 9 is , and take it out that's X plus No X plus 2 is common what's the remaining part X plus this one amen 14 M squared + 14 40 mm M square factors of 14 one with 42 with 7 those are the factors which one is suitable to get 9 2 & 7 so we can write two women 7 M both positive so I can't split instead of 9m that's 2 M + 7 name now take two at a time and factorize I can take em out and the remaining part inside brackets here 7 out and you get same thing in + 2 M plus 2 when you take it out M plus 7 is remaining these ones now in this one can you see the number first but this is also in order square term then the middle one is there it's just the simple one without the square term and a constant so you can do this way as well no need to rewrite the square term first same thing 16 times P squared plus 16 P Square what are the factors of plus 16 sign is important this is plus 16 plus 16 times plus 1 16 times 1/2 times 8 4 times Oh now which one is suitable for + 4 8 16 and 1 17 so you need to select that select these two factors to 1/8 so this becomes 2 p + 8 P this botha positive now we can split the "
,,middle term to 2p + 8 take two at a time rule number three now when you get four terms take two at a time and factorize take two out - his comments you get 8 + P when you take P out you get 8 plus P okay they need + P take it out you get 2 + now what's the difference you get a negative sign so here positive negative positive what's the earlier one something positive something again positive now what's the pattern here squared term positive the middle term negative and the last term positive now we'll see how we can do when the signs are different the middle term of the expression is now - 7e not +7 e but you follow the same procedure a squared + 12 you get positive 12 a squared so you need positive 12 but when you add the factors you need to get minus 7e so how can you get positive values and when you add you need to get negative values first we'll write down factors factors of 12 1 and 12 to 6 and 3/4 but you can take plus into plus as well but we know that negative times negative is positive so if we put negative money into negative 12 you get positive 12 negative 2 into negative 6 again positive 12 so either you can take both pluses or both minuses in this case you need to take minus value because when you add 3 & 4 you get plus 7 but we need minus 7 so you need to take minus 3 and minus 4 minus 
,,3 minus 4 you get minus 7 so these are the two appropriate factors so yeah you need a square yard.this is 3 and minus 4 now we can split the middle term minus 3 minus 4 plus 12 take two at a time and factorize a a minus 3 know which one we take you can take plus 4 or minus 4 if you take plus 4 what happens you are getting minus 
,,ay inside but we need plus a so always check the previous factor so we need to take minus 4 out to get a here if you take minus our this becomes minus 3 now we get same factor a minus 3 and what's the remaining 1 a minus now we'll apply that in these examples middle term is negative but the last term is positive 12x squared one 
,,and 12 just one factor what are the other factors to with six three with this is plus but the minute term is negative means you need to take both negatives minus eight how you get minus 8 minus 2l minus six so these are the two appropriate factors so you can write 2x + 6 X so split the middle term into - 2 X - 6 x + 2 and take two at a time so when you take X out this is X - 2 which one we take minus 6 or + 6 you need to get positive X inside so we need to take - six out X minus 2 so X - 2 
,,is there X minus 6 this one plus 14y Square 1 and 14 and what are the other factors 2 + 7 that's all middle term is minus 9 definitely we know that both should be - 
,,and to get Y squared this should be both wise so minus 2 y x - 7 y you get 14 y square now split the middle term take two at a time and factorize take Y out the remaining fact Y minus 2 here we have to take minus seven now to get positive y ya then this becomes minus 2 so y minus 2n y minus 7 this one all the terms in order square term then the single term and the constant 16 M square what are the factors 1 and 16 2 with 8 4 & 4 middle term is negative 10 so we have to select the appropriate one so to get M Square and this should be M na minus 2 m and minus 8 mu get minus 10 so you are we are splitting the middle term into 2 minus 2 m minus 8 M plus 16 tape 2 at a time I'm out you get a minus 2 yeah take minus 8 out - - because minus 8n - Joe you get plus 16 M minus 2 there come on what's the remaining 1 - 8 this 
,,one P squared into 30 30 P Square what are the factors of 31 and 32 with 15 3 with 10 can we get 4 no then that's odd what about 6 6 times 5 so that means I can write pi times 6 when you go in order I can write 5 times 6 so those are the factors but the middle term is negative both numbers should be negative what are the suitable want to get 17 - 17 I can take 2 and 15 this boat should be negative this is P and P they are to get P squared now let's play the middle term minus 2p minus 15 B 30 day two at a time now do it take P out what's remaining P minus 2 here which one we take minus 15 you can take to get plus P P minus 2 P minus 2 into P minus 30 now what happens when you get different factors here can you proceed no that means something wrong with your previous step so make sure you need to get the same factor to proceed further this one the constant first and the square term last so you don't need to rearrange it what are the factors of 16 Y square factors of 61 16 to wait for for what are the suitable ones to get minus 10 minus 2 n minus 8 and this becomes Y n Y now I'm splitting the middle term minus 10 by 2 minus 2 y and minus 8y take 2 at a time and factorize what's common there 2 is common and I can write 8 minus 5 in this 1 minus y is common 8 minus y minus into minus is plus now we get same factor so 8 minus y and the other one is too - why some more questions try 21 with y square 21 y square what are the factors of 21 1 with 21 3 with 7 and you the middle term is minus 10 we can't take 1 and 21 so definitely we know these two both mega- and we can write wise as well spread the middle term and factorize by taking two at a time this one you can take 3 out and the remaining part 7 minus y this one you can take Y out are we taking - yr plus y out we need plus 7 so we need to 
,,take minus y out 7 - why Cemil - why is comma and take it out the remaining part is 3 - what this one K squared into 15 so 15 K square factors of 15 1 15 3 5 now we 
,,need to select appropriate factors to get minus 60 so 1 + 15 you get 16 so this both should be negative to get negative 16 here so K squared you get minus 1 KN minus 15 K split the middle term you don't you can write 1 K or without one also correct take two at a time man factorize take K out K minus one is there yeah that's why 
,,it's important to write one if you take K out you are getting one there yeah we can take -15 out the remaining part is K minus one so K minus one is common take it out the remaining part is K minus 15 and also you can multiply and see whether you are getting the previous expression so here K into K likewise you can check with the yawns is correct factors of 48 what are the factors are 48 one with 48 two with 24 three with 16 and 4 with 12 so likewise you can write down factors but no need to write down all if we can find out at once - 19 how we get 19 from these two by ID adding the numbers because we saw that if it's minus and then plus you need both 
,,- so we can select the we can select 3 and 16 as the factors to get 19 both should be - to get + 48 so split the middle term into minus 3h and minus 16 H take 2 at a time when you take it out you get h minus 3 here you need to take -16 out to get plus h then minus 3h minus 3 is common take it out and write X minus H minus 60 factors of 32 now to get minus 18 one with 32 two with 16 here when you are trying to find our factors just see whether you get this number we see that already it's there so you don't need to find all factors we can see 2 and 16 becomes 18 this should be minus 2 MN minus 16 so the factors are -2 ml - 16 M now take two at a time and factorize stick em out you get a minus 2 there when you take -16 out a minus 2 okay now a minus 2 is come on let's take it out and write down the remaining fact that M minus 16 this one you need 19 years squared what are the factors of 1919 is a prime number so in prime numbers you can't find other factors always 1 net itself so 1l 19 we are getting 19 and 120 so both should be negative and this is minus 1 in length - 19 split the middle term into one meal and 19 years take two at a time and factorizes please come and take it out you get L minus 1 it's good to write 1 then you can easily see when you take a lout the remaining part is 1 your 19 - 19 when you take that's ill - 1 so L minus 1 is common take it out L minus 19 is remaining now what's the change the middle term is plus and the last term is negative so 
,,so far what are the things we did we did all terms positive second one we did middle term negative but the last term is positive now we are trying to learn how to factorize when the middle is positive and the last term is negative so same procedure you multiply the first and the last but now you are getting minus 18x squared earlier both cases these two you got plus as the final valid now you are getting minus 18 first without considering the sign what are the factors of 81 and 82 with 9 3 
,,with 6 now just check this is not about adding now because to get minus one number should be positive and the other one should be negative so one positive one negative and the product you get negative and how do you get the middle term now the middle term is +7 positive value if we take plus 9 and minus 2 you can get +7 so in this case when you get a negative on what we do try to try out the factors the bigger number should be positive to get +7 you need plus 9 and minus 9 minus 2 so first 
,,select the appropriate one and put plus father bigger factor so here minus 18x squared is obtained when multiplying the first term and the final term since the middle term is plus 7x the larger factor of both factors must be positive now we can split so to get x squared this should be X and X now I can split 7 X into minus 2 XL 
,,plus 9 X take 2 at a time when you take a South you get X minus to take plus nine out X minus two here we need to take plus because X first that's positive x minus 2 is common take it out and the remaining part we write ya now we'll apply that rule in these examples now we can see the middle term is plus and the last one is negative so when you multiply always you get a negative value so negative 10 a square so factors of 10 110 to 5 and then to get +3 one should be plus and 1 should be negative but the bigger number should be positive so when you select this one this is plus and this is minus plus 5 and minus 2 you are getting plus 3 then this is a so that's how we find out the appropriate factors so a squared minus 2a and +5 it take two at a time and factorize when you franchise you get a minus 2 when you take plus five this is a minus 2 again a minus 2 is common take it out and write V plus 5 next one minus 30 be square factors of minus 31 32 with 15 3 with 10 think about 
,,without writing can you get the middle term 7 plus 7 definitely not with want 1 and 32 with 15 you are not getting 3 with gel you're getting server so we can think about 3n +7 means the bigger number is plus and the smaller one is negative to get B squared both should be peace now we can't split the middle term 2 minus 3b plus 10t Plus 2 and last row separately here we can take me out this one you can take 10 out now B minus 3 is common and here V Plus now try to find out the factors at once -20 C square what are the factors of 21 and 22 with 10 now c2 with tail are we getting it yes so two with 10 the middle term is positive means the bigger number is positive and they're smaller one is negative to get C squared this should be C and C now let's pick the middle term minus 2c plus 10 C minus 20 take two at a time take C out you get to C minus 2 plus 10 out you get C minus 2 then C minus 2 is common what's remaining c plus now here the constant term is first doesn't matter as long as the this term in the middle it's okay you can get this for R term first all last minus 12 P Square middle term is plus 4 think about factors one with 12 2 with 6 2 with 6 you can get 4 so I'm not writing all factors now I'm writing appropriate one to at six but plus four is there this is plus and minus so to get P squared this is PE n now I can't split the middle term okay two at a time and factorize you can take two out you get 6 minus P plus P there are six minus P 6 minus fields come on remaining one plus this one 21 minus K squared minus 21 K squared what's the suitable one to get for one with 21 3 with 7 3 & 7 you are getting 4 so 3 with 7 
,,plus 4 means this is Plus this is minus and to get case come on it should be case now you can do fast you don't need to write down all factors at sea we are you get 
,,plus 4 now take two at a time threes comment there 7 minus k plus K is common and you get 7 minus K so 1 minus K it's comma and take it out you get 3 plus K now what happens in this one the term is also negative and also the constant term is also negative so we'll revise what we did we did oh positive then we did middle term positive negative and the last term positive and the third one we did middle term positive and the last term negative now we are doing middle term negative as well as Laster negative so in this case you got all positive this is a middle term negative this is last term negative now you are getting middle term and last term both are 
,,negative so what we do same procedure when you multiply first and the last you get minus 10 May square this is also minus like previous one factors of minus 10 to get minus 3 think about factors one with chain 2 with 5 2 & 5 relates to 3 so we'll write 2 & 5 now what happens is this is a nd middle term is negative means you need to get the bigger one negative negative 5 and plus 2 you get negative 3 so middle term is negative means select the bigger one negative so he'll say the middle term is negative 3a the larger factor of both factors must be negative so we can use that one to split the middle term C squared minus first we'll write plus to a minus 
,,B minus T here don't think that I can in this one here you can write minus five way first and then write to a you get the same answer so don't worry about which one 
,,to write first you can write any two factors first if you can't see the factors then what you do you can interchange the terms when you take first two you get a that's a plus two minus five common for both so I can take minus five out then you get a plus 2 a plus two is common and you get a minus so in this case also when negative is in the middle term you have to select the larger factor negative now we'll use that one to factorize now straight away we will try to find out the factors without writing all -12 factors of 12 to get 4 1 12 to 6 to 6 you get four middle term is negative means bigger number should be negative this is 6 6 n minus 6 X + 2 X so x squared + 2 X - 6 6 - 12 when you take first 2 you get X X plus 2 when you take - out - 6 6 - 6 out you get X plus X plus 2 X minus 6 this want to get minus 20y 
,,squared the middle term - 8 1 + 22 with 10 to tell you get 8 so 2 + 10 y middle term is negative means the bigger one is negative split the middle term I can write the 10 Y first as well we'll do that it was always I took the smaller one first but you don't need that take first - and you can see why is common when you take 2 out you get Y minus 10y minus 10 is common take it out and write down the remaining factor y + 2 this 1 minus 22 factors of - 22 1 with 22 you are not getting 9 - with 
,,11 to any level you are getting so - with 11 - means in the middle bigger one is - and this is positive so you can write this one and the middle term - 2 Z minus 11 
,,see take two at a time and factorize then you take Z out that's the plus two minus eleven out that's Z plus 2z + 2 is common and you get Z minus eleven this one - 20 M Squared when you mod their first and the last middle term is - it means this is minus one name factors of 21 with 22 with ten and four with five four and five differences one and the middle term is negative means bigger number is negative and this is positive select the middle term and take two at a time and factorize so I'll take four plus four out you get em - but so a minus 5 into M plus 4 this one h squared into - 26 - 26 H square one with 26 - with 13 - and 13 you get 11 this is minus 11 you'd have to take the difference so - for the larger number and this is positive splitting the middle term 2 plus 2 H and minus 13 H ok first two terms you get H comma when you take these two you can take minus 13 out and h plus 2 is common and h minus 13 remaining this one again quadratic me all these are trinomial quadratic expressions three terms and the square term is there - 30 M Squared 1 and 32 with 15 you need - 13 so - with 15 the middle term is negative so the bigger number larger number negative and this one is positive here K squared into 30 not M square so this should be k squared so k k is there now split the middle term K squared 
,,+ 2 k + -15 K then you take first two plus two when you take - 15 now that's K + 2 k plus 2 is common and K minus 15 is remain now look at this one write the following algebraic expressions they're squared terms now slightly different so you have given expressions then you are asked to write as square terms so what can you see about these numbers for 16:9 25 49 64 ol square numbers 2 times 2 4 4 times 4 16 so we can easily write in terms of a square number x squared is already there so for I can write 2 times 2 if I write 2x whole thing squared you get the same thing 2 times 2 for X into X x squared so final answer is 4x squared so this is a square term so this is the expression and you get a square term now try this one 16 P squared how can you write as a square term 16 means 4 times 4 so I can write 4p whole thing square 9m squared 3 m whole thing square 25 is 5 times 5 5h whole thing square 49 7 times 7 7 else whole thing square 64 means a times eight 8k whole thing square 36 6 times 6 6 P squared + 81 means 9 times 9 9 a whole thing's crap now we know how to write down any expression as a square term right as difference between two 
,,squared terms difference means subtraction you have given two expressions and both we need to write as square terms x squared already a square term you can write as 
,,it is minus 4y squared we read that before 4 is 2 times 2 so I can write 2y whole thing square so difference between means this is negative so 2 squared terms with minus sign in the middle in the next one 9 minus a squared 9 how can you write as a square term 3 squared and a squared already yeah this 125 5 squared + 4 a squared 
,,4 is 2 times 2 so I can write 2 a whole thing square this 116 4 times 4 so this is 4 8 whole thing squared + 9 is 3 and 3 so 3 B whole thing's 81 9 times 9 9 X whole thing squared 49 means 7 into 7 7 y whole thing square 36 means 6 times 6 right like this and 121 is can you remember square terms square numbers 11 times 11 seventh one a squared B squared I can write a B whole things got 64 times 4 so 4 squared x squared is also square so I can write as it is and 144 is 12 times 12 12 square 
,,this one 4 is 2 times 2 so I can drive to Y whole thing square 81 is 9 times 9 16 again a square number 4 times 4 169 so you need to know square terms 2 times 2 4 3 
,,times 3 9 4 times 4 16 so like that 169 is 13 times 13 13 Q squared so in this one we did writing any expression in terms of difference between two squared terms now look at this one find the factors of the difference between two squared terms now you have given this one a square term is they are in a constant term what's missing when you compare with trinomials we got three terms one a squared and the next one should be hater now nothing means you can take the middle term as zero so we can rewrite this question as a squared plus 0 a minus four and proceed as before like factorizing trinomials will do that a times minus four minus four square a square 
,,factors of -4 and the middle term is 0 so 2 well 2 2 a and 2 way but both are the same so one is positive and one is negative when you add you are getting 0 a now we will try to split that 0 you can write plus 2 a and minus 2 a and when you take the first 2 separately you get a plus 2 and here are negative sign and 2 is common a plus 2 then a plus 2 come on you get a minus 2 so this is a long process when now you have two terms but when you are trying with zero term in the middle it takes time so what we can do we can find out an easy way so I'll explain when you get two terms how we can factorize now we'll take the same question a squared minus 4 here a squared term and here 4 is also square term now can you see that we can rewrite this as 2 squared difference between two squared terms so a squared + 2 squared so when you get two squared terms what we do we can write two factors like this and think about how you get a squared that's a and a how you get 4 that's 2 and 2 so you write down the factors and one factor is positive and one factor is negative so that's really easy when you get two terms and both terms are square terms so what you call that difference between two squared terms when you get difference between two squared terms you can write the first one here and the last one for you get to 
,,enter so this number so when you write down the square term these two comes yeah and one is minus and the other one is positive now we can factorize all these using 
,,difference between two squared terms 16 first you have to write as a square term 16 is 4 times 4 so I can write as 4 square what's the next step then put two brackets x squared is X and X this is 4 and 4 one is positive and one is negative so you can switch this factor first and this one last so one factor is always positive and the other one is negative so in this one 49 you can write 7 squared so what are the factors why why this is -7 + +7 this one 36 you can write 6 squared so 6 first and then P so what are the factors 6 minus PN 6 plus B now try to factorize using difference between two square terms first thing you have to write a square terms 7a 
,,whole thing square R and 5b whole things well then easy you write 787 in first and the second term is 5 B 1 is negative and one is positive this one 81 9x whole thing squared 49 7y whole thing square now write down the 2 well it's 9x here and seven by one is positive and one is negative this one try 144 12x whole thing square twelve times twelve hundred forty four five and five twenty five how do you write down the factors with two brackets first term here and then last term here and one is positive other one is negative now it's easy two terms you can end both are square terms if both are square terms you can apply this not for all factorization 11y whole things crash then you can straight away write 9x and then other term is eleven by one is positive and the other one is negative some more questions a squared B 
,,squared I can write a B whole thing square 25 five C squared so when you take the difference a B first and five C next one means positive one is negative this one 121 is 11 P whole thing square 49 is 7 Q whole thing square so how you write down the factors p 7q one is positive and a other one is negative what about this one right as a square term 4x whole thing squared and 13 my whole thing squared right down the tube records first term first and the last second one is positive one is negative here also write as a square term a B whole thing square and C D whole thing square one is positive one is negative so here we use difference between two squared 
,,terms now what happens can you write down this as a square term - a square - is not a square number what we do there when you get something like this with two numbers we can take the common one out so eliminate the common factor two first then what you get when you eliminate that one so we will take the same question I'm taking 
,,two out two is common a squared - 25 now but we know 25 is a square number now we can use difference between two squared terms I can rewrite this as a squared and five squares now - is there what are the factors of this a a here five five one is positive and one is negative so it's easy when you get extra term try to eliminate that and then think about applying difference between two square terms in this one what's common I can see a you can take it out then you get a squared - 49 both these are squared numbers you can apply difference between two squared terms I can write this one as plus 7 n minus 7 now try to factorize these ones you can take the common term out I can take 4 out what's remaining 25 y squared and here for is there I can write what's the before that I'll write down there when you take 4 out I can write this as a square term so 25 5 into 5 so 5 by whole things square now write down the factors X X X is the term I don't take the square term 5 by is the other term then this is plus and this is negative in this one what's common I can take 4 out when you take four that's 4 a squared minus 4 times 9 9 B squared now 4 & 9 both are square terms I can write this is as to a whole thing squared and this one has 3 B whole thing squared then take the difference between two squared terms for is or we they are the two factors are two we plus 3 B and 2a minus 3b so you have to do this step to identify the factors so you have to write down square terms and then we take these two terms this one X is common take it out 4x squared minus 9 y squared and then write as a square term 2x whole thing squared and 3 by whole things square then apply difference between two square terms 2x + 3 y + 2 X - 3 well how we do this one right as a square term I can write this one as a square squared whole thing square B 4 how can you write B squared whole things square now apply difference between two squared terms a squared plus B squared and a squared minus B Square can you factorize further plus one we can't when you get to square term with plus we don't know how to factorize but we know the difference between two square terms that that means when you get square terms with minors we know how to factorize so you can factorize a squared plus B squared here again you can factorize one is 
,,positive the other one is negative so in your plus billion a minus B so if you do up to this point you are getting half marks so you need to factorize completely find the value using factor knowledge look at these two 7.5 is common take it out what's remaining 2.7 and 7.3 now we can simplify inside brackets so 7.5 times addition of these two numbers 7 + 3 10 7 + 2 9 and 10 so you get to just multiply this by 10 it's easy move the decimal place one place to right so you like 75 as it what about this one look at carefully 9.3 is common check it out what's remaining three-putt 9.3 so this is three point five and six point no add these two you get ten one 
,,remaining 6 plus 3 8 6 plus 3 9 9 plus 1 again just multiply by 10 nine point three times ten nice now using factorization method you can find out values otherwise you have to multiply all these decimals and then add it so which one is easy use this method again twelve point five is common take it out what's remaining twelve point five and here minus two point five now the subtraction so what's 12 point five minus two point five you get ten so ten times twelve point five you move one place 
,,to the right the answer is hundred twenty-five this one you get two squared terms apply the difference between two squared terms one means plus and the other one is 
,,"negative when you add these two get fifty then what about this one when you subtract you get four four times 50 that's two hundred so it's easy to apply the difference between two squared terms to find the answers this one difference between two squared terms so I can write one factor positive one factor negative so when you add these two you get 200 what's the subtraction you get 6 so 6 times 200,000 200 in this one also you get difference between two squared terms so one is positive one is negative then when you add these two you get 10 multiplied when you subtract you get five five times ten Yonsei is 50 look at this one now you get how many expressions one two three four what's that rule number three when you get four expressions take two at a time and factorize these two we'll check what's the common 12.3 is "
,,calm take it out what's remaining four point five and five point five when you take class to seven point seven is common you get four point five and five point five 
,,now when you add what you get two point three yeah this is same four point five plus five point five you get ten you know also you get 10 now we see ten is comma and check it out what's remaining 20.3 yen seven point seven now when you add these two what you 7 + 3 10 and 10 again 10 times 10 you get 100 so as there are four terms take two terms at a time and factors this one how many terms are there 1 2 or 3 4 so we'll follow the same procedure we'll take these two and these 28.7 is common 
,,"take it out what's remaining 4.6 l 5 points from this you can take 1.3 out what's remaining four point six and five point four no and these two 6 plus 4 10 five plus four so you get 10 here what about this one same thing so you get 10 now two expressions 10 is common take it out what's remaining eight point seven and one point three so 10 times what's the addition 10 times 10 you get now we'll look at review exercise in your textbook so you need to know how to factorize expressions just normal expressions and then we did trinomials and then difference between two squared terms right each of the following algebraic expressions as a product of factors so you have to take the common term out L write down the remaining part inside brackets what's common here 8 and 12 will see 4 is common take it out remaining part you write insult this one 9 and 18 9 is , take it out remaining part a plus 2y inside brackets 3 M plus 6 3 is common take it out so 6 is 3 times 2 so you get M plus 2 "
,,20 and 30 10 is common to a minus 3b this one for his comma P minus 5 5 Q so 4 times 5 you get minus 24 times minus 5 you get minus twenty twelve and four I can take fallout 3 - ok this one no three expressions three terms are they are so C common for all three three is common take it out the remaining part you write inside brackets 3 times 5 you get 5 B 3 times 12 minus 8 4 4 is common 3 8 minus 2 B plus 1 because I can write this one as 4 times 1 9 minus 3 minus 6 3 is common 3 minus B minus 2 C so you get 9 minus 3b minus 6 see these two you can take forward or minus 4 does not matter you can take any term so I look like I can take 4 out you get minus 3x inside plus y all I can't change the terms and write down by minus 3x same answer - - both they are that means common for both - for we'll take it out then you get this one in plus P this one which one we can take either minus or plus we take minus three out if you take minus 3 this becomes positive - - because - - you get positive take a out remaining part B plus C you can take P out and then not P there what's the value here one because just P means 1 P 1 minus Q 3 terms are there a is common take it out b + c - take this 1 3 you can take it out and also x is common so we can take 3x out so what's remaining this becomes 1 plus 2 what what about this one B is command + 3 so 3 B you can take it out you can write 2 a minus 3 C multiply and see whether you get the term 3 B 2 minus 3 C you get minus 9 PC here for P you can take it out for P that means a plus B minus 1 because 4 P when you take it out one is remaining in this one you can take X out you get x squared + 2 em 
,,you can take it out 3-2 in in remaining this one six is also common is also common I can take six six out six is out that means one - two 1s and one T example number one factorize 3x plus 6y plus KX plus 2k y four terms what's the method take two at a time and factorize from these two I can take three out you get X plus 2y from 
,,these two I can take plus K out X plus two now we see X plus 2y is common and then the remaining part you write inside brackets example number two similar way four terms you can take first two and last two separately if you take this one you can take a out so a minus three is there when you take B out a minus three there so a minus three is common what's remaining a plus B example number three see a method X is comma and take it out you get X plus y now what happens both - you can take - one out because XY only one is common take one out you get X plus one X plus y and the remaining part X minus one exercise six point one factorize each of the following algebraic expressions of so you get four terms take two at a time he's common you get X plus y last three is common X plus y so X plus YN EI plus three nice two is common you get X minus eight here plus three is common then you get X minus eight so X minus eight ten a plus three what about these two Emmys come on take it out you get P minus Q minus n so which one we take - a no plus in you need positive P so we'll take minus n P minus Q P minus Q and a - this one which one is common in his common take it out get K Plus both negative you can take negative B out k plus L you are getting so k plus L is comment and the remaining part is B minus P this one take two at a time and factorize X take it out you'll get X plus four when you take minus three Y out that's X plus four again X plus four is common remaining part you write separately this one when you take these two Y is come and take it out Y minus 7 so in this one do we take minus 2 or plus 2 you take minus 2 to get positive by inside this becomes minus because minus minus becomes so y minus 7 and y minus 2 this one again take two at a time and see whether you can factorize here is comma and take it out this one too is common you get same thing a minus eight and plus two this one B you can check it out B plus 5 minus - you can take minus 2 out you get positive here because positive into negative is negative so B plus 5 and B minus 2 this one okay two at a time and factorize here or so two at a time and actress this one 5 is comma take it out when you take five this is one one plus six here minus y will take it out then this becomes 1 plus X 1 plus X n PI - what this one when you take a out X minus 1 here to get plus X will take minus one out X minus one again minus minus plus six minus one and a minus an example number one now this is these are trinomial quadratics have you factorize multiply the first and the last you get plus 6x squared and try to factorize plus 6x squared and when you add the factors you need to get plus five six one six two and three two three you are getting fine so 2x and 3x are the appropriate factors so you can split the middle term to 2x and 3x now we can take three at a time and factorize you get X plus 2 here when you take 3 out you get X plus 2 X plus 2 is common for both take it out and 
,,write X plus 3 as the other factor this one middle term is negative and the other one is positive so what you do when you find out the factors the larger factor should be negative so we'll try to find out positive 12x squared and find out the factor so that the difference is minus 8 or the addition tell me this is the second part we did this is minus this is plus means both the factors are negative so here find both negative factors to get positive 12x squared so what are the suitable factors 6l 2 so 6 & 2 you get minus 6x + -2 X now we'll split the middle term and take 2 at a time and factorize so here you can take minus 2 out and write X minus 6 so X minus 6 is common what's remaining X minus 2 example number 3 now the middle term is positive and their last term is negative then what we do now you are getting the difference when you take the difference you need to get plus 2 that means larger factor is positive so we'll do multiply these two you get my knee minus 15y squared find out the factors of -15 the difference is +2 15 is 5 & 3 so this positive the bigger one should be positive so this is plus and this is minus so I can write the middle term as plus 5i + -3 bar take two at a time and but right here I can take minus 3 out this becomes y plus 5 Plus 5 is common you get Y minus 3 example number 4 both negative so what's the situation both negative means when you multiply you're getting negative and the difference is minus 1 so the bigger number the bigger factor is negative here so what are the suitable factors to get minus 1 5 & 4 bigger one should be negative - 5 en plus boy now I split the middle term take two at 
,,a time I can't take +4 out now we see a minus 5 is common and the remaining part you right here exercise six-point tuna factorize the quadratic expressions given below so now we will try to do at once + + means the addition comes here so we can write 18x squared factors of 18 to get 9 6 & 3 so 6 X set 3xo split the middle term and take two at a time and factorize now see we are getting the same factor if something happens that means you are not getting the same so you have to go back and check again this one plus 30 by square factors of 30 to get 11 6 & 5 the buta pluses split the middle term into ante two at a time and now see what factors are the same here by plus six are there that's common take it out and remaining part you write inside the bracket this is also positive positive 24 a square factors of 24 to get 10 6l when you are doing sums you can easily get the factors correct factors at one six and Oh both positive we split the middle term and Factor s plus 6 here when you take plus 4 plus 6a plus 6 is common and the remaining part you right here this one 15 so you get 15 B squared when you multiply plus 15 B squared what are the 
,,factors of plus 15 to get minus 8 so minus 8 means both factors are negative both factors negative means 5 and 3 B minus 5b so you can get minus 3b minus 5b that's 50 take two at a time and factorize minus minus plus so B minus 3 is come and you get me - this one middle one negative last one positive me same thing so 6 6 square 
,,and the factors this is negative middle term is negative so that means both negative factors so you can't get 6 and one because you get minus 6 and minus 1 minus 7 so 3 & 2 both are the appropriate factors now split the middle term and fat rice X is common and here 2 is common minus minus plus X minus 3x minus 2 this 1 plus 20 and middle term is minus 12 so plus 20 M square factors of plus 20 but the middle term is negative means both negative what are the factors 10 + 2 4 & 5 you're not getting 10 + 2 10 and 2 both negatives you get 12 so M squared minus 10 name - 2 wim plus 20 so take two at a time and factorize when you take minus 2 world you get minus here and M minus 10 and if minus 2 oh you can do at once this one different last term is negative means one factor is positive and the other factor is negative so you need to get one here so one here means this one the larger factor is positive so how do you get larger factor positive so that means minus 12 what are the factors 6 & 2 it doesn't work for 1 3 so larger factor should be positive so you get me to the top Bonnie that means for a minus 3 then you take two at a time - 3 out you get a plus 4 gate take a plus 4 out you are getting a minus 3 now the next one - 24 P squared when you multiply last term negative means the larger factor is positive but the middle term is positive 24 8 times 3 so this is plus and this is minus then only you get plus 5p so P squared + 8 P minus 3 P minus 24 take two at a time and you take P out that's this minus 3 out you get P plus 8 so P + 8 + P minus 3 this one last term is negative when you multiply you get 16 we are what are the factors middle term is plus means the larger factor is positive 16 is a 10 choose larger factor is positive there is positive 8 and negative 2 P split them at middle term 8 P minus 2 P minus 16 state two at a time and factorize you get B plus 8 and B minus 2 this one same thing final value is negative means one is positive and one 
,,is negative how we find this is one factors of 12 4 & 3 middle term is negative means larger one is negative and the other one is positive in fact right so you write the middle term in terms of minus 4 L plus 3 and take first 2 separately and the last 2 separately so you get X here X minus 4 when you take +3 out what's remaining you get X minus 4 so X minus 4 is common take it out and the remaining part is X plus 3 this one last number is negative means you take the difference minus 40 a square the middle term 40 is 8 times 5 always think about the middle term and try to find out the correct factors 8 and 5 middle term is minus means the bigger one is 
,,negative now split the middle term into minus 80 that's five you take two at a time and factorize a minus eight e minus 8 is comma and the remaining part is a plus this is also same negative 10 our square factors of negative 10 that means we have to take the difference 10 means 5 and 2 middle term is negative means negative 5 r+ 500 splitting the middle term take two at a time you can take plus 2 out - hi then R minus 5 is common you get R plus 2 as their other factor this one both positive so that's easy plus 9y square R that means addition when you add the factors you are getting plus 6 what are the factors 3 + 3 so you get 3 by n 3 Y so Y squared is plus would pluses Y squared + 3 y + 3 y + 9 and take two at a time you get y plus 3 when you take 3 out that's also y + 3 now y plus 3 is common you get y plus 3 so you can write instead of this y plus 3 squared doesn't matter either you can keep like this or write as a square term this one positive as a middle term is negative so what's the condition both factors are negative 25 what are the factors five and five but both are negative so K squared - 5 K minus 5 K was 25 Dave two at a time and factorize you can take minus five out because you need plus K inside no okay - five again K minus five you can write as a square term this one four plus four X 
,,plus X square same things now so x squared meter term is plus means both pluses so plus 2 X n plus 2 X split the middle term 2 + 2 X + + 2 X and then take two at a time what's common to is commas 2 plus X and here also X is comma 2 plus X now 2 plus X is common and the remaining one is also 2 plus X I can write this one as a square term like this when you multiply you get positive 36 x squared middle term is plus 15 so that means addition what are the factors to get plus 15 12 + 3 + 3 15 so this is positive and this is also positive now split the middle term - 12 X + 3 X and you can take 12 out 3 + X when you take X out 3 + + X again now 3 + 6 come on 
,,take it out you get 12 plus X for the next factor this one middle term is negative this the constant term is positive what it means both factors are negative what are the factors that means addition we have to think about adding the two factors you need to get 11 36 and high but both factors are negative because the middle term 
,,is negative now split the middle term when you take two at a time 6 is common and a is common I'll take - a out because I need plus five minus a ok so five minus a is common for both and the remaining one is six minus a this one last one is positive and the middle term is negative that means both the factors are negative so what are the factors of plus 54 think about it 9 + 6 6 + 9 54 and when you add 6 plus 9 you get 15 so 9 and 6 but middle term is negative means both negative so we can split the middle term like this fat rice so you get 9 out 9 times 6 so you get here why when you take minus y out 6 minus y so 6 minus y is common take it out and raining part 9 - Wow example number one now you get two terms and we did difference between two square terms we can see 25 is a square number so write this number as a 
,,square term then how we write down the factors we write X and X to get x squared 5 and 5 to get 5 squared and 1 factor is positive and the other factor is negative this one again difference between two squared terms I can write 9 as 3 square then you can straight away apply difference between two square terms one is positive and one means negative example number three two terms so again same thing how can I write Phi l squared as a square term I can write to a whole thing square 49 seven squared difference between two squared terms two ways one term and the other one is seven one is positive one is negative here one is there is one a square number yes 
,,we can write 1 square is 4 P squared I can write to bead whole thing squared so this is difference between two squared terms so you can write down the two factors one is the first term 2 B is the second term one factor is positive the other factor is negative example number five so fact rise 2 x squared minus 72 now can you write as a square number 2 is not a square number so if that means first you need to find out the common factor for both you can take two out and right this is 36 now 36 is a square number so you can write as difference between two squared terms so I can write two factors one is X mine +6 and the other one is X minus six now find the value so you can use difference between two squared terms so what are the two factors one term is 33 the other one is seventy one factor is positive one factor is 
,,negative what's this value 50 50 times what's the difference difference is 6 plus 7 13 so 16 50 times 16 so take 0 and multiply by 5 5 times 6 33 remaining 5 times 1 5 5 + 3 8 so the answer is 800 example number 7 you get fractions but don't worry you can write it as a square term how can I write this fraction as a square term I can write x over 2 whole thing square once is a square number 9 you can write 3 square then this is difference between two squared terms so what are the factors you can write x over 2 minus 1 over 3 or x over 2 plus example 8 1 minus so I can write 1 squared 4 1 how can I write this one as a square term 3x over 4 whole thing squared because 16 is 4 times 4 and 9 is 3 times 3 difference between two squared terms one one the other term is 3x over for one term is positive one term is negative exercise 6.3 factorize the expressions given below so all these are difference between two square tiles hundred is 10 square so you can write one is positive and the other one is negative again this one right as a square that's six squared one factor is positive and the other factor is negative what about this one 9 squared is 
,,81 we can write as one factor positive the other factor negative here 4 + B squared 4 I can write 2 squared apply difference between two square terms one factor positive the factor negative this one four squared and a square one factor is positive and the other factor is negative you can write the negative 1 first as well 64 is 
,,8 squared when you write down the two factors you get this one is positive the other one is negative all these are two terms and we can see square terms will try to 
,,factorize here already this one is a square term this one you have to rewrite as a square term like this now apply the factor rule one factor is positive the other factor is negative this one you have to write both as a square term first and write down one factor positive the other one negative hundred this is square number I can write an X whole thing squared + 1 s1 square so what are the factors 10 X plus 1 and X minus 1 here 25 is 5 square this is already there so what are the factors 5m + n 5m - 49 is 7 square a t-bar you can write 9p whole thing square after you write down as a square term only you can write down the factors so 7 + 9 p 7 - 9 P this one I can't write 5 a bead whole thing square this is 3c whole thing square now write down 5 a b +3 c 5a b minus 3 c miscellaneous exercise factorize the following algebraic expressions by changing the order in which the terms appear as required yeah because we can't factorize these two so we need to change will change these two X minus BX minus a y plus B Y now take two at a time X out you get a minus B here I can take minus y out eight minus B your - - here plus a minus B is common you 
,,get X minus y as the other factor now look at this one what can you see yeah like terms are there so you don't need to take two terms apparel here but rice here first will simplify 9 P plus 3 P 12 P these two you get minus 8 Q now fact rice two expressions take the common term out for is come and take it out you get 3p minus 2q 
,,now we'll take this one you get trinomial quadratic expression but the order is not correct we need square term we need this one the middle term and here I'll rewrite this as square term first and X term and then the constant now multiply these 2 you get negative 12x squared find the factors of minus 12x squared to get plus one 
,,last one is negative means we take the difference difference is plus one so the larger factor is positive what are the factors four and three larger factor is positive means this is plus four and minus three now split the middle term you get this tail two at a time and here minus three out you get X plus four X minus 3 this one 
,,is the order correct no so constant term I can take this one a square term last and the middle term minus 3 K now when you multiply first and last you get minus o K 
,,square meter term is negative means the larger factor is negative so 4 times 1 and we take the difference so minus 4 n plus 1 so 4 minus 4 K plus 1 K minus K squared now take two at a time take 4 out you give 1 minus K when you take K out this is also 1 minus K so 1 minus K is come on you can write down o plus K as the other factor question number 2 factorize the following algebraic expressions two terms are there so T is not a square number so we'll take the common factor out what's the common factor to take it out so you get 4x squared minus 25 now 25 and 4 both are squared numbers I can rewrite as a square times 5 squared is 25 now I can write down 
,,the 2 factors as 2 X is the first term 5 is the other 1 is positive the other one is negative this one 3 I can take it out what's in answer here keep on now 81 is a 
,,square number that's 9 square now you can write down as difference between two squared terms X minus 9 and X plus 9 this one take the common term out is common I can it be is common for that common so what's remaining is squared B squared here one is remaining no I can write this one as a B whole thing squared + 1 square 1 squared is 1 now apply difference between two squared terms a B plus one a B this one you can take three out one minus four Q square now you can apply difference between 
,,"two square terms 1 squared is 1 - Q whole thing squared is 4 Q squared now write down the two factors 1 plus 2 Q 1 minus 2 Q find the value so we can use factorization to find these values because all these are square terms so we'll apply the formula difference between two square terms one means positive one is negative 23 + 3 26 here you get 20 put 0 and x - 2 times 6 12 2 times 2 4 + 1 5 here 45 + 5 + 45 - 5 are the factors 45 + 5 is 50 45 minus 5 is 40 so when you multiply you get 2,000 "
,,this 102 squared - 2 square so you can use difference between two squared terms hundred - plus 200 - - - you get 104 here here you get hundred it's easy to multiply 
,,by hundred move two places to the right so with two zeros yeah so ten thousand four hundred fourth one join each algebraic expression in column a with product off its factors in column B so we need to do separate here and find out the answer from the right hand side so we'll take the first one x squared minus X minus 6 this means one last term - means you need to get one plus and one minus middle term is - means the bigger factor is - so what are the factors last six x squared 3 n - bigger 
,,"one is - so I can write x squared - x will put 1 X so I can split the middle term 2 - 3 X and + 2 X and take two at a time get X - 3 when you take + 2 out that's X minus 3 so X minus 3 is common the other factor is x + 2 X - 3 and X plus 2 this one this one four terms so we take two at a time take two at a time X is , take it out here minus 3 is comma and take it off so what are the factors x + 5 + X - 3 yeah you get here this one two terms you can take common terms out first 2x is common when you take that you get x squared minus 4 now our difference between two squared terms so 2x is there you can write 4 as 2 squared now apply difference between two squared terms you get X plus 2 and X minus 2 where's that here so I can connect here the other one 4x squared minus 9 m squared I can rewrite as square terms 2x whole thing squared + 3 M square what are the factors to X plus 3 m 2x minus 3 where's there yeah definitely the other one is this one but this is the fraction yeah x squared over 25 you can write it as a square term x over 5 so x over 5 I'll do it here thing squared + 1 square now x over 5 plus 1 and x over 5 minus 1 it's already "
,,there so we did all so all answers are okay so we complete all factorization methods related to your textbook so what are they we did when you get common factor you 
,,can take it out that's rule number one sometimes you get expression as a commenter that's rule number two and when you have four terms you take two terms that factorize and then we did factorization trinomial quadratics and difference between two squared terms so practice with all these example and exercises to improve your knowledge in factorization

AlgebraicExpression,ffLLmV4mZwU,"Hi, Im Rob. Welcome to Math Antics. In this video, were going to learn about Polynomials. Thats a big math word for a really big concept in Algebra, so pay attention. Now before we can understand what polynomials are, we need to learn about what mathematicians call terms. In Algebra, terms are mathematical expressions that "
,,"are made up of two different parts: a number part and a variable part. In a term, the number part and the variable part are multiplied together, but since multiplication is implied in Algebra, the two parts of a term are usually written right next to each other with no times symbol between them. The number part is pretty simple its just a number, like 2 or 5 or 1.4 And the number part has an official name its called the coefficient. Now theres another cool math word that you can use "
,,"to impress your friends at parties! and then I said, Thats not my wife thats my coefficient! The variable part of a term is a little more complicated. It can be made up of one or more variables that are raised to a power. Like the variable part could be 'x squared'.  Thats a variable raised to a power. Or, the variable part could be just y. If you remember what we learned in our last video, youll realize that that also qualifies as a variable raised to a power. y is the same as y to the 1st power. But since the exponent 1 doesnt change anything, we dont need to actually show it. Or the variable part of a term could be some tricky combination of variables that are raised to powers, like x squared times y squared. or a times b squared times c cubed. Terms can have any number of variables like that, but the good news is that most of the time, youll only need to deal with terms that have one variable. or maybe two in complicated problems. Oh, and "
,,"theres one thing I should point out before we move on if you have a term like 6y, even though it would be fine to do the multiplication the other way around and write y6, its conventional to always write the number part of the term first and the variable part of the term second. Okay, so thats the basic idea of a term. But theres a little more to terms that well learn in a minute. First, lets see how this basic idea of a term helps us understand the basic idea of a polynomial. A polynomial is a combination of many terms. Its kind of like a chain of terms that are all linked together using addition or subtraction. The terms themselves contain multiplication, but each term in a polynomial must be joined by either addition or subtraction. And polynomials can be made from any number of terms joined together, but there are a few specific names that are used to describe polynomials with a certain number of terms. If theres only one term (which isnt really a chain) then we call it a monomial because the prefix mono means one. If there are just two terms, then we call it a binomial because the prefix bi means two, and if there are three terms, then we call it a trinomial since the prefix tri means three. Beyond three terms, we usually just say polynomial since poly means many, and in fact, its common to simply use the term polynomial even when there are just 2 or 3 terms. Okay, so thats the basic idea of a polynomial. Its a series of terms that are joined together by addition or subtraction. Now, lets see a typical example of a polynomial that will help us learn a little more about terms:  3 x squared plus x minus 5 How many terms does this polynomial have? Well, based on what weve learned so far, youre probably not quit sure. If the terms are the parts that are joined together by addition or subtraction, then this should have three terms, but it looks like theres something missing with the last two terms. This middle term is missing its number part, and this last term is missing its variable part. That doesnt seem to fit with our original definition of a term.  Whats up with that? Well, the middle term is easy to explain. There really is a number part there, but its just 1. Do you remember how 1 is always a factor of any number? But, since multiplying by 1 has no effect on a number or variable, we dont need to show it. So, if you see a term in a polynomial that has only a variable part, you know that the number part (or coefficient) of that term is just 1. Okay, but what about this last term thats missing its variable part? Well, thats a little trickier. Do you remember in our last video about exponents in Algebra, we learned that any number or variable thats raised to the 0th power just equals 1? That means we can think of this last term as having a variable x thats being raised to the 0th power. Since that would always just equal 1, its not really a variable in the true sense of the word, and it has no effect on the value of the term. But it makes sense, especially if you remember the other rule from the last video. That rule says that any number raised to the 1st power is just itself, which helps us see that this middle term is basically the same as 1x raised to the 1st power. Now do you see the pattern? Each term has a number part and each term has a variable part that is raised to a power: 0, 1 and 2. But since x to the 0 is just 1, and x to the 1 is just x, and anything multiplied by 1 is just itself, the polynomial gets simplified so that it no longer looks exactly like the pattern it comes from. Oh, and this last term the one that doesnt have a truly variable part its called a CONSTANT term because its value always stays the same. Alright Now that you know what a Polynomial is, lets talk about an important property of terms and polynomials called their degree. Now that might sound like the units we use to measure temperature or angles, but the degree were talking about here is different. The degree of a term is determined by the power of the variable part. For example, in this term, since the power of the variable is 4, we say that the degree of the term is 4, or that its a 4th degree term. And in this term, the power of the variable is 3, so its a 3rd degree term. Likewise, this would be a 2nd degree term and this would be a 1st degree term. Oh, and I suppose you could call a term with no variable part a zero degree term, but its usually just referred to as a constant term. Things are a little more complicated when you have terms with more that one variable. In that case, you add up the powers of each variable to get the degree of the term. Since the powers in this term are 3 and 2, its a 5th "
,,"degree term because 3 + 2 = 5. Okay, but why do we care about the degree of terms? Well, its because polynomials are often referred to by the degree of their highest term. If a polynomial contains a 4th degree term (but no higher terms), then its called a 4th degree polynomial. But if its highest term is only a 2nd degree term, then its called a 2nd degree polynomial. Another reason that we care about the degree of the terms is that it helps us decide the arrangement of a polynomial. We arrange the terms in a polynomial in order from the highest degree to the lowest. ya know, cuz, mathematicians like to keep things organized [mumbeling] nice lets seedouble check Perfect! For example, this polynomial (which has 5 terms) should be rearranged so that the highest degree term is on the left, and the lowest degree term is on the right. But of course, not every polynomial has a term of every degree. This is a 5th degree polynomial, but it only has 3 terms. We should still put them in order from highest to lowest, even though it has terms that are missing. So, the 4x to the fifth should come first. And then the minus 10x. And finally, the plus 8. By the way, its totally fine for a polynomial to have missing terms like that. And its sometimes helpful to think of those missing terms as just having coefficients that are all zeros. If the coefficient of a term is zero, then the whole term has a value of zero so it wouldnt effect the polynomial at all. And speaking of coefficients What if we need to re-arrange this polynomial so that its terms are in order from highest degree to lowest degree? The highest degree term is 5x squared but before we just move it to the front of the polynomial, its important to notice that its got a minus sign in front of it. Normally when "
,,"we see a minus sign, we think of subtraction, but when it comes to polynomials, its best to think of a minus sign as a NEGATIVE SIGN that means the term right after it has a negative value (or a negative coefficient). In fact, instead of thinking of a polynomial as having terms that are added OR subtracted, its best to think of ALL of the terms as being ADDED, but that each term has either a POSITIVE or a NEGATIVE coefficient which is determined by the operator right in front of that term. For example, if you have this Polynomial, you should treat it as if all of the terms are being added together, and use the sign thats directly in front of each term to tell you if its a positive or a negative term. This first term has a coefficient of negative 4, so its a negative term. The next term has a coefficient of "
,,"positive 6, so its positive. The next term has a coefficient of negative 8, so its negative. And the constant term is just positive 2. And recognizing positive and negative coefficients helps us a lot when rearranging polynomials that have a mixture of positive and negative terms like our example here. If you think of the negative sign in front of the 5x squared term as part of its coefficient, then youll realize that when we move it to the front of the polynomial, the negative sign has to come with it. It has to come with it because its really a NEGATIVE term. If we dont bring the negative sign along with it, well be changing it into a positive term which would actually change the value of the polynomial. And in addition to helping us re-arrange them, treating a polynomial as a combination of positive and negative terms will be very helpful when we need to simplify them, which just so happens to be the subject of our next basic Algebra video. Alright, weve learned a LOT about polynomials in this video, and if youre a little overwhelmed, dont worry it might just take some time for it all to make sense. Remember, you can always re-watch this video a few times, and doing some of the practice problems will help it all sink in. As always, thanks for watching Math Antics,"

AlgebraicExpression,fUOdon3y1hU,algebraic expressions and equations good day students welcome back to my classroom for today's lesson you are going to learn how to differentiate expression from equation translate variable expressions and equations into algebraic expressions and equations and vice versa and lastly identify a variable in non-algebraic expression and equation let us begin let's cover brain exercise let's take a look at this one we have the sum of eight and nine can you translate this into a numerical expression great job we have here the keyword sum which represents addition this means that we need to add eight and nine so that is eight plus nine and this is an example 
,,of a numerical expression next one we have the sum of four and a number again our keyword here is sum which means addition this means that we need to add 4 and a number here we do not know the value of a number therefore we are going to represent it by a letter let's say letter n so that is four plus n this is an example of algebraic expression next one we have the sum of four and the number is seven again our keyword here is the word sum which means addition and we need to add four and a number which is four plus n and the word is represents equal sign therefore four plus n is equal seven this is an example of algebraic equation now do you know what is the difference between algebraic expression and equation let's go and take a look let us discuss the differences between expression and equation in algebraic expression it is a mathematical phrase for example we have this sum of 4 and a number and as we can see this is not a complete sentence while the algebraic equation is a 
,,mathematical sentence for example we have the sum of four and the number is seven another one is algebraic expression has no equal sign while in algebraic equation it has equal sign which represented by the word is lastly in an expression a value of the letter or the symbol can change for example here we have 4 plus n we can say that the value of n is 5 so that would be four plus five or we can say that the volume n here is nine so that would be four plus nine or let us say it is equal to so that would be four plus two on the other hand in algebraic equation the value of the letter or the symbol cannot be changed it has a fixed volume or fixed answer here n four plus n equals seven we cannot say that the value of n is nine as it will not say that the equation is correct if we say that the value of n here is two the equation would be wrong what if we say that the value of n here is three or plus three equals 7 and that is the correct value of m wonderful now that you know the 
,,differences let's move on to the parts of algebraic expression the first one is the variable the variable is any letter or symbol that represents a number here the variable is letter x the next one is the coefficient the coefficient is the constant value used with the variable it is the factor or the number being multiplied to a variable here the coefficient is two we can always find the coefficient before the variable the next one is the constant the constant is the fixed value that does not change here the constant is number five and lastly we have the term the term is a number or variable a product or quotient of a number and variables separated by 
,,plus or minus sign here in a given example we have the plus sign and it separates two terms which are 2x and 5 remember that addition and subtraction only separate terms while division and multiplication do not separate terms now that you already know the parts and the differences between equation expression let us go and translate some verbal expressions here we have a number plus 3 first one that you need to know is what is the missing here the missing here is a number this means that we 
,,are going to represent it by a variable any letter that we would like to let's say i want letter m the next keyword here would be the word plus which means edition so that is m plus three so our algebraic expression here is m plus three now let's have another example we have the sum of a number and three again let's take a look 
,,for some keywords here the keywords that we have is the word sum which means addition therefore we need to add a number which can be represented by a variable let's 
,,say letter m and the number 3 so that is m plus 3 very good let's have another one we have m increased by 3 here we already have a variable which is m so let us write m next we have the keyword increase by increase by represents addition so that would be a plus sign and lastly the number three next one we have three added to m so again we already have a variable which is m and we need to add 3 to it so that is m plus 3 next one we have 3 more than m again our variable here is m and the word more than represents addition and we have three so that is m plus three now let us identify which are the variables coefficient constant and the number of terms here in our given algebraic expression the variable here is the letter which is and very good next one let us take a look for the coefficient again the coefficient is the number that we see before the variable as we can see there is no number before a variable here but it doesn't mean that we do not have a coefficient remember that a coefficient is a factor or a number multiplied to a variable all variables that do not have a number beforehand has a coefficient of one because it means one times m which is equals m so the coefficient here is one next one the constant here is very good it is three and let's count the number of terms since this algebraic expression is separated by a plus sign or addition our terms here are m and 3. so we have two turns great job let's have another example next one we have a number minus seven again we have here a number which can be represented by a variable so let us say letter f our next keyword here is the word minus which represents subtraction and there is 7 so that is f minus seven next one we have the difference of f and seven so again let's take a look for some keywords we have different and the difference represents subtraction so we need to subtract f and seven all right let's have another example we have f decreased by seven so our variable here is f and we need to decrease this one which represents subtraction by seven next example we have seven subtracted from f so our variable here is is the letter f and we need to subtract seven from it to that will be m minus seven and lastly we have seven less than f and our variable again here is letter f and our keyword is less than which means subtraction 7 so that is f minus seven now let's identify the variable here again our variable is the letter which is very good is letter f and now let's take a look for the coefficient since there's no number before our variable here therefore the coefficient here is one next one is the constant the constant here is negative 
,,seven now let's count the number of terms so we have here minus that separates the term so we have f and seven so that is to turn all right let's go to our next example this time we have a number time two again we have here the missing value which is a number so now let's represent it by a letter let's say letter n times which means multiplication two in an algebraic expression we do not use the multiplication sign as it confuses us into a variable x instead of using the multiplication sign the number we just simply combine the number and the variable so that would be 2 n next example we have twice of n here our variable is n and our keyword is the word to white which means to time so that is two times n therefore that is to n on to our next example we have n multiplied by two here our variable is letter n and our keyword is multiplied by two so we need to multiply n by two so that would be two n next one we have the double of n here our keyword again is double which means times two so we need to times two the letter n so that is two n all right next one we have the product of n and two so our variable here is n and our keyword is product which is the answer for multiplication this means that we need to multiply n and 2 so that is 2 m now let us identify the variable the variable here obvi is the letter and while the coefficient is 2 as it is the number before the variable next one is the constant as we can see we do not have a constant here while the number of terms since there's no addition or subtraction that separates the term we only have one term now let's move on to our next example next one we have a number divided by five again we have the missing volume which is a number so let us represent this by a variable f and we need to divide this by five so we can write this as n divided by five next one we have the quotient of n and phi so again our keyword here is equation which means division so it means that we need to divide n and five so that is n divided by five next one we have one fifth of n so it means that we need to multiply one and n so that is one-fifth n but it can also be written as n over five okay next one we have the ratio of n to five our variable here is n and our clue word here is the ratio we all know that we can represent ratio by a fraction so 
,,that would be n is to five or n over five which also means and divided by five now our variable here is the letter n while the coefficient here is one fifth as this 
,,is the factor or the number being multiplied to the variable n next one is the constant here we cannot see a constant so that would be zero or not well the number of terms since there's no addition or attraction with separate t terms this means that we only have one term great job now that you already know some basics this time 
,,let's try to translate a verbal expression with more than one operation into algebraic expression let's have our first example six more than twice a number so again 
,,we need to take a look for some clues in order for us to translate this one so our clue word here as we can see we have two white a number and we all know that that 
,,means two times a number or a variable so we can say that is two a and next one we have six more than and that is plus six so therefore our expression here is two a 
,,plus six wonderful now let's identify the variable here is a good job well the coefficient here is 2. next one the constant is 6 and we have here two terms which are two a and six let's have another example this time we have 18 less than half a number now let's take a look for some favorite we have here 18 less than and we all know that lessons mean subtract so that is minus eight next one we have have a number and that means one half times a number or a variable so that would be one half y now if we combine them together we have one half y minus eight so that is 18 less than half a number so here our variable is y well the coefficient here is one half well the constant is negative 18 or minus 18. and the number of terms here are two that is one-half y and eighteen now let's have another example we have one plus twice a number is ten so our first clue right here is to rise a number and that means three times a variable so we can say it is to re b next one we have one plot and that means plus one if we combine that together we have three b plus one and we still have more to translate here we have the word estet which means that equals ten so that is three b plus one equals ten so here we have the variable b while the coefficient here is three the constants are one and ten and the number of terms here are three which are three b one and ten this time let us translate an expression into a verbal or word sentences or phrases here we have b plus eight divided by two so first we have b plus eight we can write this one as the sum of b and eight and next we have divided by two so that would be divided by two now we have the sum of b and eight divided by two wonderful let's have another example here we have three n plus 25 equals 31. first let's try to translate plus 25. we can translate this 
,,one as 25 added two but i will use 25 added two next we have three n this means that three times n but we can also say to rise of n and lastly we have equals 31 which means s31 so now we have 25 added tutorials of n is 31. good job students you made it this far now here are the things that you learned today you

AlgebraicExpression,Rr0Os2iteV4,you have two options the first one is a B's the second option is to a B if you could figure out the result is to a B hello friends welcome back to the shorter world 
,,this is our new series where we're gonna cover every chapter and this is our first chapter algebra and today we are starting it's part one which is basic algebra formulas oh you call it formally okay no issues are occurring to me for the correct you say formulas or formally but we'll cover everything about basic algebra so without wasting time let's begin the first formula is a plus B whole square which is equal to s qua plus 2 a B plus B Square this is very very basic formula but still you will find many people doesn't understand how does it come so if you also don't know how to prove this simply multiply a plus B into a plus B you'll get to know this the next one is a minus B whole square which is equal to a square minus 2 a B plus B Square the next one is a square minus B Square which is equal to a minus B into a plus B my dear friends these are the most basic formula from which we can derive any other formula so that's why let's revise it once again the first one is the a plus B whole square which is equal to a square plus 2 a B plus B square but second is a minus B whole square which is equal to a square minus 2 a B plus B Square and the third one is a square minus B Square which is equal to a minus 3 into a plus B now we know all these three formulas but do we know what is the significance of 
,,this and how to utilize this in our practical life probably no so let's say you have to find out the square of 52 how would you deal with this my dear friends let's 
,,use the first Formula a plus B whole square which is equal to a square plus 2 a B plus B square if you compare here is equal to 50 and B is equal to 2 so simply we'll take the square of a that means 50 square which is to 5 double 0 and 2 into a into B so 2 into 50 into 2 which is equal to 200 and at the end B square which means 
,,"2 square 2 square is 4 now simply add all this 2,500 plus 200 plus 4 it's 2700 and for that said my dear friends this is as simple as this now let's try to modify the same formula which we had seen which was a plus B whole square if I try to write a plus B whole square is equal to a minus B whole square now we need to do some modification this so that this expression should be correct right now if you look at the first part a plus B whole square is equal to a square plus 2 a B plus B Square right the second part says a minus b whole square which means a square minus 2 a B plus B Square so if I simply add plus 4a B to the right-hand side this expression would be exactly equal to the left hand side right so now I can write a minus b whole square plus 4 a B so the similar thing can be done in the second expression as well a minus B whole square if I modify this in different manner it would become a plus B whole square minus 480 this is what many people will say and the formula but this is exactly the same thing which we had written earlier or you can say this is just a modification of that now let's move on and try to figure out what would "
,,be the value of a plus B plus C let's say that variable C and if we are supposed to take the square of this this is equal to the square of each variable that means a square plus B square plus C square plus 2 into a B plus BC plus C that means 2 times of all this now this is one formula you can consider C with negatives and B with negative sign or both with negative sign or a with negative sign it's up to you first of all let's say consider B with negative sign in this case wherever you get 
,,B just put minus B instead of B so you'll find the expression like this in the same manner if you put C with negative sign you'll get this expression if you put both B and C with negative sign you'll get this expression so we are not doing anything we're just putting B or C or anything whatever you want with negative sign and your expression will get modified my dear friends now let's try to figure out the cube of a plus B a plus B whole cube is equal to a cube plus B cube plus 3 a B into a plus B if I consider this with negative sign and the expression would become like this now in the same way the cubic expression can be written as a cube plus B cube is equal to a plus B into a square minus a B plus B Square this is another form of writing this now if you change the sign of a cube plus B cube to a cube minus B cube the expression would become like this my dear friends we have seen all kinds of basic formulate now it's time to practice all those things so let's begin with the first question you'll be given five seconds solve this and this is one of the very very basic question you have two options the first one is a B's the second option is to a B if you could figure out the result is 2a be excellent had you not chosen no shoes because it's very difficult to remember each and every formula by looking at for the first time now let's move on to the second question a one expression is written this expression is equal to which one of the following we have two options one is a cube plus B cube the second option is a cube minus B cube you don't have any time limit to solve this you just pause the video and think try to recall the formula you'll come to know about the answer just pause the video and once you figure out just resume it if you could figure out the first option a cube plus B cube great work now it's time to give you some homework you need to solve all the basic questions without using calculator and width formula do not try to solve directly the first question is 79 square minus 29 square let me give you a hint this is in the form of a square minus B Square now the next one is 48 a square the hint is 
,,you need to solve this as 50 minus 2 whole square and the third one is 221 square and this is in the form of a plus B plus C whole square which means here you can figure out as 200 plus 20 plus 1 square now here are the list of all the formulas don't forget any one of them so you what you can do is you can take a snapshot of this and save it in your mobile phone or your laptop my dear friends in the next video we'll be covering algebra part two if you're going to get notified please subscribe to channel and press the notification bell as well if you like this video please give a thumbs up if you have any doubts I finna give any suggestion post your comments in the comment box and if you find this video is good for any of your friends colleagues or your schoolmates let's share the video with those guys but as of now thank you so much for watching this video and please state

AlgebraicExpression,gxOp8T-akvQ,from a childhood is from our childhood itself okay most of us are very fear about the multiplication tables sro so you may or without many of the people will say sir it is very calculate very tough to learn the tables why because we can't able to can buy hat them see I am going to explain you one beautiful technique today that is how to calculate multiplication tables up to thousand in the mind you will feel little crazy see we don't know even the tables up to tall or certain properly but this guy is saying that I can make you learn up to the tables thousand is it possible yes it is exactly possible but with a small change in your attitude see remember one thing if you are thinking something is difficult it will be difficult counting but if you try in a little different manner but to make it easy yes it is possible to calculate even thousand not own without ten thousand tables also in the mind provided condition there should be some practice now we'll start how to calculate up to one hundred tables first first see here suppose if automatic blind 110 is no mind I want to multiply 24 into six times do you know 24 table no even I don't know but even you don't know 24 tables you can easily calculate in the mind how see here what is six twos tool but don't take that well take it as 1.8 and keep in the mind take it as 120 and keeping them mind for some time you have to say to the mind so 120 yes my please - one ready for some time here right now what is six fours on 
,,24 120 plus 24 how much exactly this 144 one more example I want to multiply 36 into five times do you ever feed him 36 table no even I do not know but how see here 
,,what is five threes 15 but don't take a spoof thing take it as 150 and keep the mine for some time theta is 150 and keeping the mind for some time what is in spice 30 what is it and how is there in the mind 150 150 plus 30 it's 180 suppose I need for the six six times what is six force 24 but take it as 240 you made it went out 
,,why we need to take it as 240 here why because we are multiplying with the digit it is in de which is in the tens place which is in the tenths place that's why we are going to multiply with the Oh that's why we are imagining the nimble ass 240 right I'm just keeping a zero at the end that's it why because we are dealing with the digit which is in the tens place now what is his force 24 take it as 240 so keep it Kate - what in the mind now what is six six thirty six to forty in the mind plus 36 its 276 similarly 30 let us take some 83 into nine about to multiply 80 3 into 9 now what is in nine eight seventy to take it as exactly 720 720 keep in the mind 720 plus 27 sm1977 so 700 us 27 747 one more example I want to multiply 89 89 7 - 1 5 so what is 1864 but it has six forty six forty plus 72 six forty plus 72 how much seven one two so most of you people are maybe feeling difficult in our adding the numbers like this in the mind see here 640 + 72 you are feeling little difficult in this one why because it is crossing some 100 if it is below 100 it is not a problem but whenever the addition some is causing some handle you are feeling difficult now see here how to deal it with easily now remember 640 plus 72 anyhow the last digit will be coming as it is asana why because we are going to add it with zero zero plus Treleaven to only we'll get so for some time ignore about the last digit - of course it should be in the mind for some time but for some time just keep it aside why because we no need to bother why because is going today we are going to get that digit as it is now concentrate on the remaining part 64 plus 7 how much 64 plus 7 yes 71 it is easy right so our answer is completely 7 12 one more example suppose say some 79 into some 779 into seven now the same rule we are going to follow seven sevens 49 but don't think it has 49 494 90 plus 63 490 plus 63 remember how to add 490 per sec ste 3 in the mind 490 plus 63 means 0 plus 3 now we get 3 as it is at the end so just keep it aside now what is 49 plus 6 49 plus 6 is 55 so my answer 55 + 3 as it is so answer is finally 553 like that we can calculate okay you tell me this time oh it is 99 so okay now it 99 five times what is finite okay this time I'm not going to ask you what is financed or what is financed again simply you have to say 450 plus 45 hey sir 450 plus 45 it is 495 similarly 78 eight times I want to multiply don't say this time it's 756 with latest agnes price history 
,,like that simply 560 plus 64 560 plus 64 is how much exactly 624 560 plus 64 0 plus 4 will get 4 as it is now 56 plus 6 is how much 62 stay tuned for 6:24 like that 
,,you need to calculate in the mind okay so similarly you tell me what is finally ninety nine nine times this time what is ninety nine nine times so yes exactly 8n plus 81 8m plus 81 is how much 891 okay so now you tell me if at all if anybody asked you really right so how many tables do you know until now okay if it is like this 
,,you know up to 99 tables for naught yes we know tonight night it was not even 99 you mean Oh hundred also so you can say yes gladly you can say proudly that we learnt now until 100 tables but my friend not only hundred tables but I am going to extend this thing to even thousand also how let us see friends let us extend the same 
,,formula same technique to even up to thousand tables also suppose I want to multiply some 346 into say some three I want to multiply 346 three times right you may think it is it is a little difficult but actually it is not now you see what is 3 3 times 3 3 times is 9 but don't take it as 9 take it as 900 this one take it as 900 
,,why this 3 is in hundreds place that's why I am asking you to take it as 900 keep 900 in the mind for some time ok don't eat no keep for some time 900 now what is 3 
,,force 203 first 12 but take it as take it as yes 120 why because it is in tens place so there is 900 in the mind and this is 149 hundred plus 120 what is that 900 plus 120 is 1020 1020 keep in the mind for some time again 1020 1020 plus 18 1020 plus 18 yes simply 1038 this will be your answer one more example I want to calculate for for 547 into say some eight times five forty seven eight ten so on too much multiplying in the mind now you tell me what is a it finds 40 but Dignitas 40 hundreds okay 40 and is nothing but four thousand okay four thousand keep in the mind now what is an eighth force thirty-two take that three twenty-four thousand plus three twenty four thousand three twenty four thousand three twenty plus 56 four thousand 320 plus 56 how much 4350 sorry how much it is four thousand three hundred plus 
,,"56 it is four thousand 376 one more example 679 eight times I want to multiply 679 eight times H is a 48 take it as 4,800 that is 4,800 keeping the mind 4,800 for some time what is in sevens of 56 taken as 564 thousand eight hundred plus 560 how much 5,000 three 16s on own yes for five thousand three sixty-five thousand three sixty plus 72 five thousand three sixteen plus 72 five thousand 432 five thousand 432 I'm adding in the mind only see here I will tell you the steps eight six up 48 so 4,800 first add this 4,800 to the next one eight seven fifty six data is 560 so I am adding these two first 4,800 plus five 65 thousand three hundred sixty-four this one again I am adding the last one eight nine the 72 so adding 72 here how much I will get 5432 simply zero plus two will get to as it is but what is 536 + 7 543 simply okay even this small side is the same way 547 into 8 so 8 fisa 40 take - 1408 Roger that it would take it as 3 20 how much will get 4,000 320 first add two numbers then go for the third one now what is a terms of 56 so what is the answer 4 3 7 6 like this you need to calculate in the mind even similarly say some big number 8 9 82 8 times okay 6400 come with me have a say along with me six thousand four hundred players seven twenty six thousand why because it is tens place six thousand four hundred plus 7 27 thousand 127 thousand 120 Plus 64 seven thousand 184 exactly similarly say 9 9 9 into 9 9999 this time it will be the same amount same way 8100 my in the mind 8100 8100 + 8 10 8100 + 8 10 eight thousand nineteen eight thousand nine ten that is 8910 8910 + 81 8910 + 81 8990 1 this will be you answer now you tell me if we calculate like this is it easier I'm not to calculate 99 turbulent ervil's yes it is very easy but you need practice for this one okay you should be "
,,little faster in doing the additions okay right even know suppose if it is a big number okay and if want to be if it is a big number - maybe the single-digit how can we calculate that one we'll discuss now in the next technique

AlgebraicExpression,CT9iX5osAs4,hello grade 8 children today I am here with another new topic we'll see what's the topic about you have done numbers two plus three and a half minus five oh you have done point three plus 95 so all these are with numbers so we call this is number theory then you have done straight lines circles squares parallel lines and angles 
,,all are these geometry what about letters what are these two x plus three Y minus five plus three X letters and numbers combination we call that algebra so today we 
,,are doing about algebra so what's the topic chapter five algebraic expression so we'll find out what are the terms involved in this uni and what are the concepts look at this one the price of a coconut is 48 rupees the distance from Colombo to Gul is hundred kilometers there are 31 days in the month of January Ravinder gets 80 points in mathematics course so what are they is 48 130 180 what are those those are numbers if I ask you a question what's the height of a student in grade 8 class so we can't give a specific value usually the height of the students in the class will be different from one another so therefore we need to define a term called variable so what's variable changing values of height as it is not a fixed number so when you don't get a fixed number when the value is changing we call those are variables we use algebraic terms or expressions to denote changing values so we'll take height as a letter so we use algebraic expression like x today not changing values any letter this one profit varies from one day to another day from Nima's three-wheeler so it's changing all the time it can be named as I'll put a receipt a so what's a it's a variable because it's changing all the time this one radius of three circles are three centimetres four centimetres and five centimetres respectively when we consider radius of the circle we can take this one is R that's a variable we can use a letter so what's the R value we can write R equals three centimeters R equals four centimeters that our equals five centimeters so what's the variable they are our that's the radius of the circle this one city does a bias certain number 
,,"of string hoppers to sell in his boutique every day if we do not know the number exactly can show it as another variable we'll take simple B where B is an unknown set we don't know exactly the amount of string hoppers that city dancer buys look at this one in the figure above shows three containers of the same size all three containers contain an equal amount of liquid it can be considered as what you can use another letter H because it is an unknown constant because we don't know exactly what's the water level is so here what's the variable H height of water so lowercase letters such as a b c or you can put X Y Z so any simple lowercase letters we can use to represent variables so it can be an unknown constant or a variable look at this one the daily income of poachers fruit shop can be stated as X so what is X they are jail income he saved his income by 2,000 rupees a day find the remaining amount of money what's the total income X he's saving to thousand rupees each day so what's the remaining amount you can write in terms of X X is the total value daily income subtract 2000 so the remaining amount is X minus 2000 so this is an algebraic expression so what are the terms terms in this algebraic expression we can write x an mm so those are called terms of algebraic expression so what are the terms "
,,you learn now you learned about variable and we can use simple letters for variables and the next term is terms of an algebraic expression look at this one the price of a coconut is extra base the price of 8 coconut so what you do you have to multiply by 8 so one coconut is x and x 8 so what's the value you get 8x rupees so what are the terms you can say 8x is an algebraic term and the number in front of the letter here X is the variable the number in front of the letter is called coefficient so what's the coefficient in this term 8 8 is the coefficient of the algebraic term we learned about variables terms and coefficient now look at this one combination of algebraic terms 5x plus 3y minus 4z that's called algebraic expression so what are these 5 x 3y minus 4 are the algebraic terms and what about this one the number in front of the letter what you call that coefficients coefficients and terms the width of the rectangle is X its length is 7 its length is 7 meters more than the rich right the algebraic expression for the length so how can we write down length 7 more than that ex-mo more means in maths plus addition X plus 7 is the length so what's the algebraic expression for length X plus 7 if the length of the rectangle is wild now they have given this one is y if this one is y write down the algebraic expression for width we know the width is 7 meters less than the length so we can write by -7 if you take length as Y that's Y minus 7 is the weight the price 
,,of a pen is extra pays the cost of a pencil is why rupees the price of a book is 0 please so what about price of three prints one is X and 3 you have to multiply by 
,,3 3 X 3 times X you don't need to write down the multiplication sign you can write 3x price of 4 pencils one pencil is why 4 pencils for y price of several books one book is zero Peas seven books 7z give the cost of buying all the above in the form of an algebraic expression so the total cost we can add it together 3x plus 4y plus 7c that's an algebraic expression write the terms of this algebraic expression so you have given an algebraic expression what are the terms 3x for bi and 7z coefficient of 3 X we know what is coefficient means the number in front of the letter that's 3 coefficient of 4y what's the number in front that's four coefficient of 77 is the coefficient there build algebraic expression for the following statements we'll try to write in terms of letters you can take these letters given add 7 to the double of X what if double means 2 times X so adding 7 to double of X means 2x 2x plus 7 subtract 6 from the 3 times of X but if three times means 3x 3x and you have to subtract 6 subtract 3 from the sum of x and y sum of x and y means the addition X plus 1 and subtract 3 divided by y how you divide we can write x over 1 divide X by y and subtract from seven so that turns that you have to subtract from seven that means seven - so we'll write seven minus x over Y not X over Y minus 7 because from 7 you have to subtract this amount divided the multiplication of a and B multiplication of a and B by 3 means a B divided by 3 divided the multiplication of 
,,a and B by 3 and subtract from 10 from 10 means 10 minus this value filling the gaps in the following table algebraic expressions are there as you break terms so you have to write down only algebraic terms so what are the algebraic terms 7 x + 3 by what's the coefficient 7 & 3 what are the I do break terms here 6a + 3 B here you don't write down these constants algebraic terms means only terms with letters what are the coefficients 6 & 3 here Excel why hyphens are 1 and 1 in this one 3 a coefficient is 3 this one - 3 X + 7 5 coefficients are -3 here and so this one you get a fraction but here this is an algebraic term 2x over 3 you can write X in the numerator and 3 by over 5 also an algebraic term then what's the coefficient you have to take the whole thing the fraction 2/3 three fits this one this is an algebraic term 5x over 7 and minus 2y over 3 so what's the coefficient there five over seven is the coefficient of x term and minus two-thirds is the coefficient of weiter look at this question the cost of an arranges extra pays the cost of an apple is y rupees the cost of a mango is zero peas build algebraic expressions for the following price of two oranges and five mangoes oranges is X so 2x plus because this is both together five mangoes one mango easy five mangoes 5z price of two mangoes and seven apples two mangoes is to Z and seven apples Apple is why rupee so 7 y cost of six oranges and eight apples six oranges one orange is X plus six six and eight apples one Apple is why that's eight why price of five oranges seven apples and three mangos five oranges that's 5 X 7 apples 7 y then 3 mangoes 3z question number five cost of one orange one apple and two mangoes one Apple is why and one orange is X and two mangoes - Z - look at this one right down the algebraic expression for the total cost to buy three kilos of sugar two kilos of Thailand five kilos of flour we are one kilo of each product is a rupees be rupees and C rupees respectively so what are the values total cost we need three kilos of sugar so sugar is a so three a five kilos then two kilos of Dar Daly's be rupees to be and five kilos of flour flour is C rupees of five C next one one kilo of red dollies extra peas and one kilo of yellow dollies why rupees write down an algebraic expression for the extra mounts pen for buying five kilos of yellow da then three kilos of red that means the price is high when you buy five kilos of yellow da so what's the difference five 
,,kilos of yellow doll yellow one is by rupees 5 i- three kilos of red on red dollies extra piece per kilo so 3x so the difference is this well the capacity of a bucket days M liters and bucket B is in liters you need to use 12 buckets of a and eight buckets of B at once to fill a tank what is the capacity of the track so what's the total amount of a buckets yeah 12 a buckets so M liters are there so 12 M then what about from B buckets so need eight buckets of B each bucket contained in liters so eight and so the capacity of the tank is 12 m + 8 in the father's age in one of the families years the age of the mother is beers the daughter's age is Sears give the sum of ages of the father and mother in the form of an algebraic expression fathers ages a mother's ages B so the total is a plastic give the sum of the age of the mother and daughter in the form of an algebraic expression mother's age is B daughters ages the total of the ages of the father mother and dot all three of them a plus B plus C write the sum of the total age of the three above after 10 years in the form of an algebraic expression so we have to add 10 for each value 10 and 
,,10 and 10 for all three people that means 30 so the total value is a plus B plus C plus 30 so after 10 years this is the total value manufacturers men extra piece to make a table the manufacturer made a profit of twice as much as the cost price and sold it to a retailer the retailer solely to the consumer with a profit of by rupees right the profit of the manufacturer in the form of an algebraic expression so how can you write down an algebraic expression manufacture a spend X to make a table that's the cost value the manufacturer made a profit of twice as much as the cost price so what's the profit to X so write the profit of the manufacturer in the form of an algebraic expression err so that's 2x give the selling price of the table by the manufacturer in the form of an algebraic expression so the profit is 2x and the cost price is X so what's the selling price X plus 2x when you add it that's 3x so that's the selling price right the selling price of the retailer to the consumer in the form of an algebraic expression now the retailer sold it to the consumer with a profit of Y rupees so this is the price this retailer bought that means 3 X and he keeps by rupee profit so you have to add Y so this is the selling price of the retailer to the consumer the shape shown in the above is a square and a rectangle made out of matchsticks give the perimeter of the square in the form of an algebraic expression one side is given X for sides and there X plus X plus X plus X 
,,what's the perimeter for X give the perimeter of the rectangle in the form of an algebraic expression how you find out the perimeter you have to add all these lengths so a plus 2b plus a plus 2b a and a you are getting 2 a 2b and 2b when you add 2 plus 2 4 that's 4 B give the full length of the matchsticks used to construct the 
,,above images in the form of an algebraic expression so total length so length for the squares for X and length for this one is 2a plus 4b subtract the total length of the matchsticks used to make the square from the total length of the matchsticks used to make the rectangle in an algebraic expression so you have to subtract the 
,,lengths of matchsticks used to make the square from this one so what's the total here two way plus 4b and subtract the lengths for this one that's 4x look at this one give the perimeter of the equilateral triangle in the form of an algebraic expression equilateral means all sides I equal a and a n a what's the perimeter 3a right the perimeter of the write angular triangle in the form of an algebraic expression so just add all the lengths together we'll do that X plus X plus 2 plus X plus 1 
,,now you can simplify like terms you can add X X X 3x 2 & 1 that's right the total perimeter of the above diagrams in the form of an algebraic expression so this is the perimeter of the write angular triangle and is the parameter for the equilateral triangle so add it together 3 E + 3 X + 3 multiplying an algebraic expression by 
,,a number so we'll see how we can multiply the algebraic expression by a number width of the rectangle is X this is the width and the length is 1 determine the perimeter of the rectangle x + y + X + 1 so you can write down 2 times X plus y of x + alright separately x + y X plus y when you simplify you get 2 x + 2 I now I want to 
,,just separate these two parts this part separately and this part separately what's the length of this part when you separate this what's the length of this one x + y you get the same length here X + 1 so double of this x + y so length of one part is X plus y length of 2 parts you multiply by 2 so 2 times X plus 1 but we took the same diagram finding perimeter fully and taking separately you have to get the same answer so in both methods the perimeter of the same figure is equal so we can write down 2 x + y is equal to two x plus 2y now look at this one when there's a number in front you are multiplying both these X terms by two so when X plus y is x to both the terms x + y x - so now we observe when there's a number in front of an algebraic expression you have to multiply all terms with that number a box contains 
,,a red glass balls and B blue glass balls determine the total number of glass balls in such high boxes number of total ass balls in a box was that a plus B number of 
,,total glass balls in five boxes you have to multiply 5 times a plus B then number of red colored balls in a box separately there are a red color glass balls so number of red color balls in a box is a number of red glass balls in five boxes that's five B multiplied by five if you take separately blue ones how many blue ones are there be blue ones for five boxes you get five be blue ones in five boxes so what can you say about this one the total the total is now we can write total is 5 a + 5 
,,B the answer received in either of the two methods should be equal so in this case five times a plus B is equal to 5 a plus 5b now look at this one when you multiply by the constant each term you get this one remove the brackets of the following algebraic expressions now we can use that knowledge you gain from the previous two questions there's a number in front this is a minus B is the algebraic expression so what you do multiply the first term as shown by the first arrow so this is the first arrow multiply this value here 3 times a 3 and then multiply the second term as shown by the second arrow I'll put numbers this is one red one pink one is 1 and 
,,the other color I'll take blue so this one multiply this one that's two three times minus B minus 3b now we'll follow that multiply and give me the answer this one with this you get 5x this one with this five times minus y minus five now try first this one seven times m 7m then this one seven times n plus seven ten times P 10 P 
,,plus 10 times Q 10 Q here the arrows are used to show the order to multiply so here always first one we can take first one and this is the SEC and why remove the brackets using arrows now now you can do that I mean there's a number in front of the algebraic expression you have to multiply all terms in the algebraic expression inside the bracket by the outside number yes with this this with this 3 into X 3 X 3 into 2 y + 6 1 now do this 1 7 into a 7 a 7 into minus 4 B that means minus 28 eleven times tu-22m 11 times n 11 4 times 3 P 4 times 3 12 P 4 times minus 2q so that's minus 8q this one 6 times X 6 X 6 times minus 11 by minus 66 1 8 times 3 24h 8 x k8 now look at this one you get three terms but same thing you have to multiply each and every term by the outside number this one three times five a 15 a three times to be six be three times c plus 3 C now do that four times X for X for x - y - y 4 times 7 that's + 28 8 times 2 16 a 8 times 7 56 be 8 times C that's 8 say look 
,,at this one 2 times X - x - x - 7 y minus 14y 2 times 3 z 6z 4 times P 4 P 4 times minus 3q - 12 Q 4 times 2r 8 11 times M 11 M 11 times 3 n 33 and 11 times 2 11 times 2 22 with l22 multiplying an algebraic expression by a negative number so now there's a negative number in front so we'll practice first with negative minus 3 times a minus 3 minus 3 times B minus 3 B negative into positive always you get a negative answer negative 5 times X negative 5x negative 5 into negative Y now negative into negative positive plus 5 minus 1 into 3 minus 3 minus 1 into minus 2 B plus 2 B minus into plus minus and here 5 times 2 10 2 times 2 4 that's plus because minus into minus plus and you get B here 2 times 7 here - into plus minus 14 C now you know how to multiply so plus into plus plus plus into minus minus minus into plus minus and minus into minus plus now we'll remove the brackets so you need to first multiply the first one when this number minus 3 a minus 3 times B minus 3b minus 
,,5 X and here so minus 5x minus 5 minus y you get plus 5i we did that minus 3 a and here minus 3 a you get here - nothing means 1 so this is like 1 minus 1 into 3 a minus 3 minus 1 into minus 2 B that's plus 2b this one this one minus 2 times 3 a what's the value minus 2 times 3a minus 6a this one - two - 2b plus 4b and here - two times seven you get minus 14c remove the brackets now so use arrows to multiply minus 3x minus - plus 6y this one when you multiply minus - plus 3 times 2 6 minus 
,,3 times minus 7 plus 20 months what this one you have to multiply all three terms minus 5 a minus - plus 5 times 4 20 get be your minus 5 times C minus 5 see this one multiply minus 8 times a minus 8 a - eight - seven be multiplication + 56 8 times 7 56 B question number 5 - 7 into minus X plus 7 X minus 7 into 2 y minus 14y - 7 into minus c plus 7z here minus 11 times 2 X minus 22 X minus 11 times -3 plus 33 yeah do all these multiplications try 4 times X 4 X 4 times minus 7y minus 28 y 4 
,,times 5 20 minus 3 times a minus 3 minus minus plus 21 B minus in 2 plus minus 24 6 here minus 11 times 2 minus 22 X here minus minus plus 11 times 3 plus 33 Y here 
,,you get minus 22 this one multiply minus 6 times 2 minus 12 minus 6 minus 7 plus 42 and minus 6 and minus 5 plus 13 this one minus 10 into minus 3 plus 30 minus 10 times chobe - 20 B and minus 10 times sake - 10 see what about this one - 4 times 3 H minus 12 which minus 4 times minus 4 plus 16 K minus 4 times minus 4 plus 60 now we're do multiplying an algebraic term by another algebraic term earlier we multiply by a constant now multiplying by an algebraic term 3x + 4 y how we multiply 3x 
,,times 4 1 so what we do we multiply that numbers first 3 times 4 12 and then x + y so without writing we can write without writing multiplication sign 12x what this 
,,one multiplication 7b into foil we can multiply separately the number 7 times 4 and then be a 7 times 4 28 be a it is better to write down then letters in order 28 a B but this is not wrong VA is okay but it's better it is good to write the letters in English at alphabetical order this 1 minus 3 by minus 5 X so we can multiply minus 3 and minus 5 first and then Y and X minus 3 times minus 5 plus 15 y X you can write 15 X Y to a times 7 B now we'll multiply at once 2 times 7 14 a into B a B 
,,you can write at once 3 X into 5 y 3 times 5 15 X into y X Y now there's a bracket minus sign minus 7 times 3 minus 21 a times B a B this one Phi times -3 minus 15 M times n m in here minus 4 times minus 3 plus 12 a and B you can write a B for x minus seven minus twenty eight Y into X Y X or what's the better one x1 multiplication of an algebraic expression by an algebraic term find the area of the following two rectangles separately so what's the area of the rectangle this one is length into breadth or length into width so area of the rectangle is any times X so what's that the X what's the area of the other rectangle length is B width or break is X B times X VX sum of areas you can just add it a X plus B X now when you combine the two rectangles now you are getting a big rectangle two rectangles are merged in the above diagram what's the length of this rectangle length is a here B here a plus B what's the area of the rectangle now length is a plus B and the with operate is 
,,X so X into a plus B as same rectangles are merged areas are equal now what's the area we got before a X plus B X so we can write a X plus B X is same as X into a plus B now sick how do you get this one so when you multiply the expression here can you see you get a X plus B X it is required to multiply all the terms inside brackets given by the outside term remove the brackets using arrows first one is this second one is this a 2 X a X a into - why - a why B into X BX be in 2 - 3 y - 3 B by C into a see a or a see C into 7 B 7 BC so here you can write AC as well is C + 7 BC when you remove brackets using an arrow first draw an arrow and write it then draw the next arrow and write it we'll do that separately X into a exhale Oh a X X into minus B minus BX X into 2 C 2 CX of XE y into p YP y into 2q minus 2 Q minus 2 y qi qi y into our are Y now try into p a p a into 3 q 3 a key a into for our for a 2 a into X 2x - 3 y that is -6 a why this 1 3 b into m 3b 3b into 4 12 B 5 a into 2 X 10 X 5 a into minus 3y minus 15 a why here - -5 a into z5 a 0 minus 3 into X minus 3 X minus into - now you get plus 6 a 1 plus 6 a expand brackets without using arrows no will do without arrows 3p into x 3p x 3p into minus 2 y minus 6 P for a into 2 where 8 a 4 into minus 3n minus 12 a in this one minus 4 into X minus 4 a X minus 4 times minus 3/12 a y minus 11 8 into 2 B minus 22 a be minus 11 a into minus 3 C you get plus 33 a see this one 7 a mintue l 7m n 7m into 428 look at this diagram area of the entire rectangle length is X with this a so what's the area a times X shaded area now can you see this square with length a a into a or we can write a square area of the unshaded part so you have to subtract total area that's a X minus the shaded area e squared sum of two algebraic expressions when you are adding you have to consider like terms so like terms only you can add or subtract when you consider these two terms what can you do you can add a terms with a 2a and 
,,3a you can add and then 3b and 5b separately so what do you get 5a + 5 + 3 8 at the time of addition or subtraction you have to add or subtract the like terms remove brackets and simplify taking like terms so first you have to multiply and then simplify here without arrows we'll do 2 times X 2 X 2 times y - 1 and then you have to add this 3x so I'd like terms 2x + 3 X you get 5x + 2 y right as it is here five times a five wave hi x minus B 5 B and plus seven B is there five way you can add 
,,separately yeah - five plus seven what's the value plus two so take the difference and put the sign of the bigger number plus two that's me here multiply by 4 8 X 4 
,,times y 4y now what are the like terms 8 XL minus 5x that's 3x plus 4 here you have to multiply both these terms here 3 times X 3 X 3 times y 3 by here 2 times X 2 X 2 times y 2 now add the like terms 3x + 2 X you get 5 X 3 y + 2 y you get high five do it separately 2 times a 2 a 2 times -3 b -6 b plus 5 times a highway by x - Oh Big Ten now I'd like terms - and five seven that's seven minus six and ten take the difference + OB this one seven times - 14 X 7 times y 7y this one three times X minus three x + -3 y add the like terms 14 -3 11 X 7 - 3 + 4 y this one 3 x - 6 a 3 times 5 15 b + 7 e + 10 B what are the like terms a terms 6 + 7:30 15 minus 10 plus 5 so 5 b minus 5 times 7 -35 a minus 5 times -3 plus 15 plus 40 a now like terms add 40 - 35 5 a + 15 subtraction of two algebraic expressions you have to do the same thing right the first algebraic expression in brackets right the second algebraic expression in another brackets remove both brackets and simplify three-year you nothing means just multiply by one yeah - is there so that means this is minus 1 multiplied by minus 1 minus 1 times a minus a minus 1 times minus 2 B you get plus 2 B now like terms added 3 and minus a 2 a 4 B plus 2 B you get 6 this one subtract this from this so that means you have to write this one first 12x plus 7 1 so here just multiply by one 12x plus 7 1 minus this means open brackets with minus 1 minus 1 times 7 minus 7x minus 1 times minus 2 plus 2 I like terms you get 12 minus 7 5 x 7 + 2 9 5 subtract 2x minus 3 from this so from means first this one so 6x + 7 when there's a minus sign change the sign minus 2x and minus minus becomes plus 3 like term 6 and minus 2 4 X 7 + 3 that's 10 subtract this value from this so first you write here so 3p plus 8q - open brackets with minus 1 - P last - q + + 7 3 
,,p + - b - p8 q + 2 Q thank you and our terms you get only this one so that's 7 simplify so that here multiply and first open brackets and then simplify 4 times a 4 4 times -3 minus 12 minus 2 times a minus 2 a minus 2 x - 7 + 14 now like terms that for a and minus 2 a 2 a minus 12 and plus 14 you get plus 2 open brackets first 5x - 5 minus 3 times X minus 3 X minus 3 and minus 2 you get 6 y 5x + 3 X 2 X - 5 I + + 6 Y you get Y this one has a minus 2 in front so when you are multiplying be careful - 2 times 3 - 6 Z minus 2 and minus plus plus times foil the Savoy here you get minus 8b add like terms minus 6a + 4 you get minus 2 a 4 B and minus a 2 B minus 4 B this one Phi P into 2 Q 10 PQ or QP 5 P into 4 20 P here - 3 P into Q minus 3 P Q minus 3 P into 2 minus 6 peace now these are two like terms 10 P Q minus 3 P Q you get 7 PQ 20 P minus 6 P you get plus 14 substituting the values in the edge break expression so now we will see how we can find out the expression with substituting values so what's the first one determine the value of 5 a plus 4 when a equals 3 so substitute a equals 3 there so what happens five times three plus four so 
,,what's five times three 15 15 plus four you get 19 look at this expression seven A plus 2 B now you get two letters so substitute these two values equals three and B equals three so 7 M plus 2 B is the expression so we'll substitute 7 times is 3 7 times 3 plus 2 times B equals 3 so 7 times 3 21 2 times 3 6 21 plus 6 27 look at this one now you get three unknown letters 5 a 2 B 7 C values are given a equals 5 B equals 3 and C equals -2 substitute 5 into a is 5 2 times 3 and say x minus 2 so 
,,minus 7 x minus 2 5 times 5 25 minus 2 times 3 minus 6 and here minus minus becomes positive seven times 2 plus 14 now simplify 25 minus 6 you get 19 19 plus 14 33 determine the value of the following expressions when x equals 2 and y equals minus 3 we substitute 8 times X is 2 y equals minus 3/8 times 2 16 5 times minus 3 minus 15 16 minus 15 you get 1 here 12 times 2 minus 3 times minus 3 12 times 2 24 minus into minus plus 2 so 3 times 3 9 9 plus 4 13 so you get 33 now look at this one so same values you have to plug what are the values x equals 2 and y equals -3 9 mean 2 2 plus XY means X into y so 2 into minus 3 y equals minus 3 9 times 2 18 minus 6 you get 12 2 times X X is 2 5 times minus 3 plus 11 2 times 2 4 minus 15 plus 11 so 4 minus 15 you get minus 11 minus 11 and plus 11 you get 0 this one 4 times X 
,,X is 2 2 times minus 3 plus 8 4 times 2 8 minus 6 plus 8 8 minus 6 2 2 plus 8 10 here X is 2 y is minus 3 plus 2 minus 7 times minus 3 2 times minus 3 minus 6 here plus 2 is they are already according to Bodnar's you have to multiply first minus into minus plus 21 minus 6 plus 2 minus 4 minus 4 plus 21 you get 17 determine the value of the following algebraic expressions when a equals 3 and B equals 5 so what you do first first we'll open brackets and then substitute 3 times 2 6 6 8 3 times 3 you get 9 so 9 B now substitute after you multiply now substitute the value 6 times 3 9 times 5 because B equals 5 and a equals 3 6 times 3 18 9 times 5 45 what's the addition 63 in this one you have given the same question we'll try in a different way earlier we multiplied and then simplify now we'll do we'll simplify inside brackets and then multiply by three so three is there two times a is 3 B equals 5 now simplify inside 3 times 2 6 3 times 5 15 3 times 6 plus 15 21 now multiply 3 and 21 3 times 1 3 3 times 2 6 so you are getting the same answer get the same as if simplify inside brackets or without removing bracket so you can do any method first you can multiply and simplify and then substitute or simplify inside the brackets and then multiply by the outside number remove the brackets and substitute the values so first remove the brackets 7 a plus 14 B substitute the values 7 times 3 plus 14 times 5 say 1 times 3 21 here 5 times 425 times 1 5 and 7 add it you get 91 
,,this one 4 times 3 12 a and 8 B substitute the values of 12 times 3 minus 8 times fun now simplify 12 times 3 36 8 times 5 40 36 minus 40 you get minus here 11 times 2 22 a plus 11b so 22 times a 3 because 566 plus 55 hundred twenty-one this one 9 times 3 27 a 9 x -2 18 B now multiply 27 times 3 and 18 times fun 3 times 7 21 two remaining 3 times 2 6 plus 2 81 minus 5 times 8 44 remaining so you get 90 81 minus 90 you get minus 9 determine the value when a equals 3 B equals -2 and C equals 
,,1 so just substitute the values 2 times 3 7 x minus 2 make sure you put brackets when you get negative numbers 3 times 1/6 minus minus plus 14 plus 3 so 6 plus 3 9 9 plus 14 23 this one 5 times 3/2 x minus 2 and 4 into 1 15 minus 4 plus 4 minus 4 plus 4 get canceled out you get 15 11 x equals 3 B equals -2 and C equals 1 according to what must do the multiplication first 11 times 3 33 minus 2 times minus 2 plus 4 and you get minus 3/4 minus 3/1 33 plus 130 in this one first simplify and then substitute values of the following algebraic expressions when a equals 5 because 3 and C equals -2 so you have given this expression so what you do first open brackets 2 where 2 B 3 B 3 C then what you do simplify the terms add the like terms to a you have to write as it is 2b and 3b becomes Phi B and 3c here now substitute the values equals 5 B equals 3 and C equals -2 2 times 5 10 5 times 3 15 minus 60 so but you get 10 minus 6 4 4 plus 15 19 this one first open brackets 3 a 3 times minus B minus 3 B 4 times B 4 B 4 times C minus 4 C here because there's a negative sign now I'd like terms 3-year you can't simplify minus 3 and plus 4 that's plus 1 B or B minus 4 C now substitute the values 3 a means multiplication 3 times a 3 times 5 B is 3 4 times minus 2 first multiplication according to but must 5 times 3 15 minus 4 minus 2 plus 8 so you get 8 plus 3 11 11 and 15 you get 26 this one first open brackets 3a plus 3b here to be and -2 C 5 C 5 a so each one you have to multiply by the outside number now like terms 3a and 5a 8 a 3 B and plus 2 B 5 B -2 C + + 5 C plus 3 C now multiply 8 times a what's the value for a a 5 3 minus 2 I'll write down here equals 5 B equals minus 3 B is 3 and C equals -2 C equals -2 so a is 5 B 3 C minus 2 8 times 5 14 15 here and -6 15 minus 6 you get 9 9 plus 40 49 this one 7 a 7 B minus 7 C and then plus 2a minus 2b minus 2 C when you multiply by 2 add like terms 7 + + 2 9 e 7 B and minus 2b + 5 b minus 7 and minus 2 minus 9 see now my tip life is five B's tricky and C is minus 2/9 times 5 45 five times three 15 and minus minus becomes plus nine times two eighteen now add all together 1018 one remaining five six seven so 78 is the answer this one you get fractions but same procedure just substitute the values for a eight over be sixteen over C so now substitute equals 2 so 4 over 2 8 / BBS for 16 over C C is 8 now you have to simplify first 4 divide by 2 you get 2 8 divided by 4 you get 2 16 divided by 8 you get 2 2 + 2 + 2 6 this one substitute the values a equals 2 2 divided by 2 B is 4 4 divided by 4 C equals 8 8 divided by 8 simplify division first 2 divided by 2 is 1 4 divided by 4 is 1 8 divided by 8 is 1 1 plus 1 plus 1 you get 3 this one substitute a B means a times B 2 times 4 plus BC means B times that's 4 times C means 8 minus C times a C is 8 and a equals to 8 32 16 so 32 minus 16 is 16 16 and 8 addition you get 24 now we will look at remove exercise complete the table given below algebraic expression is given unknown term of the algebraic expression coefficient of the unknown term terms of the algebraic expression and final column is mathematical operations in the order they appear in the algebraic expression so first of all what's the unknown letter X coefficient is the number in front of the letter that's three and these are called algebraic terms and what is the operation plus and multiplication is three times X now we look at the next one what's the letter here Y what's the coefficient of that term to what are the algebraic terms to Y and 4 and what's the operation first multiplication and then addition next one what's the algebraic letter B coefficient 4 and terms for P and minus hundred and the operation for times P that means multiply and then subtract this one P is the letter coefficient nothing means one terms PN minus 10 and what are the operations used 1 times P times and then - what's the later here in coefficient is + 3 terms 3 n n minus 7 and operation first multiply and then subtract question number two the length of a table is two meters more than its breadth write an algebraic expression for the length of the table by taking its breath as V when you take this table B is the bread length is 2 meters more than its brick so what's the expression B plus 2 back to write

AlgebraicExpression,NybHckSEQBI,"Hi! This is Rob. Welcome to Math Antics. In this lesson, we're going to learn some really important things about a whole branch of math called Algebra. The first thing you need to know is that Algebra is a lot like arithmetic. It follows all the rules of arithmetic and it uses the same four main operations that arithmetic is built on: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. But Algebra introduces a new element... the element of the unknown. When you were learning arithmetic, the only thing that was ever unknown was the answer to the problem. For example, you might have the problem 1 + 2 = what? The answer isn't known until you go ahead and "
,,"do the arithmetic. Now the important thing about Algebra is that when we don't know what a number is yet, we use a symbol in its place. that symbol is usually just any letter of the alphabet. A really popular letter to choose is the letter 'x'. So in arithmetic, we would just leave the problem like this: 1 + 2 = ""blank"" and we'd write in the answer when we did the addition. But in Algebra, we'd write it like this:  1 + 2 = x The 'x' is a place holder that stands for the number that we don't know yet. What we have here is a very basic algebraic equation. An equation is just a mathematical statement that two things are equal. An equation says, ""the things on this side of the equal sign have the same value as the things on the other side of the equal sign."" In this case, our equation is telling us that the known values on this side (1+2) are equal to what's on the other side, which happens to be the unknown value that we are calling 'x'. One of the main goals in Algebra is to figure out what the unknown values in equations are. And when you do that, it's called ""solving the equations"". In this equation, it's pretty easy to see that the unknown value is just 3. All you have to do is actually add the 1 and 2 together on this side of the equation and it turns into 3 = x, which is the same as x = 3. So now we know what 'x' is!  It's just 3. That almost seems too easy, doesnt it? And that's why in Algebra, you are usually given an equation in a more complicated form like this: x - 2 = 1. This is exactly the same equation as 1 + 2 = x, but it has been rearranged so that it's not quite as easy to tell what 'x' is. So in Algebra, solving equations is a lot like a game where you are given mixed-up, complicated equations, and it's your job to simplify them and rearrange them until it is a nice simple equation (like x = 3) where it's easy to tell what the unknown values are. We're going to learn a lot more about how you actually do that (how you solve equations) in the next several videos, but for now, let's learn some important rules about how symbols can and can't be used in algebraic equations. The first rule you need to know is that the same symbol (or letter) can be used in different algebra problems to stand for different unknown values. For example, in the problem we just solved, the letter 'x' was used to stand for the number 3, right? But 'x' could stand for a different number in a different problem. Like, if someone asks us to solve the equation, 5 + x = 10. In order for the two sides of this equation to be equal, 'x' must have the value '5' in this problem, because 5 + 5 = 10. So 'x' (or any other symbol) can stand for different values in different problems. That's okay, but what's NOT okay is for a symbol to stand for different values in the same problem at the same time! For example, what if you had the equation: x + x = 10? This equation says that if we add 'x' to 'x' we will get 10. And there are a lot of different numbers we could add together to get 10, like 6 and 4. But, if we had the first 'x' stand for 6 and the second 'x' stand for 4, then 'x' would stand for two different value at the same time and things could get really confusing! If you wanted symbols to stand for two different numbers at the same time, you would need to use two different symbols, like 'x' and 'y'. So in Algebra, whenever you see the same symbol repeated more than once in an equation, it's representing the same unknown value. Like if you see a really complicated Algebraic equation (like this), where 'x' is repeated a lot of different times, all of those 'x's stand for the same value, and it will be your job to figure out what that value is. Okay, so for any particular equation, we can't use the same letter to represent two different numbers at the same time, but what about the other way around? Could we use two different letters to represent the same number? Yes! - Here's an example of that. Let's say you have the equation: a + b = 2 What could 'a' and 'b' stand for so that the equation is true? Well, If 'a' was 0 and 'b' was 2, then the equation would be true. Or, we could switch them around. If 'a' was 2 and 'b' was 0, the equation would also be true. But there's another possibility: If 'a' was 1 and 'b' was also 1, that would make the equation true, right? So, even though 'a' and 'b' are different symbols, and would usually be used to represent different numbers, there are times when they might happen to represent the same number. Oh, and this problem can help us understand something very important about how symbols are used in Algebra. Did you notice that there were different possible solution for this equation? In other words, 'b' could have the value 0, 1, or 2 depending on what the value of 'a' was. If 'a' is 0 then 'b' must be 2 If 'a' is 1 then 'b' must be 1 If 'a' is 2 then 'b' must be 0 'b' can't have two different values at the same time, but it's value can change over time if the value of 'a' changes. In Algebra, 'b' is what's called a ""variable"" because it's value can 'vary' or change. In fact, in this equation, both 'a' and 'b' are variables because their values will change depending on the value of each other. Actually, it's really common in Algebra to refer to any letter as a variable, "
,,"since letters can stand for different values in different problems. But at Math Antics, we'll usually just use the word ""variable"" when we're talking about values that can change or vary in the same problem. Alright, so far we've learned that Algebra is a lot like arithmetic, but that in includes unknown values and variables that we can solve for in equations. There's one other really important thing that I want to teach you that will help you understand what's going on in a lot of Algebra "
,,"problems, and it has to do with multiplication. Here are the four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Although in Algebra, you'll usually see division written in fraction form, like this. In Arithmetic, all four operations have the same status, but in Algebra, multiplication get's some special treatment. In Algebra, multiplication is the 'default' operation. That means, if no other arithmetic operation is shown between two symbols, then you can just assume they're being multiplied. The multiplication is 'implied'. For example, instead of writing 'a' times 'b', you can leave out the times symbol and just write 'ab'. Since no operation is shown between these two symbols, you know that you're supposed to multiply 'a' and 'b'. Of course, you can't actually multiply 'a' and "
,,"'b' until you figure out what numbers they stand for. The advantage of this rule about multiplication is that it makes many algebraic equations less cluttered and easier to write down. For example, instead of this: a * b + c * d = 10 You could just write: ab + cd = 10. You can also use this shorthand when you are multiplying a variable and a known number... like 2x, which means the same thing as 2 times 'x' or 3y which means the same thing as 3 times 'y' Since the symbol and the number are "
,,"right next to each other, the multiplication is implied. You don't have to write it down. Finally some good news! Now I never have to write down that pesky multiplication symbol again! Oh yeah!! Ah, not so fast... there are some cases in Algebra where still need to use a multiplication symbol. For example, what if you want to show 2 x 5? If you just get rid of the times symbol and put the '2' right next to the '5', it's going to look like the two-digit number twenty-five, which is NOT the same as 2 x 5. So, whenever you need to show multiplication between two known numbers, you still have to use the times symbol, unless... you use parentheses instead. "
,,"But aren't parentheses used to show grouping in math? How can you use that to show multiplication? Ah, that's a good question. Parentheses are used to group things, "
,,"but whenever you put two groups right next to each other, with no operation between them, guess what operation is implied. Yep!  Multiplication! For example, if you "
,,"see the this, it means that the group (a+b) is being multiplied by the group (x+y). We could put a times symbol between the groups, but we don't have to because it's the default operation in Algebra. The multiplication is just implied. So, going back to our problem: 2 x 5 If you wanted to, you could put each of the numbers inside parentheses like this, and then you could get rid of the multiplication sign. Now this can't be confused with the number twenty-five, and since the groups are right next to each other, you know that you need to multiply them. Of course, it might seem strange to have just one thing inside 'group' symbols like this, but it's okay to do that in math. An alternate way that you could do the same thing would be to put just one of the numbers in parentheses, like this. Again, you won't confuse this with a two-digit number and you know that multiplication is implied. Okay, so we've learned that Algebra is a lot like arithmetic, but it involves unknown values or variables that we need to solve for. And we learned that in Algebra, the multiplication sign is usually not shown, because it's the default operation. You can just assume that two things right next to each other are being multiplied. But why do we even care about Algebra? Is it good for anything in the 'real world'? or is it just a bunch of tricky problems that keep students busy in school? Actually, Algebra is very useful for describing or ""modeling""  things in the real world. It's a little hard to see that when you are just looking at all these numbers and symbols on the page of a math book. But, it's a lot easier to see when you start taking algebraic equations and graphing their solutions. Graphing an equation is like using its different solutions to draw simple lines and curves that can be used to describe and predict things in real life. For example, there's a whole class of equations in Algebra called ""linear"" equations because they form straight lines when you graph them. Those sorts of equations could help you describe the slope of a roof or tell you how long it will take to get somewhere. Another class of algebraic equations, called ""quadratic"" equations can be used to design telescope lenses, or describe how a ball flies through the air, or predict the growth of a population. So Algebra is used all the time in fields like science, engineering, economics and computer programming. And even though you might not need Algebra to get by in your day to "
,,"day life,... ...so divide both sides by 3. That means x = 42. So... in three... two... one... YES!! Alright... now to see how much butter I need. It's still a very useful part of math. Thanks for watching Math Antics,"

AlgebraicExpression,20BYGqGufY8,are they grenades and welcome to worksheet cloud maths my name is Joe Milligan and I'm going to take you through some facts about algebraic expressions first of all 
,,how to write them then how to simplify them and then how to evaluate them okay if at any stage you don't understand anything and you want to ask a question remember 
,,to just send an email to that email address at the bottom of your page and somebody will get back to you right first of all we have to look at what an algebraic expression actually is it indicates a sequence of calculations that can also be described in words or with a flow diagram so for example multiply a number by 2 and add 6 to the answer that is in words as you can see this would be the flow diagram for that sentence and it's an unknown number x bar 2 and added 6 and that as an algebraic expression would look like that X plus 2 or sorry x times 2 plus 6 okay that would be the expression it's written an algebraic form okay so your expression would 
,,actually look like this 2x plus 6 remember the X is the unknown value you can call that unknown value anything you'd like you can call it a or b or Y or CID but for 
,,today's lesson we're going to refer to unknown values as X okay now you try see if you can write that as an expression two times a number added to three times the same number okay did you get that 2 times X plus 3 times X and if we make it simpler it would just be 2x plus 3x okay right let's go on let's break this down two times a number added to three times the same number okay now give it give the unknown number a name like I said earlier you can give it any name you like but today we are going to call it X so both are no numbers have the same value and they can both be called X if you choose to use y both of them would be called Y okay so these words then translate to 2 times X plus 3 times X as an algebraic expression and can also then be written 2x plus 3x which just looks a whole lot tidier okay let's try one more half a number subtracted from five times of that number it would be 5 X minus 1/2 X you might have written half X minus 5 X but let me explain to you why it's the other way around okay we break this one down we've got half of a number subtracted from 5 times that same number okay if the same number is we're dealing with only one unknown value so we can give it them both the same name and we will call it X again and so we are then we need to look at the word from in this case yeah because we are subtracting 1/2 X from 5 times X so we need to write it 5x minus 1/2 X it would be like me asking you to subtract 2 from 3 if you were to write that it would be 3 minus 2 okay let's go on you can try these now all on your own so you can pause the video and you can try them out and then we'll go over them together right let's see what you did the first one is a number less 7 again you can call it a B why is it whatever you'd like to call it we're going to call it X again and that would be X minus 7 see this time wasn't from 7 it was a number less 7 that means you subtract the 7 from the number okay half of a number added to 6 that would be 1/2 X plus 6 or 6 plus 1/2 X remember adding we can write it any which way we lack any way around okay the next one times a number divided by 2 would be 9x divided by 2 next one 3 times a number increased by 4 you've got it 3x plus 4 and then 1/4 of a number subtracted from 8 remember these are from again let's have a look it would be 8 minus 1/4 X well done guys I'm sure you got those all rights right now we're going to look and see how we can simplify the expressions okay five times a number add it to six times the same number and then subtract 4 wow that seems like quite a long sentence but let's go through it slowly 5x plus 6x minus 4 now because you've got 5x and a 6x those are both the same unknown numbers so we could say we can put them together and say it's 11x minus 4 can you see that you've got an unknown number of that X and that X 5 of those and 6 of the same things you'd get 11 of them if I were to say to you for 5x and 6x then you could say I've got 11x it would 
,,be the same kind of thing see right now you can try try those ones pause the video again have a go and we'll go over them together right let's see how you did two times a number subtracted from 3 times the same number would give you 3 minus 2x is the and then it would be the same as just plain X because you've got three X's and 
,,you - includes from that you left with 1x right the second one for added to a number and subtract 2 times the same number let's see what happens yeah we've got 4 plus an unknown X minus 2x so yeah we've got a positive x and a negative x so if you have minus 2x and you add on an X you she just got EXO it would be four minus X let's go over that one just one more time you've got a positive excellent you - in two x's from it you would end up in with a negative x so it'll be 4 minus X instead of 4 plus X right let's go over the next one and number added to 7 and 3 times that number is subtracted let's see what happens ya X plus 7 minus 3 X again you've got a positive X if there's nothing in front of it it means it's positive and see how you've got a minus 3 X so you adding an X 1 to your minus 3 X so then you would end up with 7 minus 2x you could possibly also write it minus 2x plus 7 it just looks a little bit more messy right so far we've looked at writing algebraic expressions from words and how to simplify the expression now we're going to look at how to evaluate these expressions ok we can only evaluate an expression if we are given the value of x and remember the X is the unknown number so we can't give an expression of value unless we are actually given the value of that X so let's have a look at so if we are told X is equal to 3 then we can work out the value of the expression 2x minus 1 and how do we do this well we would substitute the 3 into the expression in the position of X so it would be 3 2 times 3 minus 1 so we would write it like that or we can write it like that the only reason I wrote it like that was because the X looks sits next to the tooth so it's the same thing 2 times 3 and then minus 1 okay because we now have an actual value we can carry out the operations and the expression to find the answer so 2 times 3 would be 6 and 6 minus 1 would give me 5 rights have you got it so let's go over that again we can only substitute in when we are given the value of the X so we the value up here we are told that X is equal to 3 so 2 times 3 would give me 6 6 minus 1 is 5 and that would be the value of that expression right let's go on to your turn now I want you to find the value of the expression X minus 2 X where X is equal to 2 you can pause the video and 
,,you can try that out and then we'll go over it okay so what's the value of your expression for let's break it down we've got 8 minus 2x where the X is equal to 2 so 
,,it's 8 minus 2 times 2 that's 8 minus 4 and so the value of your expression is 4 okay try those on your own grab a piece of paper write them down pause the video and work them out okay how well did you do 8 minus 2 X where X is equal to 3 we're going to substitute the 3 in for the X so it would be 8 minus 2 times 3x minus 6 which gives me 2 5x minus 7 where X is equal to 2 same thing we're going to go 5 times 2 2 is in place of the X which gives me 10 minus 7 is 3 one thing here you have to write out the whole expression so I can't just write 5 times 2 because I've got an equal sign so my equal sign tells me that what is on this line is actually exactly the same value as to what is on that line so if I left off the 7 5 times 2 does not give me 5x minus 7 it doesn't equal that so we must just be very careful with how we write things down see okay number three 1/2 X where X is 10 half of 10 we all know is 5 3 times 2 X where X is 4 again we're going to substitute in for the X where it's 4 it will be 3 times and in brackets 2 times 4 so we'll do that first then we'll go 2 times 4 is 8 3 times 8 is 24 the next one 3x plus 2x again we substituting in 3 X + 2 X X here is 5 so 5 3 times 5 plus 2 times 5 will be 15 plus 10 and that gives you 25 I hope you all got that but let's look at the next thing remember when we simplified the expression while that last one we could probably simplify so in question 5 was 3x + 2 X where X was equal to 5 so because your variables are the same your unknowns are the same can add them together before you substitute it in so we got 3x + 2 X and that's the same as 5x remember when we simplify the expressions we looked at putting those together okay so X is equal to 5 and we can then multiply it 5 times 5 and we end up with 25 so the answer to that expression would be 25 that is the same answer as what you got when you did when you didn't simplify the expression and you kept the two terms apart it would be 3 times 5 + 2 times 5 which is 15 plus 10 and you also end up with 25 can you see you got the same answer so you could do it either way around you would end up with the same answer right let's look at see if it works for another example where 2 X + 4 X + X is equal to 3 we've got 2 times 3 plus 4 times 3 that's 6 plus 12 and it gives me an answer of 18 or we could go to X plus 4 X is 6 X 6 times 3 is 18 can you see same answer so whichever way suits you to work it out you can work it out like that you're going to get the same answer either way around right let's draw on everything you have learned today to try these ok you can pause the video again try those art and we'll go over them together right let's see how you did 2 times a number subtracted from 3 times the same number we've got 3 X minus 2 X and that would eggs we haven't been given the the value of the X so we can just simplify them right for added to 2 times a number and subtract the same number is 4 + 2 X - X would be 4 + X a number subtracted from 7 and 3 times that number is added it's 7 - x + 3 X and that would give you 7 minus 2 X right it's just revised what you've gone over today what we've learned so you've learned how to first of all write an expression in words then you learned how to simplify the expression and how to evaluate the expression when given a value for the unknown number see I made a little mistake here it's hard to simplify the expression not and expression and how do you evaluate the expression when given a value for the unknown number now you can try the activity that is being posted and then you can check it with the memo thank you for joining us today great and I hope you've understood everything just remember if you haven't understood anything at all you can email in and the email address has been on each side so you can go back and check it it is also an activity worksheet and somebody will get back to you with an answer or an explanation thank you for listening today

AlgebraicExpression,LDIiYKYvvdA,"Hi, Im Rob. Welcome to Math Antics. In the last two Algebra videos, we learned how to solve simple equations that had only one arithmetic operation in them. But often, equations have many different operations which makes solving them a little more complicated. In this video, were going to learn how to solve equations that have just two math operations in them. one addition or subtraction operation, and one multiplication or division operation. And the concepts you learn in this video will help you solve even more complicated equations in the future. Now as you might expect, equations that have two arithmetic operations in them are going to require two different steps to solve them. In other words, to get the unknown all by itself, youll need to undo two operations. But that doesnt sound too hard, right? I mean we learned how to do undo any arithmetic operation in the last two videos. And thats true.  But there are a couple of reason that make two-step equations a little trickier to solve. The first is that there are a lot more possible combinations of those two operations. And the second is that, when theres more than one operation, you have to decide what order to undo those operations in. Uhhello! If you need to know what order to do operations in, just follow the Order of Operations rules! You DID watch that video, didnt you? I sure did! But the Order of Operations rules tell us what order to DO operations not what order to UNDO them! UhWellthen could we REVERSE the order since were UN-doing operations? Now thats a good idea. Well of course it is! When solving multi-step equations, thats basically what were going to do. Using the Order of Operations rules in reverse can help us know what order to undo operations in, but it can be a little tricky actually putting it into practice. So to see how it works, lets start by solving a very simple two-step equation:  2x + 2 = 8. In this equation, the unknown value x is involved "
,,"in two different operations addition and multiplication (which is implied between the first 2 and the x) And to undo those two operations, we need to use their inverse operations subtraction and division. But the question is, which one should we do first? Like many things in life, the order we decide to do things in can make a big difference. Ah, come on! Theres gotta be an easier way! [voice from off screen] First socks, then shoes. Fortunately, in math, we have a special set of rules that tell us what order to do operations in. Those rules tell us to do operations inside parentheses (or other groups) first. And then we do exponent, and then multiplication and division, and last of all, we do addition and subtraction. Those are the rules you need to follow when simplifying mathematical expressions or equations. But solving an equation is different because we are trying to UNDO any operations that the unknown value is involved with so that the unknown value will be all by itself. So when solving equations, the best strategy is to apply those Order of Operations rules in reverse. Using the reverse Order of Operations is not the only way to solve a multi-step equation, but its usually the easiest way. Just like its much easier to take your shoes and socks off in the reverse order that you put them on! Ahhhhh!  Are you sure its socks before shoes? Since the Order of Operations rules tell us to DO multiplication before we DO addition. We should UNDO addition before we UNDO multiplication. So first, we undo the addition by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation. On the first side, the plus 2 and the minus 2 cancel each other out, leaving just 2x on that side. And on the other side we have 8 minus 2 which is 6. Next, we can undo the multiplication by dividing both sides of the equation by 2. On the first side, the 2s cancel, leaving x all by itself. And on the other side, we have 6 divided by 2 which is just 3. There weve solved the equation using the Order of Operations rules in reverse, and now we know that x = 3. That wasnt so bad, was it? Lets try solving another simple two-step "
,,"equation that has division and subtraction in it: x/2 - 1 = 4. Again, were going to apply the Order of Operations rules in reverse to undo the subtraction and the division operations. Since we would normally DO the subtraction last, were going to UNDO it first. To undo the subtraction, we add '1' to both sides of the equation. On the first side, the minus 1 and the plus 1 cancel out, leaving just x over 2 on that side. And on the other side, we have 4 plus 1 which is 5. And then, to undo the divided by 2, we need to multiply both sides by 2. On the first side, the 2s cancel, leaving x all by itself. And on the other side, we have 2 times "
,,"5 which is 10. So our answer is x = 10. Those examples are pretty easy, right? But solving two-step equations gets a bit trickier thanks to a little something in math called groups. Do you remember how parentheses are used to group things in math? And our Order of Operations rules say we are supposed to do any operations that "
,,"are inside parentheses first. In other words, we need to do operations that are inside of groups first. Well guess what? That means that when were solving equations and UN-doing operations, we need to wait to do groups LAST of all. To see what I mean, lets solve this equation, which looks very similar to the first one we solved. The only difference is that a set of parentheses has been used to group this x + 2 together. And even though that might not seem like much of a change, it makes a big difference for our answer. Thats because, in the original equation, this first 2 is only being multiplied by the x, but in the new equation, its being multiplied by the entire quantity (or group) x + 2. And thats going to change how we solve it. Were still going to follow our Order of Operations rules in reverse, but "
,,"now that the x + 2 is inside parentheses (which means that its part of a group), were going to undo THAT operation last. Since we are supposed to DO operations in "
,,"groups first, that means were going to UNDO operations in groups last. So in this problem, we should start by undoing the multiplication that's implied between the "
,,"2 and the group (x + 2) To do that, we divide both sides of the equation by 2. On the first side, the 2 on the top and the 2 on the bottom cancel, leaving the group "
,,"(x + 2) on that side. And on the other side, we have 8 divided by 2 which is 4. That looks simpler already!  And we can make it even simpler than that, because now that theres nothing else on that side of the equal sign with the group (x + 2) we really dont even need the parentheses any more. Next, we just need to subtract 2 from both sides. On the first side, the plus 2 and the minus 2 cancel out, leaving x all by itself, and on the other side we have 4 minus 2, which is 2. So for "
,,"this equation, x = 2. And now you can see how grouping operations differently in our equation results in different answers. Lets try one more important example. Do "
,,"you remember the second equation we solved?  x/2 - 1 = 4 In this equation, the 1 is being subtracted from the entire x over 2 term. But take a look at this slightly different equation. This looks a lot like the original equation, but now that the '1' is up on top of the fraction line, its only being subtracted from the x and NOT the 2. The x - 1 on top forms a group. Hold on!  How can the x - 1 be a group? I dont see any parentheses or brackets around it. Ah, thats a good question! In Algebra, the fraction line is used as a way to automatically group things that are above it or things that are below it. For example, in this fancy algebraic expression, everything thats on top of the fraction line forms a group and everything on the bottom of the line forms another group. Of course, we could put parentheses there if we wanted to make it really clear, but its not required. Grouping above and below a fraction line is just implied in Algebra. Getting back to our new problem, now that we know that the x - 1 on the top of the fraction line is an implied group, as we learned in the last example, were going to wait and undo the "
,,"operation inside that group last. So the first step is to undo the divided by 2 by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2. On the first side, the 2 on top and the 2 on the bottom will cancel out, leaving just our implied group x - 1 on that side. And on the other side, we have 4 times 2 which is 8. Next, we can undo the operation inside the group by adding '1' to both sides. On the first side, the minus 1 and the plus 1 cancel, leaving x all by itself. And on the other side, "
,,"we have 8 plus 1 which is 9.  So in this equation, x = 9. Alright  As you can see, solving two-step equations is definitely more complicated than single step equations because there are so many different combinations and different ways to group things. But if you just take things one step at a time and remember to UNDO operations using the REVERSE Order of Operations rules, it will be much easier. Just pay close attention to how things are grouped in an equation and be on the lookout for  "
,,"those implied groups on the top and bottom of a fraction line. And, because there are so many variations of these two-step equations, its really important to practice by trying to solve lots of different problems.

,,2 y 11 minus 2 plus 9 substituting fractions - algebraic terms X is half you asked to find out 4 X plus 5 so substitute 4 times 1/2 plus 5 here you can see you can simplify the denominator with the numerator 1 and here so you get 2 + 5 that's 7 equals 1/3 9a plus 2/9 times 1/3 + 2 here 3 times 1/3 times 3 3 + 2 you get 5 x equals 2/3 now 9 x + 1 9 times 2/3 plus 1/3 times 1/3 times 3 so 3 times 2 6 6 + 1 7 here 11 minus 3 when a equals minus 2/3 11 minus 3 times minus 2 over 3 will put brackets here 3 + 3 get cancel out you get 11 minus into minus plus 11 plus 2 answer yes 13 equals 1/2 B equals 1/3 so this should be simple B so we'll substitute the values for a equals 1/2 we cause 1/3 2 times 1/2 times 2 so what's the answer 2 + here are 3 in one three two one so one day three to plus one you'll get three six a six times 1/2 minus 3 times 1/3 substitute a and B two times three three get cancelled out so what's remaining 3 here 1 3 minus 1 is 2 8 E is 1/2 B is 1/3 2 times 1/2 times 4 3 times 1/3 times 2 here 4-2 ours is to 18 times 1/2 six times one thirty two and nine three bit too so what's the final answer nine minus two answer is seven if x equals 2/3 and y equals 1/2 find the value of the following algebraic expressions 6 times 2/3 2 times 1/2 3 times 1/3 times 2 2 times 1/2 times 1/2 times 2 4 here plus one times one one four plus one you get five this one 9 times X what is X X is 2/3 4 times 1/2 3 times 1/3 times 3 2 times 1/2 times 2 so 3 times 2 is 6 2 times 1 is 2 6 minus 2 same question another part 12 X is 2/3 - why why is half substitute 3 times 1/3 times 4 4 times 2 eight here - when to get canceled out you get one there 8 + 1 9 9 X is 2/3 minus 2 times 1/2 3 n here 3 3 times 2 6 2 + 2 get cancelled out you get minus 1 6 - 1 answer is 5 find the value of value if P equals 1/3 so substitute 1/3 for P simplify first 3 times 2 6 2 + 4 that's 6 9 P minus 2/9 times P is 1/3 minus 2 here simplify 3 + 3 3 - 2 you get 12 P P is 1/3 + 3 3 times 1 3 times 4 4 + 3 you get 7 3 P plus 11 3 into 1/3 + ulema 3 + 3 get cancel out 1 plus 11 is 12 so you need to simplify the fractional part that's multiplication and then do the addition find the value if M equals to 4 times 2 + 11 8 plus 11 that's 19 6 times 2 plus 5 multiplication first 12 + 5 17 10 times 2 - 1 xx - 1 that's 19 8 times 2 plus 10 8 times 2 16 + 10 26 find the value when x equals 2l y equals 1/3 for X is 2 y is 138 plus 1/3 how can you write you can write 8 full parts and 135 X plus 3 by 5 X that's not bad by 2 3 y 1/3 is there 3 3 get cancelled out so 10 plus 1 the answer is either 1 another one 8 times 2 minus 6 times 1/3 3 and here too you get 6 8 times 2 16 minus 2 answer is 14 again this one 10 times 2 minus 9 times white why is 1/3 3 times 1/3 times 3 10 times 2 20 minus 3 answer is 17 find the value of M equals 1/2 and in equals 1/2 for these expressions 8m a miss half in Miss 152 times 4 here are 5 times 2 4 times 1 4 2 times 1 2 4 minus 2 you get to do the same thing 16mm is 1/2 it needs 152 with 16 you get eight five and five get canceled out 8 minus 1 is 7 10 mm is half a Miss 152 and ten five five and this 1 so 5 plus 1 you get 6 6 times mm is 1/2 minus 15 times n that's one field to end is 3 5 times 3 15 so you get 3 minus 3 answer is 0 binomial expressions what is 
,,bi means two so expressions means when you get two terms 3x plus 4y is binomial expression X minus 5i so all these are binomial expressions so there are two terms in all these expressions due to one term or both of these terms are algebraic terms these are called binomial algebraic expressions so here one term is constant and the other one is algebraic term here both terms are algebraic terms product of two binomial expressions now X plus 2 is a binomial expression X plus 3 or so another binomial expression now we'll try to multiply these two so this is the product of both binary expressions or binomial expressions expand the brackets and simplify as much as possible now we'll try to do that using this method so we are multiplying here X plus 3 they are we can write x plus 2 here X plus 2 this way row wise X plus 
,,3 column wise X plus 2 so we can use multiply row and columns X into X we know this is X square X into plus 3 plus 3x this one 2 into X plus 2 X 2 into 3 plus 6 so what's the answer when you multiply using this method you get x squared - 3 X 2 X + 6 now simplify I can simplify these two - 3 + 2 5 X + 6 so that's how we can multiply using this method now we'll do the same thing X + 3 is there x + 5 X into X x squared X into 5 5 X 3 into X 3 X 3 into 5 15 so what are the values you are getting here when you multiply you get x squared - 5 X 3x + 15 so when you simplify you get 8x plus 15 - the same thing a plus 4a plus 4a into a a square into 4 4 a 5 into a 5 a 5 into 4 20 so when you multiply you get all these terms so a square plus 4 plus 5a plus 20 so when you can so you can add these to phibn for where you get 9e and this is 20 similar to that one y + 3 y + 7 Y into y Y square my into 3 3 by 7 into y 7y 7 into 3 20 so what's the answer Y squared 3 by 7 y + 20 bucks so these 
,,two terms you can add you get 10 buy and here are twenty one this one now - so a minus two so you can write in one color - to a +3 here a squared - 2 way here plus 3 a + -6 - into + - now what are the terms you are getting a squared minus 2a plus 3 and minus 6 so simply 5 3 - 2 + 1 that's a minus 6 this was X - 5 X - 2 so we need to multiply X into X X square X into minus 5 minus 5 X here you get minus 2 X minus 2 into minus 5 that's + step write down the terms and simplify x squared minus 
,,5 minus 2 minus 7 and you'll get 10 here similar to that one a minus 7 a minus 3 a into a a square minus 7 8 - 3 times a minus 3 a minus 3 times minus 7 plus 25 so what are the terms you are getting a squared minus 7 a minus 3 a + 21 a squared - 7 + -3 minus 10 plus 21 expand and simplify so we'll take the whole expression multiplied with this and this so you get a into a plus 2 here 3 with a plus 2 now expand brackets a into a square plus 2 a 3 into a 3a plus 6 so you get a squared 2a and 
,,3a v b +6 this one through the same thing the whole expression multiplied with this one X into X minus 2 5 into X minus 2 then expand brackets x squared minus 2x plus 5 X minus 10 so x squared minus 2 plus 5 that's plus 3x minus 10 this one this whole expression with this end this p with p + 5 + -7 b 3 plus 5p squared plus 5p minus 7 P minus 35 so you get P squared minus 7 and plus 5 minus 2p minus 35 this one Y with Y minus 3 and minus 4 with Y minus 3 so this term multiplied by these two 
,,terms Y squared minus 3y minus 4y plus 12 so you get Y squared minus 3 minus 4 minus 7y then you get plus expand and simplify again we can write a plus 3 expression 
,,with a plus 7 with this now expand a square plus 3 plus seventy plus 21 but you get a squared 3 a + 7 a 10 a plus 21 what about this one y with y + 7 + 4 with y + 7 
,,now multiply Y into y y square and 4y plus 28 four times seven simplify y squared 7 plus 4 11 y plus 28 this one a minus 3 times M plus 4 times M minus 3 M into M M 
,,squared minus 3 M 4 M minus 12 so you get M squared minus 3 plus 4 plus M minus 12 what about this one p + 7 x p + + 8 x p + 7 you get P squared + 7 p 8 b + 56 p square 7 p + 8 P 15 P Plus 56 look at this one P with P minus 8 and the other one is minus 3 with P minus 8 expand brackets you get V squared minus 18 minus 3 P plus 24 P square 8 + 3 11 so this is minus 24 there this one X with X - 4 - 7 with X - 4 x squared minus 4 X minus 7 X + 28 x squared minus 4 X and minus 7 X minus 11 X and here plus 28 here 4 into 6 + P + + P into 6 + p expand separately 24 + 4 p here 6 P plus P squared so 24 is there here 6 plus 4 10 plus P Square what about this one 4 is there 7 - why - why with 7 - what 4 times 7 28 here - 4 y minus 7y plus y square answer is 28 minus 4 minus 7 minus 11 y + y squared there this one a with a - 
,,8 + 8 with a minus 8a squared - 8 8 plus 8 a + 64 minus 64 a squared - 8 e + 8 a get cancel out you get minus 68 so this one P into P minus 4 and plus 4 with P minus 4p squared - 4 p + 4 P minus 16 yeah also me the term get canceled out P squared minus 16 is what seven with seven plus M minus M with seven plus M when you simplify expand brackets 49 + 7 m - 7 M minus M Squared so what's the value 49 minus M Squared because this these two terms get cancelled out so what are these actually can you remember difference between two squared terms so you get square terms here and here this one give it to a plus three minus five it to a plus three to a squared 
,,plus 3a minus 10y minus fifteen simplify you get 2a squared - 7 8 - 15 question number 19 expand using the arrow now we'll use another method we call it rainbow method or foil so I'll show you how to do that at once without writing separate brackets this one first with first number so that's F a into a that's a square that's F first with first that's the arrow number one now we are taking oh-oh means outside values so outside here with outside that's the second one a with eight get 8a that's outside I mean inside with inside so inside with inside that's number three three with you get three that's I thought 1l l means last with last two last week last

AlgebraicExpression,v-6MShC82ow,"Hi, Im Rob.  Welcome to Math Antics! In this lesson, were going to talk about the Distributive Property, which is a really useful tool in Algebra. And if you watched our video called The Distributive Property in Arithmetic, then you already know the basics of how the Distributive Property works. The key idea is that the Distributive Property allows you to take a factor and distribute it to each member of a group of things that are being added or subtracted. Instead of multiplying the factor by the entire group as a whole, you can distribute it to be multiplied by each member of the group individually. And in that previous video, we saw how you can take a problem like: 3 times the group (4 + 6) and simplify it two different ways. You could either simplify what was in the group first, OR you could use the distributive property to distribute a copy of the factor 3 to each member of the group, and no matter which way you go, you get the same answer. But in Algebra, things are a little more complicated, because we arent just working with known numbers. Algebra involves unknown values and variables, right? So in Algebra, you might have an expression like this:  3 times the group (x + 6). In this expression, we dont know what value x is. It could be 4 like in the last expression, but it doesnt have to be. It could be ANY number at all!  And since we dont know what it is, that means we CANT simplify the group first in this case. Our only option here is to "
,,"either leave the expression just like it is and not simplify it at all, OR to use the Distributive Property to eliminate the group. Just like in the arithmetic video, we can distribute a copy of the 3 times to each member of the group so the group goes away and we end up with 3 times x plus 3 times 6. The 3 time x cant be simplified any further because we still dont know what x is, but we can simplify 3 times 6 and just write 18. So the distributed form of this expression is: 3x + 18 And even though we cant simplify these expressions all the way down to a single numeric answer without knowing the value of x, we do know that these two forms of the expression are equivalent because they follow the distributive property. So the Distributive Property works exactly the same way whether your working with numbers or variables. In fact, in Algebra, youll often see the Distributive Property shown like this: a times the group (b + c) equals ab + ac Or you might see it with different letters, like x, y, and z, but the pattern will be the same. This pattern is just telling you that these two forms are equivalent. In the first form, the factor a is being multiplied by the entire group. But in the second form, the factor a has been distributed so its being multiplied by each member of the group individually. And if youre looking at this thinking, what multiplication?, remember that multiplication is the default operation which is why we dont have to show it in this pattern. Since the a is right next to the group, it means its being multiplied by the group, and on this other side, since the copies of the a are right next to the b and c, it means they are being multiplied also. And even though this pattern is usually shown with addition in the group, remember that "
,,"it also works for subtraction since subtraction is the same as negative addition. But the distributive property does NOT apply to group members that are being multiplied or divided. Okay, so this is the basic pattern of the Distributive Property. Its usually just shown with two members in the group, but remember that it works for groups of any size. We could have a times the group (b + c + d) and the equivalent distributed form would be: ab + ac + ad Heres a few quick examples that "
,,have a combination of numbers and variables to help you see the patterns of the Distributive property: 2 times the group (x + y + z) can be changed into the distributed form:  2x + 2y + 2z 10 times the group (a - b + 4) can be changed into the distributed form: 10a - 10b + 10 times 4 (which is 40). And a times the group (x - 
,,"y + 2) can be changed into the distributed form: ax - ay + a2 (or 2a which is more proper). So whether youre dealing with numbers or variables or both, the key concept is that the factor outside the group gets distributed to each term in the group. Each TERM in the group? But I thought terms were parts of polynomials, and I "
,,"thought we were WAY past all that by now! Ah - I was hoping you would notice that. And in fact, the members of these groups really are just simple terms in a Polynomial. Well thats what Im here for noticing things. Ooooo! - A butterfly!! Realizing that these groups of things being added or subtracted are really just Polynomials will help you see why the Distributive Property is SO useful in Algebra. For example, in this simple expression:  2 times the group (x + y) the x and the y "
,,"are simple terms in the polynomial x + y. Each of the terms has a variable part but no number part. And if we apply the Distributive Property to the group, we get the equivalent form: 2x + 2y But what if the polynomial was just a little bit more complicated? like this:  2 times the group (3x + 5y) In this expression, each of the terms in the polynomial DOES have a number part that is being multiplied by the variable part. But we can still use the Distributive Property to distribute a copy "
,,of the factor 2 to each term in the polynomial. Wait just a second here! I NOTICED earlier that you said the Distributive Property does NOT work with members of a 
,,"group that are being multiplied, and I also NOTICED that these terms DO have multiplication. Whats up with that? Ah Thats a good question! And it can be a little "
,,"confusing to see how it all works at first. But notice that even though the terms do have multiplication in them, the terms THEMSELVES are being added. So we distributed a copy of the factor 2 to each whole term, but NOT to each part of a term. In other words, we treat each term in a polynomial as a individual member of the group, even if that term has multiplication going on inside of it (which is common since there is often a variable part and number part being multiplied together). Getting back to our example  Distributing the factor 2 to each term gives us 2 times 3x plus 2 times 5y. But this can be simplified even further because we know that 2 times 3 is just 6 and 2 times 5 is just 10. So the distributed form is:  6x + 10y Lets try another example of a factor times a polynomial: 4 times the group (x squared + 3x - 5). First we need to identify the terms of this polynomial so when we distribute the factor, we just make one copy of it for each term. This "
,,"polynomial has three terms: x squared, positive 3x and negative 5. So we distribute a copy of the factor 4 to each term and we get: 4 times x squared (or just "
,,"4 x squared) 4 times 3x which is 12x (since 4 times 3 is 12), and 4 times the negative 5 which is negative 20. So the equivalent distributed form is:  4 x squared + 12x - 20 Lets see another example:  x times the group (x squared - 8x + 2) In this expression, the factor being multiplied by the group is actually a variable, but the Distributive Property works exactly the same way. And it says we can distribute that factor and multiply it by each term of the group individually. The first term is x squared (which is the same as x times x) so if we multiply that by x, well get x-cubed since that would be three xs multiplied together. "
,,"The next term is negative 8x so if we multiply that by x well have negative 8 times x times x which is the same as negative 8 x squared. Last of all we have the term positive 2, and x times positive 2 is just 2x, so after distributing the factor x to each member of the original group, we have the polynomial: x cubed - 8 x squared + 2x See why the Distributive Property is so handy in Algebra? It shows us how to multiply a polynomial by a factor! We just distribute a copy of "
,,"that factor to each of the polynomials terms. So I know what youre thinking if we can distribute something to each member of a group Can we do the process in REVERSE and UN-distribute something? We sure can! Take a look at this polynomial:  4 x cubed + 4 x squared + 4x Notice that each term of this polynomial has a factor of 4 as its number part. In fact it kinda looks like someone distributed a factor of 4 to each term. Since distributing a factor means making multiple copies of it for each member of a group, UN-distributing is going to mean consolidating multiple copies of a factor into a single copy that is multiplied by the whole group. "
,,"So in this case, we can remove the factor of '4' that is being multiplied by each term individually, and then we can consolidate those into a single factor of '4' that is being multiplied by the entire polynomial by using parentheses to turn the polynomial into a group. But mathematicians usually dont call this UN-distributing a 4. Instead they would say that we factored out a 4 from the polynomial. So you can use the Distributive Property both ways. If you get the expression a times the group (b + c), you can distribute a copy of the factor a to each member of the group. But if youre given the expression, ab + ac, you can apply the Distributive Property in reverse and factor out the a so that it is multiplied by the whole group at once. Its important to realize that neither of these changes the value of the expression. Distributing and UN-distributing a factor are just ways of going back and forth between two equivalent forms of an expression. And it works in "
,,"cases where its not quite so obvious too. For example, Look at this polynomial: 8x + 6y + 4z. Notice that each of the number parts of this polynomial is an even number which means it contains a factor of 2. 8 is 2 times 4 6 is 2 times 3 and 4 is 2 times 2 So each of these terms has a common factor of 2 and that means that if we want to, we can factor out that 2. We can apply the Distributive Property in reverse! We remove the 2 from each term and consolidate it to form a single factor thats multiplied by the whole polynomial at once. And it works exactly the same way for variables too. What if we have the polynomial:  a x squared + ax + a Each of these terms has the common factor a so you could UN-distribute or factor out the a. Notice that when we do that to the last term (which was just a) that term becomes a 1 because there is always a factor of 1 being multiplied by any term. Alright, so thats the basics of how the Distributive Property works "
,,"in Algebra. As you can see, it can get pretty complicated for big Polynomials, but the most important thing is to understand how it works in simple cases so you can "
,,"build on that understanding in the future. Being able to recognize the pattern of the Distributive Property and to apply it both directions will allow you to rearrange algebraic expressions and equations when you need to. And remember the key to really understanding math is to try working some practice problems so that you actually use what youve learned in the video. As always, thanks for watching Math Antics"

AlgebraicExpression,nn_6exr-ShA,in this video you will cover algebraic expressions a topic covered in class 8 math okay moving on let's understand what an expression is to begin with an expression 
,,is nothing but a combination of variables and constants of one or more terms and what does that mean so lets it that's better understood with an example like you see on the right side we have an expression for X square minus 5y plus 10 it has three terms the terms being for X square being the first term minus 5y being the second term and +10 being the third term and a term is nothing but a part of the expression that is separated by the plus or minus signs so for X square minus 5y and plus 
,,10 these become the three terms of the expression for x squared minus 5y plus 10 for instance if you had an expression of the form a minus 4b plus 5c then a would be one term minus 4b would be the second term and plus 5c would be the third term easy enough digging in further we need to understand what a coefficient is what are like terms and what are constants let's look at this expression here for X square minus 5y plus 2 a B minus 4 B a and minus 10 so again we have five terms right or x 
,,squared minus 5 y plus 2 a B minus 4 B a minus 10 so in this example the coefficients would be 4 minus 5 plus 2 and minus 4 let's take a look at what like terms are 
,,like terms are the terms with the same variables raised to the same power now here which are the same variables raised to the same power we see a b and b 8 right these are the same variables and they are raised to the same power a is raised to the power 1 b is raised to the power 1 same goes here b is raised to the power 1 and a is raised to the far one that makes two a B and minus 4 B a like terms and constants are nothing but terms without any variables associated with them so my understand becomes a constant in this scenario now let's understand different types of algebraic expressions we have what are called monomials binomials trinomials polynomials sounds pretty easy based on the name of each cuz mono means one by means to try corresponds to three poly corresponds to multiple right so in the similar fashion 
,,the description is also associated with the same meaning so monomial means an algebraic expression comprising of one nonzero term for example 7a is an example of a monomial 3x square is an example of a monomial because it comes each comprises of one nonzero term similarly a binomial consists of two nonzero terms same way we have seven plus five be three X minus four X Y cube each consists of two terms right two nonzero terms seven being one of them five B being the second term in the first 
,,expression the second expression we have three X being the first term and minus four X Y cube being the second term a trinomial comprised of three nonzero terms so in this example these two examples consists of three terms that makes each of them a trinomial and a polynomial consists of one two or more nonzero terms so a monomial is a also a final polynomial a binomial is also considered a polynomial and a trinomial is also considered a subset of a polynomial so in this example three x squared would be a polynomial 3x minus 4 XY cubed would be considered a polynomial all of these would be considered polynomial because by definition a polynomial can serve one two or more nonzero terms all right moving so let's take a look at how we add and subtract polynomials let's take a look at the example given here we're trying to add two expressions here for X cubed plus or 5y minus 10 and 5 X square Y minus 15 minus 6 X cube minus 2 y so if what we have to do here is that we add the where we group the like terms together and each of these expressions we figure out which other like terms right we notice that 4x cubed and minus 6x cubed are like terms similarly 5y and minus 2y electrum so we group them together and then we form the addition that gives us the result which is -2 X cubed plus 5 X square y plus 3y minus 25 similarly we have a little variation in the question here where we've been asked what must be subtracted from 5x minus 6 X cubed minus 10 to give this result which is 4 X cubed plus 12 so it's nothing but saying what must be subtracted from a if you consider this to be a to give C so it's nothing but saying a minus B equals C so what is B right so B becomes a minus C so if this was a and this was C we subtract 4x cubed plus 12 from - from 5x - 6 X cubed minus 10 so of course we changed the signs of 4x cubed + 12 that makes it minus 4x u minus 12 and that's the result which is minus 10x cubed minus 5x minus 22 and that's the answer now moving on let's take a look at how to multiply polynomials so we have an example given here for a minus 1 times minus 2 a plus 7 so what we have to do is we take each term of the first expression and we multiply it with each term of the second expression so we take four a and multiply it with minus 2 a plus seven and then the second second term which is minus one and multiply it with minus 2 a plus seven so that's how we open the brackets solve them that gives us minus eighty square because for a times minus 2 e is minus 80 square and then plus 28 a plus 2 we because minus 1 minus 2 acre just last way minus 7 and that's the answer which is minus 8a squared plus 38 minus 7 here's another example we've been given the base and height of triangle in terms of expressions as minus 4 X plus y and X minus 3 y applying the formula 
,,for triangle which is 1/2 base times a height we inject and the expressions that we've been provided we simplify it to get this answer which is nothing but half times a multiplying the each of the terms of the first expression with the second expression and that gives your area in square units easy enough and then last but not the least we look at how to divide polynomials so one thing you need to remember is that when we divide terms with the same bases we subtract the exponents if you haven't seen one of my other videos you may want to take a look at it which talks more about about X powers and exponents and come in handy for this particular slide okay so we have to simplify this expression here which is 40 a square B minus 16 a B square plus 24 a cubed b cubed which is the expression and they've asked us to divide by 8 a B so what we have to do is when you are subdividing two expressions and dividing an expression by one term that term gets divided by each of the associated terms of the numerator so it becomes 40 a square B divided by 8 AP - 16 a B Square minus 8 a couple divided by eight a B plus 24 a QB cube divided by 8 a B and then now when you divide a square B divided by a B that is nothing but b and b cancel out a square divided by a gives us a that gives us 5 a because 40 divided by 8 is 
,,5 16 by 8 is 2 a B squared divided by a B gives us B and then 24 a cubed b cubed divided by 8 a B is nothing but 24 by 8 is 3 a cube by a is a 3 a raised to the power 3 minus 1 by applying this rule where we subtract the exponents and that gives you a final answer which is fine 8 minus 2 B plus 3 a square B Square that's a folks keep on solving additional examples and you will be an expert at all the normals as well please subscribe to my channel and keep watching and sharing and liking these videos appreciate your inputs and thoughts and comments thanks so much see you soon

AlgebraicExpression,CMK8cTOSilU,hello great 9 students today we will talk about another unit in your syllabus let's take number 12 can you write this number 12 as a product of two numbers so you can write one time another way of writing I can write this one as 2 times 6 again 3 times 4 then again 4 times 3 is same as 3 times 4 6 times 2 is same as 2 times 6 so what are these numbers we can write any number as a product of two numbers so we call these are factors so what are the factors of 12 if we can write down set off factors of 12 in this form so we can write curly brackets and write all the factors inside 1 2 3 4 6 and 12 so we can write number 12 in terms of these numbers we call these a factor so what's today's listen today's lesson is about factors so that's chapter 6 factors of algebraic expressions now you know how to find out the factors let's take number 24 what are the factors so starting from 1 1 times 24 again how can you write down 24 2 times 12 3 times 3 times 8 and 4 times 6 do we have now 
,,the factors again come 6 6 times 4 so when you write all the factors of 24 we can start from 1 you can write 2 3 4 6 8 12 and 24 so here you know I mean brackets so 
,,these are all called factors and again when you look at factors we can form another set that's called prime factors what are the prime factors in this set so what are the prime numbers 2 & 3 so I can write if you want prime factors I can write as 2 n 3 don't take 1 as a prime number the lowest prime number is 2 now we'll take algebra expressions now it's 3 how can you write down 3 I can write starting from 1 1 times 3 oh I can write 3 times then what are the factors in 3 I can write number 
,,1 and 3 a + 3 now we'll take 5 a B now try to write down all the factors starting from 1 1 times 5 a B then I can take number 5 then 5 times a B now I can combine with a letter and write 5a times 5a times B oh I can connect be with five and write five B times a then what are the factors in five maybe one five then I can write a 
,,B what is 5a 5b a B and 5e so I can't write factors of five baby all these numbers and expressions now we'll take this one find the common factor of the algebraic expressions a B and a C what is common mean common means belongs to both these expressions we'll try to do separately and see what's the common factor a B so already be is there I can write this - it a times B a B what about AC C is already there I can write a now compare these two what can you see you can see this one is common the common factor is written within the circle so what can you write about the common factor common factor is hey let's take this expression 2 ax + 6 X 5 now you need to be careful you have to take all factors and see what's common now if you take X only that's not the common factor sometimes you need to take two or more factors 
,,we can take X look at these two numbers 2 & 6 2 is common so we can take 2 as well so I can take instead of taking 1 X I can take two weeks out so 2x times either what about 6 X Y I can take 2x + 6 is 2 times 3 and y remain now can you see the common one inside the circle 2x is the common factor now we will take this one 7 XY + 
,,21 X Y Z so when you are trying to find our factors first look at number 7 and 21 what's common 7 is common so we can take 7 then look at carefully the letters X is 
,,there and why is there so we can't write 7 X Y in one part and what's the other one 7 X 1 7 X Y times 1 what about this mark if you take 7 X Y out have you get 21 this is 3z now can you see this one is the common bond for both expressions so what's the common factor 7 X take this one a squared B and a B squared so when you take 
,,this one what's common a letter is common B letter is common so we will take a B when you take a B 1 is remaining there when you take a B 1 B is remaining there so what's the common one common factor is a this one now you get three expressions try to find out the common bond for all three three six nine what's common we know that three is common X is there in all three expressions and Y is not there so we'll take three X out three x times y 3x times then how you get 6 3 times 2 so 2 Z so check again 3 X into 2 Z you get 6x z what about this mod when you take 3 X out to get 9 this is 3 and this is P now we see 3 X is common for all these three expressions that's called a common factor so common factor is 3x now in this one is slightly different so you are getting expressions now try a X plus y so this is one expression so that's a factor so I can write x plus y one expression into a here also X plus y is one expression into B so what's the common one there we can see the common one is this expression so you need to remember when you're trying to factors it can be just a number or letter or expression so I can take X plus y out so that's the common factor take this one X into 2 a plus B Y into 2 a plus B so what's common we'll take this one so I can write to a plus B into X here I can write to a plus 
,,B with what so what's common this is the common part so common factor is to a plus B another one now try a into X minus 2y B into X minus two my so these two expressions are the same so which one is the common you can easily get the common factor so we can see X minus 2y into a and here X minus 2y into B so what's the common one this one is the common you can write X minus 2y is the common factor not the one look at carefully a - to win into five p7q into a - tool five and seven there are no common factors PQ also not common so that means we can take a - to win with 5p here a - to win with 17 so we see this is the common factor this one another question a squared X - 3 1 b squared x - 3 by so a squared B squared no common factors we can write x -3 by into a squad in this one X -3 by into B Square so which one is common so the common factor is this one belongs to both these expressions so I can write X minus 3y is the common factor now we'll look at rules related to factor so 
,,we have to do three rules in this unit so we'll take the first one eliminate the common factor of the algebraic expression X plus a lie now eliminate means taking out so when you take these expressions you can take a letter out a is common so I can write taking a out a and then what's remaining when you take a out X is remaining from this one and the plus sign is there Y is remaining from the other one you can check again multiplying these two you need to get this far into X plus a into y ax plus IVA so we can take a letter out from this so that's the first rule when you get an expression taking one letter out from the expression so rule number one if 
,,there's two expressions like this one letter is common take it out so that's how you factorize now we'll use that rule in these examples look at carefully these two 
,,expressions what's common 7 and 14 a number is common there seven is common when you take seven out what's remaining X is remaining from this one and then the sign comes here 14 you already have taken seven out seven times two so this becomes two what about this one three six what's common P and Q both are not common so three take it out what's remaining P plus 6 you get 3 times 2 so this is 2 Oh cute this one a B a plus AC what's common is common take it out what's the remaining part B plus C look at carefully the next one 3 and minus MN m miss come on take it out 3 minus and here which one is common this common take it out so what you write here so when there's no number here means that's 1 so remember that X means 1 next when you take X out you can write 1 there 1 plus what this one a squared plus a B 1 is common check it out a plus B write down the below algebraic expressions as product of two factors so that means take the common letter or number out from these expressions now you have 3 so you have to do the same thing look at all three expressions and take the common 112 p 8q and for look at the numbers what's the common 1 4 4 8 12 4 is common check it out what's remaining 3 P minus 4 already taken from 8 so that's 2 and here I told you when only one number is there that means 4 times 1 so 4 
,,already taken you get one then this one 20x minus 15y 35 so what's common there 5 is common check it out remaining part you inside 4x3 by and this one m-miss come on take it out the remaining part 7m minus 2 and here and this one only come on take it out a plus B minus C this one eight six three there are no common numbers only 
,,X you can take so 8 X 6 Y and when you take X out that's 3 Z what about this one he is common when you take a out this is a B squared + C squared remain so that's how we factorize when you get three expressions and only one letter or number is common now look at this one write down a 2x + y + 2 b x + y algebraic expression as product of two factors okay we'll take separation in this one a into x plus y so you can write the two factors like this what about this one - b into x + 5 so we can write 2 B into X plus 5 now what's the common factor we can see this is the common bond for both expressions so here you get an expression is common so you can take it out so that's the second rule so in second rule you can take one expression out so what we do when you get a into X plus y 2 B into X plus y this X plus y you can 
,,check it out we can take X plus y out and write down the remaining part inside the other bracket so a plus 2b so that's the second rule so remember that first rule says you can take a letter or number just one here you can take an expression out from the algebraic expressions now we'll try to use that theory in these expressions so eliminate the common factor and write down the below expressions as product of two factors so when you look at these two expressions we can see a minus B is common so make sure that you put brackets and the remaining part also you have to write inside brackets when you take a minus B out this becomes X and this is three bar 
,,so X plus three by this one what's comma the whole expression is common a plus seven is common take it out what's remaining two P Q this one tryna X minus y is common take it out the remaining parties is God plus this one what's common this one is common so 2 plus 7y is common take it out and write down the rim look at carefully this one P minus 2q is common check it out and write down the remaining part 7 M plus N squared this one what's common X minus 3 5x minus 3y take it out and the remaining part 11 a plus 3b insert several questions are there related to that so try to do those M plus n is common what's remaining to be minus 11 Q here also X minus 3y common and 7 plus 8 M is the remaining part always the same here comes so a plus 2b when you take it out what you get x squared plus y squared this is also this 
,,is common to P plus 3 is common take it out and then remaining part you write inside now will look like this one now what happens earlier you got two expressions now you have four expressions so how we do that how we try to find out the common factor when you get four terms so we'll take two at a time we'll take first two separately and the next two separately so I can write in here X plus a I and this one is B X plus B bar then you take this expression what's common is come and take it out and then I can write x plus y there this one B is common I can take it out and write X plus y now try to write down factors so what are the factors of this X plus y and in this one X plus y and so what's the common factor so common factor for both is X plus so here the common factor is X plus y what's the other two terms are the two terms are the end here B now you are learning the third rule what's that when you get four terms you can take two at a time and then factorize again when four 
,,"terms are found take two terms at a time and find a factor so here take these two separately these two separately factorize and then finally you will end up with two expressions again the car take the common factor out X plus y is , take it out and you can write down remaining part as a plus take this question factorize so when "
,,you are factorize you have to take two terms at once so when you take these two take 5 out 5 is comma take it out remaining parties X plus 2 1 now a is common plus say take it out what's remaining X plus 2 1 now X plus 2 y is common take it out and the remaining part that's 5 plus you write in the other bracket this one when you take these 2 is common what's the remaining part B plus C these 2 Plus 3 is comments then B plus C so B plus C is common check it out what's the remaining part a plus 3 now look at this one positive so when you take first 2 a is common take it out what's remaining if last 3 these 2 plus 5 is common take it out you get a plus 3 
,,now a plus 3 is common take it out and the remaining part you write in the other bracket if last high look at this one I'll take this one as negative so when you take these two what's common is common so what's remaining B minus C so here 3 is common which one we need to take plus 3 or negative 3 plus 3 when you take you get the same term B minus C now we can see B minus C is common take it out and the remaining part that's a plus 3 in the other bracket look at this one when you take first 
,,2 is common take it out the remaining part is 3 plus Q now what - so we need to get minus sign out - a it's common so what's remaining 3 plus Q now again 3 plus Q is common take it out q what's remaining B - hey these ones from these two a is common take it out this is X plus minus minus so I can take minus 9 out then this becomes plus inside - x plus becomes minus X plus y into a - this one when you take two at a time is come and take it out a minus 2 there which one is common there what we take minus or plus look at carefully when you take plus X out what's remaining X minus plus 6 out you get a minus 2 so then we can see a minus 2 is common so be careful when you have one positive and one negative sometimes you need to take the minus out sometimes not so in this case you don't need to take - out you can write x + X and then a minus 2 is remained then a minus 2 is common and you can write this as a plus X this one you take these two out so what's common this one I can take 
,,X out l- then this one which one we can take - 7 o + 7 so think about this minus sign in the first place if you take - out you are getting -7 out you are getting ill - f that's what we need not a - L other way around so you have to get the same factor in the first one to factorize further so we can take - 7 out what's remaining 
,,there this is L - so what's common now it'll minus M is common check it out the remaining part is X - so in this one just I have given two expressions just to see you can take either plus or minus sometimes you can just take the positive number sometimes you can take that negative one so here if you take Elm out what's remaining - seven in this one if you take minus M out what should be there - seven right because minus into minus becomes plus seven so when you ask to find out the common factor if you if you take just Ament seven you can't find out common factor so that's why so you need to be tricky so to get plus it can be both - so em if you take em that's seven positive into positive positive button to get the common factor there you need to take minus MN minus seven then we can see minus seven is common so in this one what's the common ones - now the next one find the factors of the following algebraic expressions a X plus B by plus a y plus B X now we discussed when you have four terms you take first two separately and the next two separately but what happens here when you take first two separately you can't see any common factors 
,,what we can do there we can interchange the terms so that we get factors now B by and ax no common term so I can switch this term here and this term there because X 
,,is common there so I'll switch that so first term I can write as it is instead of B by I can take this term here BX then a by and I can write this term there now see whether you can apply the previous rule rule number three when you take these two separate here and these two separately you can see that now X is common take it out and you can write this as a plus B what about this one plus wise they gain a plus now a plus B is come on take it out and write down this as X plus so when you can't factorize the first two what you do interchange the terms so the factors can be found by interchanging terms now here also AP and 6q there are no common terms so 
,,what we do I can take a queue there so write down that AP plus EQ now this term here and six feet already there and I can write 6q last take first two is common check it out then V plus key remain then this one plus six is common take it out and P plus Q is remain then P plus Q take it out and the remaining part is a plus six so that's how we factorize now take this one also three a and B X can you find factors you can't find factor so what you do you interchange these two this so I can rewrite this as 3 a + ax and three b + PX then take us two separately and the last two separate yet factorize what's common there a is common when you take a out 3 plus X is remaining from these 2 B is common three plus six remain no three plus six is common so you can take 3 plus 6 out and write down the remaining factor inside so you'll get 3 plus into a plus B now we need to talk about factors of trinomial quadratic expressions so you're learning three terms trinomial tri means three by means to try means three so something about treat quadratic expression what are cod Hritik expressions have you heard about that this word quadratic means when you get 
,,maximum power is two we call those are contracting expressions so in this expression you get three terms that's why it's trinomial why this is quadratic you get power to so there are three terms to this expression as X square term is there this is a quadratic expression so we are trying to factorize when you get three terms with a square term so when three terms of x squared plus five x plus six are converted to four terms can factorize by taking two at a time so we did three rows what's the third one when you get four terms take two terms at once and factorize but three terms there so if we can't split one term to two you get four terms so that's our 
,,idea how can we factorize trinomials three terms you split into four terms so how you're going to do that so this is the method so step number one is here take first you have to write in order square term first and X term then and the constant term third and what we do we multiply first and the last term's x squared into six what you get 6x squared here the sign is important so plus sign so you need to observe the sign so you are getting plus 6x squared then what you do you are trying to find out factors of 6 X square so we'll first look at the number what are the factors of 6 we know that's 1 into 6 2 into 3 that's all so try to find out the factors and then what you do when you multiply here when you add these two can you get the middle term 1 & 6 both positive so what 4 plus 1 and plus 6 you get plus 7 but the 
,,middle term is plus 5 so you can't take 1 & 6 so what about 2 & 3 2 + 3 you get 5 so first you need to identify when you add the factors are we catching the middle term yes we are getting the middle term by these two factors so that means these are the correct expressions so how can you write 6x squared I can write 2x into 3x not just 2 times 3 you get 6 so 6x squared means 2x times 3x then when you add the factors 2x and 3x you are getting 5 X so what we do when you get quadratic trinomial quadratic expressions you are splitting the middle term into two parts so I can rewrite this as x squared instead of 5x I can write plus 2x + 3 X now we get four terms take two at a time and factorize X is common take it out it's plus two is remaining three is common take it out again X plus two is remaining now X plus two is common take it out so what's what's the remaining part X plus three so what's the step first multiply the first and the last and try to find out all factors and how you select the correct factors when you add the factors you need to get the mediator so here this expression both are pluses all three terms are pluses now we'll look at these expressions now we have to we get same type of questions all positive so how can we factorize rearrange it already they are x squared 7 X term and the constant 12 into x squared 12 x squared what's the sign positive sorry what are the factors of 12 1 into 12 2 into 6 3 into Oh now select the appropriate factors what's 
,,the suitable one to get 7 how can we split 7 1 and 12 can you do that No 2 & 6 you can't because you get 8 3 & 4 so that means you can drive this is 3 x + 4 X so this is the ofoh these are the appropriate factors so 3 X + 4 X so I can split 7 X into 3x + 4 X now take two at a time and Trice when you take X out you get X plus 3 there when you take 4 you get X plus 3 because 4 times 3 12 now X plus 3 is common you take it out then you get X plus now try this one a squared plus 8 a plus 50 so 
,,when you multiply these two you get plus 15 a square so the sign is positive what are the factors of 15 1 15 3 times 5 what is those are the factors now see how you 
,,get the middle term 8 a can we take 1 and 15 no we have to take 3 & 5 because 3 + 5 8 so this is a squared so you need three eight times five ways so these are the two factors appropriate to this one so I can split 8a using that 3 & 5 a take two at a time and factorize is comma and take it out a plus 3 is remaining five and fifteen plus five is comma and take it out and a plus three also remaining then a plus 3 again come on take it out and you can write the remaining part inside brackets so the factors are a plus 3 and a plus now try these ones similar wave all these pluses x squared into 18 18 x squared this is plus what are the factors of 18 always 
,,"start from 1 and C then 2 with 9 3 with 6 those are the factors now select the suitable factors is it 1 and 18 or 2 & 9 Oh three and six which one two one nine two plus nine is so we have to select this one so how can you write 18x squared this is 2 X n 9 X now we'll split the middle term - 2 X + 9 X take two at a time and factorize X's , and take it out that's X plus 2 9 is , and take it out that's X plus No X plus 2 is common what's the remaining part X plus this one amen 14 M squared + 14 40 mm M square factors of 14 one with 42 with 7 those are the factors which one is suitable to get 9 2 & 7 so we can write two women 7 M both positive so I can't split instead of 9m that's 2 M + 7 name now take two at a time and factorize I can take em out and the remaining part inside brackets here 7 out and you get same thing in + 2 M plus 2 when you take it out M plus 7 is remaining these ones now in this one can you see the number first but this is also in order square term then the middle one is there it's just the simple one without the square term and a constant so you can do this way as well no need to rewrite the square term first same thing 16 times P squared plus 16 P Square what are the factors of plus 16 sign is important this is plus 16 plus 16 times plus 1 16 times 1/2 times 8 4 times Oh now which one is suitable for + 4 8 16 and 1 17 so you need to select that select these two factors to 1/8 so this becomes 2 p + 8 P this botha positive now we can split the "
,,middle term to 2p + 8 take two at a time rule number three now when you get four terms take two at a time and factorize take two out - his comments you get 8 + P when you take P out you get 8 plus P okay they need + P take it out you get 2 + now what's the difference you get a negative sign so here positive negative positive what's the earlier one something positive something again positive now what's the pattern here squared term positive the middle term negative and the last term positive now we'll see how we can do when the signs are different the middle term of the expression is now - 7e not +7 e but you follow the same procedure a squared + 12 you get positive 12 a squared so you need positive 12 but when you add the factors you need to get minus 7e so how can you get positive values and when you add you need to get negative values first we'll write down factors factors of 12 1 and 12 to 6 and 3/4 but you can take plus into plus as well but we know that negative times negative is positive so if we put negative money into negative 12 you get positive 12 negative 2 into negative 6 again positive 12 so either you can take both pluses or both minuses in this case you need to take minus value because when you add 3 & 4 you get plus 7 but we need minus 7 so you need to take minus 3 and minus 4 minus 
,,3 minus 4 you get minus 7 so these are the two appropriate factors so yeah you need a square yard.this is 3 and minus 4 now we can split the middle term minus 3 minus 4 plus 12 take two at a time and factorize a a minus 3 know which one we take you can take plus 4 or minus 4 if you take plus 4 what happens you are getting minus 
,,ay inside but we need plus a so always check the previous factor so we need to take minus 4 out to get a here if you take minus our this becomes minus 3 now we get same factor a minus 3 and what's the remaining 1 a minus now we'll apply that in these examples middle term is negative but the last term is positive 12x squared one 
,,and 12 just one factor what are the other factors to with six three with this is plus but the minute term is negative means you need to take both negatives minus eight how you get minus 8 minus 2l minus six so these are the two appropriate factors so you can write 2x + 6 X so split the middle term into - 2 X - 6 x + 2 and take two at a time so when you take X out this is X - 2 which one we take minus 6 or + 6 you need to get positive X inside so we need to take - six out X minus 2 so X - 2 
,,is there X minus 6 this one plus 14y Square 1 and 14 and what are the other factors 2 + 7 that's all middle term is minus 9 definitely we know that both should be - 
,,and to get Y squared this should be both wise so minus 2 y x - 7 y you get 14 y square now split the middle term take two at a time and factorize take Y out the remaining fact Y minus 2 here we have to take minus seven now to get positive y ya then this becomes minus 2 so y minus 2n y minus 7 this one all the terms in order square term then the single term and the constant 16 M square what are the factors 1 and 16 2 with 8 4 & 4 middle term is negative 10 so we have to select the appropriate one so to get M Square and this should be M na minus 2 m and minus 8 mu get minus 10 so you are we are splitting the middle term into 2 minus 2 m minus 8 M plus 16 tape 2 at a time I'm out you get a minus 2 yeah take minus 8 out - - because minus 8n - Joe you get plus 16 M minus 2 there come on what's the remaining 1 - 8 this 
,,one P squared into 30 30 P Square what are the factors of 31 and 32 with 15 3 with 10 can we get 4 no then that's odd what about 6 6 times 5 so that means I can write pi times 6 when you go in order I can write 5 times 6 so those are the factors but the middle term is negative both numbers should be negative what are the suitable want to get 17 - 17 I can take 2 and 15 this boat should be negative this is P and P they are to get P squared now let's play the middle term minus 2p minus 15 B 30 day two at a time now do it take P out what's remaining P minus 2 here which one we take minus 15 you can take to get plus P P minus 2 P minus 2 into P minus 30 now what happens when you get different factors here can you proceed no that means something wrong with your previous step so make sure you need to get the same factor to proceed further this one the constant first and the square term last so you don't need to rearrange it what are the factors of 16 Y square factors of 61 16 to wait for for what are the suitable ones to get minus 10 minus 2 n minus 8 and this becomes Y n Y now I'm splitting the middle term minus 10 by 2 minus 2 y and minus 8y take 2 at a time and factorize what's common there 2 is common and I can write 8 minus 5 in this 1 minus y is common 8 minus y minus into minus is plus now we get same factor so 8 minus y and the other one is too - why some more questions try 21 with y square 21 y square what are the factors of 21 1 with 21 3 with 7 and you the middle term is minus 10 we can't take 1 and 21 so definitely we know these two both mega- and we can write wise as well spread the middle term and factorize by taking two at a time this one you can take 3 out and the remaining part 7 minus y this one you can take Y out are we taking - yr plus y out we need plus 7 so we need to 
,,take minus y out 7 - why Cemil - why is comma and take it out the remaining part is 3 - what this one K squared into 15 so 15 K square factors of 15 1 15 3 5 now we 
,,need to select appropriate factors to get minus 60 so 1 + 15 you get 16 so this both should be negative to get negative 16 here so K squared you get minus 1 KN minus 15 K split the middle term you don't you can write 1 K or without one also correct take two at a time man factorize take K out K minus one is there yeah that's why 
,,it's important to write one if you take K out you are getting one there yeah we can take -15 out the remaining part is K minus one so K minus one is common take it out the remaining part is K minus 15 and also you can multiply and see whether you are getting the previous expression so here K into K likewise you can check with the yawns is correct factors of 48 what are the factors are 48 one with 48 two with 24 three with 16 and 4 with 12 so likewise you can write down factors but no need to write down all if we can find out at once - 19 how we get 19 from these two by ID adding the numbers because we saw that if it's minus and then plus you need both 
,,- so we can select the we can select 3 and 16 as the factors to get 19 both should be - to get + 48 so split the middle term into minus 3h and minus 16 H take 2 at a time when you take it out you get h minus 3 here you need to take -16 out to get plus h then minus 3h minus 3 is common take it out and write X minus H minus 60 factors of 32 now to get minus 18 one with 32 two with 16 here when you are trying to find our factors just see whether you get this number we see that already it's there so you don't need to find all factors we can see 2 and 16 becomes 18 this should be minus 2 MN minus 16 so the factors are -2 ml - 16 M now take two at a time and factorize stick em out you get a minus 2 there when you take -16 out a minus 2 okay now a minus 2 is come on let's take it out and write down the remaining fact that M minus 16 this one you need 19 years squared what are the factors of 1919 is a prime number so in prime numbers you can't find other factors always 1 net itself so 1l 19 we are getting 19 and 120 so both should be negative and this is minus 1 in length - 19 split the middle term into one meal and 19 years take two at a time and factorizes please come and take it out you get L minus 1 it's good to write 1 then you can easily see when you take a lout the remaining part is 1 your 19 - 19 when you take that's ill - 1 so L minus 1 is common take it out L minus 19 is remaining now what's the change the middle term is plus and the last term is negative so 
,,so far what are the things we did we did all terms positive second one we did middle term negative but the last term is positive now we are trying to learn how to factorize when the middle is positive and the last term is negative so same procedure you multiply the first and the last but now you are getting minus 18x squared earlier both cases these two you got plus as the final valid now you are getting minus 18 first without considering the sign what are the factors of 81 and 82 with 9 3 
,,with 6 now just check this is not about adding now because to get minus one number should be positive and the other one should be negative so one positive one negative and the product you get negative and how do you get the middle term now the middle term is +7 positive value if we take plus 9 and minus 2 you can get +7 so in this case when you get a negative on what we do try to try out the factors the bigger number should be positive to get +7 you need plus 9 and minus 9 minus 2 so first 
,,select the appropriate one and put plus father bigger factor so here minus 18x squared is obtained when multiplying the first term and the final term since the middle term is plus 7x the larger factor of both factors must be positive now we can split so to get x squared this should be X and X now I can split 7 X into minus 2 XL 
,,plus 9 X take 2 at a time when you take a South you get X minus to take plus nine out X minus two here we need to take plus because X first that's positive x minus 2 is common take it out and the remaining part we write ya now we'll apply that rule in these examples now we can see the middle term is plus and the last one is negative so when you multiply always you get a negative value so negative 10 a square so factors of 10 110 to 5 and then to get +3 one should be plus and 1 should be negative but the bigger number should be positive so when you select this one this is plus and this is minus plus 5 and minus 2 you are getting plus 3 then this is a so that's how we find out the appropriate factors so a squared minus 2a and +5 it take two at a time and factorize when you franchise you get a minus 2 when you take plus five this is a minus 2 again a minus 2 is common take it out and write V plus 5 next one minus 30 be square factors of minus 31 32 with 15 3 with 10 think about 
,,without writing can you get the middle term 7 plus 7 definitely not with want 1 and 32 with 15 you are not getting 3 with gel you're getting server so we can think about 3n +7 means the bigger number is plus and the smaller one is negative to get B squared both should be peace now we can't split the middle term 2 minus 3b plus 10t Plus 2 and last row separately here we can take me out this one you can take 10 out now B minus 3 is common and here V Plus now try to find out the factors at once -20 C square what are the factors of 21 and 22 with 10 now c2 with tail are we getting it yes so two with 10 the middle term is positive means the bigger number is positive and they're smaller one is negative to get C squared this should be C and C now let's pick the middle term minus 2c plus 10 C minus 20 take two at a time take C out you get to C minus 2 plus 10 out you get C minus 2 then C minus 2 is common what's remaining c plus now here the constant term is first doesn't matter as long as the this term in the middle it's okay you can get this for R term first all last minus 12 P Square middle term is plus 4 think about factors one with 12 2 with 6 2 with 6 you can get 4 so I'm not writing all factors now I'm writing appropriate one to at six but plus four is there this is plus and minus so to get P squared this is PE n now I can't split the middle term okay two at a time and factorize you can take two out you get 6 minus P plus P there are six minus P 6 minus fields come on remaining one plus this one 21 minus K squared minus 21 K squared what's the suitable one to get for one with 21 3 with 7 3 & 7 you are getting 4 so 3 with 7 
,,plus 4 means this is Plus this is minus and to get case come on it should be case now you can do fast you don't need to write down all factors at sea we are you get 
,,plus 4 now take two at a time threes comment there 7 minus k plus K is common and you get 7 minus K so 1 minus K it's comma and take it out you get 3 plus K now what happens in this one the term is also negative and also the constant term is also negative so we'll revise what we did we did oh positive then we did middle term positive negative and the last term positive and the third one we did middle term positive and the last term negative now we are doing middle term negative as well as Laster negative so in this case you got all positive this is a middle term negative this is last term negative now you are getting middle term and last term both are 
,,negative so what we do same procedure when you multiply first and the last you get minus 10 May square this is also minus like previous one factors of minus 10 to get minus 3 think about factors one with chain 2 with 5 2 & 5 relates to 3 so we'll write 2 & 5 now what happens is this is a nd middle term is negative means you need to get the bigger one negative negative 5 and plus 2 you get negative 3 so middle term is negative means select the bigger one negative so he'll say the middle term is negative 3a the larger factor of both factors must be negative so we can use that one to split the middle term C squared minus first we'll write plus to a minus 
,,B minus T here don't think that I can in this one here you can write minus five way first and then write to a you get the same answer so don't worry about which one 
,,to write first you can write any two factors first if you can't see the factors then what you do you can interchange the terms when you take first two you get a that's a plus two minus five common for both so I can take minus five out then you get a plus 2 a plus two is common and you get a minus so in this case also when negative is in the middle term you have to select the larger factor negative now we'll use that one to factorize now straight away we will try to find out the factors without writing all -12 factors of 12 to get 4 1 12 to 6 to 6 you get four middle term is negative means bigger number should be negative this is 6 6 n minus 6 X + 2 X so x squared + 2 X - 6 6 - 12 when you take first 2 you get X X plus 2 when you take - out - 6 6 - 6 out you get X plus X plus 2 X minus 6 this want to get minus 20y 
,,squared the middle term - 8 1 + 22 with 10 to tell you get 8 so 2 + 10 y middle term is negative means the bigger one is negative split the middle term I can write the 10 Y first as well we'll do that it was always I took the smaller one first but you don't need that take first - and you can see why is common when you take 2 out you get Y minus 10y minus 10 is common take it out and write down the remaining factor y + 2 this 1 minus 22 factors of - 22 1 with 22 you are not getting 9 - with 
,,11 to any level you are getting so - with 11 - means in the middle bigger one is - and this is positive so you can write this one and the middle term - 2 Z minus 11 
,,see take two at a time and factorize then you take Z out that's the plus two minus eleven out that's Z plus 2z + 2 is common and you get Z minus eleven this one - 20 M Squared when you mod their first and the last middle term is - it means this is minus one name factors of 21 with 22 with ten and four with five four and five differences one and the middle term is negative means bigger number is negative and this is positive select the middle term and take two at a time and factorize so I'll take four plus four out you get em - but so a minus 5 into M plus 4 this one h squared into - 26 - 26 H square one with 26 - with 13 - and 13 you get 11 this is minus 11 you'd have to take the difference so - for the larger number and this is positive splitting the middle term 2 plus 2 H and minus 13 H ok first two terms you get H comma when you take these two you can take minus 13 out and h plus 2 is common and h minus 13 remaining this one again quadratic me all these are trinomial quadratic expressions three terms and the square term is there - 30 M Squared 1 and 32 with 15 you need - 13 so - with 15 the middle term is negative so the bigger number larger number negative and this one is positive here K squared into 30 not M square so this should be k squared so k k is there now split the middle term K squared 
,,+ 2 k + -15 K then you take first two plus two when you take - 15 now that's K + 2 k plus 2 is common and K minus 15 is remain now look at this one write the following algebraic expressions they're squared terms now slightly different so you have given expressions then you are asked to write as square terms so what can you see about these numbers for 16:9 25 49 64 ol square numbers 2 times 2 4 4 times 4 16 so we can easily write in terms of a square number x squared is already there so for I can write 2 times 2 if I write 2x whole thing squared you get the same thing 2 times 2 for X into X x squared so final answer is 4x squared so this is a square term so this is the expression and you get a square term now try this one 16 P squared how can you write as a square term 16 means 4 times 4 so I can write 4p whole thing square 9m squared 3 m whole thing square 25 is 5 times 5 5h whole thing square 49 7 times 7 7 else whole thing square 64 means a times eight 8k whole thing square 36 6 times 6 6 P squared + 81 means 9 times 9 9 a whole thing's crap now we know how to write down any expression as a square term right as difference between two 
,,squared terms difference means subtraction you have given two expressions and both we need to write as square terms x squared already a square term you can write as 
,,it is minus 4y squared we read that before 4 is 2 times 2 so I can write 2y whole thing square so difference between means this is negative so 2 squared terms with minus sign in the middle in the next one 9 minus a squared 9 how can you write as a square term 3 squared and a squared already yeah this 125 5 squared + 4 a squared 
,,4 is 2 times 2 so I can write 2 a whole thing square this 116 4 times 4 so this is 4 8 whole thing squared + 9 is 3 and 3 so 3 B whole thing's 81 9 times 9 9 X whole thing squared 49 means 7 into 7 7 y whole thing square 36 means 6 times 6 right like this and 121 is can you remember square terms square numbers 11 times 11 seventh one a squared B squared I can write a B whole things got 64 times 4 so 4 squared x squared is also square so I can write as it is and 144 is 12 times 12 12 square 
,,this one 4 is 2 times 2 so I can drive to Y whole thing square 81 is 9 times 9 16 again a square number 4 times 4 169 so you need to know square terms 2 times 2 4 3 
,,times 3 9 4 times 4 16 so like that 169 is 13 times 13 13 Q squared so in this one we did writing any expression in terms of difference between two squared terms now look at this one find the factors of the difference between two squared terms now you have given this one a square term is they are in a constant term what's missing when you compare with trinomials we got three terms one a squared and the next one should be hater now nothing means you can take the middle term as zero so we can rewrite this question as a squared plus 0 a minus four and proceed as before like factorizing trinomials will do that a times minus four minus four square a square 
,,factors of -4 and the middle term is 0 so 2 well 2 2 a and 2 way but both are the same so one is positive and one is negative when you add you are getting 0 a now we will try to split that 0 you can write plus 2 a and minus 2 a and when you take the first 2 separately you get a plus 2 and here are negative sign and 2 is common a plus 2 then a plus 2 come on you get a minus 2 so this is a long process when now you have two terms but when you are trying with zero term in the middle it takes time so what we can do we can find out an easy way so I'll explain when you get two terms how we can factorize now we'll take the same question a squared minus 4 here a squared term and here 4 is also square term now can you see that we can rewrite this as 2 squared difference between two squared terms so a squared + 2 squared so when you get two squared terms what we do we can write two factors like this and think about how you get a squared that's a and a how you get 4 that's 2 and 2 so you write down the factors and one factor is positive and one factor is negative so that's really easy when you get two terms and both terms are square terms so what you call that difference between two squared terms when you get difference between two squared terms you can write the first one here and the last one for you get to 
,,enter so this number so when you write down the square term these two comes yeah and one is minus and the other one is positive now we can factorize all these using 
,,difference between two squared terms 16 first you have to write as a square term 16 is 4 times 4 so I can write as 4 square what's the next step then put two brackets x squared is X and X this is 4 and 4 one is positive and one is negative so you can switch this factor first and this one last so one factor is always positive and the other one is negative so in this one 49 you can write 7 squared so what are the factors why why this is -7 + +7 this one 36 you can write 6 squared so 6 first and then P so what are the factors 6 minus PN 6 plus B now try to factorize using difference between two square terms first thing you have to write a square terms 7a 
,,whole thing square R and 5b whole things well then easy you write 787 in first and the second term is 5 B 1 is negative and one is positive this one 81 9x whole thing squared 49 7y whole thing square now write down the 2 well it's 9x here and seven by one is positive and one is negative this one try 144 12x whole thing square twelve times twelve hundred forty four five and five twenty five how do you write down the factors with two brackets first term here and then last term here and one is positive other one is negative now it's easy two terms you can end both are square terms if both are square terms you can apply this not for all factorization 11y whole things crash then you can straight away write 9x and then other term is eleven by one is positive and the other one is negative some more questions a squared B 
,,squared I can write a B whole thing square 25 five C squared so when you take the difference a B first and five C next one means positive one is negative this one 121 is 11 P whole thing square 49 is 7 Q whole thing square so how you write down the factors p 7q one is positive and a other one is negative what about this one right as a square term 4x whole thing squared and 13 my whole thing squared right down the tube records first term first and the last second one is positive one is negative here also write as a square term a B whole thing square and C D whole thing square one is positive one is negative so here we use difference between two squared 
,,terms now what happens can you write down this as a square term - a square - is not a square number what we do there when you get something like this with two numbers we can take the common one out so eliminate the common factor two first then what you get when you eliminate that one so we will take the same question I'm taking 
,,two out two is common a squared - 25 now but we know 25 is a square number now we can use difference between two squared terms I can rewrite this as a squared and five squares now - is there what are the factors of this a a here five five one is positive and one is negative so it's easy when you get extra term try to eliminate that and then think about applying difference between two square terms in this one what's common I can see a you can take it out then you get a squared - 49 both these are squared numbers you can apply difference between two squared terms I can write this one as plus 7 n minus 7 now try to factorize these ones you can take the common term out I can take 4 out what's remaining 25 y squared and here for is there I can write what's the before that I'll write down there when you take 4 out I can write this as a square term so 25 5 into 5 so 5 by whole things square now write down the factors X X X is the term I don't take the square term 5 by is the other term then this is plus and this is negative in this one what's common I can take 4 out when you take four that's 4 a squared minus 4 times 9 9 B squared now 4 & 9 both are square terms I can write this is as to a whole thing squared and this one has 3 B whole thing squared then take the difference between two squared terms for is or we they are the two factors are two we plus 3 B and 2a minus 3b so you have to do this step to identify the factors so you have to write down square terms and then we take these two terms this one X is common take it out 4x squared minus 9 y squared and then write as a square term 2x whole thing squared and 3 by whole things square then apply difference between two square terms 2x + 3 y + 2 X - 3 well how we do this one right as a square term I can write this one as a square squared whole thing square B 4 how can you write B squared whole things square now apply difference between two squared terms a squared plus B squared and a squared minus B Square can you factorize further plus one we can't when you get to square term with plus we don't know how to factorize but we know the difference between two square terms that that means when you get square terms with minors we know how to factorize so you can factorize a squared plus B squared here again you can factorize one is 
,,positive the other one is negative so in your plus billion a minus B so if you do up to this point you are getting half marks so you need to factorize completely find the value using factor knowledge look at these two 7.5 is common take it out what's remaining 2.7 and 7.3 now we can simplify inside brackets so 7.5 times addition of these two numbers 7 + 3 10 7 + 2 9 and 10 so you get to just multiply this by 10 it's easy move the decimal place one place to right so you like 75 as it what about this one look at carefully 9.3 is common check it out what's remaining three-putt 9.3 so this is three point five and six point no add these two you get ten one 
,,remaining 6 plus 3 8 6 plus 3 9 9 plus 1 again just multiply by 10 nine point three times ten nice now using factorization method you can find out values otherwise you have to multiply all these decimals and then add it so which one is easy use this method again twelve point five is common take it out what's remaining twelve point five and here minus two point five now the subtraction so what's 12 point five minus two point five you get ten so ten times twelve point five you move one place 
,,to the right the answer is hundred twenty-five this one you get two squared terms apply the difference between two squared terms one means plus and the other one is 
,,"negative when you add these two get fifty then what about this one when you subtract you get four four times 50 that's two hundred so it's easy to apply the difference between two squared terms to find the answers this one difference between two squared terms so I can write one factor positive one factor negative so when you add these two you get 200 what's the subtraction you get 6 so 6 times 200,000 200 in this one also you get difference between two squared terms so one is positive one is negative then when you add these two you get 10 multiplied when you subtract you get five five times ten Yonsei is 50 look at this one now you get how many expressions one two three four what's that rule number three when you get four expressions take two at a time and factorize these two we'll check what's the common 12.3 is "
,,calm take it out what's remaining four point five and five point five when you take class to seven point seven is common you get four point five and five point five 
,,now when you add what you get two point three yeah this is same four point five plus five point five you get ten you know also you get 10 now we see ten is comma and check it out what's remaining 20.3 yen seven point seven now when you add these two what you 7 + 3 10 and 10 again 10 times 10 you get 100 so as there are four terms take two terms at a time and factors this one how many terms are there 1 2 or 3 4 so we'll follow the same procedure we'll take these two and these 28.7 is common 
,,"take it out what's remaining 4.6 l 5 points from this you can take 1.3 out what's remaining four point six and five point four no and these two 6 plus 4 10 five plus four so you get 10 here what about this one same thing so you get 10 now two expressions 10 is common take it out what's remaining eight point seven and one point three so 10 times what's the addition 10 times 10 you get now we'll look at review exercise in your textbook so you need to know how to factorize expressions just normal expressions and then we did trinomials and then difference between two squared terms right each of the following algebraic expressions as a product of factors so you have to take the common term out L write down the remaining part inside brackets what's common here 8 and 12 will see 4 is common take it out remaining part you write insult this one 9 and 18 9 is , take it out remaining part a plus 2y inside brackets 3 M plus 6 3 is common take it out so 6 is 3 times 2 so you get M plus 2 "
,,20 and 30 10 is common to a minus 3b this one for his comma P minus 5 5 Q so 4 times 5 you get minus 24 times minus 5 you get minus twenty twelve and four I can take fallout 3 - ok this one no three expressions three terms are they are so C common for all three three is common take it out the remaining part you write inside brackets 3 times 5 you get 5 B 3 times 12 minus 8 4 4 is common 3 8 minus 2 B plus 1 because I can write this one as 4 times 1 9 minus 3 minus 6 3 is common 3 minus B minus 2 C so you get 9 minus 3b minus 6 see these two you can take forward or minus 4 does not matter you can take any term so I look like I can take 4 out you get minus 3x inside plus y all I can't change the terms and write down by minus 3x same answer - - both they are that means common for both - for we'll take it out then you get this one in plus P this one which one we can take either minus or plus we take minus three out if you take minus 3 this becomes positive - - because - - you get positive take a out remaining part B plus C you can take P out and then not P there what's the value here one because just P means 1 P 1 minus Q 3 terms are there a is common take it out b + c - take this 1 3 you can take it out and also x is common so we can take 3x out so what's remaining this becomes 1 plus 2 what what about this one B is command + 3 so 3 B you can take it out you can write 2 a minus 3 C multiply and see whether you get the term 3 B 2 minus 3 C you get minus 9 PC here for P you can take it out for P that means a plus B minus 1 because 4 P when you take it out one is remaining in this one you can take X out you get x squared + 2 em 
,,you can take it out 3-2 in in remaining this one six is also common is also common I can take six six out six is out that means one - two 1s and one T example number one factorize 3x plus 6y plus KX plus 2k y four terms what's the method take two at a time and factorize from these two I can take three out you get X plus 2y from 
,,these two I can take plus K out X plus two now we see X plus 2y is common and then the remaining part you write inside brackets example number two similar way four terms you can take first two and last two separately if you take this one you can take a out so a minus three is there when you take B out a minus three there so a minus three is common what's remaining a plus B example number three see a method X is comma and take it out you get X plus y now what happens both - you can take - one out because XY only one is common take one out you get X plus one X plus y and the remaining part X minus one exercise six point one factorize each of the following algebraic expressions of so you get four terms take two at a time he's common you get X plus y last three is common X plus y so X plus YN EI plus three nice two is common you get X minus eight here plus three is common then you get X minus eight so X minus eight ten a plus three what about these two Emmys come on take it out you get P minus Q minus n so which one we take - a no plus in you need positive P so we'll take minus n P minus Q P minus Q and a - this one which one is common in his common take it out get K Plus both negative you can take negative B out k plus L you are getting so k plus L is comment and the remaining part is B minus P this one take two at a time and factorize X take it out you'll get X plus four when you take minus three Y out that's X plus four again X plus four is common remaining part you write separately this one when you take these two Y is come and take it out Y minus 7 so in this one do we take minus 2 or plus 2 you take minus 2 to get positive by inside this becomes minus because minus minus becomes so y minus 7 and y minus 2 this one again take two at a time and see whether you can factorize here is comma and take it out this one too is common you get same thing a minus eight and plus two this one B you can check it out B plus 5 minus - you can take minus 2 out you get positive here because positive into negative is negative so B plus 5 and B minus 2 this one okay two at a time and factorize here or so two at a time and actress this one 5 is comma take it out when you take five this is one one plus six here minus y will take it out then this becomes 1 plus X 1 plus X n PI - what this one when you take a out X minus 1 here to get plus X will take minus one out X minus one again minus minus plus six minus one and a minus an example number one now this is these are trinomial quadratics have you factorize multiply the first and the last you get plus 6x squared and try to factorize plus 6x squared and when you add the factors you need to get plus five six one six two and three two three you are getting fine so 2x and 3x are the appropriate factors so you can split the middle term to 2x and 3x now we can take three at a time and factorize you get X plus 2 here when you take 3 out you get X plus 2 X plus 2 is common for both take it out and 
,,write X plus 3 as the other factor this one middle term is negative and the other one is positive so what you do when you find out the factors the larger factor should be negative so we'll try to find out positive 12x squared and find out the factor so that the difference is minus 8 or the addition tell me this is the second part we did this is minus this is plus means both the factors are negative so here find both negative factors to get positive 12x squared so what are the suitable factors 6l 2 so 6 & 2 you get minus 6x + -2 X now we'll split the middle term and take 2 at a time and factorize so here you can take minus 2 out and write X minus 6 so X minus 6 is common what's remaining X minus 2 example number 3 now the middle term is positive and their last term is negative then what we do now you are getting the difference when you take the difference you need to get plus 2 that means larger factor is positive so we'll do multiply these two you get my knee minus 15y squared find out the factors of -15 the difference is +2 15 is 5 & 3 so this positive the bigger one should be positive so this is plus and this is minus so I can write the middle term as plus 5i + -3 bar take two at a time and but right here I can take minus 3 out this becomes y plus 5 Plus 5 is common you get Y minus 3 example number 4 both negative so what's the situation both negative means when you multiply you're getting negative and the difference is minus 1 so the bigger number the bigger factor is negative here so what are the suitable factors to get minus 1 5 & 4 bigger one should be negative - 5 en plus boy now I split the middle term take two at 
,,a time I can't take +4 out now we see a minus 5 is common and the remaining part you right here exercise six-point tuna factorize the quadratic expressions given below so now we will try to do at once + + means the addition comes here so we can write 18x squared factors of 18 to get 9 6 & 3 so 6 X set 3xo split the middle term and take two at a time and factorize now see we are getting the same factor if something happens that means you are not getting the same so you have to go back and check again this one plus 30 by square factors of 30 to get 11 6 & 5 the buta pluses split the middle term into ante two at a time and now see what factors are the same here by plus six are there that's common take it out and remaining part you write inside the bracket this is also positive positive 24 a square factors of 24 to get 10 6l when you are doing sums you can easily get the factors correct factors at one six and Oh both positive we split the middle term and Factor s plus 6 here when you take plus 4 plus 6a plus 6 is common and the remaining part you right here this one 15 so you get 15 B squared when you multiply plus 15 B squared what are the 
,,factors of plus 15 to get minus 8 so minus 8 means both factors are negative both factors negative means 5 and 3 B minus 5b so you can get minus 3b minus 5b that's 50 take two at a time and factorize minus minus plus so B minus 3 is come and you get me - this one middle one negative last one positive me same thing so 6 6 square 
,,and the factors this is negative middle term is negative so that means both negative factors so you can't get 6 and one because you get minus 6 and minus 1 minus 7 so 3 & 2 both are the appropriate factors now split the middle term and fat rice X is common and here 2 is common minus minus plus X minus 3x minus 2 this 1 plus 20 and middle term is minus 12 so plus 20 M square factors of plus 20 but the middle term is negative means both negative what are the factors 10 + 2 4 & 5 you're not getting 10 + 2 10 and 2 both negatives you get 12 so M squared minus 10 name - 2 wim plus 20 so take two at a time and factorize when you take minus 2 world you get minus here and M minus 10 and if minus 2 oh you can do at once this one different last term is negative means one factor is positive and the other factor is negative so you need to get one here so one here means this one the larger factor is positive so how do you get larger factor positive so that means minus 12 what are the factors 6 & 2 it doesn't work for 1 3 so larger factor should be positive so you get me to the top Bonnie that means for a minus 3 then you take two at a time - 3 out you get a plus 4 gate take a plus 4 out you are getting a minus 3 now the next one - 24 P squared when you multiply last term negative means the larger factor is positive but the middle term is positive 24 8 times 3 so this is plus and this is minus then only you get plus 5p so P squared + 8 P minus 3 P minus 24 take two at a time and you take P out that's this minus 3 out you get P plus 8 so P + 8 + P minus 3 this one last term is negative when you multiply you get 16 we are what are the factors middle term is plus means the larger factor is positive 16 is a 10 choose larger factor is positive there is positive 8 and negative 2 P split them at middle term 8 P minus 2 P minus 16 state two at a time and factorize you get B plus 8 and B minus 2 this one same thing final value is negative means one is positive and one 
,,is negative how we find this is one factors of 12 4 & 3 middle term is negative means larger one is negative and the other one is positive in fact right so you write the middle term in terms of minus 4 L plus 3 and take first 2 separately and the last 2 separately so you get X here X minus 4 when you take +3 out what's remaining you get X minus 4 so X minus 4 is common take it out and the remaining part is X plus 3 this one last number is negative means you take the difference minus 40 a square the middle term 40 is 8 times 5 always think about the middle term and try to find out the correct factors 8 and 5 middle term is minus means the bigger one is 
,,negative now split the middle term into minus 80 that's five you take two at a time and factorize a minus eight e minus 8 is comma and the remaining part is a plus this is also same negative 10 our square factors of negative 10 that means we have to take the difference 10 means 5 and 2 middle term is negative means negative 5 r+ 500 splitting the middle term take two at a time you can take plus 2 out - hi then R minus 5 is common you get R plus 2 as their other factor this one both positive so that's easy plus 9y square R that means addition when you add the factors you are getting plus 6 what are the factors 3 + 3 so you get 3 by n 3 Y so Y squared is plus would pluses Y squared + 3 y + 3 y + 9 and take two at a time you get y plus 3 when you take 3 out that's also y + 3 now y plus 3 is common you get y plus 3 so you can write instead of this y plus 3 squared doesn't matter either you can keep like this or write as a square term this one positive as a middle term is negative so what's the condition both factors are negative 25 what are the factors five and five but both are negative so K squared - 5 K minus 5 K was 25 Dave two at a time and factorize you can take minus five out because you need plus K inside no okay - five again K minus five you can write as a square term this one four plus four X 
,,plus X square same things now so x squared meter term is plus means both pluses so plus 2 X n plus 2 X split the middle term 2 + 2 X + + 2 X and then take two at a time what's common to is commas 2 plus X and here also X is comma 2 plus X now 2 plus X is common and the remaining one is also 2 plus X I can write this one as a square term like this when you multiply you get positive 36 x squared middle term is plus 15 so that means addition what are the factors to get plus 15 12 + 3 + 3 15 so this is positive and this is also positive now split the middle term - 12 X + 3 X and you can take 12 out 3 + X when you take X out 3 + + X again now 3 + 6 come on 
,,take it out you get 12 plus X for the next factor this one middle term is negative this the constant term is positive what it means both factors are negative what are the factors that means addition we have to think about adding the two factors you need to get 11 36 and high but both factors are negative because the middle term 
,,is negative now split the middle term when you take two at a time 6 is common and a is common I'll take - a out because I need plus five minus a ok so five minus a is common for both and the remaining one is six minus a this one last one is positive and the middle term is negative that means both the factors are negative so what are the factors of plus 54 think about it 9 + 6 6 + 9 54 and when you add 6 plus 9 you get 15 so 9 and 6 but middle term is negative means both negative so we can split the middle term like this fat rice so you get 9 out 9 times 6 so you get here why when you take minus y out 6 minus y so 6 minus y is common take it out and raining part 9 - Wow example number one now you get two terms and we did difference between two square terms we can see 25 is a square number so write this number as a 
,,square term then how we write down the factors we write X and X to get x squared 5 and 5 to get 5 squared and 1 factor is positive and the other factor is negative this one again difference between two squared terms I can write 9 as 3 square then you can straight away apply difference between two square terms one is positive and one means negative example number three two terms so again same thing how can I write Phi l squared as a square term I can write to a whole thing square 49 seven squared difference between two squared terms two ways one term and the other one is seven one is positive one is negative here one is there is one a square number yes 
,,we can write 1 square is 4 P squared I can write to bead whole thing squared so this is difference between two squared terms so you can write down the two factors one is the first term 2 B is the second term one factor is positive the other factor is negative example number five so fact rise 2 x squared minus 72 now can you write as a square number 2 is not a square number so if that means first you need to find out the common factor for both you can take two out and right this is 36 now 36 is a square number so you can write as difference between two squared terms so I can write two factors one is X mine +6 and the other one is X minus six now find the value so you can use difference between two squared terms so what are the two factors one term is 33 the other one is seventy one factor is positive one factor is 
,,negative what's this value 50 50 times what's the difference difference is 6 plus 7 13 so 16 50 times 16 so take 0 and multiply by 5 5 times 6 33 remaining 5 times 1 5 5 + 3 8 so the answer is 800 example number 7 you get fractions but don't worry you can write it as a square term how can I write this fraction as a square term I can write x over 2 whole thing square once is a square number 9 you can write 3 square then this is difference between two squared terms so what are the factors you can write x over 2 minus 1 over 3 or x over 2 plus example 8 1 minus so I can write 1 squared 4 1 how can I write this one as a square term 3x over 4 whole thing squared because 16 is 4 times 4 and 9 is 3 times 3 difference between two squared terms one one the other term is 3x over for one term is positive one term is negative exercise 6.3 factorize the expressions given below so all these are difference between two square tiles hundred is 10 square so you can write one is positive and the other one is negative again this one right as a square that's six squared one factor is positive and the other factor is negative what about this one 9 squared is 
,,81 we can write as one factor positive the other factor negative here 4 + B squared 4 I can write 2 squared apply difference between two square terms one factor positive the factor negative this one four squared and a square one factor is positive and the other factor is negative you can write the negative 1 first as well 64 is 
,,8 squared when you write down the two factors you get this one is positive the other one is negative all these are two terms and we can see square terms will try to 
,,factorize here already this one is a square term this one you have to rewrite as a square term like this now apply the factor rule one factor is positive the other factor is negative this one you have to write both as a square term first and write down one factor positive the other one negative hundred this is square number I can write an X whole thing squared + 1 s1 square so what are the factors 10 X plus 1 and X minus 1 here 25 is 5 square this is already there so what are the factors 5m + n 5m - 49 is 7 square a t-bar you can write 9p whole thing square after you write down as a square term only you can write down the factors so 7 + 9 p 7 - 9 P this one I can't write 5 a bead whole thing square this is 3c whole thing square now write down 5 a b +3 c 5a b minus 3 c miscellaneous exercise factorize the following algebraic expressions by changing the order in which the terms appear as required yeah because we can't factorize these two so we need to change will change these two X minus BX minus a y plus B Y now take two at a time X out you get a minus B here I can take minus y out eight minus B your - - here plus a minus B is common you 
,,get X minus y as the other factor now look at this one what can you see yeah like terms are there so you don't need to take two terms apparel here but rice here first will simplify 9 P plus 3 P 12 P these two you get minus 8 Q now fact rice two expressions take the common term out for is come and take it out you get 3p minus 2q 
,,now we'll take this one you get trinomial quadratic expression but the order is not correct we need square term we need this one the middle term and here I'll rewrite this as square term first and X term and then the constant now multiply these 2 you get negative 12x squared find the factors of minus 12x squared to get plus one 
,,last one is negative means we take the difference difference is plus one so the larger factor is positive what are the factors four and three larger factor is positive means this is plus four and minus three now split the middle term you get this tail two at a time and here minus three out you get X plus four X minus 3 this one 
,,is the order correct no so constant term I can take this one a square term last and the middle term minus 3 K now when you multiply first and last you get minus o K 
,,square meter term is negative means the larger factor is negative so 4 times 1 and we take the difference so minus 4 n plus 1 so 4 minus 4 K plus 1 K minus K squared now take two at a time take 4 out you give 1 minus K when you take K out this is also 1 minus K so 1 minus K is come on you can write down o plus K as the other factor question number 2 factorize the following algebraic expressions two terms are there so T is not a square number so we'll take the common factor out what's the common factor to take it out so you get 4x squared minus 25 now 25 and 4 both are squared numbers I can rewrite as a square times 5 squared is 25 now I can write down 
,,the 2 factors as 2 X is the first term 5 is the other 1 is positive the other one is negative this one 3 I can take it out what's in answer here keep on now 81 is a 
,,square number that's 9 square now you can write down as difference between two squared terms X minus 9 and X plus 9 this one take the common term out is common I can it be is common for that common so what's remaining is squared B squared here one is remaining no I can write this one as a B whole thing squared + 1 square 1 squared is 1 now apply difference between two squared terms a B plus one a B this one you can take three out one minus four Q square now you can apply difference between 
,,"two square terms 1 squared is 1 - Q whole thing squared is 4 Q squared now write down the two factors 1 plus 2 Q 1 minus 2 Q find the value so we can use factorization to find these values because all these are square terms so we'll apply the formula difference between two square terms one means positive one is negative 23 + 3 26 here you get 20 put 0 and x - 2 times 6 12 2 times 2 4 + 1 5 here 45 + 5 + 45 - 5 are the factors 45 + 5 is 50 45 minus 5 is 40 so when you multiply you get 2,000 "
,,this 102 squared - 2 square so you can use difference between two squared terms hundred - plus 200 - - - you get 104 here here you get hundred it's easy to multiply 
,,by hundred move two places to the right so with two zeros yeah so ten thousand four hundred fourth one join each algebraic expression in column a with product off its factors in column B so we need to do separate here and find out the answer from the right hand side so we'll take the first one x squared minus X minus 6 this means one last term - means you need to get one plus and one minus middle term is - means the bigger factor is - so what are the factors last six x squared 3 n - bigger 
,,"one is - so I can write x squared - x will put 1 X so I can split the middle term 2 - 3 X and + 2 X and take two at a time get X - 3 when you take + 2 out that's X minus 3 so X minus 3 is common the other factor is x + 2 X - 3 and X plus 2 this one this one four terms so we take two at a time take two at a time X is , take it out here minus 3 is comma and take it off so what are the factors x + 5 + X - 3 yeah you get here this one two terms you can take common terms out first 2x is common when you take that you get x squared minus 4 now our difference between two squared terms so 2x is there you can write 4 as 2 squared now apply difference between two squared terms you get X plus 2 and X minus 2 where's that here so I can connect here the other one 4x squared minus 9 m squared I can rewrite as square terms 2x whole thing squared + 3 M square what are the factors to X plus 3 m 2x minus 3 where's there yeah definitely the other one is this one but this is the fraction yeah x squared over 25 you can write it as a square term x over 5 so x over 5 I'll do it here thing squared + 1 square now x over 5 plus 1 and x over 5 minus 1 it's already "
,,there so we did all so all answers are okay so we complete all factorization methods related to your textbook so what are they we did when you get common factor you 
,,can take it out that's rule number one sometimes you get expression as a commenter that's rule number two and when you have four terms you take two terms that factorize and then we did factorization trinomial quadratics and difference between two squared terms so practice with all these example and exercises to improve your knowledge in factorization

AlgebraicExpression,ffLLmV4mZwU,"Hi, Im Rob. Welcome to Math Antics. In this video, were going to learn about Polynomials. Thats a big math word for a really big concept in Algebra, so pay attention. Now before we can understand what polynomials are, we need to learn about what mathematicians call terms. In Algebra, terms are mathematical expressions that "
,,"are made up of two different parts: a number part and a variable part. In a term, the number part and the variable part are multiplied together, but since multiplication is implied in Algebra, the two parts of a term are usually written right next to each other with no times symbol between them. The number part is pretty simple its just a number, like 2 or 5 or 1.4 And the number part has an official name its called the coefficient. Now theres another cool math word that you can use "
,,"to impress your friends at parties! and then I said, Thats not my wife thats my coefficient! The variable part of a term is a little more complicated. It can be made up of one or more variables that are raised to a power. Like the variable part could be 'x squared'.  Thats a variable raised to a power. Or, the variable part could be just y. If you remember what we learned in our last video, youll realize that that also qualifies as a variable raised to a power. y is the same as y to the 1st power. But since the exponent 1 doesnt change anything, we dont need to actually show it. Or the variable part of a term could be some tricky combination of variables that are raised to powers, like x squared times y squared. or a times b squared times c cubed. Terms can have any number of variables like that, but the good news is that most of the time, youll only need to deal with terms that have one variable. or maybe two in complicated problems. Oh, and "
,,"theres one thing I should point out before we move on if you have a term like 6y, even though it would be fine to do the multiplication the other way around and write y6, its conventional to always write the number part of the term first and the variable part of the term second. Okay, so thats the basic idea of a term. But theres a little more to terms that well learn in a minute. First, lets see how this basic idea of a term helps us understand the basic idea of a polynomial. A polynomial is a combination of many terms. Its kind of like a chain of terms that are all linked together using addition or subtraction. The terms themselves contain multiplication, but each term in a polynomial must be joined by either addition or subtraction. And polynomials can be made from any number of terms joined together, but there are a few specific names that are used to describe polynomials with a certain number of terms. If theres only one term (which isnt really a chain) then we call it a monomial because the prefix mono means one. If there are just two terms, then we call it a binomial because the prefix bi means two, and if there are three terms, then we call it a trinomial since the prefix tri means three. Beyond three terms, we usually just say polynomial since poly means many, and in fact, its common to simply use the term polynomial even when there are just 2 or 3 terms. Okay, so thats the basic idea of a polynomial. Its a series of terms that are joined together by addition or subtraction. Now, lets see a typical example of a polynomial that will help us learn a little more about terms:  3 x squared plus x minus 5 How many terms does this polynomial have? Well, based on what weve learned so far, youre probably not quit sure. If the terms are the parts that are joined together by addition or subtraction, then this should have three terms, but it looks like theres something missing with the last two terms. This middle term is missing its number part, and this last term is missing its variable part. That doesnt seem to fit with our original definition of a term.  Whats up with that? Well, the middle term is easy to explain. There really is a number part there, but its just 1. Do you remember how 1 is always a factor of any number? But, since multiplying by 1 has no effect on a number or variable, we dont need to show it. So, if you see a term in a polynomial that has only a variable part, you know that the number part (or coefficient) of that term is just 1. Okay, but what about this last term thats missing its variable part? Well, thats a little trickier. Do you remember in our last video about exponents in Algebra, we learned that any number or variable thats raised to the 0th power just equals 1? That means we can think of this last term as having a variable x thats being raised to the 0th power. Since that would always just equal 1, its not really a variable in the true sense of the word, and it has no effect on the value of the term. But it makes sense, especially if you remember the other rule from the last video. That rule says that any number raised to the 1st power is just itself, which helps us see that this middle term is basically the same as 1x raised to the 1st power. Now do you see the pattern? Each term has a number part and each term has a variable part that is raised to a power: 0, 1 and 2. But since x to the 0 is just 1, and x to the 1 is just x, and anything multiplied by 1 is just itself, the polynomial gets simplified so that it no longer looks exactly like the pattern it comes from. Oh, and this last term the one that doesnt have a truly variable part its called a CONSTANT term because its value always stays the same. Alright Now that you know what a Polynomial is, lets talk about an important property of terms and polynomials called their degree. Now that might sound like the units we use to measure temperature or angles, but the degree were talking about here is different. The degree of a term is determined by the power of the variable part. For example, in this term, since the power of the variable is 4, we say that the degree of the term is 4, or that its a 4th degree term. And in this term, the power of the variable is 3, so its a 3rd degree term. Likewise, this would be a 2nd degree term and this would be a 1st degree term. Oh, and I suppose you could call a term with no variable part a zero degree term, but its usually just referred to as a constant term. Things are a little more complicated when you have terms with more that one variable. In that case, you add up the powers of each variable to get the degree of the term. Since the powers in this term are 3 and 2, its a 5th "
,,"degree term because 3 + 2 = 5. Okay, but why do we care about the degree of terms? Well, its because polynomials are often referred to by the degree of their highest term. If a polynomial contains a 4th degree term (but no higher terms), then its called a 4th degree polynomial. But if its highest term is only a 2nd degree term, then its called a 2nd degree polynomial. Another reason that we care about the degree of the terms is that it helps us decide the arrangement of a polynomial. We arrange the terms in a polynomial in order from the highest degree to the lowest. ya know, cuz, mathematicians like to keep things organized [mumbeling] nice lets seedouble check Perfect! For example, this polynomial (which has 5 terms) should be rearranged so that the highest degree term is on the left, and the lowest degree term is on the right. But of course, not every polynomial has a term of every degree. This is a 5th degree polynomial, but it only has 3 terms. We should still put them in order from highest to lowest, even though it has terms that are missing. So, the 4x to the fifth should come first. And then the minus 10x. And finally, the plus 8. By the way, its totally fine for a polynomial to have missing terms like that. And its sometimes helpful to think of those missing terms as just having coefficients that are all zeros. If the coefficient of a term is zero, then the whole term has a value of zero so it wouldnt effect the polynomial at all. And speaking of coefficients What if we need to re-arrange this polynomial so that its terms are in order from highest degree to lowest degree? The highest degree term is 5x squared but before we just move it to the front of the polynomial, its important to notice that its got a minus sign in front of it. Normally when "
,,"we see a minus sign, we think of subtraction, but when it comes to polynomials, its best to think of a minus sign as a NEGATIVE SIGN that means the term right after it has a negative value (or a negative coefficient). In fact, instead of thinking of a polynomial as having terms that are added OR subtracted, its best to think of ALL of the terms as being ADDED, but that each term has either a POSITIVE or a NEGATIVE coefficient which is determined by the operator right in front of that term. For example, if you have this Polynomial, you should treat it as if all of the terms are being added together, and use the sign thats directly in front of each term to tell you if its a positive or a negative term. This first term has a coefficient of negative 4, so its a negative term. The next term has a coefficient of "
,,"positive 6, so its positive. The next term has a coefficient of negative 8, so its negative. And the constant term is just positive 2. And recognizing positive and negative coefficients helps us a lot when rearranging polynomials that have a mixture of positive and negative terms like our example here. If you think of the negative sign in front of the 5x squared term as part of its coefficient, then youll realize that when we move it to the front of the polynomial, the negative sign has to come with it. It has to come with it because its really a NEGATIVE term. If we dont bring the negative sign along with it, well be changing it into a positive term which would actually change the value of the polynomial. And in addition to helping us re-arrange them, treating a polynomial as a combination of positive and negative terms will be very helpful when we need to simplify them, which just so happens to be the subject of our next basic Algebra video. Alright, weve learned a LOT about polynomials in this video, and if youre a little overwhelmed, dont worry it might just take some time for it all to make sense. Remember, you can always re-watch this video a few times, and doing some of the practice problems will help it all sink in. As always, thanks for watching Math Antics,"

AlgebraicExpression,fUOdon3y1hU,algebraic expressions and equations good day students welcome back to my classroom for today's lesson you are going to learn how to differentiate expression from equation translate variable expressions and equations into algebraic expressions and equations and vice versa and lastly identify a variable in non-algebraic expression and equation let us begin let's cover brain exercise let's take a look at this one we have the sum of eight and nine can you translate this into a numerical expression great job we have here the keyword sum which represents addition this means that we need to add eight and nine so that is eight plus nine and this is an example 
,,of a numerical expression next one we have the sum of four and a number again our keyword here is sum which means addition this means that we need to add 4 and a number here we do not know the value of a number therefore we are going to represent it by a letter let's say letter n so that is four plus n this is an example of algebraic expression next one we have the sum of four and the number is seven again our keyword here is the word sum which means addition and we need to add four and a number which is four plus n and the word is represents equal sign therefore four plus n is equal seven this is an example of algebraic equation now do you know what is the difference between algebraic expression and equation let's go and take a look let us discuss the differences between expression and equation in algebraic expression it is a mathematical phrase for example we have this sum of 4 and a number and as we can see this is not a complete sentence while the algebraic equation is a 
,,mathematical sentence for example we have the sum of four and the number is seven another one is algebraic expression has no equal sign while in algebraic equation it has equal sign which represented by the word is lastly in an expression a value of the letter or the symbol can change for example here we have 4 plus n we can say that the value of n is 5 so that would be four plus five or we can say that the volume n here is nine so that would be four plus nine or let us say it is equal to so that would be four plus two on the other hand in algebraic equation the value of the letter or the symbol cannot be changed it has a fixed volume or fixed answer here n four plus n equals seven we cannot say that the value of n is nine as it will not say that the equation is correct if we say that the value of n here is two the equation would be wrong what if we say that the value of n here is three or plus three equals 7 and that is the correct value of m wonderful now that you know the 
,,differences let's move on to the parts of algebraic expression the first one is the variable the variable is any letter or symbol that represents a number here the variable is letter x the next one is the coefficient the coefficient is the constant value used with the variable it is the factor or the number being multiplied to a variable here the coefficient is two we can always find the coefficient before the variable the next one is the constant the constant is the fixed value that does not change here the constant is number five and lastly we have the term the term is a number or variable a product or quotient of a number and variables separated by 
,,plus or minus sign here in a given example we have the plus sign and it separates two terms which are 2x and 5 remember that addition and subtraction only separate terms while division and multiplication do not separate terms now that you already know the parts and the differences between equation expression let us go and translate some verbal expressions here we have a number plus 3 first one that you need to know is what is the missing here the missing here is a number this means that we 
,,are going to represent it by a variable any letter that we would like to let's say i want letter m the next keyword here would be the word plus which means edition so that is m plus three so our algebraic expression here is m plus three now let's have another example we have the sum of a number and three again let's take a look 
,,for some keywords here the keywords that we have is the word sum which means addition therefore we need to add a number which can be represented by a variable let's 
,,say letter m and the number 3 so that is m plus 3 very good let's have another one we have m increased by 3 here we already have a variable which is m so let us write m next we have the keyword increase by increase by represents addition so that would be a plus sign and lastly the number three next one we have three added to m so again we already have a variable which is m and we need to add 3 to it so that is m plus 3 next one we have 3 more than m again our variable here is m and the word more than represents addition and we have three so that is m plus three now let us identify which are the variables coefficient constant and the number of terms here in our given algebraic expression the variable here is the letter which is and very good next one let us take a look for the coefficient again the coefficient is the number that we see before the variable as we can see there is no number before a variable here but it doesn't mean that we do not have a coefficient remember that a coefficient is a factor or a number multiplied to a variable all variables that do not have a number beforehand has a coefficient of one because it means one times m which is equals m so the coefficient here is one next one the constant here is very good it is three and let's count the number of terms since this algebraic expression is separated by a plus sign or addition our terms here are m and 3. so we have two turns great job let's have another example next one we have a number minus seven again we have here a number which can be represented by a variable so let us say letter f our next keyword here is the word minus which represents subtraction and there is 7 so that is f minus seven next one we have the difference of f and seven so again let's take a look for some keywords we have different and the difference represents subtraction so we need to subtract f and seven all right let's have another example we have f decreased by seven so our variable here is f and we need to decrease this one which represents subtraction by seven next example we have seven subtracted from f so our variable here is is the letter f and we need to subtract seven from it to that will be m minus seven and lastly we have seven less than f and our variable again here is letter f and our keyword is less than which means subtraction 7 so that is f minus seven now let's identify the variable here again our variable is the letter which is very good is letter f and now let's take a look for the coefficient since there's no number before our variable here therefore the coefficient here is one next one is the constant the constant here is negative 
,,seven now let's count the number of terms so we have here minus that separates the term so we have f and seven so that is to turn all right let's go to our next example this time we have a number time two again we have here the missing value which is a number so now let's represent it by a letter let's say letter n times which means multiplication two in an algebraic expression we do not use the multiplication sign as it confuses us into a variable x instead of using the multiplication sign the number we just simply combine the number and the variable so that would be 2 n next example we have twice of n here our variable is n and our keyword is the word to white which means to time so that is two times n therefore that is to n on to our next example we have n multiplied by two here our variable is letter n and our keyword is multiplied by two so we need to multiply n by two so that would be two n next one we have the double of n here our keyword again is double which means times two so we need to times two the letter n so that is two n all right next one we have the product of n and two so our variable here is n and our keyword is product which is the answer for multiplication this means that we need to multiply n and 2 so that is 2 m now let us identify the variable the variable here obvi is the letter and while the coefficient is 2 as it is the number before the variable next one is the constant as we can see we do not have a constant here while the number of terms since there's no addition or subtraction that separates the term we only have one term now let's move on to our next example next one we have a number divided by five again we have the missing volume which is a number so let us represent this by a variable f and we need to divide this by five so we can write this as n divided by five next one we have the quotient of n and phi so again our keyword here is equation which means division so it means that we need to divide n and five so that is n divided by five next one we have one fifth of n so it means that we need to multiply one and n so that is one-fifth n but it can also be written as n over five okay next one we have the ratio of n to five our variable here is n and our clue word here is the ratio we all know that we can represent ratio by a fraction so 
,,that would be n is to five or n over five which also means and divided by five now our variable here is the letter n while the coefficient here is one fifth as this 
,,is the factor or the number being multiplied to the variable n next one is the constant here we cannot see a constant so that would be zero or not well the number of terms since there's no addition or attraction with separate t terms this means that we only have one term great job now that you already know some basics this time 
,,let's try to translate a verbal expression with more than one operation into algebraic expression let's have our first example six more than twice a number so again 
,,we need to take a look for some clues in order for us to translate this one so our clue word here as we can see we have two white a number and we all know that that 
,,means two times a number or a variable so we can say that is two a and next one we have six more than and that is plus six so therefore our expression here is two a 
,,plus six wonderful now let's identify the variable here is a good job well the coefficient here is 2. next one the constant is 6 and we have here two terms which are two a and six let's have another example this time we have 18 less than half a number now let's take a look for some favorite we have here 18 less than and we all know that lessons mean subtract so that is minus eight next one we have have a number and that means one half times a number or a variable so that would be one half y now if we combine them together we have one half y minus eight so that is 18 less than half a number so here our variable is y well the coefficient here is one half well the constant is negative 18 or minus 18. and the number of terms here are two that is one-half y and eighteen now let's have another example we have one plus twice a number is ten so our first clue right here is to rise a number and that means three times a variable so we can say it is to re b next one we have one plot and that means plus one if we combine that together we have three b plus one and we still have more to translate here we have the word estet which means that equals ten so that is three b plus one equals ten so here we have the variable b while the coefficient here is three the constants are one and ten and the number of terms here are three which are three b one and ten this time let us translate an expression into a verbal or word sentences or phrases here we have b plus eight divided by two so first we have b plus eight we can write this one as the sum of b and eight and next we have divided by two so that would be divided by two now we have the sum of b and eight divided by two wonderful let's have another example here we have three n plus 25 equals 31. first let's try to translate plus 25. we can translate this 
,,one as 25 added two but i will use 25 added two next we have three n this means that three times n but we can also say to rise of n and lastly we have equals 31 which means s31 so now we have 25 added tutorials of n is 31. good job students you made it this far now here are the things that you learned today you

AlgebraicExpression,Qs35Zdho4gI,good morning grades and welcome to worksheet cloud maths my name is Joe Milligan I hope you're all well today and I wish you a very happy birthday and remember although today is officially birthday birthday should be every day for us because we should be looking after our environment every single day right we're going to go into algebraic expressions today we sorry algebraic equations today we have already done algebraic expressions and the difference is that now we're going to look at how 
,,to keep a scale balanced okay using an equation so what is the difference between an expression and an equation well an expression has an unknown value and in order 
,,to find its value you need to know what the unknown value or variable is so for example 10x plus 3 we can't do anything with it because we don't know the value of the unknown the value of the it variable which in this case is X okay X is the variable we don't know its value the expression has to stay as it is but if we get given the value say we told that their baby is 5 then we can say that 10 times 5 plus 3 and we can get the value of the whole expression which is 53 so we can evaluate the expression ok but that what is the difference an equation on the other hand can will be worked out because we are given the value of the expression so in other words the output number has been given to us and then we can manipulate the whole equation to find out what the X is but remember it has to be balanced on both sides so what you do to the one side you must do to the other side and the whole point is to get X on its own to find out what the value of x is so market said this equation needs to remain balanced so in order to work out what the X is we need to eliminate the other values equally from both sides remember if you've got a scale and you 
,,add something to one side if and not to the other side it's going to become unbalanced we need to keep this equation balanced at all times so what we do to the one side we have to do to the other side and the whole point of trying to work this out is to get X on its own so if we have a look at this step by step there's our equation we've got 10 X plus 3 is equal to 53 we want X on its own so we can find out its value so what do we do we would take away their 3 on this side but we have to do the same on the other side so there we go 10 X plus 3 minus 3 which means that we have to take away the 3 on the other side can you see we've kept it balanced if we only supply the 3 on the one side it wouldn't be balanced and the equation wouldn't work out so 10 X is then equal to 50 now we have to divide this side by 10 and that side by 10 so that we can have X on its own just like that can you see how we've kept the equation balanced and we're going to end up with X is equal to 5 now we mustn't just leave it there and say okay well that's that's fine X is equal to 5 let's check it ok and by checking it we're going to substitute back into the original equation so we would go can see that our answer is 5 we've said that X is equal to 5 let's put 5 back into the original equation so we've got 10 times 5 plus 3 we can see that it's going to be 53 but let's just go through the motions okay 10 times 5 is 50 plus 3 is 53 it works well done right let's look at another one together and this time we're going to be starting from a given statement in other words a word statement so the statement is a number added to 85 is 90 we now need to make 
,,up a an equation from that and there's your equation X plus 85 is equal to 90 now remember we want to leave X on its own so in order to do that we're going to say 85 minus 85 on the side but we have to do the same on this side to keep it balanced and X is equal to 5 how do we check we then subs back in five in place of X so 5 plus 85 is equal to 90 90 and 90 balanced our scale is balanced so yummy we've got it right that means that X is equal to five that is correct okay now you try one and then we'll go over together there's your once you try pause the video work it out on a piece of paper and then we'll go over it together right how did you do that would be X divided by 4 so divide a number by 4 to get to 12 X divided by 4 is equal 12 we've now got to try and get rid of the X on this side sorry not the X we're going to get rid of the other values so that X stays on its own and in order to do that we will use the inverse operation or the opposite operation so what's opposite to divide it would be multiply what we do on the one side we do on the other side because we have to keep the bell of the scale balanced so X divided by 4 times 4 and then we have to do the same on the other side 12 times 4 so what are we going to get X is equal to 48 okay now we check it by substituting we're going to put 48 in the place of the X 48 divided by 4 what is that equal 12 12 is on the other side yay it works scale is balanced which means that 48 is correct 48 is the value of X right if you have some more to try you can write these down try them on a piece of paper pause the video and then we'll go over them one by one together but how did you do let's have a look at the first one twice a number is a hundred so we've got 2 X is equal to 100 how do we get rid of the 2 it's 2 times X so we must divide by 2 which means we have to do the same to the other side 2x divided by 2 is equal to 100 divided by 2 which means that X is equal to 50 let's substitute in to check 
,,that it rat 2 times 50 is equal to a hundred right there we go our scale is balanced we've got it right which means that the 50 is the correct answer of X remember that this is not the answer for X that is your double check this means that that is the answer for X if that is correct what you've done in this section means that you have got it right if you are confident and you don't need to do a substitution that's fine but if you're a little bit weary and the answer doesn't look quite right substitute it back in to double-check yourself it's look at number two half a number is 15 right we've got 1/2 X is equal to 15 what we need to do now the inverse of that 1/2 would be to times it by 2 remember half X is the same as x over 2 or X divided by 2 okay so we would go 1/2 x times 2 is equal to 15 times 2 because we've got to keep that scale balanced which means that X is equal to 30 okay substitute it back in half 30 its equal to 15 both sides of the scale are balanced therefore 
,,you are at and X is actually 30 number 3 let's see how you did yeah 4 plus a number is 23 4 plus X is equal to 23 would be your equation again we've got a positive 4 there which means we have to take 4 away on that side of the X on the left hand side we have to take far away on the right hand side 2 so there we go 4 plus X minus 4 is equal to 23 minus 4 so these two fours would then disappear and you would have this to work out on this side so X is equal to 19 it's put 19 back into substitute we just want to make sure every single time that a scale is balanced 4 plus 19 that gives you 23 23 is the same on the other side you've got it right which means 
,,that X is equal 2:19 let's look at the last one 93 editor number is minus three Brad 93 plus X is equal to minus three it's remember get rid of the 93 on that side which means we have to do the same to the other side so what we do to the left hand side has to be the same as the right hand side so we've got 93 plus X minus 93 which is equal to -3 minus 93 so it's going to be X is equal to minus 96 that doesn't look quite right so let's check it 93 minus 96 is equal to minus 3 that means 93 minus 96 is minus 3 which is the same as on this side so even though it looked a bit funny it is correct you have dealt with negative numbers so this shouldn't be too much of a mission means that X is minus 96 and that is correct okay right let's go one step further this is a bit of a challenge because now we're going to introduce unknown values to both sides of the equation so you can also have variables on either side of the equal sign for example in X minus 7 is equal to 5x plus 3 maybe it looks a little bit daunting to you maybe it looks a little bit difficult but let's just use the same things that we've done all the time and let's work through it 
,,carefully so the first thing we need to get all our variables onto the same side of the equation and all the constants onto the other side but we will do it step-by-step as you go along and you get used to this you can do it order in one step but let's try to step by step for now right we've got 10 X minus 7 minus 5 X can you see we've taken the variable across but we're going to do minus five X because on this side we did minus five X to get rid of that 5x there so we're going to be left just with the constant okay so we've got 5x minus 7 because 10x minus 5x gives me 5x keep the minus 7 we haven't done anything with that and we've got a three left there now we've got to get 5x on its own we're used to working with something that looks like this so we've got it take away the seven by adding on seven and we'll add on seven to that side okay so all our constants to the other side there we can see minus seven plus seven is going to give us naught but we have to add on seven to 
,,keep our scale balanced so we're going to end up with tune on the side and 5x on the other side we're not yet finished we need to have X on its own so how do we get 
,,X on its own we're going to divide by five here which means we have to divide by five on that side just like that so we're going to end up with X on its own and X is equal to two so I think a good thing would be to substitute because that was quite a long process let's make sure it works okay 10x minus seven is equal to five x plus three we've got a substitute for both values of X not just the one so we're going to substitute two in here we're going to substitute two in there and we're going to get 10 times two hundred seven and five times two plus three let's see we've got 20 minus 7 and 10 plus 3 and we're going to get 13 on both sides it works see if that is balanced then it means that that is correct okay let's try another one together 9 minus X is equal to 2x plus 3 we've got to get all our X's on one side and all our constants on the other side so let's add on X to the side and we'll have to add on X to that side which means that we're going to be left with 9 on the left-hand side and 3 X because we've got 2x plus X on the right-hand side but we haven't done anything with that plus 3 yet so let's try and move that to the other side so that all our constants are on the same side which means that we'll do u minus 3 here and we'll do a minus 3 on that side we're going to end up with 6 on the left-hand side and 3 X on the right-hand side divide this by 3 divide that by 3 and you're going to get X is equal - it doesn't matter whether your ex is on the right hand side or the left hand side you've got it as being equal to two - check they'd substitute in 9 - x equals 2x plus 3 remember we have to substitute and for both X's so we're going to get 9 minus 2 is equal to 2 times 2 plus 3 9 minus 2 7 2 times 2 is 4 plus 3 7 is equal to 7 yay we've got it right now we need to try these you need to try these on your own you can pause the video try those on a piece of paper and we will go over them together right let's have a look how did you do the first one 5 X plus 3 is equal to 9 minus X can you see we have taken that X across by adding it onto the side and you add it onto that side then we get so then we will get 6 X plus 3 is equal to 9 can you see how that has just made that X disappear and we've taken across to this side okay we now have to take that constant and put it 
,,on the right-hand side so to do that we're gonna say plus 3 minus 3 we're going to end up with 6x there then that we'd have to say minus 3 that we did it there and 9 minus 3 is 6 and X is equal to 1 okay let's see by substitution we take the one we're going to put it back into our original equation by substituting it 5 times 1 plus 3 is equal to 9 minus 1 5 plus 3 is 8 9 minus 1 is 8 yay it's right that means that X is equal to 1 okay the next one 2x plus 3 is equal to X plus 4 2x plus 3 minus 3 X plus 4 minus 3 can you see we've kept the scale balanced completely we've got 2x on its own and X plus 1 on the other side that means we need to take that X 
,,away we need to put it on this side so what if we - at yeah we've gotta - it there so we've got one left on this side and X left on that side I think that tickles a 
,,little bit premature but let's have a look by substituting it in we're going to take the 1 we can substitute it in 2 times 1 + 3 substituted in on the side 1 + 4 2 times 1 is 2 2 + 3 is equal to 5 and we have got a balanced scale which means that your X is correct let's look at the next one right 10 - 3 X is equal to 3x - 2 10 we've got to get rid of the 3x on this side let's take it across because it is a negative so then it becomes a positive and it's much easier to work with it's not saying you can't work with a negative but let's take the negatives across to this side okay so we're going to try and take that across we're going to say minus 3x plus 
,,3x and we've got 2 plus 3x on that side as well so we left with 10 on the left-hand side 6 6 X because it's 3x plus 3x over here but we still got -2 it's try and get our constants to the right side and so in order to do that we've got to add on to here which means we add on to there which means we have 12 on the left-hand side 6x on the right-hand side we've got to get X on its own how do we do that we divide by 6 on the right hand side divided by 6 on the left hand side and we're going to 
,,end up with 2 is equal to X let's have a look if we can substitute does that work 10 minus 3 times 2 which is going to be giving me 10 minus 6 and on this side it's 
,,4 yeah we've got 3 times 2 minus 2 which is 6 minus 2 it's for array that is right okay remember again just to go over it again this is not your answer for 6 this is your double check to make you sure that your scale is balanced that would be your answer to X if this is balanced then X is right U of X is right okay let's look at the next one three X minus two is equal to X plus 4 3 X minus 2 minus X we're going to take that X away from here so there we've - turd and we've - to check keep the scale balanced remember we end up with 4 on the right-hand side and 2 X minus 2 on the left-hand side so now we've got to get rid of this - we're going to add it to the left-hand side and add it to the right-hand side we're going to end up with 2x is equal to 6 we want X on its own so forgot 2x we've got it divided by 2 and divide that by 2 divide the right-hand side by 2 X is equal to 3 if you're not sure if it's right if you 100% sure that it is right then you can leave it there if you're not sure it's right check by substitution yeah we've taken our 3 we've put it back into our original equation into the right places 3 times 3 is 9 9 minus 2 is 7 
,,on the left hand side 3 plus 4 is 7 on the right hand side if balance says yay X is equal to 3 right guys thank you for watching the video thank you for being part of worksheet card have a wonderful day further and remember to celebrate Earth Day see you next time

AlgebraicExpression,1_DSMABQZbk,if you are a student and struggling with
,,math if Math super difficult for you if math comes in your nightmare then
,,you are on a right place because this video is going to change your whole student life
,,after watching this video you will be solving that super easily like Albert
,,Einstein in the next couple of minute I am going to share with you that mindset
,,of every successful mathematician who created history in mathematics that
,,mindset is the key ingredient to solve math like a piece of cake I got 97 out
,,of hundreds in my 12th math exam and now you will also score obove 90 just by
,,learning that mindset which is required to solve any math problem first you have to
,,commit something to your self this is very important without this the video
,,will be a waste for you now allows you to yourself that math is easy for me yes
,,say it again I want to hear you louder more louder no matter who is near to you
,,don't feel shy if you didn't do this you will go back to your old life where math
,,is like a demon so do not care about anybody nobody is going to come and
,,change your life only you can change your life so say this loudly to yourself
,,that math is easy for me I can solve math easily Math is a piece of cake for
,,me why this is important I will give you answer this is
,,important to take off the wrong mindset wrong programming in your mind and
,,filling it with positiveness like Math is easy for you once you really believe
,,in this then you are on a right track it's not pause this video and go in
,,front of a mirror and say this to yourself
,,till you believe this from your within from your deepest heart that math is easy for me then play this video I will be
,,always here so if you are ready completely ready let's begin first I
,,will talk about the most toxic mindset to solve math whenever a math
,,problem comes to the most of the people first they get frightened and say oh my
,,god this question is so big this question is
,,super difficult for me I can never solve this question huh where is the formula
,,how I will solve this what will happen blah blah but you now you won't say this
,,because you just change your mindset and then suddenly they will open a help
,,book in which the solution of that question is already given and they will try to
,,copy the solution from there after that they will cram the solution from there
,,and cramming math is the most worst thing you can do about your math so
,,never cram Math or if they do not find a help book what will they do they will
,,find a similar question in which the solution is given and they will try to
,,do the same in that question and it doesn't matter that done is right or not
,,if the answer is right what you have learnt from that question nothing just cramming
,,copying etc so never do this this will only make your math
,,difficult for you and the more you do this the more you will get stuffed in
,,this because this is like a spider dance so never do this because the question
,,will only increase and cramming will not solve this now the time has come in
,,which I will talk about that mindset I call it the learning + solution
,,oriented mindset in which you focus on learning trying to learn something from
,,the question and you focus on finding the solution of that question by
,,focusing on the problem you have given first let me give you a tip for solving
,,every math problem in your math book first make a list of all the formulas
,,which are going to be used in that particular chapter you are going to
,,solve this is a proven method to solve math problems if you have a list of
,,formulas which can be used in that problem
,,this makes math super easy for you so always before starting a chapter make a
,,list of all the formulas which are going to be used in that chapter for example
,,if you are going to solve trigonometry then make a list of all the formulas
,,which are going to be used in it now you will say that I hardly remember any math
,,formula it is so hard to remember them and I know but no problem with this
,,mindset you will automatically start memorizing all the formulas in your math
,,book without doing any effort if you practice what I say now you have a math
,,problem and a number of formulas to solve that problem now how will you know
,,which formula is right for the problem the answer is to read the problem
,,carefully this is the first and the most important step to solve math problem
,,most people never do this they never read the problem carefully they do this
,,this question is of this chapter they solve it like this I will solve it like
,,this I will copy this oh I didn't got the right answer oh no math is so difficult
,, for me ask yourself do you ever read a math question carefully ever
,,without starting to solve the problem if so first read the question and then
,,you will know that formula automatically which is going to be used in that
,,problem because you have a list of particular formulas which are going to
,,be used in that chapter then do not suddenly start solving the problem first
,,think in your mind how will I get from these value in the question to the one
,,value of the answer I have to use the formulas which I have what to do think
,,use your mind this will make math super interesting it is
,,like solving the puzzle game you have given a puzzle and you have some patterns
,,and some formulas to solve the problem and you have to get to the answer to the
,,goal so how will you solve the problem think in your mind but I have to do what
,,I have to change the values I have to change these numbers to this and then
,,apply this formula make it super interesting in your mind and then start
,,solving the problem lets say you got a wrong answer you try tried again you again got the wrong answer no problem you have to try again
,,always remember Einstein said I am not intelligent I just stay with the problem
,,longer than other people so the longer you will be with  the problem the more
,,chances that you will solve the problem correctly and at last you will get
,,the right answer yess you just solved a math problem on
,,your own without any help book Congrats now you have to open a helpbook and see if
,,your solution is right and learn from your mistake you did in the  previous
,,question basically this is learning learning from your mistakes this will
,,make your brain more sharper now you just solved a math problem on your own
,,what do you think you did ?you made billions of connections in your mind you
,,are using a trial and error method and constantly learning from your tries and
,,by this you will start memorizing formulas easily because you will take up
,,a formula and apply that in your question and this automatically memorizes
,,formulas I tried this and all the math formulas just stamps in my mind if you
,,practice this that you can solve any question in that chapter remember
,,Einstein said imagination is more powerful than knowledge
,,if you don't memorize formulas no matter but you should have a mind which is
,,required to solve that problem a mind which has full of imagination that how
,,you can get to the answer so next time when your teacher give you a homework of
,,a question and try to use this method in this method will math super
,,interesting for you and it will be like playing a videogame and please do not
,,go back to what you were when you open this video because there is no other way
,,to solve math more easy than this there are lots of other videos which tell how
,,to solve math easily how to become a genius etc etc but there is no other way
,,they will give you tips routines etc like I also gave you a routine but
,,you have to stick with something something in this video or in any other
,,video ok so take a simple thing and stick with it like if you say I do not want
,,to do all this from tomorrow just do a simple thing like making a list of all
,,the formulas in your chapter this will change something and you just ask
,,growing so slow and steady wins the race now you know the way the single key to
,,success in mathematics if you follow this getting above 90 is a piece of
,,cake for you now let's get something practical we will take a universal math
,,problem of seven standards so that everybody can understand it and will
,,apply this method to solve that problem if you are a high standard student than
,,see how I will solve that problem and apply the same method in your math problems
,,this will clear this concept to you more so let begin take a look at this simple
,,math question this is the seventh standard math question i took this
,,question so that everybody can understand the mindset better in this
,,question you are asked to find the volume of the cylinder of height five
,,centimeters and radius two cm this this is a cylinder of height 5
,,centimeters and radius 2 centimeters for high standard student just assume this
,,as a demonstration of that mindset I will apply that mindset in this question
,,to find the answer let's say we have a chapter in which we can find two types
,,of questions first is the volume of the cylinder and second is the surface area
,,of cylinders and we have new to all this and we don't know which formula of
,,volume and this formula of surface area so assume that this is happening and now
,,we will apply the method to solve that problem so first step is to read the
,,problem carefully in this problem we have to find the volume of cylinder of
,,height 5 centimeter and radius 2 centimeter for high standard students
,,they will say that all this question is super easy this is of volume formula we have to chunk in these values and finds answer but no this is just a
,,demonstration take it as a demonstration and use the
,,same method in your difficult question so we have these two values first is
,,height and second is radius of cylinder now let us write  first what is the
,,radius of cylinder radius or cylinder equal to 2 cm and height of cylinder is equal to five centimeters so we have
,,these two values and we have to get from these two values to the one value of the
,,volume how do we get there we have to use one formula one formula of the
,,volume we do what we have to do so first we have to know which formulas is of
,,volume at which formula is of surface area so how do we know that see
,,what is the area of circle that means all this what is the area of circle that
,,is PI R square right so we have the area of circle this and if we
,,multiply it by the height which is this then we will have a circle stacked on
,,each other to five centimeter height and then we will have the volume so we know
,,that this formula is of volume and for surface area tell me the parameter of
,,circle that is 2 PI R right and if we have hollow circle stacked on each other
,,to 5 centimeters then we will have the surface area of cylinder so we know that
,,volume of cylinder is this and we will apply this in our question so volume of cylinder so the volume of
,,cylinder which is this formula and we will apply that in our question that is
,,PI R squared H so we first have chunk in the value okay so let's chunk in the
,,value Phi is three point one four multiplied by r square which is 2 and 2 square
,,equal to 4 multiply by h which is height which is 5 centimeter and now this is equal to 62.8 centimeter cube never forget to add the unit after the value in math    
,,this is also very important tip for math so we just read the question carefully
,,knew which formulas to be applied first thought what we have to do and then did it
,,and found the answer and this is how you should always solve a math question hope

AlgebraicExpression,Kzj0B8VUXC8,today we're at a car manufacturing factory and what you see here are different parts of a car he has an engine the gearbox the headlights the mirrors and the brakes 
,,all these and many more parts are put together to make a car but each of these parts is also made up of smaller parts for example the engine consists of a spark plug piston piston rings crankshaft connecting rod sump and valves so basically many small parts are put together to form bigger parts and the bigger parts are put together to manufacture a car are you wondering where the algebra is in all of this well forming algebraic expressions is just like putting together parts of a car let's 
,,see how here's an algebraic expression an algebraic expression is a mathematical phrase that contains ordinary numbers variables like X or Y and mathematical operators like add subtract multiply or divide this expression consists of three parts 5x y 3y and 7 parts of an expression which are formed separately and then put together with operators like addition or subtraction are known as terms so 5x y 3y and 7 are the terms of this expression these terms are formed by multiplying variables and numbers let's look at the term 5x y this term is made up of a number five and variables x and y then we have 3y which is a product of 3 and Y and finally we have 7 which is a constant term as it has no variables the smaller parts like 5 x and y in a term 5 X Y are called factors so factors combine to form a term and terms are 
,,put together to form an algebraic expression we can see that one of these factors may be a number like five and the others could be variables like x and y the number is called the numerical coefficient or just coefficient of the term while the variables are called the algebraic factors hence we can say that in 5 X Y 5 is the coefficient of the term and X and y are the algebraic factors do you know there are two types of terms in an algebraic expression when terms have the same algebraic factors they are called like terms for example in this expression the factors of 2 XY are two x and y and the factors of 5 XY are 5 x and y since they have the same algebraic factors that is x + y - x y + 5 XY are called like terms on the other hand negative 7 x + 4 y have different factors x and y so they are called unlike terms if an expression contains only one term it is called a monomial for example negative 7 XY 8 z 2 x if an expression contains two unlike terms it is called a binomial for example 3x plus 4y or 4 XY plus 2z an expression which contains 3 unlike terms is called a trinomial for example 2x + 3 XY plus 7y in general an expression with one or more unlike terms is called a polynomial therefore a monomial binomial and trinomial are all polynomials fill that's a lot but head back to your tutor to understand more about algebraic expressions

AlgebraicExpression,PVoTRu3p6ug,hello welcome to the algebra course my name is Mike and I will be teaching you this course so what is algebra well loosely translated from its Arabic roots algebra means balancing and restoring but that's a little bit boring and and to us what does that mean so far well it means nothing really I prefer to think of algebra like all math as the mystery of the unknown and what do I mean by that well before you get to algebra you do things like adding numbers subtracting numbers multiplying dividing numbers and there's really no mystery there you're just kind of doing arithmetic you're combining numbers together in algebra we have new things called variables or unknowns that we represent with letters so for example we have something like X plus 1 equals 5 we can think of X as just standing in the place for a number what number needs to go there so there's some mystery here we're on the hunt for the number that goes in place of X well this example is not too hard if instead of X and if we had in place of ax there in that equation if we had 4 then 4 plus 1 equals 5 that's certainly true so instead of that X we need to put a 4 so what we say is that X must be equal to 4 and there we go we've solved our first algebraic equation we started with an unknown called the variable X and we found out it had to be 4 so the key idea here is that X is what's called a variable or an unknown they're synonymous and what do we need to know about variables well variables just stand in the place of a number in our example the letter X the variable stood in place of 4 also variables are usually written as letters of the alphabet in this particular 
,,example we chose the letter X but it doesn't have to be X and in fact let's see another example of an equation with a variable so how about a plus 10 equals 12 so what has to go in for a what does a stand in the place of well it's not too hard to see that if we put it to where a is then we get a true equation so a is equal to 2a a is standing in the place of the number 2 and if you really want to see that we can write this out to +10 certainly equals 12 so we can see that a really was just 
,,standing in the place of 2 and that's that's the the beginning of algebra instead of working with just numbers we start working with variables and that's a very powerful tool ok we'll see how powerful it is and we'll see lots more examples and and and really dive into this when we get into the course see that in this video we're going to talk about different types of numbers if you have to memorize the different types of numbers for a class then this is a great place to start if not then we're gonna get on the same page by just quickly reviewing these different types of numbers so we start with the natural numbers which are sometimes called the counting numbers because we start at one and we just count up from there 1 2 3 4 5 6 so on and so on until we get to a hundred a million a trillion and it just keeps going 
,,if we want to add in zero we can do that and sometimes we write that little subscript of a zero sometimes we call these the whole numbers the natural numbers with zero that's not too important now the integers have all the natural numbers they have zero and they have these negative numbers so an example of an integer is something like negative 7 now negative 7 is an integer but it's not a natural number because there's no negatives in the natural numbers on the other hand something like 20 
,,is both a natural number and an integer we can clearly count up to 20 in the natural numbers and if you look at the integers the integers include all the natural numbers one two three four five and so on now what's an example of a number that's not an integer well how about something like a fraction now when we move to the when 
,,we if we want to include all the fractions then we move to the rational numbers so for instance one-half is a rational number but it's not an integer now one-half is a rational number because if you look one is an integer in the top and two is an integer in the bottom so when we make a fraction with integers that's a rational number now can you think of any examples of a number that is both a rational number and an integer well five is both why think about it five is definitely an integer and a natural number for that for that matter but it's also a fraction because 5 is the same thing as 5 over 1 now 5 is an integer and 1 is an integer so we can write 5 as a fraction of integers so 5 is a rational number and an integer in fact all the integers are rational numbers now what about things that are not rational numbers well the square root of 2 is not a rational number but it is something called a real number so real numbers are all the rational numbers all the fractions and there are these mysterious things like the square root of 2 and the square root of 3 and numbers that we call irrational so for example 5 halves is a fraction so it's both a real number and a rational number but the square root of 2 is only a real number we'll talk more about the real numbers at the end of the video but they're really really really important they're the numbers we'll be using most often in this course finally we get to the complex numbers which are just real numbers with imaginary numbers things of the form a plus bi where a and B are real and I is the imaginary number square root of negative 1 now if this all seems if the complex numbers right now seem mysterious and weird to you don't worry about it we'll talk about it later but let's revisit the real number line for the real number so this is the 
,,real number line and it's just a continuous line of numbers you can see we have all the integers 1 2 3 and so on we also have everything in between so for example right where that Green Dot is that's perhaps the square root of 2 because the square root of 2 is approximately 1.4 1/4 and it keeps going on forever so it's just a little less than 1.5 now the interesting thing about this is that if we were to draw a number line with only rational numbers so only fractions well we already talked 
,,about the fact that the square root of 2 is not a rational number it's not a fraction so if we drew a number line with only fractions there would be hole holes in it there would be a hole where the square root of 2 goes so the real number line is really special it has this property that every number is there there's no holes or 
,,jumps or gaps and well we'll use the real number line in that sense that basically when we can think of it as all the numbers on that line the whole line is continuous and filled with numbers ok see in the next video in the last video we learned how addition and multiplication have this nice property called the commutative property now we're going to learn a new property that addition and multiplication both have and it's the associative property so addition is associative let's start with 
,,addition here so a plus B as a group plus C is the same thing as a plus the group B plus C so really it tells us something about how we're grouping addition where we write these parentheses and really it's saying it doesn't matter where we write them because they're they're the same so let's see an example nine plus three plus five and we'll do nine plus three as a group well this is equal to 9 plus the group 5 plus 3 or 3 plus 5 so 9 plus 3 is 12 plus 5 and then on the other side we're going to get 9 plus 8 12 plus 5 is 17 9 Plus 8 is 17 and so we can see the associative property an accident action doesn't matter where we put the parentheses the both 
,,sides are equal since it doesn't matter where we put the parentheses what we're gonna do is just drop them the parentheses don't tell us anything interesting so we don't need them it doesn't matter where we put them so why put them anywhere okay so that was addition multiplication is the same multiplication is associative so we 
,,write that as a times B as a group times C is equal to a times the group B times C so it's the same thing and let's see an example of this five times three as a group is equal to five times the group 3 times 2 so 5 times 3 is 15 times 2 and then on the other side we'll get 5 times 6 and 15 times 2 is 30 5 times 6 is 30 so you can see that both sides are equal if you're wondering if anything isn't associative in the next video we'll see that subtraction is not associative and we'll see how that works okay see you then we have two groups of marbles on screen 5 blue marbles and 2 red marbles and if I asked you to tell me how many total marbles marbles are there some of you might write well there's five blue ones plus two red ones so there's seven marbles in total but some of you might start counting with the red and 
,,you'd say there's two red ones plus five blue ones which still gives you a total of seven marbles so the important thing here is that five plus two is equal to two plus five it doesn't matter which order we add in because we're counting the same number of marbles and this is a really important property of addition it's called the commutative property of addition and it says that if we have any two numbers and B then a plus B is equal to B plus a so it doesn't matter which order we add two numbers in then we have something similar for multiplication so let me write some dots on screen here and I want you to count how many doubt dots there are on screen 
,,or tell me how many you don't have to count them but tell me how many dots there some of you might say well there's five groups of three here's a group of three and 
,,there's five of them so that's five groups of three or in other words five times three and so there's fifteen dots on-screen others of you might look at it a little 
,,bit differently instead of seeing five groups of three maybe you see three groups of five so here's a group of five and there's three of those so that's three times 
,,five which still gives us 15 total dots on-screen so again the important thing here is that five times three is equal to three times five and there's nothing special about five and three this works for any two numbers so this is the commutative property of multiplication and we write a times B is equal to B times a so given any 
,,two numbers you can multiply them in either order you like these two properties seem simple the commutative property of addition and the commutative property of multiplication and they are simple but they're really important so they'll be good to know okay see in the next video I want to talk to you about simplifying fractions or what's sometimes called cancelling fractions so let's start with the basics five divided by five is what it's 1 right any number divided by itself is just one so negative 1131 divided by itself again is just one what about fractions something like 3/7 divided by three sevenths well a fraction is just a number and so we're dividing it by itself so we get one what about zero zero divided by zero well this is not equal to one this is the only exception and it's because we can't divide by zero if we tried to divide by zero the the universe would split open and your mother would cry it just would be terrible so zero divided by zero is undefined and that's the only exception so we end up with this nice little rule if a is not equal to zero then a divided by itself is equal to one so what does this have to do with canceling fractions well let's see a really simple example two divided by four is the same thing as 2 times 1 divided by 2 times 2 well because we know the way fractions multiply that's the same as 2 over 2 times 1 over 2 but 2 over 2 we just talked about that's just 1 so we're left with 1 times 1 over 2 or in other words 1/2 and 1 
,,times anything is just that same so we're just left with 1/2 so it took us quite a few steps but we simplified to fourth to one half let's see another example six over twenty-seven well six is three times two and 27 is 3 times 9 and again we can split this up into two fractions so we end up with 3 divided by 3 times 2 divided by 9 the 3 over 3 that just becomes a 1 so we're left with 1 times 2 over 9 which of course is just a 2 over 9 so now this is taking a lot of writing it takes quite a 
,,few steps so maybe we want to abbreviate this we know how everything's gonna work out we're gonna end up multiplying by 1 so instead of writing out those steps we're gonna do something like this let's see it let's see this again only with an abbreviation so 6 over 27 is 3 times 2 over 3 times 9 and we know that 3 is gonna cancel to 1 so we'll just cross it out and that's an abbreviation for those steps underlined and orange and we end up with 2 ninths okay so this can actually be really useful let's combine simplifying fractions and what we're doing in this video with some things we've already learned what if we had something like 3 times 3 over 40 7 times 2 over 13 sorry at 13 times 3 over 40 7 times 2 over 13 times 47 well it looks like the 13 in the denominator there and the 13 on the Left maybe will cancel and the the 47 in the denominator and the 47 on the right might cancel so since multiplication is commutative something we've already learned we can rearrange this any 
,,way we want so we'll rearrange it this way let's put the 13s together and the 47s together also multiplication is associative which means we can group it any way we 
,,want so not let's not only put them next to each other but let's actually group them and now we know the way fractions multiply that's something we've already learned 3 times 2 over 13 is just 30 or sorry 13 times 2 over 13 it's just 13 times 2 over 13 we get something similar over on the right hand side and now we can just cancel but let's since this is our first example let's just go through one more step so 13 times 2 over 13 times 1 right 13 is the same as 13 times 1 so we'll just put that one in there and 3 times 47 is the same as 47 times 3 and 47 is the same as 47 times 1 and now we're all set to cancel so we're just left with 2 over 1 times 3 over 1 while 2 over 1 is just 2 & 3 over 1 is just 3 so this is 2 times 3 which is equal to 6 and it took those quite a few steps because I wanted to write everything out so we can see how this works but the the main point here is that we can use all of our rules to simplify that net multiplication okay what if we have addition instead of multiplication can we cancel then something like this well the answer is definitely no doing something like that is wrong you don't want to do that why not well let's see if we cancelled we'd be left with 1/3 so instead of canceling let's see what happens if we just do this addition and try and simplify so 5 plus 1 is 
,,6 5 plus 3 is 8 and then we're left with 6 is 2 times 3 8 is 2 times 4 and now we know those twos cancel and we're just left with 3/4 well 3/4 certainly is not the same thing as 1/3 if we had cancelled the 5s originally we would have gotten 1/3 but of course 3/4 does not equal 1/3 so that's just an example of why this doesn't work out it really it doesn't work out because we need to be multiplying by something over itself because when we're multiplying by something over itself we're really 
,,just multiplying by one and that's where the simplification comes from but when we have addition we don't have any multiplication so we're certainly not multiplying 
,,by one okay see you in the next video I want to talk to you about division but before we do that we should do some review of fractions so if we want to multiply two 
,,fractions a over B times C over D we just multiply across the top so a times C and then multiply across the bottom so B times D really simple multiplying fractions is really easy so let's see an example three over five times two over seven well we just get three times two in the numerator over five times seven and in the denominator so it's just six over 35 really really basic stuff let's do another example how about negative 5 over 8 times 9 over 11 well this is just negative 5 times 9 over 8 times 11 and negative 5 times 9 is negative 45 and 8 times 11 is 88 just to be thorough why don't we do one more example and then we'll talk about something different how about 1/3 times 40 over 41 well 1 times 40 is just 40 over 3 times 41 so this is 40 over 123 okay so we figured out how to multiply fractions it's really really simple but you might have a question lingering and that question is how do I multiply a number by a fraction we know how to multiply fractions by fractions but let's see an example of multiplying just a number by a fraction in integer so for example 7 times 2/3 well the key to doing this is just to remember that 7 is equal to 7 over 1 so we can turn 7 into a fraction and now we have 7 over 1 times 2 over 3 which of course is 7 times 2 over 3 times 1 which is just 3 so we have 14 thirds 14 over 3 now this comes up so often we can single it out as its own special case so we can write our own rule for a number times a fraction a times C over D is equal to a times C over D and now if we just use this rule here that we derived we'll have 7 times 2/3 is just equal to 7 times 2 over 3 which of course is 14 thirds so all we did was we skipped this step where we wrote 7 as 7 over 1 we don't need to really write that every time as long as we understand how all this works okay I hope that was a good review see in the next video I want to talk to you about subtraction subtraction is kind of nasty it has it doesn't have very many good properties that we like for instance 6 minus 2 is not equal to 2 minus 6 why because 6 minus 2 is 4 and 2 minus 6 is negative 4 so obviously 4 is not equal to negative 4 so subtraction is not commutative and the example we just gave is 6 minus 2 is not equal to 2 minus 6 there's other things wrong with subtraction for instance subtraction is not associative so an example of that would be 9 minus 4 grouped minus 1 is not equal to 9 minus parentheses 4 minus 1 and we can go through this just to prove 
,,it to ourselves 9 minus 4 is 5 minus 1 and then on the other side we have 9 well 4 minus 1 is 3 so 9 minus 3 those are not equal because 5 minus 1 is 4 and 9 minus 3 is 6 so subtraction is not associative and there's another reason subtraction is not that great but first let's just write our example down so our example here was 
,,9 minus 4 parentheses minus 1 or parentheses 9 minus 4 and parentheses minus 1 is not equal to 9 minus parentheses 4 minus 1 okay another reason that subtraction is 
,,not that great is because sometimes it can be confusing with the order of operations so for instance 10 minus 6 plus 2 maybe we're not sure should we do subtraction 
,,first or should we do the addition first so we think of the order of operations parentheses exponents multiplication division addition and subtraction and that looks like we're supposed to do addition first addition becomes where comes before subtraction so this would be 10 minus 8 which would be 2 but that's wrong that is the wrong answer what we forgot is that what the order of operations really says is then what is when you have only subtraction and addition left do everything from left 
,,to right so this is really 10 minus 6 which is 4 plus 2 which is equal to 6 and that's the right answer so the third reason subtraction isn't that great is because subtraction can be confusing with the order of operations if we're not careful in our example for this one is 10 minus 6 plus 2 but all is not lost there's something 
,,we can do we can actually turn subtraction into addition because a minus B is an abbreviation for a plus negative B so let's look at our first example how would that work well 6 minus 2 is equal to 6 plus negative 2 and now since we're doing addition we know this is commutative so we can change the order so now we have negative 
,,2 plus 6 notice in this example the negative sign stays with the 2 in our original example the negative sign went to the 6 that was the problem the negative sign was on the wrong number okay so when we think of subtraction as addition of a negative number we get commutativity back look a little note about the notation here why do we put parentheses around the negative sign it's really because doing it that way is ugly and unclear and you might even confuse somebody if you're if you're not very neat so instead what we do is we put parentheses around the negative sign so that everything is really clear if we look at this it's very clear what we mean we mean 6 plus negative 2 and now anybody looking at that will know exactly what you mean ok so that's just a note about why we put parentheses around the negative sign 
,,let's talk about what happens it with associativity when we think of subtraction as addition of a negative number well subtraction really does become associative again because we're turning it into addition so let's just look at our example here 9 minus 4 from the parentheses 9 minus 4 in parentheses minus 1 is equal to 9 plus negative 4 plus negative 1 and now this is all addition and since addition is associative it doesn't matter where we put the parentheses we could put them around the 
,,9 plus the negative 4 or we could put them around the negative 4 plus the negative 1 and why don't you try doing that at home see if you get the same answer you should because addition is associative ok and finally let's look at our third example does this fix the problem so 10 minus 6 plus 2 if we think of this as 10 plus negative 6 plus 2 now if we do the negative 6 plus the 2 first we would get negative 4 from that so 10 plus negative 4 which is equal to 6 so even though we did the negative 6 plus the 2 first we got the right answer ok so the important thing to take away from this video is that subtraction is not commutative and it's not associative but we can think of subtraction as addition of a negative number and then we get all those nice properties back okay see in the next video let's look at factoring a cubic polynomial so the way we're gonna do this is we're gonna factor by grouping and for now that's the only way we're gonna look at later on in the course we'll talk about factoring with the rational roots test and synthetic division and things like that but for now we're just gonna group it so how does that work well we group the first two terms together and then we add the second two terms the group of the second two so this will be X cubed plus 6x squared plus and then minus 4x minus 
,,24 so we haven't changed anything we just decided to group these into into pairs and now we factor out of each group while we can so on the left side we can get an x squared out of each term and that just becomes x squared times X plus 6 and then we have to add to that well what can we get out of the next term well we can give them entire negative 4 right this will be negative 4 times X minus sorry X plus 6 right because negative 4 times positive 6 becomes that negative 24 and now we have an X plus 6 multiplying both terms so we can just factor that out so this becomes x squared minus 4 x by X plus 6 and we're almost done but remember the difference of squares set if we have x squared minus a squared this is always going to be equal to X minus a times X minus B or sorry plus X plus a sorry there's no B involved X 
,,minus a times X plus a well that's what we have here is in this x squared minus 4 is the same as x squared minus 2 squared x by X plus 6 so now we can use the difference of squares to factor this completely into X minus 2 times X plus 2 times by oops sorry mr. parentheses up there times X plus 6 and now we're done this is as simple as as we can get this problem so we factored by grouping that's how we're gonna do it what happens if you have a coefficient in front of the X term so let's look at that what if we had something that looked like 3x cubed plus plus 9 x squared plus X plus 3 what are we going to do now well we're actually we're gonna do the exact same thing nothing changes so so when you have a cubic polynomial if it factors by grouping if this grouping method works it's really really quite simple so we're just going to set up our groups here and we have 3x cubed plus 9x squared plus X plus 3 well what can we factor out of out of the group on the left we can take out an entire 3x squared right and now we'll just be left with on the inside we'll be left with just an X plus 3 right and now plus well what's common 2x + 3 the only thing common to both of those actually is just the number 1 right 1 times X is still X and 1 times 3 is still 3 so we're gonna factor out of 1 it's it's really not factoring it out it's always been there but we're gonna write it just to make this more clear and now we have an x + 3 common to both terms so we factor that out so this becomes 3x squared plus one x by x plus three and that's as simple as we can get this particular problem but as you can see factoring by grouping is it makes makes these problems really easy so until we talk about the rational roots test this is the only way we're going to try and factor cubic polynomials okay see in the next video

AlgebraicExpression,49G43UkVvEM,hello grade eight children today I'm here to teach you chapter seven in your textbook that's called factors so in this lesson we'll look at what our highest common factor look at number fifteen and see what are the factors how can you write down fifteen as a product of two numbers I can write 51 times 15 again 3 times 5 or 5 times 3 same thing so these are called these numbers are called factors if a number can be written as a product of two whole numbers numbers are called factors so what 
,,are the factors of number 15 1 3 5 and 15 now we'll take another example 24 what are the factors we can write 1 times 24 2 times you divide by 2 and see what's they 
,,are the factor 24 divided by 2 you get 12 so 2 times 12 3 times 8 4 times 6 again 6 times 4 8 times 3 so these are the numbers we call factors for 24 so what are the factors 1 2 3 4 6 8 12 24 now we'll take another 136 write down all factors of 36 so you can start from 1 1 times 36 divided by 2 you get 82 times 18 36 divided by 
,,3 and C you get 12 divided by 4 that's 9 6 times 6 36 so what are the factors of 36 we can start from 1 2 3 4 6 9 12 18 and 36 so these are the factors of 36 will take 18 18 how can you write 1 times 18 2 times 9 3 times 6 or 6 times 3 9 times 2 again so what are the factors of 18 1 2 3 and then you can write 6 9 18 so factors always 1 and the number itself are factors any number when observing factors when you look at all these numbers 1 and itself yes 1 and 36 4 36 1 and 15 for 15 so you 
,,get always 1 and the number itself are factors always write down all factors of 32 1 times 32 1 times 32 32 you can write 2 times 16 4 times 8 so what are the factors 1 2 4 8 16 32 so 1 and the number self always a factor write down all factors of 21 times 22 times 10 4 times 5 so factors of 21 in 2 4 5 10 20 45 1 times 45 3 times 3 times 1 3 4 15 that's fine divided by 5 that's 9 so what are the factors 1 3 5 9 15 and 40 now we look at what are common factors write down highest common factor HC afreet stands for highest common factor of 6 and 10 so that's what we need to find now when you take 6 what are the factors we know 1 and itself always a factor then you can divide this by 2 so 2 is a factor you can divide this by 3 3 is a factor so 1 2 3 6 factors of 10 1 and itself always a factor you can divide by 2 you can divide by 5 so when you look at these two numbers what are common factors of 6 and 10 1 & 2 so 1 & 2 are common factors highest common factor of 6 and 10 which 
,,one is the highest to so 2 is the highest common factor the largest common factor is called the highest common factor so we select common factors out of that the largest one we call highest common factor find the highest common factor of 12 and 18 so how we write 12 1/2 yes get 6 divided by 3 you get 4 divided by 4 you get 3 and divide by 6 you get 12 and finally 12 is also a factor 81 be visible by 2 divisible by 3 and what else 4 is not there 5 6 and then 18 what are common factors they're common ones 1 2 3 & 6 so out of these what's the highest one six six is the highest common factor so we can write 12 in terms of 6 into 2 18 you can write 6 times 
,,3 so here if you take these two factors highest common factor is in the circle 6 is the highest common factor find the highest common factor of 15 and 20 15 1 not divisible by 2 3 5 and 15 21 - ok then 3 not divisible 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and then finally 20 so what are the common factors there one fine those are the two common factors out of these two you can write down the highest one is fine so if you take 15 I can write 5 times 3 and 5 times 4 so highest common factor is in the circle find highest common factor of 20 and 30 now can you find out at once when you look at 20 and 30 10 times 2 and 10 times 3 so here I can write 10 times 2 and 10 times 3 so what's the highest common factor for 20 and 13 that's 10 fine highest common factor of the tn 45 what do you think 15 times 2 and 15 times 3 so 15 times 2 is 30 15 times 3 is 45 so what do you think the highest one highest one we can take as 15 24 36 60 now you get three numbers and we are asked to find out the highest common factor so 24 36 60 when you look at it we see what is the common factor 12 these are multiples of 12 12 times 2 12 times 3 12 times 5 that's the maximum number common factor we can take so what's the highest one highest one we can take as 12 these 3 45 6 275 so when you look at it carefully we see 15 either common factor and it's the highest one 15 times 3 15 times 4 and 15 times 5 75 so highest common factor we can take as 15 finding highest common factor using prime factors so we did so far 
,,by looking at the numbers we took the highest one now there's a method to find out if you can't see at once you can use prime factor method so we'll take 12 so what 
,,you have to do take separate numbers and see what are the factors you can divide by 2 again you can divide by 2 you can't divide by 3 so what are the factors 2 times 2 times 3:18 what are the factors you can't divide by 2 divided by 3 you get 1 2 times 3 times 3 24 divided by 2 again 2 and again two and finally 3 2 times 2 times 2 times 3 now what we do we take the highest common factor from this this is one common factor and there's another common factors what we do we multiply these two so we can take highest common factor as 2 & 3 that's 6 so we can write 12 as 6 into 2 18s 6 into 3 24 as 6 into 4 so 6 is the highest common factor 4 12 18 and 24 find highest common factor of 15 30 and 45 15 we know 3 times 5 so when you divide 15 you can see this is 3 & 5 here you don't need to multiply by 1 so you can write 3 
,,times 5 30 3 2 5 so 2 3 5 2 3 45 divided by 3 again 3 you get 5 3 3 5 now select the common 1/3 is common and five also common so what's the highest common factor we multiply these children so three only we take once and this is five so 15 so 15 is the highest common factor of 15 30 and 45 finding highest common factor of 12 24 
,,60 so now use prime factors and find out 12 you can write 2 to 24 you can write 2 2 to 3 and 60 you can't divide and see the factors 2 to 3 now select common factors 2 is common another 2 is common and here 3 is also so what's the highest 1 2 times another 2 times so 2 times 2 4 4 times 3 12 so the highest common factor of all these numbers is 12 now look at 22:40 4 60 you look at we see what's the highest common factor but we'll check it 22 2 times 11 11 times 1 so 2 times in our 44 / 222 
,,again we'll get to it 22 divided by 11 1 so 2 times 2 times 11 66 when you divide by 2 you get 33 divided by 3 you get 11 2 3 11 so what's common 2 is common and 11 
,,is a common factor so 2 times 11 is the highest common factor so 22 is the highest common factor five highest common factor of 14 21 and 49 14 divided by 2 + 7 - x 720 bar you can divide by 3 3 times 7 49 is 7 times 7 now what's the highest one 7 is the only common factor and it's the highest one so 7 is the highest one 26:39 65 now you can do it so 26 divided by 2 to get 1313 is a prime number so 2 times 30 39 can divide by 3 and 13 is a prime number so 3 times 30 65 you can divide by 5 and you get 13 so 5 times 30 so what's the common factor highest common factor is 13 so 13 you can write as the highest common factor write down the highest common factor at once now can you see when you look at these 3 we can see 10 10 times 5 10 times 16 times 7 so if you can do that we can easily find out the highest common factor so from all these what's the highest common factor we can write as 10 this one what do you think 35 what's the number high times 7 7 times 7 7 times 10 what's the number 7 7 we can see that the highest one 7 times 5 7 times 7 49 7 times 10 70 so what's the highest one 7 is the highest common factor 30 45 60 what can you say 
,,15 15 times to 15 times 3 15 times 5 so we can write 15 times to 15 times 3 you get 40 for it so here 60 is 15 times 4 so what's the highest common factor highest common factor is 50 look at these numbers 80 100 and hundred and eighty so 10 is okay then look at 810 18 another 2 is common so what's the highest common factor so you get 20 so just check 20 times for 20 times 500 20 times 5 here 20 times 4 what's 20 times here 9 so 20 is the highest common factor so we can take 20 now look at these ones 1845 63 divisible by 3 and you get 9 and 21 again divisible by 3 so these are multiples of 9 so I can write 18s 9 times 2 what's this one 9 times 5 63 is 9 times 7 so what's the highest common factor there 9 is the highest common factor finding highest common factor for algebraic terms now so far we did numbers now these are letters and numbers a mixture we call it algebraic terms now let's take 4x squared how can you write for 2 & 2 2 times 2x squared means X annex so you can first expand it like this and see what are common factors 6 how can you write 2 times 3 and X Y X into y 8 2 times 2 4 4 times 2 8 and x squared means two x's there and Y squared means two wise now take the common ones 1 2 is common what is X 1 X is common there and what about YY is not common because it's not there here so only 2 
,,"well X so 2 and X you can write 2x is the highest common factor right down highest common factor for these are G break terms 8 2 times 2 times 2 is there and B squared means B twice 12 2 times 2 4 4 times 3 12 a squared is a times a and B then 22 then again neither - 2 times 2 4 4 times 5 20 and B now see what are common and from that you can find out the highest 1/2 is , another 2 what is e you can take ears commenter and one B so what are the common factors to 2 e and B so when you multiply 2 times 2 4 so for a B is the highest common factor right down highest common factor for these numbers a B a times B 3 a B means 3 times a times B so a B means 2 "
,,times 2 times a B when you write down factors make sure that you write in prime numbers B is Commerce and is common so what's the highest common factor we can multiply a and B so without this multiplication sign we can write ap another algebraic terms find the highest common factor if you can't get it at once you write like this and find out the prime factors 2 times 2 times 3 is 12 and then P Q squared means cube and cube 8 2 times 2 times 2 P squared means P and P and want you there 40 divided by 2 divide by 2 divide by 2 and then high so 2 times 2 times 2 times 5 so when you select the common ones here to another two and what is here we forgot P and Q squared so we'll take pinion q squared P Q and Q now we'll select the common ones 1p is common 1q common here so that's all so you can write 2 times 2 times P times Q 2 times 2 4 4 P Q is the highest common factor right down highest common factor for these numbers 24 divided by 2 divided by 2 again 2 and then 3 2 times 2 times 2 times 3 and then M N squared one name and two ends 36 divided by 2 2 you get 9 divided by 3 and another 3 so 2 times 2 times 3 and 3 and M square that means 2 m 
,,then one name M squared N squared here 48 48 divided by 2 divided by 2 again so when you divide you get all these numbers then - how many times one two three four two three four and then three M Squared n square so that means - MZ twins now we'll find out the highest one to another to is common what else look at carefully three 
,,is common you take one name and another in so what's the number 2 times 2 4 4 times 3 12 so 12 mm now you can do this so write down the factors first 7 we know it's 
,,a prime number 7 only 7 x 1 x 2 eyes till how can you write as prime numbers 2 times 5 two x's and one why 9 we see 3 times 3 and x and x 4 x squared and y and y 4 y square now take the common ones out when you take numbers nothing common only letters are common 1 X you can take it out and one boy that's all so what's the highest common factor x into y or you can write x y so now the 1 6 you can write 2 x 3 2 x's two ones 12 - x - 4 4 x 3 12 - XS + 1 by 15 3 times 5 2 XS + 2 1 now we see that this X is common another X is cover what else now that Y you can take another one no numbers are common so what's the highest common factor X x + y you can write 
,,x squared Y now we look at how we can write algebraic expressions as a product of its factors so remove highest common factor for this 6 X + 15 Y and write as a product of two factors so we can separate the two terms 6x + 15 1 when you look at 6 X you can write 2x + 3 15 Y you can write 3 a 5 by so that's the common one and it's the highest common law so common factor is 3 and what are the remaining part you get 2 X 5 so we can take this highest common factor out and write down the remaining part so here when you take 3 out from 6 what's remaining 2 X when you multiply what you get 3 times 2 X 6 6 you are getting then when you take 3 from here 15 what's remaining five bye so when you take three out you get five by here so we can write 6x plus 15y as 3 times 2x plus 5y because when you multiply expand you get the same answer 6x 3 times 5 15 what so you get the same answer so when you are taking common factors out what you call that we call we are factorizing what's the reverse order expanding brackets and then factorizing so we are now looking at taking the highest common factor out from the expression look at these 2 5 a and 10 B so how 
,,can you write 5 a I can write 5 times a 10 B 5 times B 5 times to be then how can I write 5 8 and 10 B I can take the highest common factor out and the remaining part I can put inside the brackets a and plus sign this sign comes here so 8 plus 2 B now you can check by multiplying these two 5 times a 5 a 5 times 2b check me so that's correct now see this one you have given two terms 7p + 14 cube so what's common 7 times P I can write 7 times 2 cube I can write for 14 so 7 is the highest one 
,,so I can take 7 out and write the remaining part P plus 2 Q inside brackets so when you multiply you get 7p + 14 this one what do you think six times five six times 
,,two so I can write 6 times 5 m 6 times 2 n that's 12 so 6 you can take it out and the remaining part 5m plus 2n you can write inside so 6 times 5 30 30 M 6 times 2 n 12 15 X + 18 y the plus sign is there so we write plus sign so 15 3 times 5 X 18 y 3 times 6 y know what's the highest common factor 3 take it out and the remaining 5 5 X + 6 Y you can write inside the brackets this one now the sign is negative so we'll put negative 10 yeah this should be negative 20 X you can write 10 with 2 X 10 with 3 B that's 30 B so 10 when you take it out what's remaining 2 X now the sign is minus 3 always this sign comes here as well so 2x minus 3 be multiplied and 
,,see 10 times 2 20 10 times 3 30 and minus sign comes this one for a and 20 B what's common will take 4 4 times a four times five B so four is the highest common factor take it out the remaining part e + 5 b you can write in sat 8m plus 28 what's common look at carefully when you look at carefully sometimes you get it at once for four times - it four times five in four is the highest common factor take it out and write the remaining part inside the bracket so 2m plus five write down as product of factors at once can you take the highest common one out 7 + 35 7 is common so what's the remaining part when you take 7 a is there and then here 35 we have already taken 7 so 5 is remain 5b 8 12 16 what's the common factor for multiples of 4 so 4 is common 2 x 4 times 3 12 so 3y there 4 times 4 16 so for Z third one what's common 6 + 8 4 2 is common no letters common there so only you can take 2 so 2 a squared remain minus sign because this is minus 2 times 3 6 so 3 B squared and here 2 times 4 8 4 C square fourth one nine six three multiples of 3 so it take 3 out 3 plus 2x plus y so here only 3 is calm 12 16 20 what's common for four you can take it out 4 times 3 12 so 3 P 4 times 4 16 so 4 cube + 4 times 5 20 so that's 5 are 40 50 60 you can take turn out when you take 10 for X is there 5y + 10 x 6 16 so - its 22 11:33 definitely we know that's 11 11 times 2 20 to 11 times 1 so you can write a only no need one name - 314 2135 multiples of 7 and take 7 out to where 3 b + 5 2 4 6 2 take 2 out a plus 2b minus 311 2255 again 11 is common x + 2 y minus 5 write down as productive factors no no numbers just the letters so what's common 
,,here a I can write a times X a times y so I can write ax plus ay Y taking the common highest common factor out a and the remaining part inside so a into X plus y so 
,,these two are the product of factors again 2 PQ + 4 P R I can write - P - P times Q to P times here - are you get 4 PR no - P is common highest one so you can take it out and write Q + to work always check whether you are getting the same term - n PQ 2 PQ + 2 P into two are 4 p are these examples how can I write x is common 3 and X I can take so 3 X into X 3 X into 2 y 3 X into 3 Z so what's the highest common factor 3x I can take it out and write x + 2 y + 3 Z look at this one first 7 XY 14 x CI 21 X so what's common 7 X into are 7 X into 2 z 7x - three is 21 X so how can you write down this one I can write take seven X out take seven X out and write 
,,down the remaining part inside y - Z and this one eight twelve sixteen and here P P P P also common so we can take four P out for P times to P you get eight P squared forty-four p x 3q squared twelve P Q squared 4 P times 4 Q 16 B cube so for P is the highest common factor there so remaining part you write inside to p3 q squared + 4 Q write down algebraic expression 5 a plus 10 B as product of two factors so again 5 a I can write 5 times a 10 B I can write phi x 2b so 5 is common that's the highest common factor take it out the remaining part your right inside write our algebraic expression 7 XY 14x e 21 x as product of two factors so 7x is the highest common one check it out so you can write Y there 2 Z 3 so when you take my necks out what's remaining y plus 2z plus 3 so we call these are factors of this expression find factors of these ones ap square 12 P Q squared 8 P squared Q so already give up for P you can take it out so for P means 2 when another P 4 times 3 12 P is already there so Q Square when you take 4 P out this is 2p q 8 P squared Q you'll get now for P is the highest common factor take it out and remaining part 2 V 3 Q squared + 2 PQ you can write inside brackets find factors of these three expressions what's the highest one x squared x squared x squared so definitely x squared is common and 6 9 12 you get 3 so 3 x squared we can take it out if it's 3 x squared this is 2y squared 3x squared take it you get 3 only 3x squared when you take it you 
,,get for y so no need to circle that so 3x squared it's the highest common factor and you can write down the remaining part inside the brackets find tractors at once 
,,so we'll do at once look at the number three six three is common so no letter is common so the remaining part you write insult six and nine three is common so when you take three hours it's to a and three be fifteen and twenty you can take 3 out 5 X + 4 3 times 3 is not common there what's common 15 and 25 is common so when you 
,,take 5 out 3x + 4 1 12 and 15 you can take 3 out for a and 3 times 5 15 so 5 be 20 and 30 I can take 10 out 2x + 3 okay these ones take the factors at once 8 10 12 I can take for ya X also common for X out then - y remaining for X when you take this is 3 z 9 + 53 is common and 1a is common so 3a so 3b 5c 16 and 24 butts comma 8 
,,8 times 2 16 eight times three twenty four eight and twelve here you can take four out to here X is also come on X is also common for is also common so for X you can take it out 2x 3y so you get 12 X Y 30 and 45 what's common 3 you get 15 10 so only 3 & 5 15 you can take it out 2 & 1 X and you take 15 X you get 2 y inside and 15 times 3 45 3 Z so 15 times 3 45 fine factors now three expressions three terms are there at once we see a nice common take it out the remaining part we write inside brackets from these we can see only X is common 1 X 2 y and y square your sign is the same you can't change the side here PQ q RQ is Q is common P plus R plus s here M is common you can write M plus n plus here what you write one name is there when you take em out that means one is there so M times 1 is M so here when you take 
,,"the whole thing out you have to write this is 1 now here also same thing when you take a out this is 1 here 1 plus B plus B Square this one too you can take it out what else p2p that's all so when you take two P out Q minus 2 R and 3's let's comment here and Miss common 3 so 3 M foo and you get 12 here then 5 6 9 12 3 1 P is , so 3 P to Q 3 r & 4 yes what is here only hey so when you take a out this is a plus B plus C this one X is combine and no number is common so only X 2 X 3 y + 5 Z now what happens you can take negative numbers as a common factor so we'll look at this one so this is a negative number so negative 2 way I can write negative 2 times "
,,a so negative 2 times 8 oh I can write negative 8 times 2 you are still getting the - - wait look at this 1 minus 5b I can take minus 5 and B or minus B and 5 - 7 X 
,,- 7 with X or minus X with 7 here minus 15 minus 3 into positive 5 oh I can write 3 with negative 5 minus 12 minus 4 with 3 or 4 plus 4 with minus 3 I can take the minus sign to any of these factors find factors of minus 14 a minus 21 B minus 14 so we'll take minus 7 then what's the other part - a if you take minus 7 out what's 
,,remaining three big now is C minus seven is the common factor so I can take minus seven out and write down the remaining part 2 a + 3 B inside brackets now multiply 
,,and see 7 times 2 away 14 let's - minus and plus that's - you get 21 B fine factors of minus 8x minus 12i so I can take minus 4 if you take minus 4 this is 2x minus 
,,4 times 3y you get minus 12i now we'll take minus 4 out from the two terms that's the highest common factor the remaining part you can write inside so this is plus 3y plus 2x so that's why this plus 3y comes over there now find factors here both negative I can take minus 3 out so when I take minus 3 out this becomes plus a plus 
,,5b 4 minus 4 will take out - well when you take it out you get 2x and 3y from this minus 3 out but you get 3p and 2 K minus 2 and -6 we take minus 2 out e + 3 so multiply and see whether you are getting the same expression all three will take minus 2 out what's happening here you get 5n that's positive because this is negative now here positive is there so this becomes negative because you have already taken a minus sign out so 2 times 4 8 that's four N and minus 2 you have take it out and 
,,then this becomes plus 3 so multiply and see whether you get this sign correctly - - and - you get +8 a will take - 11 out you can take plus 11 also then the sign stays the inside so if you take minus 11 this becomes X plus 6 this becomes plus 2y and here plus becomes minus 3 15 18 3 3 is common so we'll take minus 3 out you get 5p this is minus so this becomes plus 6 q & 3 are so that means plus or minus classes there so that becomes minus because - - you get plus their take - formed E and then this becomes must to be 8 and here plus becomes minus minus - you get plus 4 times 24 36 12 you can take minus 12 out so this becomes 2 p3q and here - because 
,,- 12 and - are you get plus 12 are 16 24 8 I can take minus 8 out this becomes 2 X plus 3 by and minus Z so minus 8n - see you get plus 8 see find factors of following algebraic expressions so you can take either plus or minus will take all common factors that's called highest common factor I can't take two what so what's remaining two this one X is common for so I'll take four X out this becomes 3 2 y 4 times 2 8 XY minus 4 X already taken 10 12 8 I can take 2 and here a 2 way so what's remaining 5 a + 6 b + 4 c all these I can take a out a plus B plus C this one x squared is common take it out 2 plus 3y minus 5z this one p is common and 3 so 3 P 3 P 
,,when you take 3 q is there for R + 3 x - 2 SS you get 6 PS remove common factor at once so now you should be able to take the highest common factor out at once so when you take an expression just try to take all possible factors out so here X take it out what's remaining y + ya when you look at this one is come on take it out so you'll get a plus B minus 8 see what is this one what is common 3x when you take 3x a minus B here 9 + 3 3 comma and take it out you can write 3x + 1 because remember when you take the highest number out always remember this is 1 so 1 X is common take it out remaining parts you can write inside with the correct sign a is common so remaining part a plus B minus C here X is common L - M - what's common there 3 yes 3 is common for p5q and - a / b is common C is common L is common three terms 
,,come ABC when you take ABC one remaining here one be remaining here and one C remaining there X Y you can take it out when you take XY out exist remaining Y is remaining there and XY both remaining yeah so try to take the highest wall out so fine factors means you are taking the highest common factor out 3 take it out you get 4x - 5 14 and 20 1:7 is the highest common factor to M minus 3 9 and 12 3 and here a squared is also common when you take 3 s squared you get 3 minus 4p we are 16 and 
,,24 what's the highest one 8 and X so 2x 8 times 2 16 x squared and here 3y 8 times 3 24 X Y this one 15 and 25 x and y comma 3 what remaining 5 you have already taken so this becomes 4 X 12 and 21 3 x squared is common and 1 Y is common take it out so what's remaining 4 here plus 3 x squared Y we have taken that one out 3 times 
,,4 12 minus 7 x squared you have taken out so One X is remaining and Y squared is there we took one Y out one Y remaining check it again 3 x squared so 3 times 7 21 x squared and X X cube Y and y Y squared now we will look at your review exercise find the highest common factor of each set of numbers given below so how we find out do it separately and find out the highest common factor 12 2 times 2 4 4 times 3 12 2 times three six six times three eighty now take the highest one two and three 
,,so highest common factor is two and three that's six thirty and twenty four two times fifteen fifteen you can write three and five if you can't figure it out you do 
,,separately and find out the factors so here fifteen three times four and twenty four two times twelve twelve means two times two four four times three now what are the common factors two and three so highest common factor is 2 times 3 that's 6 45 and 60 45 60 you can divide by 5 5 times 9 9 you can write 3 and 3 divided by 5 you get 12 12 you can write 2 times 2 4 4 times 3 12 so what's the highest common factor 5 3 that's all 5 times 3 that's 15 6 12 18 when you take that we can't say 6 is the highest common factor but we'll show the workings 2 times 3 2 times 2 4 4 times 3 12 2 times 9 so that 9 is 3 times three two is common and three is common so highest common factor is 2 times 3 that's 6 this one 15 30 and 75 3 times 5 30 3 times 10 so you can write 3 10 you can write 2 and 575 3 you get 3 times 2 6 so 25 25 you can write 5 and 5 what's the highest common factor 3 & 5 you get 50 now take this one 36 24 and 60 you can divide by 2 you get 18 18 also divided by 2 you get 9 9 you can write 3 & 3 24 you can divide by 2 you get 12 12 how you can write 2 times 2 4 4 times 360 divided by 2 you get 30 divided by 2 again 15 3 times and fun know what's common to another two and three common now what's the highest common factor 2 times 2 times 3 4 times 3 12 12 is the highest common factor 6 9 12 6 2 times 3 9 3 times 3 12 3 times 4 so what's common only 1 3 is common you can write highest common factor is 3 15 30 and 45 how can you write 3 times 5 53 times 10 10 you can write 2 times 5 45 3 and 15 there 15 3 times 5 so what's the highest common factor 3 is common and 5 is common 3 times 5 15 he left for 13 and 511 you can write 1 times 11 1 times 13 all these are prime numbers 1 and the number itself are the factors so what's the highest common factor in this case only one example number 1 find the highest common factor of the algebraic terms in each part given below so we can write separate 2 times P times Q for 2 times 2 P Q now take the common 1 highest common factor 2 P Q 2 P Q is the highest common 7mn 14 M and P 28 m and q 7 is 7 times MN 42 times 7 times M and P 28 2 times 14 14 2 times 7 M in Q now what are the common ones 7 M hmm 7 mm so highest common factor is 7 ma exercise 7.1 find the highest common factor of the algebraic terms in each part given below so you write like this and find out them common ones x into y 3 into X into y 2 times 2 into X prime factors here without writing 4 times X right 2 times 2 times X X is common why is not common so that's all so highest common factor is just X this one for C 8 a 4 B 4 how can you write we write in terms of prime numbers 2 times 2 times C 8 2 times 2 times 2 and a 4 again 2 times 2 so you can see 2 & 2 common so that's 4 2 times 2 you get 4 is the highest common back to their 2 X 8 X + 4 X 1 you see 
,,2x is the ice common factor but we'll show 2 times X 2 times 2 times 2 X 2 times 2 times x and y so what's the common 1/2 + 1 X the highest common factor is 2x this 
,,one for P 8 P Q 12 P 2 times 2 4 and SP 2 times 2 times 2 PQ that's 8 PQ 2 times 2 4 4 times 3 12 P Q now we'll take the common ones out to another 2 and P so highest common factor is 2 times 2 times P that's 4 P 8 P Q R 16 QR and 7 mq r 8 2 times 2 times 2 and then P Q R is there 16 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 7 7 times M Q now what R comma Q is common our is common that's all so what's the highest common factor Q this one 4x 6x y 8 q r x 4 x 2 x 2 x x 2 x 3 by x and y 8 2 times 2 times 2 q 
,,r x now take the common ones to another 2 is not common x that's all so highest common factor is 2x so highest one is 2 X 4 X 6 a B X 10 a B X Y now write down all the factors for x 2 x 2 6 2 x 3 a B X 10 2 times 5 a B X Y now see the common factors to X that's up so what's the highest common factor to X this one 6 MN 12 MN y 15 my 6 means 2 times 3 12 2 times 2 4 4 times 3 15 three times now we'll take the common ones 3 & M and means not common so what's the highest common factor 3 example number one write the expression 36 a plus 60 B as a product of factors so that means you can take the highest common factor out so what do you think 36 and 60 B 6 times 6 6 times 10 so another 2 so 12 12 times 3 12 times 5 so that means 12 is their highest one so take it out you get 12 times 3 so 3 a plus 5 if you can't figure 
,,it out you just write down 12 times 3 12 times by me so common one take it out and the remaining part you write inside brackets example number two write the expression as a product of factors so 12 X 25 and 16z 12 4 times 3 24 times 5 16 4 times 4 so 4 is the highest common month so when you take for the remaining part three x 5i + 4 z so i told you if you are not okay write down 4 x 3 3 x 4 x 5 button here 4 x 4z so when you check for out the other parts inside the brackets exercise 7.2 fill in the blanks the expressions are given and you asked to fill in the blanks ok so 3 X means 3 times X 12 millions 3 times 4/3 is comma and take it out what's remaining x + 15 X you can write 5 times 3 X 25 times 4 y so when you take 5 out what's remaining 3 X + 12 a how do you write 12 B 6 times 2 in here this number given now 6 times 3 18 so here 3 comes there so what's the number here this is 18 now look at this one 12 4 times 3x you get 12 X this one 4 x 2 y you get 8y 4 times 5 z is 
,,20 Z when you take 4 out what's remaining 3 x - 2 y + 5 this one you have to check the common fat here 5x is there how will you get 30 from five six times 5x now you can take six out six times for 24 so for y there six times three you get 18 and here we missed one black what's that six times when you take six out what's remaining two a plus three question number two write each of the algebraic expressions given below as product of two factors such that one factor is the highest common factor of the terms of the expression so what's the highest one - you can take it out X plus 3y here four is the highest one so 2x plus 3y this one 3 3 times 5 15 3 times 6 18 9 9 27 9 you can take 9x + 3 y 4 and 24 you can take it out P plus 5 cube 12 and 30 get 6 2p plus 5 cube 20 and 30 we can take ten out to weigh and three be 36 and 54 what's the number 18 if you can't figure out you just do it 36 is 2 times 18 so 18 times 254 when you divide by 2 you get 27 divided by 3 9 again this one so here 3 times 3 times 2 18 18 times 3 so 18 you can take it out so 18 times 2a and 18 times 3 B so here 60 and 90 vc10 is common and another 3 so 30 so you can take 
,,30 out so this is 2p + 3 okay Part B what's common 5 is comma take it out what's remaining 2y and here Phi 3 15 12 3 you can take it out and write down the remaining numbers inside 18:12 6 6 you can take it out 3 - 2 M + M 10 2015 5 only 5 - a 4 B + 3 if you can take the highest one out you again check inside whether you can take another fact out then you can do again 989 I can take nine out C minus 2a plus one because nine is nine times 1/12 618 six you can take to D plus one and three see there three six three three is common X plus 2y minus 1 10 4 2 2 is common 5 m 2 n minus 1 so this is 2 times 1 12 8 4 before you can take it or not and then the remaining part you can write so 1 is there 9 3 6 3 3 plus B plus 2 C here is not common it is not there so 3 only a squared to be a so here a also comes to a B plus 3 
,,B squared for 16 12 for is there a is not comments only 4 a squared minus 4a B minus 3 C example number one write minus 15 as a product of two factors such that minus 3 is a factor so minus fifteen if minus 3 is a I can write minus three times five ah to write ten as product of two factors such that minus 2 is a factor so 10 if 
,,I take minus 2 as a factor what's the remaining 1 minus 5 because - and - you get plus 10 write down each of the algebraic expressions given below as a product of two factors such that one factor is a negative now so we'll take a negative number out - for when you take minus 4 this is plus and this is plus so for my second one we'll take minus 8 out so remaining part this is plus plus is there so this becomes minus 3n minus - you get positive and minus 16 is there an so this becomes plus 2 
,,so minus 8 is the factor we have taken it out exercise 7.3 right - 20 as a product of two factors such that minus 4 is what factor if minus 4 is there what's the other factor 4 times 5 no so the other one is plus 5 or you can write just 5 write 12 as product of two factors such that minus 4 is one factor so if this is 12 if I want to take minus 4 what happens to get Plus this should be minus 3 minus 4 times minus 3 you get plus 12 write each algebraic expression given below as a product of 
,,two factors such that one factor is a negative number so we'll take minus four if you take minus 4 this becomes minus 3x minus minus plus and here you get plus y expand and see whether you get the same expression we take minus 4 out this becomes plus 3 and this becomes minus y minus minus plus take minus 4/3 X plus y here minus 
,,3 we'll take it out a minus minus minus plus 5b and this becomes plus 2c what's the common one minus six out to eight so you get minus 12a this is minus because this is plus three beef and this is minus order check on this is for see what's the common factor there 8 minus 8 very japanese peeny this is minus because this is plus 
,,minus minus plus 5q and here - already taken so this is plus 8 times example number one write the expression as a product of two factors so here expression is 18 X 24 XY + 12 X Z so what are the common factors 18 24 12 you can take 6 + XS comic so 6 6 you can take it out when you take 6 6 this becomes 3 6 times 4 so this is 4y + 12 that's 2 Z multiplied and say 6 times 2 12 exa example number two write the expression as product of factors 15 pink.you 45 P Q R + 60 Cuba 15 Q is common so we 
,,take 15 Q out what's remaining please there 15 times 3 is 45 so 3 you have 15 times 4 is 60 so you can write for example 3 write the expression as a product of factors 306 a B and 12a C 3 e is common that's the highest common factor when you take 3 out this becomes 1 remember that 3 a times 1 is 3 this is 2 B and when you take 3 from 12 that's four C so 6 a b + 12 AC you are getting exercise 7.4 write each algebraic expressions given below as a product of two factors now you can take the highest common factor out and write down the remaining part inside the bracket so if this is P 1 plus Q so X is common Y Z plus P chip 3x is comment here when you take 3x that's 1 plus 2y here 15 and 25 and P you can take it out 3q minus 4r this one for people you can't take it out 1 minus 4 Q and then 3r this one what is common to it 1 minus 4 B and minus 4 sick take 5 X out 1 - 2 y + Z because we have taken 5 X out what's common here 3 a B all 3 are commenting 1 - 3 C right each of the following algebraic expressions as a product of two factors establish the accuracy of your answer by simplifying the product so we have to recheck whether you are getting the answer ok so first take the common one highest one highest common factor you get Z minus 2 P now we will check whether we are getting the same thing when you multiply you get X Y Z when you multiply this 1 you get minus 2 X Y P no check X Y P we are getting the same answer this one when you take four weeks out 3 minus 5 I 
,,now multiply and see whether you are getting the same four times three 12 X 4 times 5 20 that's - 20 X Y check whether you are getting the same thing here is come on check it out B plus C minus T multiply and see whether you are getting the same as a B plus AC minus ad so that's correct what's common P is common take it out 1 plus Q plus Q are multiplied and C P into 1 P P into Q P Q and P Q so that's correct take X out P minus y -1 multiply and check whether it's correct X P minus XY minus X so it's true this one what's common to a B now we can't take B to a we'll check it out then this becomes 3 B 4 B squared + 6 C when you multiply what you get 6 a 
,,be 2 times here - a 8a b squared + 6 x - 12 AC no check it's correct join each algebraic expression in Group A with the algebraic expression in Group B which it is equal to so we can expand brackets and find the answer 2 times X 2 X 4 y and so this is the here when you multiply this one 6a + 4 B where 6a + 4 b + 12 C order is not important so we need to find out your 12 C is there 8 a 4 B so this one 5 times 2 so you need to multiply all okay with the outside number 10 a - 5 10 a - 5 5 times 3 15 B so this is this next one 4 times 3 12x minus 8y + 20 z for Pierre or for AP for BP and for P 2 times 5 10 a 10 a minus 2ac 10 a minus 2ac and for a B this one when you multiply two works minus 3 XY 2 X minus 3 XY and here 3 XY square what about the next one 8 a for a B and minus 4 AC 5 times 3 15 XYZ 15 X Y Z Phi times 
,,5 25 XY + 20 X Z 3 times 4 12 X minus 6 XY + 9 XZ this one - x - 4 4 P squared 4 P squared + 2 QR + 2 PQ R so you get this one so you are getting all the answers there complete the table given below original expression and after factoring the expression so that means you have to expand records 12 a 4 x 2 b 8 B 4 x 3 12 a squared what about this one here other way around you have to factorize what's common 9 a calm and you take 9a out one plus 3z squared plus 2 be remaining here you need to 
,,expand 3 times 2 6 a PE 3 times 3 9 and then you get 9 AR and here you get 18 this is also expanding brackets 2 a squared 2 times 3 6 a B and 2 times 2 4 a squared C here 8 is common take it out and X you can take it out when you take 8 X out y plus 3 P + 8 times 5 is 40 so 40 you get Q is there expand 6a be 8 BC and here what's the number your Phi 2 times 5 minus 10 is see here also expand brackets 6 x PQ so we can write in order 6 PQ x 3 times 3 9 9 x squared and 3 times 6 18 PX when you 
,,multiply this one by six 12 XY squared and then 18 XY + 6 x 4 24 z now factorize this one what's common 3 a is common so when you take 3a out B - to be here so 3 minus here to be and here when you take 3 out for see here you can simplify so same term you can first simplify and write down this 1 s 3 a B minus 2 B - B this is also correct last one what's common for X is common take it out for X you get 2y minus 3 P 4 times 3 12 X P then minus 4 take it out 5 a y so for X and this one you get 
,,20 a X well again fill in the blanks algebraic expression is there one factor and you ask to write down the other factor so 4 is a factor then what's the other one when you take 4 this becomes minus 6 and plus 3 here you can write 3 - X as well or day is not important so you can write 3 minus 6 or so minus 4 when you take it out what's remaining we can take minus 4 then this becomes plus 6 and here minus X minus 3 now to take it out when you take two out this becomes minus three X and minus four Y goes - - is it correct no this is plus 2 this becomes plus if you take minus 2 X out this is plus so 3 you get 3 times - ok then this is minus means this is 
,,- take 2 X out 2 times 4 so 4 1 multiply and say 2 minus 2 and minus 4 plus 8 X for this one take 2 out when you take positive 2 out - II here plus 2 B you get 4 B and when you take - from minus 6 plus 2 it becomes minus 3 C so you get minus 6 C now we'll take - two out so when you take minus 2 out this becomes plus a and here you get minus 2 P minus 2 B and minus 2 you get plus 4b and - is there this becomes plus so when you take minus 2 this is 3 C so minus 2 times 3 C - 6 C now take - 3 
,,B from here so what's the remaining part this becomes positive and this is also positive a plus 3 so multiply and see - 3 B a or 3 a B and minus 9 B here 2x Y comma 
,,then this becomes 1 - two times four four Z because that's - now here you can take whatever the highest common factors what's the highest common factor five Y we can take so we'll take five Y as the highest common factor so what's remaining you get X plus two here Y you have already taken two X and here to pee now again can you 
,,see same jump d15 XY + 10 X Y both are like terms so you can add it here so X + 2 X you get 3x + 2 P now multiply and see 5 times 3 15 X Y so these two 15 XY + 5 I + 2 P you get 10 XP is it correct here this one and this one 10 P Y so that's correct so we covered all theory part related to factors so what's the main topic we did finding highest common factor so take the highest common factor as one factor and the expression which is obtained by dividing each term of the algebraic expression by the highest common factor as the other factor and write the algebraic expression as a product of these two factors so that means when you want to factorize what 
,,you do take the highest common factor and write down the remaining part inside the bracket so practice all the exercises and examples and thorough with finding factors

AlgebraicExpression,ctqviXu-mTE,hey guys in this video I'm going to talk about factorizing algebraic expressions so what is factorizing well that's to break something into its factors so if you have a number like say 55 for example if you were to factorize 55 you would break it into say think of two factors like 5 times 11 so you've just factorize 55 into 5 times 11 or you could have 1 x 55 and that's a 55 factorize that's actually all of the factors of 55 you can also factorize you can also factorize algebraic term so if you have like 3 X well factors of 3x are 3 and X so 3 times X so that's factorizing are numbers and terms and then if you have an expression well you need to take out the highest common factor so let's have a look at an example so let's say we have 3 lots of X plus 15 and I need to factor out that expression so I need to take out the highest common factor so let's look at 3 exits factorize that oops so 3 x equals 3 times X and then if I factorize 15 well this can be 1 times 15 or it can be 3 times 5 so let's have a look at the factors of 15 that 1 3 5 and 15 so now is there a common factor there yes it's the 3 so that is actually the highest common factor and I need to take that out of this expression and what I mean by take that out well take it out of each term or divide each term by by 3 so what I do with that term at that common factor is I put it out the front of the expression and then inside the brackets I need to put some brackets I put the rest of the the expression in those brackets so if I'm taking the 3 out of the 3x or divide that by 3 left with X I divide 15 by three you're left with five so that's that expression factorized I've taken out the highest common factor this is useful when you're dealing with fractions and longer terms and equations where it might be easier to factorize and then do some canceling or get rid of get rid of some things to simplify an expression so so we need to get the hang of this before we move on to more complicated questions all right let's have a look at some more examples okay so you can have all different types of expressions that you can factorize so you might have lots of unknowns so you might have six a B for example - a squared B and then you need to factorize that so let's have a look the factor so the factors of six a B well that's going to be six times a times B and then a squared B it's going to be eight times a times B so can you see any common factors in there well we've got an a here and 
,,an a here and we've got to be here and a B here so the highest common factor is actually combination of a and B so that's going to be a whoops I mean to put that times so the highest common factor is actually a B and then we need to tat what goes in the back is what's left over in each term so 6 AB if we divide that by a be we're just left with 6 I've got a negative and then if we take a be out of a squared B on left with is a okay so and then you can always double check you can expand it back out to make sure you get the same thing so 6a B 6 times a B is a B and then a B times a is a squared B so you should end up with what you started with so that's 
,,kind of a way to double check that you got the right answer all right ok let's have a look at another example so you can have something that looks like this PQ R so 
,,for example you might not have any numbers at all you just have a lots and lots of letters and you need to decide which letters either come factors say this looks a 
,,bit you know a bit nasty lots of different letters but actually what you really need to do is look for the letters that are common in each term so no keys in here so there can't be I see a Q and a Q so so the Q must be a common factor and then R and know are there so the only common factor there must be Q so put the Q out the front and in brackets it's the letters that are left over so P R and then plus if I taken out Q I'm left with an R T and then negative s W all right so that's the factorization of that expression let's just do a couple more so let's do 25 P squared for example minus 10p so now factors of 25 P now you need to start possibly you can either write down all the factors or perhaps you can do some work out in your head here and think what's common between 25 and 10 so I know that 5 goes into 25 and 
,,5 goes into 10 but we need the highest is there a higher one I'm not sure so I think it might be 5 that is called the highest common factor between 25 and 10 and then and then that's a P squared and a P so actually so P is in both so it's going to be 5 P is the common factor and then if you divide 25 by 5 years with 5 and then taking a pee you've got one P left and then minus 10 P divided by 5 feet well all you're left with is 2 so 10 P cancel the peas and cancel the 5 and you're fit to there okay so hopefully this is all making sense and then just one more example something let's say I don't know you could have higher indices so you might have something like 6 P to the power of 4 minus 12 P so it don't be don't be too afraid of these indices all that's saying is that's for lots of PP times P times P times P okay 
,,so I know that come factor between 6 and 12 or 6 goes into 12 twice so 6 is is coming factor there and then I've got a P and a P so 6p is the highest common factor and then if I take 6p out of six P to the power 4 and but that's just P to the power 4 not 6 to the power 4 as well so I've got P to the power of 3 left and then minus 2 12 divided by 6 is 2 and that P is in the common factor so that's the factorization of that term 6p bracket P to the 3 minus 2 okay so that's our that's a few examples of factorizing algebraic expressions please let me know if there's any details I missed or you need to maybe go over something that didn't make sense I was I

AlgebraicExpression,Ks-wwYpS20Y,in this video we're gonna take a look at one of the most powerful and time-saving algebra tricks ever I've tutored hundreds and hundreds of students and I have never seen any of them used this trick I don't think anyone really knows about this so stay tuned so you can learn one of the best algebra tricks ever hey everyone its Brian if you're looking for all the lessons and tricks to make math easy start now by subscribing one of the most hated things to do in math and algebra in precalc is 
,,solving systems of equations everybody hates doing it if you don't remember what systems of equations look like they look like this right systems of equations or simultaneous equations you're given more than one equation and more than one variable and the traditional way that you solve this is either by what's called elimination or by substitution basically you solve for one of the variables in one equation and you plug it into the other equation it's a lot of work so with this method we're just gonna skip all that we're just gonna skip right to the answer all right are you ready for it so here we go I'm just gonna write the answer x is equal to here's how it works 2 times 10 is 20 minus there's a 1 in front of this Y 1 times 11 is 11 divided by 2 times 2 is 4 minus 1 times 1 is 1 that would be 20 minus 11 is 9 over 4 minus 1 is 3 9 over 3 is 3 you just solved for X in like a few seconds Wow so at this point to get Y you have an option if it's easier you can just plug 3 in for X into either of these equations and get Y but that's kind of just like the old method so I'm just gonna continue with my trick so let's do the same thing for y y 
,,is equal to and it works just slightly different than the last time so Y is equal to 11 times 2 is 22 - 1 times 10 is 10 and then I divide by the exact same thing I 
,,got last time I work in here 2 times 2 is 4 minus 1 times 1 is 3 you can just you can just keep the denominator here it's gonna be the same so when you're solving for y it's even one less step so I'll just keep that as 3 22 minus 10 is 12 over 3 12 over 3 is 4 and there you go you solved the system of equation without doing any 
,,elimination without doing any substitution just wrote down the answer saves you so much time so at this point you might be wondering why have you never heard of this where does this come from this is actually something called Kramer's rule it's something you learn in a linear algebra class or a matrices class the reason you haven't heard of it is because it involves what are called determinants and that's something that's defined for matrices and I just kind of threw that all out I didn't worry about doing any of the theory behind it and I took away some of the intermediate steps just to get to the bare bone just to get the answer as quick as possible 
,,so if you want to look into the theory of Kramer's rule you're welcome to but this is the application of Kramer's rule I just kind of removed a few intermediate steps for you let's take a look at one more example to make sure you've got this down here I have another system of equations simultaneous equations 3x minus y equals to 4x plus 5y equals 1 and let's do the trick so here we go X is equal to and remember how this works we do minus 1 so we do the coefficient of Y here minus 1 times 1 
,,is minus 1 minus 2 times 5 is 10 divided by and this time we go the diagonals the other way minus 1 times minus 4 is 4 minus 3 times 5 is 15 if you simplify this minus 1 minus 10 is minus 11 minus 4 I'm sorry 4 minus 15 is -11 something over itself is positive one how do you do it with y remember this time we take the coefficients of the X I do two times minus 4 is minus 8 minus 1 times 3 is 3 all over and remember the bottom the denominator it's just the same from the last time so you can 
,,just keep this keep the denominator to the same don't even worry about computing that the second time minus 8 minus 3 again is minus 11 over minus 11 that's again 1 
,,so X is 1 and Y is 1 in this equation and if you're ever not sure if you ever feel like you made a mistake you could always plug these numbers back into the equations and make sure that you make sense if I plug 1 in for X and y 3 minus 1 is 2 and minus 4 plus 5 is 1 it works out before you try this trick on your problems make sure you have the ordering right make sure you know which numbers to multiply and when when you're solving for x it's this times this minus this times this and when you're solving for y it's this times this minus this times this make sure you have the ordering down for the numerators now I know what you're thinking you're saying Brian this is great two-by-two systems of two equations and two unknowns two variables that's great you just saved me a lot of time thank you very much what if I have more what if I have three equations and three unknowns what if you have more than that so here are three equations with three variables can I use my trick for this 
,,the answer is yes but it's probably not worth it Cramer's rule this trick it gets a little bit more complicated the more equations you use you can learn the details 
,,if you take a matrices or linear algebra class but it actually wouldn't recommend this trick for a more than just two equations it kind of just gets a little bit too complicated and a little bit too much to memorize as a trick if you do want to learn the best way to solve this system and actually exactly this system you can click right here and you can watch my video on what's called Gaussian elimination that shows you how to solve a system of three equations in three unknowns the best and 
,,most efficient way in this video you learned one of the most powerful and time-saving algebra tricks out there to solve systems of equations I really hope you got something out of this video if you found it helpful I would really appreciate it if you would subscribe to my channel and tell your friends watch this video too so they can learn the benefits of this trick thanks very much for watching have a great day

AlgebraicExpression,BZeFnoAHFkw,all right hello gradates and welcome to 8.5 solving equations part 2 found conveniently on page 268 of your textbook and the goal is to solve equations by balancing 
,,essentially what you do to one side of the equation you do to the other side here is one side there's the other what you do to one side you do to the other balance both sides are to be equal alright so let's take a look at this one here now 3n plus 2 equals 17 your goal is to isolate the variable that's the variable you need to 
,,isolate that you need to find out what is N write this down isolate the variable so that's our goal here find out what's the variable so in this case how are we going to do this we need to eliminate numbers around it now we can eliminate it there's many ways that you've heard and they all mean the same thing so I'm going to talk through a bunch of examples using the terminology that we've come across in the past so let's do this here we're going to balance these two sides now your next line in your equation will read like this you need to eliminate that too how am I gonna living at that too all right 3 n plus 2 well plus 2 then eliminate like this - to subtract 2 now because we're balancing there's an equal sign you do the same thing on the other side so 17 is minus 2 so then you're left with 3n equals 15 all right how we're going to get rid of this how am I going to get rid of the 3 I'm going to divide it by itself and you what you do once how you do it the other so 3 divided by 3 is 1 so the next line will be 1n or just n 15 divided by 3 is 5 n is 5 let me see if this works three times five plus two 3 times 5 is 15 plus 2 is 17 beautiful it works next alright we've heard this carrying over moving it to the other side so all I hear oh I move it to the other side well here's why you're moving it to 
,,the other side because the example we we've just did so T plus 8 equals 14 what is T your line your next line will read as follows plus 8 minus 8 so you're not carrying it over your mitt you're balancing both sides ok 14 minus 8 so T equals 2 6 does this work 6 plus 8 is 14 boom beautiful that works as well lovely we move on now take the time press pause get all these examples down so I have to have an example press pause go back in case you missed it and take down each example work it through I want to see all these examples next day plus the question I'm going to be giving you at the end of this glorious presentation next reversing the signs again we've done this already this is just different way of expressing it so 10 plus D well I am I going to do what am i doing this 10 this is a positive 10 to eliminate this or 2 is in order to isolate the D you have to subtract it from itself plus D and what you do one side you do to the other minus 10 so D equals 15 does it work 10 plus 15 you substitute the variable with the number 10 plus 15 equals 25 lovely well done alright last example 18 p equals 55 what am I going to do here we've seen this already divide it by itself wonderful and what we do the left side do the right side what is 55 divided by 18 well works out to three point zero five five six all right so essentially three point zero five approximately we plug that in it's going to be 55 point zero four or something so it works and finally for next day now again paused copy this down take this and bring it in tomorrow I want to see all the examples Plus this one come prepared with this equation work it out and I don't see it we'll take it up and that's it so this is your homework from the homework take down this equation and bring it for next day alright good good thank you very much thank you for watching we'll see you in class bye-bye

AlgebraicExpression,bAerID24QJ0,Welcome to level one
,,linear equations. So let's start
,,doing some problems. So let's say I had the equation
,,"5-- a big fat 5, 5x equals 20. So at first this might look"
,,"a little unfamiliar for you, but if I were to"
,,"rephrase this, I think you'll realize this"
,,is a pretty easy problem. This is the same thing as
,,saying 5 times question mark equals 20. And the reason we do the
,,notation a little bit-- we write the 5 next
,,"to the x, because when you write a number right"
,,"next to a variable, you assume that you're"
,,multiplying them. So this is just
,,"saying 5 times x, so instead of a question"
,,"mark, we're writing an x. So 5 times x is equal to 20. Now, most of you all could"
,,"do that in your head. You could say, well, what"
,,"number times 5 is equal to 20? Well, it equals 4. But I'll show you a way to do"
,,it systematically just in case that 5 was a more
,,complicated number. So let me make my pen
,,"a little thinner, OK. So rewriting it, if"
,,"I had 5x equals 20, we could do two things"
,,and they're essentially the same thing. We could say we just divide
,,"both sides of this equation by 5, in which case, the left"
,,"hand side, those two 5's will cancel out, we'll get x. And the right hand side,"
,,"20 divided by 5 is 4, and we would have solved it. Another way to do it, and this"
,,"is actually the exact same way, we're just phrasing"
,,"it a little different. If you said 5x equals 20,"
,,"instead of dividing by 5, we could multiply by 1/5. And if you look at that, you can"
,,realize that multiplying by 1/5 is the same thing
,,"as dividing by 5, if you know the difference"
,,between dividing and multiplying fractions. And then that gets the
,,"same thing, 1/5 times 5 is 1, so you're just"
,,left with an x equals 4. I tend to focus a
,,little bit more on this because when we start having
,,"fractions instead of a 5, it's easier just to think about"
,,"multiplying by the reciprocal. Actually, let's do one"
,,of those right now. So let's say I had negative
,,"3/4 times x equals 10/13. Now, this is a harder problem. I can't do this one in my head. We're saying negative"
,,3/4 times some number x is equal to 10/13. If someone came up to you on
,,"the street and asked you that, I think you'd be like me,"
,,and you'd be pretty stumped. But let's work it
,,"out algebraically. Well, we do the same thing. We multiply both sides"
,,"by the coefficient on x. So the coefficient, all that"
,,"is, all that fancy word means, is the number that's"
,,being multiplied by x. So what's the
,,"reciprocal of minus 3/4. Well, it's minus 4/3 times,"
,,"and dot is another way to use times, and"
,,"you're probably wondering why in algebra, there"
,,are all these other conventions for doing times
,,as opposed to just the traditional
,,"multiplication sign. And the main reason is, I think,"
,,just a regular multiplication sign gets confused
,,"with the variable x, so they thought of either using"
,,"a dot if you're multiplying two constants, or just writing"
,,it next to a variable to imply you're
,,multiplying a variable. So if we multiply the left
,,"hand side by negative 4/3, we also have to"
,,do the same thing to the right hand
,,"side, minus 4/3. The left hand side, the"
,,"minus 4/3 and the 3/4, they cancel out. You could work it out on"
,,"your own to see that they do. They equal 1, so we're just"
,,"left with x is equal to 10 times minus 4 is minus 40, 13 times"
,,"3, well, that's equal to 39. So we get x is equal"
,,to minus 40/39. And I like to leave
,,my fractions improper because it's easier
,,to deal with them. But you could also view
,,that-- that's minus-- if you wanted to write it
,,"as a mixed number, that's minus 1 and 1/39. I tend to keep it like this. Let's check to make"
,,sure that's right. The cool thing about algebra is
,,you can always get your answer and put it back into
,,the original equation to make sure you are right. So the original equation
,,"was minus 3/4 times x, and here we'll substitute"
,,"the x back into the equation. Wherever we saw x, we'll"
,,"now put our answer. So it's minus 40/39, and"
,,"our original equation said that equals 10/13. Well, and once"
,,"again, when I just write the 3/4 right next to"
,,"the parentheses like that, that's just another"
,,way of writing times. So minus 3 times minus
,,"40, it is minus 100-- Actually, we could do"
,,something a little bit simpler. This 4 becomes a 1
,,and this becomes a 10. If you remember when you're
,,"multiplying fractions, you can simplify it like that. So it actually becomes"
,,"minus-- actually, plus 30, because we have a minus times"
,,"a minus and 3 times 10, over, the 4 is now 1, so all"
,,"we have left is 39. And 30/39, if we divide the"
,,"top and the bottom by 3, we get 10 over 13, which"
,,is the same thing as what the equation said
,,"we would get, so we know that we've got"
,,the right answer. Let's do one more problem. Minus 5/6x is equal to 7/8. And if you want to
,,"try this problem yourself, now's a"
,,"good time to pause, and I'm going to start"
,,doing the problem right now. So same thing. What's the reciprocal
,,"of minus 5/6? Well, it's minus 6/5. We multiply that. If you do that on"
,,"the left hand side, we have to do it on the"
,,"right hand side as well. Minus 6/5. The left hand side, the"
,,minus 6/5 and the minus 5/6 cancel out. We're just left with x. And the right hand
,,"side, we have, well, we can divide both"
,,"the 6 and the 8 by 2, so this 6 becomes negative 3. This becomes 4. 7 times negative"
,,3 is minus 21/20. And assuming I haven't
,,"made any careless mistakes, that should be right. Actually, let's just"
,,"check that real quick. Minus 5/6 times minus 21/20. Well, that equals"
,,"5, make that into 1. Turn this into a 4. Make this into a 2. Make this into a 7. Negative times"
,,negative is positive. So you have 7. 2 times 4 is 8. And that's what we
,,said we would get. So we got it right. I think you're
,,ready at this point to try some level one equations. Have fun.

AlgebraicExpression,-6BxSBRWQ2o,hello graduate children today i'm here to teach you chapter 6 in your textbook that's solids so what are solids take a stone that's a solid 3d figure a cuboid a brick a dye so those are solid so you get different shapes in this lesson we'll discuss certain types of solids so what are solids object that has a specific shape and which occupies a certain amount of space is called a solid surfaces of solids can be curved or play so take a thin biscuit tin so you get curved surface as well as plane surfaces and when you take a cube cuboid you get only plane surfaces so you get different types of solids with curved as well as plane surfaces so you need to know what are these terms we we can say vertices f is faces and e edges we'll see what are edges faces and vertices in certain solids first shape that you have to learn about a cube what is a cube all sides you get squares all sides are equal now we will look at a cube and see what are edges vertices and faces so i have a model with me so this is a cube when you take one side that's a square so when you turn this way you get squares now first thing we need to look at number of faces so how many faces are there so one two three four five six so six faces are there number of edges so these lines are called edges so 1 2 3 4 and 5 6 7 8 and sideways 9 10 11 
,,12 so all together 12 edges are there number of vertices vertices are these points 1 2 3 4 other side another four four plus four eight so when you look at this diagram you can figure out number of faces one two three four five six and vertices 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and number of edges 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 12 edges are there now we'll find out what's the sum of faces and edges faces and vertices v plus f vertices plus faces b is eight and six so eight plus six you get fourteen now take e plus two edges plus two edges twelve 12 plus 2 also you are getting 14. so what can you say about this we can write v plus f vertices plus faces is equal to edges plus two so vertices plus faces is equal to edges plus two so this is called euler's relationship so euler found out that he's a mathematician he found out the vertices 
,,and phases when you add it it's equal to the edges plus 2. now we look at these shapes first one is a cuboid like a brick second one a cube a dye a regular tetrahedron so here all sides are triangles and a square pyramid so you get a square in the base and all the other sides are triangles and a triangular prism means you get two triangles and you get three rectangles so that's called a triangular prism so these all are solids a regular regular means all sides are equal now we'll take those shapes and identify vertices faces and edges take the first one what do you call that a cuboid how many vertices are there one two three four five six seven eight how many faces like cube you get six faces edges you can count 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12. so 12 edges are there so same as a cube b is a cube we did that before so you get same number of vertices spaces and it's just like the cubot see a regular tetrahedron have you seen a regular tetrahedra so i'll show you this is a regular tetrahedron all sides you get triangles but regular means this is like isosceles triangles here but if all sides are equal we call it regular tetrahedron so c regular 
,,tetrahedron now we'll see how many vertices are there one two three four how many faces one two three and bottom so you get four edges one two three four five six six edges are there so you can use this diagram as well so here from this one two three four four vertices and one two three four five six six edges and four faces now take d d is a square pyramid so how many vertices are there one two three four five how many faces one two three four and bottom you get five how many edges one two three four five six seven 8 and e is a triangular prism so how many vertices are there one two three four five six six vertices are there how many faces one two three four five and how many edges one two three four five six seven eight nine nine edges are there now we'll see whether there's a relationship between vertices and faces with edges plus 2. so the first one a cuboid you get 8 plus 6 that's 14. 12 plus 2 that's 14. so these two are equal equal euler's relationship is true b is a cube same as cuboid you get 14 yeah 12 plus 2 you get 40. so that's also true but c is a regular tetrahedra regular tetrahedron four four six four four and six here so what you get four plus four eight six plus two eight so you are getting the same so euler's relationship is true d we found five five eight five five and here it just eight five and five ten eight plus two also ten so we can say euler's relationship is true for d as well what about e e is a triangular prism six five nine six five nine so 6 plus 5 11 9 plus 2 that's 11 so same thing so euler's relationship is true so what can you say about all these solids we can say v plus f is equal to e plus 2 so if you write down the words this is vertices this faces is equal to edges plus 2. now we'll look at this solid regular octahedron so what is octahedra means octa means eight eight sides are there so how can we create that so can you see one two three four five six seven eight triangles are there so regular means all sides are equal so these are equilateral triangles so when you take eight equilateral triangles you can create this regular octahedron so cut out the above figure and prepare a model of regular octahedron by folding along these edges examine and identify the special features of the model so we'll see what are the features what are the vertices edges and faces in regular octahedral so i have a model to show you so this is the regular octahedron eight sides are there so there are how many faces you get eight equilateral triangles so eight faces are there all phases are the shape of identical equilateral triangles there are how many vertices one two three 
,,four five and this one six so there are six vertices in a regular octahedron and how many straight edges are there one two three four and here also four four and four eight and here around this eight plus four you get 12 straight edges in a regular octahedron length of the edges are equal because we say this is a regular octahedral so all sides are equal edges intersect to make a vertex so this is a vertex how many edges intersect one two three four four edges intersect to make a vertex point how many faces intersect to make a vertex point one two three four four faces also when it intersects it makes a vertex point so this is a vertex point now remember this one to make a regular octahedral you need eight equilateral triangles so practice to draw the net to make the regular octahedron the next solid shape you need to know is about dodecahedron so dodeca means 12 12 faces are there so what are these shapes five-sided figure pentagons so one two three four five six 7 8 9 10 11 12 12 regular pentagons when you connect together you get dodecahedron this is a regular dodecahedron with 12 faces it consists of 12 regular pentagons with same area so cut out the above figure and prepare a model of regular dodecahedron by folding along these edges examine and identify the special features of the model practice to draw the net to make regular dodecahedron so we'll see what are the vertices edges and faces so i'll show you a model for that so this is a regular dodecahedron so all these are pentagons now we'll see how many phases i told you dodeca means dodecagon means 12 faces 12-sided polygon so 12 faces are there so remember that it's 12 faces all faces are the shape of identical regular pentagons there are how many vertices now we'll see how many vertices are there so we can take up there are five and down also five five and five ten what about around this we'll start from this vertex point 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 so we counted this one 10 so 5 and 5 10 10 
,,plus 10 20 20 vertices are there and there are edges how many edges are there one two three four five five above five down and here another five and another five so 
,,five ten twenty now what about a round we'll start from this line one two three four five six seven 8 9 10. so we counted this one so 10 and 10 10 all together 30 straight edges are in a regular dodecahedron so length of the edges are equal because this is a regular dodecahedron now we'll take another solid means 20 20 phases are there this is used to decorate christmas trees and take as visa planters so how can we make the ecosahedral you need 20 equilateral triangles cut out the above figure and prepare a model of regular ecosahedral by folding along edges examine and identify the special features of the model so we'll see how many edges vertices and faces in ecosahedron so this is an ecosahedral i'll show you a model so this is ecosahedra so how many equilateral triangles are there so you get 20 equilateral triangles so remember this is 20 20 faces are there all phases are the shape of identical equilateral triangles and how many vertices are there so count and see one one two three four five so here around five so 1 plus 5 6. so you get the same thing here 6 and 6 12 so you get 12 vertices in a regular because a hadron and how many edges are there so 1 2 3 4 5 and down also 5 and we need to count this way 5 this way 5 so 5 5 10 15 20 now now we will see side how many edges are there we'll start 
,,from this slide one two three four five six seven 8 9 10. so we started from this point so 10 there so all together how many edges are there 30. so 30 straight edges in a regular cosahedron length of the edges are equal because this is a regular ecosahedron now we'll fill in the blanks using previous solids so can you remember regular tetrahedra how many vertices we got one and then three so four faces three triangles and below four edges six so what's v plus f faces n vertices 4 plus 4 you get 8. and e edges we got 6 6 plus 2 you get 8. so what can you say about euler's relationship that's true cube can you remember cube how many vertices 8 and faces 
,,6 and edges 12 so when you take v plus f 8 plus 6 that's 14 12 plus 2 also 14. so that means euler's relationship is true regulo-octahedron now we look at this one regulo-octahedron octa means eight so eight faces are there and can you remember we did that we got six vertices and 12 edges now we'll see vertices plus faces 6 plus 8 you get 14 and edges plus 2 you get 40. so that's true eyeless relationship is true now regular dodecahedron dodeca means 12 phases so remember that and then we got 30 edges and 20 vertices now we'll see whether it's true 20 plus 12 you get 32 and 30 plus 2 also 32 so that's true and regular ecosystem ecosa means 20 spaces so remember that one 20 faces are there and we got this one 12 and this is 30. so what's v plus f so 12 plus 20 is 32 and 30 plus 2 also 32. so this is true for this solid as well so how can we remember these edges vertices and faces look at this one so easily you can remember regular tetrahedron and cube here this is cuboid cube 
,,and cuboid you get the same thing and here octahedron remember this 8 and then dodecahedron remember 12 and 32 then you can fill the other values and regulators are 
,,hydrogen also remember 20 and 32 so when you subtract you get the same here same ages for both regular dodecahedron and regular ecosystem what are platonic solids you have learned five types of regular solids that are introduced by the mathematician plato so therefore we call it as platonic solids having identical regular polygonal phases the same number of phases meeting at every vertex so in platonic solids we know that vertices plus phases is equal to edges plus two so platonic means regular polygonal phases what are they we learned about that regular tetrahedra cube regular octahedron regular dodecahedron regular ecosahedra those are the five platonic solids now we'll look at this question select the nets which cannot be constructed a cube now look at carefully this one you can make a cube so this is the bottom surface and then you can create the cube by folding these along these edges so this is okay you can create a cube but what happens here when you keep this one as the base you can create all sides but what happens to the top part so you can't create a cube there this one here when you fold it these two sides come this way but we can't fold this one to make a cube so you can't make the top part so this is also wrong and what about this one bottom is here so you get two faces here and when you put it up you can create a cube so you can create here a cube there label the given nets of cubes which the sum of opposite sides is equal to 7 so that means if you take up and butter the sum should be 7 so here one done for you so when you create this one this is the bottom and you get this is the uppermost part so 5 plus 2 
,,7. so likewise you are getting opposite side how can we create another one so you can put any number there if this is 4 so this is the upper part for this one so 4 plus 3 that's 7. if this is 6 this and this side you need to get 7 and 5 with 2 you can put any number we'll put 5 there if this is 5 this should be 2 because this is up and down and here side these two so you can put 1 and 6 there and here if this is 4 this should be 3 so you can create you can put any number and see to get the 
,,sum of opposite sides is equal to 7 from which net that can be constructed a square pyramid here this is a square and you get four triangles now you can close this side and this side what about this side we can't connect this one here so you can't create a square pyramid from this then you take this one this comes here and then 
,,you can fold it and create a square pyramid here so that's correct this one you can fold it here and here but you can't close it from this triangle so you can't create so what's the number number two is the correct diagram below is a composite solid made out of a cube and a square pyramid find out number of phases vertices and edges and check whether euler's relationship satisfies the satisfies for the solid now consider faces here when you take the cuboid cube you're not getting six faces 
,,because here the upper part is closed with this pyramid so you get five here and what about this one so you get 4 4 plus 5 9 9 faces are there vertices will count vertices 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 9 vertices are there edges 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12. 13 14 15 16 16 edges are there now we'll add faces and vertices faces and vertices nine plus 9 so you get 18. e plus 2 16 plus 2 you get 18. so what can you say about the euler's relationship it's true below is a triangular prism find out number of phases vertices and edges and check where the euler's relationship satisfy for the solid now faces two triangles and three rectangles so three plus two five faces are there vertices one two three four five six six vertices are there edges one two three four five six seven eight nine now we let faces and vertices 5 plus 6 you get 
,,11. e plus 2 edges 9 9 plus 2 11. so what can you say about euler's relationship that's true below is a prism with cross-section as trapezium find out number of faces vertices and edges and check whether euler's relationship satisfy for the solid faces so you get one two three four five six so like a cube six faces are there vertices one two three four five six seven eight edges one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve so same as a cube or cuboid faces plus vertices you get 6 plus 8 that's 14 edges plus 2 12 plus 2 you get 14. so both are the same so you can write the euler's relationship is true below is a prism with cross-section as trapezium find our number of phases vertices and edges and check whether euler's relationship satisfy for the solid now same as before so how many faces are there one two three four five six six faces are there vertices one two three four five six seven eight eight vertices edges one 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 12 edges are there now add faces and vertices you get 6 plus 8 that's 14 e plus 2 means 12 plus 2 that's 14. so you get same as this so euler's relationship is true below is a prism with cross section as trapezium find out number of phases vertices and edges and check whether euler's relationship satisfies for the solid how many faces one two 
,,three four five and the bottom one six vertices 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 edges 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 and here this one 12 we can't see that but it's behind so 12 f plus v faces plus vertices 6 plus 8 you get 14 edges plus 2 12 plus 2 that's also 14. so you get euler's relationship is true now we'll look at review exercise fill in the blanks in the table given below a cuboid so can you remember 12 edges six faces and eight vertices so cube is the same as cuboid so 12 6 8 regular tetrahedron tetrahedron you can draw a triangle like this and another triangle here and you can connect so this is a regular tetrahedron how many faces one two three four faces four edges we'll count vertices first one two three four and edges one two three 5 6 6 edges square pyramid how can you draw a square pyramid you can first draw a square and take any vertex point and connect all these then so that's a square pyramid how many edges are there one two three four five six seven eight eight edges are there 
,,faces so four around and bottom one that's five vertices one two three four five and triangular prism how can you draw a triangular prism you can draw a triangle here another triangle and then connect all sides like this this is a triangular prism how many edges one two three four five six seven eight nine nine edges are there how many faces one two three four five five faces and how many vertices one two three four five six six vertices are there draw nets that can be used to construct the following solids a square pyramid so how can you draw square pyramid means a square and four triangles so you need to draw a square here and then triangles around so these sides are equal so that means these also needs to be equal so all sides are equal so that's a square pyramid triangular prism you need you need two triangles and three rectangles so you can take three rectangles like this and two triangles there when you fold it you can get a triangular prism question number three a figure of a solid constructed by pasting together two triangular faces of two identical regular tetrahedrons one on the other is given here find the number of edges faces and vertices of the solid so we look at number of faces f f is number of faces so you get here one two three four five six six faces are there then how many edges 
,,are there edges one two three four five six seven eight nine nine edges how many vertices one two three four five v equals five now we'll see whether the euler's relationship is true vertices plus faces so v equals 5 plus phaser 6 you get 11. now we'll check e plus 2 edges is 9 9 plus 2 you get 11. so in this one vertices plus faces is equal to e plus 2. so euler's relationship is true a solid constructed by joining a cube and a square pyramid is shown in the figure find the number of edges phases and vertices of this solid so we'll find out edges edges 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 edges are there how many vertices are there one two three four 5 6 7 8 9 9 vertices are there how many faces are there one two three four and four around here this is for the cube you can take five except the top part so five 
,,plus 4 9. now we'll check whether the euler's relationship is true v plus f 9 plus 9 you get 18. edges plus 2 16 plus 2 also 18. now can you see v plus f is equal to edges plus 2 so euler's relationship is true exercise 6.1 name the solid which can be constructed using each net given below so rectangles and two another rectangles this is a q void this one one two three four four triangles tetrahedron here it's not mentioned all sides are equal if it's all sides are equal this is a regular tetrahedra so one side is an equilateral triangle now how many faces are there one two three four five six seven eight eight faces what's the name regular octahedron 
,,if all sides are equal we call it a regular one regular octahedra then this is six squares so what you call that cue cube not cuboid cube this one two triangles and 
,,three rectangles triangular prism how many triangles are there one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twenty means ecosa ecosahedron so this is regular ecosa hedron exercise 6.2 verify euler's relationship for a regular tetrahedron by considering the number of phases vertices and edges it has so it's easy to draw a regular tetrahedron so big triangle and a small triangle like this and then connect so this is tetrahedral and how many vertices are there so how many vertices are there we'll count one two three four four vertices are there how many edges you can count one two three four five six and how many faces one two three four so around three and bottom one that's four so four six four now we'll verify euler's relationship so according to euler's relationship v plus f vertices plus faces is equal to edges plus 2. now left hand side v plus f 4 plus 4 you get 8 right hand side edges six plus two you get eight so left hand side is equal to right hand side so you can say it's true euler's relationship is true for this solid that's regular tetrahedron look at question number two for a square pyramid write down the number of faces vertices and edges show that the above values satisfy euler's relationship square 
,,pyramid so you can draw a square like this and connect to a point so this is a square base pyramid and now you can count how many vertices one two three four five how many faces one down and four triangles four plus one five faces are there and how many edges edges i can use one two three four five six seven eight now we'll see 
,,whether euler's relationship is true v plus f is e plus 2 vertices 5 faces 5 so you get 10 here edges 8 plus 2 this is also 10 so left hand side is equal to right hand side so this is true euler's relationship is true for square pyramid question number three if a certain solid has nine edges six vertices and if euler's relationship is satisfied find the number of faces it has so we know according to the euler's relation vertices plus faces is edges plus two we know how many vertices are there six many edges 9 now we need to find out how many phases so we'll put f for faces and we'll try to solve the equation 9 plus 2 11. 6 plus f is 11 so what's f subtract 6 from both sides so 11 minus 6 you get 5 so 5 faces question number 4 a figure of a composite solid is shown here determine with reasons where the euler's relationship is satisfied for this solid so we need to count vertices faces edges now we'll see vertices one two three four five six seven eight nine faces one two three four five and then four around four triangles five plus four nine edges itches 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 edges now we'll see whether it's true v plus f is e plus 2 now we'll check v is 9 phase is 9 so left hand side is 18. what about right hand side e means 16 plus 2 so you get 18 here so left hand side is equal to right hand side so this is true for this solid question number five a certain solid has ten edges six faces find the number of vertices it has if euler's relationship is satisfied so here what's the equation v plus f is e plus two we vertices so you need to find out that f six faces is given ten edges now if it's true this satisfy so you can solve the equation v plus 6 is equal to 10 plus 2 12 subtract 6 from both sides you get v equals 12 minus 6 so six vertices question number six the figure given here shows a pyramid of which the upper portion has been cut out and removed verify euler's relationship for this solid okay so we'll find out number of vertices one two three four five six seven eight vertices are there how many edges one one two three 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 and how many faces so here four around four 
,,and then two upper face and the bottom face so six now we'll check whether this is true we plus f equals e plus 2 left-hand side we 8 plus 6 and e is 12 plus 2 so 8 
,,plus 6 is 14 12 plus 2 is 14 so this is left hand side and this is right hand side this is equal so two sides are equal therefore euler's relationship is true for this solid exercise 6.3 complete the table given below so cube shape of the face of the solid we know that's that's a square are all the faces regular yes regular are 
,,the number of phases meeting at each vertex equal equal so when you take one point one two three so when you take this one also one two three so equal number of faces meeting a text number of faces also equal number of edges one two three one two three so three edges meet at vertex and three phases meet at a vertex is the solid 
,,a platonic solid platonic solids those are regular ones yes that's a regular one now we'll take cuboid so when you take a cuboid you can get square or a rectangle so are all the faces regular no rectangles two opposite sides are equal not all sides are equal not regular are the number of phases meeting at each vertex equal if you take this vertex number of faces one two three if this is the vertex one two three so that's equal number of phases meeting at a vertex point so how many three is 
,,the solid a platonic solid no this is not regular it's not a platonic solid regular tetrahedron so each one is a equilateral triangle so each shape is an equilateral triangle so that's regular are the number of faces meeting at each vertex equal if you take this one one two three here get one two three yes equal and it's three and is the solid a platinic solid yes because this is a regular one this one regular octahedral so regular means all sides are equal and octahedron eight sides are there each one is equilateral triangle so this is regular and if you take this vertex how many sides are there four if you take this one one two three four so equal and what's the number that's four so yes this is a platonic solid more shapes are there regular dodecahedron dodeca means 12 sided figure so each side it's a regular pentagon all the faces regular yes i'll write regular are the number of phases meeting at each vertex equal we'll look at it if you take this one one two three if you take this one one two three yes equals and three vertices three phases meet at one vertex is a solid a platonic solid yes because this is regular regular ecosahedra how many sides 20 triangles are there so that's regular one and what you call that equilateral triangles are there so that's regular and we'll check if you take this vertex how many faces one two three four five if you take this one one two three four five five faces meet at one vertex point that's equal and this is a platonic 
,,shape so you can write down that's here's a platonic solid and the last one is a composite solid consisting of a cuboid and a square pyramid so what are the shapes you are getting now we look at the last one composite solid consists of a cuboid and a square pyramid so cuboid means a rectangle squares you can get so you can get rectangle square and here equilateral triangles and are these regular no because rectangles are there so not regular and are the number of faces meeting at each vertex equal we'll check if you take this one you get one two three four if you take one point here this one you get one two three four if you take this point you get only three so that means it's not equal we can't give exact numbers so sometimes three sometimes four so is the solid a platonic no it's not a platonic solid question number two construct a regular ecosahedron and 20 regular tetrahedron such that the ecosahedral and the tetrahedrons have edges of equal length construct a composite 
,,solid by pasting a tetrahedron on each phase of the ecosahedron for the composite figure and find out the number of edges and the number of phases and the number of 
,,vertices so this means when you take 20 tetra regular tetrahedrons and when you paste it what you get you get a ecosahedral so you get an ecosystem so here if you take this one ecosahedral so and this is tetrahedron if all sides are equal here when you paste it 20 of these equivalent to one ecosahedral so basically they are asking number of edges number of phases and number of vertices of a of an ecosahedron solid so that means you know already ecosahedron is how many faces 20 faces so here number of faces 20 and then remember 32 32 is the total then number of edges is 32 minus 2 that's 30 this is number of vertices is how you get 32 you are adding 12 
,,to that so 30 20 and 12. from the following select the platonic solids and write down the corresponding numbers so this is not regular not a platonic so here this is a platonic shape that's cube this is a platonic shape regular tetrahedron and here this can be a square so this is not a regular one and here this is a regular one 
,,so if this is 12 sides one so we call this is this is 10. 10 plus 2 12 sides are there so what you call that that's dodecahedron and this is it can be a square or a 
,,rectangle here so it is not regular so you can't take that one and prism is also not a regular one so that's not platonic solid and what's this this is ecosahedron ecosahedron is 20. equilateral triangles are there so what are the shapes now look at this one here you get eight faces and equilateral triangles we can say regular octahedron so that's a platonic solid and prism is not a platonic solid it's not regular and what is this 20 faces with all equilateral triangles ecosatran is a platonic shape so what are the platonic shapes two three five six and eight they are called platonic solids again what are the platonic solids regular tetrahedral cube regular octahedron regular dope decahedron and regular ecosahedra so you can remember tetra means four four faces are there octa eight faces are there dodeca dodeca means twelve twelve faces are they are eco means twenty faces and remember again what's the next thing you need to remember the total is 32 here as well as 32 yeah then easily you can find out the number of uh faces we know edges and vertices so remember octa means 80 octa means 8 dodeca means 12 picosa means twin so we covered all theory related to solids so what are the things we discussed the sum of the number of faces and the number of vertices of a solid with straight edges is two more than the number of edges so that's the euler's relationship solids having identical regular polygonal phases and with the same number of phases meeting at every vertex are called platonic solids the five types of regular tetrahedron cube regular octahedral regular dodecahedron and regular ecosahedrons are the only solids that are platonic solids so remember these words and we know the shapes you are getting so remember all these and number of faces edges and vertices so you can remember easily for ecosahedron the total is 32 and 20 faces dodecahedron 32 is the total and 12 faces are there octa-octahedron eight phases are there and cuban cuboid both got 
,,same number of faces and vertices so practice and try to make all these solids and figure out number of edges vertices and faces

AlgebraicExpression,CT9iX5osAs4,hello grade 8 children today I am here with another new topic we'll see what's the topic about you have done numbers two plus three and a half minus five oh you have done point three plus 95 so all these are with numbers so we call this is number theory then you have done straight lines circles squares parallel lines and angles 
,,all are these geometry what about letters what are these two x plus three Y minus five plus three X letters and numbers combination we call that algebra so today we 
,,are doing about algebra so what's the topic chapter five algebraic expression so we'll find out what are the terms involved in this uni and what are the concepts look at this one the price of a coconut is 48 rupees the distance from Colombo to Gul is hundred kilometers there are 31 days in the month of January Ravinder gets 80 points in mathematics course so what are they is 48 130 180 what are those those are numbers if I ask you a question what's the height of a student in grade 8 class so we can't give a specific value usually the height of the students in the class will be different from one another so therefore we need to define a term called variable so what's variable changing values of height as it is not a fixed number so when you don't get a fixed number when the value is changing we call those are variables we use algebraic terms or expressions to denote changing values so we'll take height as a letter so we use algebraic expression like x today not changing values any letter this one profit varies from one day to another day from Nima's three-wheeler so it's changing all the time it can be named as I'll put a receipt a so what's a it's a variable because it's changing all the time this one radius of three circles are three centimetres four centimetres and five centimetres respectively when we consider radius of the circle we can take this one is R that's a variable we can use a letter so what's the R value we can write R equals three centimeters R equals four centimeters that our equals five centimeters so what's the variable they are our that's the radius of the circle this one city does a bias certain number 
,,"of string hoppers to sell in his boutique every day if we do not know the number exactly can show it as another variable we'll take simple B where B is an unknown set we don't know exactly the amount of string hoppers that city dancer buys look at this one in the figure above shows three containers of the same size all three containers contain an equal amount of liquid it can be considered as what you can use another letter H because it is an unknown constant because we don't know exactly what's the water level is so here what's the variable H height of water so lowercase letters such as a b c or you can put X Y Z so any simple lowercase letters we can use to represent variables so it can be an unknown constant or a variable look at this one the daily income of poachers fruit shop can be stated as X so what is X they are jail income he saved his income by 2,000 rupees a day find the remaining amount of money what's the total income X he's saving to thousand rupees each day so what's the remaining amount you can write in terms of X X is the total value daily income subtract 2000 so the remaining amount is X minus 2000 so this is an algebraic expression so what are the terms terms in this algebraic expression we can write x an mm so those are called terms of algebraic expression so what are the terms "
,,you learn now you learned about variable and we can use simple letters for variables and the next term is terms of an algebraic expression look at this one the price of a coconut is extra base the price of 8 coconut so what you do you have to multiply by 8 so one coconut is x and x 8 so what's the value you get 8x rupees so what are the terms you can say 8x is an algebraic term and the number in front of the letter here X is the variable the number in front of the letter is called coefficient so what's the coefficient in this term 8 8 is the coefficient of the algebraic term we learned about variables terms and coefficient now look at this one combination of algebraic terms 5x plus 3y minus 4z that's called algebraic expression so what are these 5 x 3y minus 4 are the algebraic terms and what about this one the number in front of the letter what you call that coefficients coefficients and terms the width of the rectangle is X its length is 7 its length is 7 meters more than the rich right the algebraic expression for the length so how can we write down length 7 more than that ex-mo more means in maths plus addition X plus 7 is the length so what's the algebraic expression for length X plus 7 if the length of the rectangle is wild now they have given this one is y if this one is y write down the algebraic expression for width we know the width is 7 meters less than the length so we can write by -7 if you take length as Y that's Y minus 7 is the weight the price 
,,of a pen is extra pays the cost of a pencil is why rupees the price of a book is 0 please so what about price of three prints one is X and 3 you have to multiply by 
,,3 3 X 3 times X you don't need to write down the multiplication sign you can write 3x price of 4 pencils one pencil is why 4 pencils for y price of several books one book is zero Peas seven books 7z give the cost of buying all the above in the form of an algebraic expression so the total cost we can add it together 3x plus 4y plus 7c that's an algebraic expression write the terms of this algebraic expression so you have given an algebraic expression what are the terms 3x for bi and 7z coefficient of 3 X we know what is coefficient means the number in front of the letter that's 3 coefficient of 4y what's the number in front that's four coefficient of 77 is the coefficient there build algebraic expression for the following statements we'll try to write in terms of letters you can take these letters given add 7 to the double of X what if double means 2 times X so adding 7 to double of X means 2x 2x plus 7 subtract 6 from the 3 times of X but if three times means 3x 3x and you have to subtract 6 subtract 3 from the sum of x and y sum of x and y means the addition X plus 1 and subtract 3 divided by y how you divide we can write x over 1 divide X by y and subtract from seven so that turns that you have to subtract from seven that means seven - so we'll write seven minus x over Y not X over Y minus 7 because from 7 you have to subtract this amount divided the multiplication of a and B multiplication of a and B by 3 means a B divided by 3 divided the multiplication of 
,,a and B by 3 and subtract from 10 from 10 means 10 minus this value filling the gaps in the following table algebraic expressions are there as you break terms so you have to write down only algebraic terms so what are the algebraic terms 7 x + 3 by what's the coefficient 7 & 3 what are the I do break terms here 6a + 3 B here you don't write down these constants algebraic terms means only terms with letters what are the coefficients 6 & 3 here Excel why hyphens are 1 and 1 in this one 3 a coefficient is 3 this one - 3 X + 7 5 coefficients are -3 here and so this one you get a fraction but here this is an algebraic term 2x over 3 you can write X in the numerator and 3 by over 5 also an algebraic term then what's the coefficient you have to take the whole thing the fraction 2/3 three fits this one this is an algebraic term 5x over 7 and minus 2y over 3 so what's the coefficient there five over seven is the coefficient of x term and minus two-thirds is the coefficient of weiter look at this question the cost of an arranges extra pays the cost of an apple is y rupees the cost of a mango is zero peas build algebraic expressions for the following price of two oranges and five mangoes oranges is X so 2x plus because this is both together five mangoes one mango easy five mangoes 5z price of two mangoes and seven apples two mangoes is to Z and seven apples Apple is why rupee so 7 y cost of six oranges and eight apples six oranges one orange is X plus six six and eight apples one Apple is why that's eight why price of five oranges seven apples and three mangos five oranges that's 5 X 7 apples 7 y then 3 mangoes 3z question number five cost of one orange one apple and two mangoes one Apple is why and one orange is X and two mangoes - Z - look at this one right down the algebraic expression for the total cost to buy three kilos of sugar two kilos of Thailand five kilos of flour we are one kilo of each product is a rupees be rupees and C rupees respectively so what are the values total cost we need three kilos of sugar so sugar is a so three a five kilos then two kilos of Dar Daly's be rupees to be and five kilos of flour flour is C rupees of five C next one one kilo of red dollies extra peas and one kilo of yellow dollies why rupees write down an algebraic expression for the extra mounts pen for buying five kilos of yellow da then three kilos of red that means the price is high when you buy five kilos of yellow da so what's the difference five 
,,kilos of yellow doll yellow one is by rupees 5 i- three kilos of red on red dollies extra piece per kilo so 3x so the difference is this well the capacity of a bucket days M liters and bucket B is in liters you need to use 12 buckets of a and eight buckets of B at once to fill a tank what is the capacity of the track so what's the total amount of a buckets yeah 12 a buckets so M liters are there so 12 M then what about from B buckets so need eight buckets of B each bucket contained in liters so eight and so the capacity of the tank is 12 m + 8 in the father's age in one of the families years the age of the mother is beers the daughter's age is Sears give the sum of ages of the father and mother in the form of an algebraic expression fathers ages a mother's ages B so the total is a plastic give the sum of the age of the mother and daughter in the form of an algebraic expression mother's age is B daughters ages the total of the ages of the father mother and dot all three of them a plus B plus C write the sum of the total age of the three above after 10 years in the form of an algebraic expression so we have to add 10 for each value 10 and 
,,10 and 10 for all three people that means 30 so the total value is a plus B plus C plus 30 so after 10 years this is the total value manufacturers men extra piece to make a table the manufacturer made a profit of twice as much as the cost price and sold it to a retailer the retailer solely to the consumer with a profit of by rupees right the profit of the manufacturer in the form of an algebraic expression so how can you write down an algebraic expression manufacture a spend X to make a table that's the cost value the manufacturer made a profit of twice as much as the cost price so what's the profit to X so write the profit of the manufacturer in the form of an algebraic expression err so that's 2x give the selling price of the table by the manufacturer in the form of an algebraic expression so the profit is 2x and the cost price is X so what's the selling price X plus 2x when you add it that's 3x so that's the selling price right the selling price of the retailer to the consumer in the form of an algebraic expression now the retailer sold it to the consumer with a profit of Y rupees so this is the price this retailer bought that means 3 X and he keeps by rupee profit so you have to add Y so this is the selling price of the retailer to the consumer the shape shown in the above is a square and a rectangle made out of matchsticks give the perimeter of the square in the form of an algebraic expression one side is given X for sides and there X plus X plus X plus X 
,,what's the perimeter for X give the perimeter of the rectangle in the form of an algebraic expression how you find out the perimeter you have to add all these lengths so a plus 2b plus a plus 2b a and a you are getting 2 a 2b and 2b when you add 2 plus 2 4 that's 4 B give the full length of the matchsticks used to construct the 
,,above images in the form of an algebraic expression so total length so length for the squares for X and length for this one is 2a plus 4b subtract the total length of the matchsticks used to make the square from the total length of the matchsticks used to make the rectangle in an algebraic expression so you have to subtract the 
,,lengths of matchsticks used to make the square from this one so what's the total here two way plus 4b and subtract the lengths for this one that's 4x look at this one give the perimeter of the equilateral triangle in the form of an algebraic expression equilateral means all sides I equal a and a n a what's the perimeter 3a right the perimeter of the write angular triangle in the form of an algebraic expression so just add all the lengths together we'll do that X plus X plus 2 plus X plus 1 
,,now you can simplify like terms you can add X X X 3x 2 & 1 that's right the total perimeter of the above diagrams in the form of an algebraic expression so this is the perimeter of the write angular triangle and is the parameter for the equilateral triangle so add it together 3 E + 3 X + 3 multiplying an algebraic expression by 
,,a number so we'll see how we can multiply the algebraic expression by a number width of the rectangle is X this is the width and the length is 1 determine the perimeter of the rectangle x + y + X + 1 so you can write down 2 times X plus y of x + alright separately x + y X plus y when you simplify you get 2 x + 2 I now I want to 
,,just separate these two parts this part separately and this part separately what's the length of this part when you separate this what's the length of this one x + y you get the same length here X + 1 so double of this x + y so length of one part is X plus y length of 2 parts you multiply by 2 so 2 times X plus 1 but we took the same diagram finding perimeter fully and taking separately you have to get the same answer so in both methods the perimeter of the same figure is equal so we can write down 2 x + y is equal to two x plus 2y now look at this one when there's a number in front you are multiplying both these X terms by two so when X plus y is x to both the terms x + y x - so now we observe when there's a number in front of an algebraic expression you have to multiply all terms with that number a box contains 
,,a red glass balls and B blue glass balls determine the total number of glass balls in such high boxes number of total ass balls in a box was that a plus B number of 
,,total glass balls in five boxes you have to multiply 5 times a plus B then number of red colored balls in a box separately there are a red color glass balls so number of red color balls in a box is a number of red glass balls in five boxes that's five B multiplied by five if you take separately blue ones how many blue ones are there be blue ones for five boxes you get five be blue ones in five boxes so what can you say about this one the total the total is now we can write total is 5 a + 5 
,,B the answer received in either of the two methods should be equal so in this case five times a plus B is equal to 5 a plus 5b now look at this one when you multiply by the constant each term you get this one remove the brackets of the following algebraic expressions now we can use that knowledge you gain from the previous two questions there's a number in front this is a minus B is the algebraic expression so what you do multiply the first term as shown by the first arrow so this is the first arrow multiply this value here 3 times a 3 and then multiply the second term as shown by the second arrow I'll put numbers this is one red one pink one is 1 and 
,,the other color I'll take blue so this one multiply this one that's two three times minus B minus 3b now we'll follow that multiply and give me the answer this one with this you get 5x this one with this five times minus y minus five now try first this one seven times m 7m then this one seven times n plus seven ten times P 10 P 
,,plus 10 times Q 10 Q here the arrows are used to show the order to multiply so here always first one we can take first one and this is the SEC and why remove the brackets using arrows now now you can do that I mean there's a number in front of the algebraic expression you have to multiply all terms in the algebraic expression inside the bracket by the outside number yes with this this with this 3 into X 3 X 3 into 2 y + 6 1 now do this 1 7 into a 7 a 7 into minus 4 B that means minus 28 eleven times tu-22m 11 times n 11 4 times 3 P 4 times 3 12 P 4 times minus 2q so that's minus 8q this one 6 times X 6 X 6 times minus 11 by minus 66 1 8 times 3 24h 8 x k8 now look at this one you get three terms but same thing you have to multiply each and every term by the outside number this one three times five a 15 a three times to be six be three times c plus 3 C now do that four times X for X for x - y - y 4 times 7 that's + 28 8 times 2 16 a 8 times 7 56 be 8 times C that's 8 say look 
,,at this one 2 times X - x - x - 7 y minus 14y 2 times 3 z 6z 4 times P 4 P 4 times minus 3q - 12 Q 4 times 2r 8 11 times M 11 M 11 times 3 n 33 and 11 times 2 11 times 2 22 with l22 multiplying an algebraic expression by a negative number so now there's a negative number in front so we'll practice first with negative minus 3 times a minus 3 minus 3 times B minus 3 B negative into positive always you get a negative answer negative 5 times X negative 5x negative 5 into negative Y now negative into negative positive plus 5 minus 1 into 3 minus 3 minus 1 into minus 2 B plus 2 B minus into plus minus and here 5 times 2 10 2 times 2 4 that's plus because minus into minus plus and you get B here 2 times 7 here - into plus minus 14 C now you know how to multiply so plus into plus plus plus into minus minus minus into plus minus and minus into minus plus now we'll remove the brackets so you need to first multiply the first one when this number minus 3 a minus 3 times B minus 3b minus 
,,5 X and here so minus 5x minus 5 minus y you get plus 5i we did that minus 3 a and here minus 3 a you get here - nothing means 1 so this is like 1 minus 1 into 3 a minus 3 minus 1 into minus 2 B that's plus 2b this one this one minus 2 times 3 a what's the value minus 2 times 3a minus 6a this one - two - 2b plus 4b and here - two times seven you get minus 14c remove the brackets now so use arrows to multiply minus 3x minus - plus 6y this one when you multiply minus - plus 3 times 2 6 minus 
,,3 times minus 7 plus 20 months what this one you have to multiply all three terms minus 5 a minus - plus 5 times 4 20 get be your minus 5 times C minus 5 see this one multiply minus 8 times a minus 8 a - eight - seven be multiplication + 56 8 times 7 56 B question number 5 - 7 into minus X plus 7 X minus 7 into 2 y minus 14y - 7 into minus c plus 7z here minus 11 times 2 X minus 22 X minus 11 times -3 plus 33 yeah do all these multiplications try 4 times X 4 X 4 times minus 7y minus 28 y 4 
,,times 5 20 minus 3 times a minus 3 minus minus plus 21 B minus in 2 plus minus 24 6 here minus 11 times 2 minus 22 X here minus minus plus 11 times 3 plus 33 Y here 
,,you get minus 22 this one multiply minus 6 times 2 minus 12 minus 6 minus 7 plus 42 and minus 6 and minus 5 plus 13 this one minus 10 into minus 3 plus 30 minus 10 times chobe - 20 B and minus 10 times sake - 10 see what about this one - 4 times 3 H minus 12 which minus 4 times minus 4 plus 16 K minus 4 times minus 4 plus 60 now we're do multiplying an algebraic term by another algebraic term earlier we multiply by a constant now multiplying by an algebraic term 3x + 4 y how we multiply 3x 
,,times 4 1 so what we do we multiply that numbers first 3 times 4 12 and then x + y so without writing we can write without writing multiplication sign 12x what this 
,,one multiplication 7b into foil we can multiply separately the number 7 times 4 and then be a 7 times 4 28 be a it is better to write down then letters in order 28 a B but this is not wrong VA is okay but it's better it is good to write the letters in English at alphabetical order this 1 minus 3 by minus 5 X so we can multiply minus 3 and minus 5 first and then Y and X minus 3 times minus 5 plus 15 y X you can write 15 X Y to a times 7 B now we'll multiply at once 2 times 7 14 a into B a B 
,,you can write at once 3 X into 5 y 3 times 5 15 X into y X Y now there's a bracket minus sign minus 7 times 3 minus 21 a times B a B this one Phi times -3 minus 15 M times n m in here minus 4 times minus 3 plus 12 a and B you can write a B for x minus seven minus twenty eight Y into X Y X or what's the better one x1 multiplication of an algebraic expression by an algebraic term find the area of the following two rectangles separately so what's the area of the rectangle this one is length into breadth or length into width so area of the rectangle is any times X so what's that the X what's the area of the other rectangle length is B width or break is X B times X VX sum of areas you can just add it a X plus B X now when you combine the two rectangles now you are getting a big rectangle two rectangles are merged in the above diagram what's the length of this rectangle length is a here B here a plus B what's the area of the rectangle now length is a plus B and the with operate is 
,,X so X into a plus B as same rectangles are merged areas are equal now what's the area we got before a X plus B X so we can write a X plus B X is same as X into a plus B now sick how do you get this one so when you multiply the expression here can you see you get a X plus B X it is required to multiply all the terms inside brackets given by the outside term remove the brackets using arrows first one is this second one is this a 2 X a X a into - why - a why B into X BX be in 2 - 3 y - 3 B by C into a see a or a see C into 7 B 7 BC so here you can write AC as well is C + 7 BC when you remove brackets using an arrow first draw an arrow and write it then draw the next arrow and write it we'll do that separately X into a exhale Oh a X X into minus B minus BX X into 2 C 2 CX of XE y into p YP y into 2q minus 2 Q minus 2 y qi qi y into our are Y now try into p a p a into 3 q 3 a key a into for our for a 2 a into X 2x - 3 y that is -6 a why this 1 3 b into m 3b 3b into 4 12 B 5 a into 2 X 10 X 5 a into minus 3y minus 15 a why here - -5 a into z5 a 0 minus 3 into X minus 3 X minus into - now you get plus 6 a 1 plus 6 a expand brackets without using arrows no will do without arrows 3p into x 3p x 3p into minus 2 y minus 6 P for a into 2 where 8 a 4 into minus 3n minus 12 a in this one minus 4 into X minus 4 a X minus 4 times minus 3/12 a y minus 11 8 into 2 B minus 22 a be minus 11 a into minus 3 C you get plus 33 a see this one 7 a mintue l 7m n 7m into 428 look at this diagram area of the entire rectangle length is X with this a so what's the area a times X shaded area now can you see this square with length a a into a or we can write a square area of the unshaded part so you have to subtract total area that's a X minus the shaded area e squared sum of two algebraic expressions when you are adding you have to consider like terms so like terms only you can add or subtract when you consider these two terms what can you do you can add a terms with a 2a and 
,,3a you can add and then 3b and 5b separately so what do you get 5a + 5 + 3 8 at the time of addition or subtraction you have to add or subtract the like terms remove brackets and simplify taking like terms so first you have to multiply and then simplify here without arrows we'll do 2 times X 2 X 2 times y - 1 and then you have to add this 3x so I'd like terms 2x + 3 X you get 5x + 2 y right as it is here five times a five wave hi x minus B 5 B and plus seven B is there five way you can add 
,,separately yeah - five plus seven what's the value plus two so take the difference and put the sign of the bigger number plus two that's me here multiply by 4 8 X 4 
,,times y 4y now what are the like terms 8 XL minus 5x that's 3x plus 4 here you have to multiply both these terms here 3 times X 3 X 3 times y 3 by here 2 times X 2 X 2 times y 2 now add the like terms 3x + 2 X you get 5 X 3 y + 2 y you get high five do it separately 2 times a 2 a 2 times -3 b -6 b plus 5 times a highway by x - Oh Big Ten now I'd like terms - and five seven that's seven minus six and ten take the difference + OB this one seven times - 14 X 7 times y 7y this one three times X minus three x + -3 y add the like terms 14 -3 11 X 7 - 3 + 4 y this one 3 x - 6 a 3 times 5 15 b + 7 e + 10 B what are the like terms a terms 6 + 7:30 15 minus 10 plus 5 so 5 b minus 5 times 7 -35 a minus 5 times -3 plus 15 plus 40 a now like terms add 40 - 35 5 a + 15 subtraction of two algebraic expressions you have to do the same thing right the first algebraic expression in brackets right the second algebraic expression in another brackets remove both brackets and simplify three-year you nothing means just multiply by one yeah - is there so that means this is minus 1 multiplied by minus 1 minus 1 times a minus a minus 1 times minus 2 B you get plus 2 B now like terms added 3 and minus a 2 a 4 B plus 2 B you get 6 this one subtract this from this so that means you have to write this one first 12x plus 7 1 so here just multiply by one 12x plus 7 1 minus this means open brackets with minus 1 minus 1 times 7 minus 7x minus 1 times minus 2 plus 2 I like terms you get 12 minus 7 5 x 7 + 2 9 5 subtract 2x minus 3 from this so from means first this one so 6x + 7 when there's a minus sign change the sign minus 2x and minus minus becomes plus 3 like term 6 and minus 2 4 X 7 + 3 that's 10 subtract this value from this so first you write here so 3p plus 8q - open brackets with minus 1 - P last - q + + 7 3 
,,p + - b - p8 q + 2 Q thank you and our terms you get only this one so that's 7 simplify so that here multiply and first open brackets and then simplify 4 times a 4 4 times -3 minus 12 minus 2 times a minus 2 a minus 2 x - 7 + 14 now like terms that for a and minus 2 a 2 a minus 12 and plus 14 you get plus 2 open brackets first 5x - 5 minus 3 times X minus 3 X minus 3 and minus 2 you get 6 y 5x + 3 X 2 X - 5 I + + 6 Y you get Y this one has a minus 2 in front so when you are multiplying be careful - 2 times 3 - 6 Z minus 2 and minus plus plus times foil the Savoy here you get minus 8b add like terms minus 6a + 4 you get minus 2 a 4 B and minus a 2 B minus 4 B this one Phi P into 2 Q 10 PQ or QP 5 P into 4 20 P here - 3 P into Q minus 3 P Q minus 3 P into 2 minus 6 peace now these are two like terms 10 P Q minus 3 P Q you get 7 PQ 20 P minus 6 P you get plus 14 substituting the values in the edge break expression so now we will see how we can find out the expression with substituting values so what's the first one determine the value of 5 a plus 4 when a equals 3 so substitute a equals 3 there so what happens five times three plus four so 
,,what's five times three 15 15 plus four you get 19 look at this expression seven A plus 2 B now you get two letters so substitute these two values equals three and B equals three so 7 M plus 2 B is the expression so we'll substitute 7 times is 3 7 times 3 plus 2 times B equals 3 so 7 times 3 21 2 times 3 6 21 plus 6 27 look at this one now you get three unknown letters 5 a 2 B 7 C values are given a equals 5 B equals 3 and C equals -2 substitute 5 into a is 5 2 times 3 and say x minus 2 so 
,,minus 7 x minus 2 5 times 5 25 minus 2 times 3 minus 6 and here minus minus becomes positive seven times 2 plus 14 now simplify 25 minus 6 you get 19 19 plus 14 33 determine the value of the following expressions when x equals 2 and y equals minus 3 we substitute 8 times X is 2 y equals minus 3/8 times 2 16 5 times minus 3 minus 15 16 minus 15 you get 1 here 12 times 2 minus 3 times minus 3 12 times 2 24 minus into minus plus 2 so 3 times 3 9 9 plus 4 13 so you get 33 now look at this one so same values you have to plug what are the values x equals 2 and y equals -3 9 mean 2 2 plus XY means X into y so 2 into minus 3 y equals minus 3 9 times 2 18 minus 6 you get 12 2 times X X is 2 5 times minus 3 plus 11 2 times 2 4 minus 15 plus 11 so 4 minus 15 you get minus 11 minus 11 and plus 11 you get 0 this one 4 times X 
,,X is 2 2 times minus 3 plus 8 4 times 2 8 minus 6 plus 8 8 minus 6 2 2 plus 8 10 here X is 2 y is minus 3 plus 2 minus 7 times minus 3 2 times minus 3 minus 6 here plus 2 is they are already according to Bodnar's you have to multiply first minus into minus plus 21 minus 6 plus 2 minus 4 minus 4 plus 21 you get 17 determine the value of the following algebraic expressions when a equals 3 and B equals 5 so what you do first first we'll open brackets and then substitute 3 times 2 6 6 8 3 times 3 you get 9 so 9 B now substitute after you multiply now substitute the value 6 times 3 9 times 5 because B equals 5 and a equals 3 6 times 3 18 9 times 5 45 what's the addition 63 in this one you have given the same question we'll try in a different way earlier we multiplied and then simplify now we'll do we'll simplify inside brackets and then multiply by three so three is there two times a is 3 B equals 5 now simplify inside 3 times 2 6 3 times 5 15 3 times 6 plus 15 21 now multiply 3 and 21 3 times 1 3 3 times 2 6 so you are getting the same answer get the same as if simplify inside brackets or without removing bracket so you can do any method first you can multiply and simplify and then substitute or simplify inside the brackets and then multiply by the outside number remove the brackets and substitute the values so first remove the brackets 7 a plus 14 B substitute the values 7 times 3 plus 14 times 5 say 1 times 3 21 here 5 times 425 times 1 5 and 7 add it you get 91 
,,this one 4 times 3 12 a and 8 B substitute the values of 12 times 3 minus 8 times fun now simplify 12 times 3 36 8 times 5 40 36 minus 40 you get minus here 11 times 2 22 a plus 11b so 22 times a 3 because 566 plus 55 hundred twenty-one this one 9 times 3 27 a 9 x -2 18 B now multiply 27 times 3 and 18 times fun 3 times 7 21 two remaining 3 times 2 6 plus 2 81 minus 5 times 8 44 remaining so you get 90 81 minus 90 you get minus 9 determine the value when a equals 3 B equals -2 and C equals 
,,1 so just substitute the values 2 times 3 7 x minus 2 make sure you put brackets when you get negative numbers 3 times 1/6 minus minus plus 14 plus 3 so 6 plus 3 9 9 plus 14 23 this one 5 times 3/2 x minus 2 and 4 into 1 15 minus 4 plus 4 minus 4 plus 4 get canceled out you get 15 11 x equals 3 B equals -2 and C equals 1 according to what must do the multiplication first 11 times 3 33 minus 2 times minus 2 plus 4 and you get minus 3/4 minus 3/1 33 plus 130 in this one first simplify and then substitute values of the following algebraic expressions when a equals 5 because 3 and C equals -2 so you have given this expression so what you do first open brackets 2 where 2 B 3 B 3 C then what you do simplify the terms add the like terms to a you have to write as it is 2b and 3b becomes Phi B and 3c here now substitute the values equals 5 B equals 3 and C equals -2 2 times 5 10 5 times 3 15 minus 60 so but you get 10 minus 6 4 4 plus 15 19 this one first open brackets 3 a 3 times minus B minus 3 B 4 times B 4 B 4 times C minus 4 C here because there's a negative sign now I'd like terms 3-year you can't simplify minus 3 and plus 4 that's plus 1 B or B minus 4 C now substitute the values 3 a means multiplication 3 times a 3 times 5 B is 3 4 times minus 2 first multiplication according to but must 5 times 3 15 minus 4 minus 2 plus 8 so you get 8 plus 3 11 11 and 15 you get 26 this one first open brackets 3a plus 3b here to be and -2 C 5 C 5 a so each one you have to multiply by the outside number now like terms 3a and 5a 8 a 3 B and plus 2 B 5 B -2 C + + 5 C plus 3 C now multiply 8 times a what's the value for a a 5 3 minus 2 I'll write down here equals 5 B equals minus 3 B is 3 and C equals -2 C equals -2 so a is 5 B 3 C minus 2 8 times 5 14 15 here and -6 15 minus 6 you get 9 9 plus 40 49 this one 7 a 7 B minus 7 C and then plus 2a minus 2b minus 2 C when you multiply by 2 add like terms 7 + + 2 9 e 7 B and minus 2b + 5 b minus 7 and minus 2 minus 9 see now my tip life is five B's tricky and C is minus 2/9 times 5 45 five times three 15 and minus minus becomes plus nine times two eighteen now add all together 1018 one remaining five six seven so 78 is the answer this one you get fractions but same procedure just substitute the values for a eight over be sixteen over C so now substitute equals 2 so 4 over 2 8 / BBS for 16 over C C is 8 now you have to simplify first 4 divide by 2 you get 2 8 divided by 4 you get 2 16 divided by 8 you get 2 2 + 2 + 2 6 this one substitute the values a equals 2 2 divided by 2 B is 4 4 divided by 4 C equals 8 8 divided by 8 simplify division first 2 divided by 2 is 1 4 divided by 4 is 1 8 divided by 8 is 1 1 plus 1 plus 1 you get 3 this one substitute a B means a times B 2 times 4 plus BC means B times that's 4 times C means 8 minus C times a C is 8 and a equals to 8 32 16 so 32 minus 16 is 16 16 and 8 addition you get 24 now we will look at remove exercise complete the table given below algebraic expression is given unknown term of the algebraic expression coefficient of the unknown term terms of the algebraic expression and final column is mathematical operations in the order they appear in the algebraic expression so first of all what's the unknown letter X coefficient is the number in front of the letter that's three and these are called algebraic terms and what is the operation plus and multiplication is three times X now we look at the next one what's the letter here Y what's the coefficient of that term to what are the algebraic terms to Y and 4 and what's the operation first multiplication and then addition next one what's the algebraic letter B coefficient 4 and terms for P and minus hundred and the operation for times P that means multiply and then subtract this one P is the letter coefficient nothing means one terms PN minus 10 and what are the operations used 1 times P times and then - what's the later here in coefficient is + 3 terms 3 n n minus 7 and operation first multiply and then subtract question number two the length of a table is two meters more than its breadth write an algebraic expression for the length of the table by taking its breath as V when you take this table B is the bread length is 2 meters more than its brick so what's the expression B plus 2 back to write

,,by a number each term of the algebraic expression needs to be multiplied by the number that is the coefficient of each algebraic term should be multiplied by the given number and simplify so make sure that you multiply by the coefficient when multiplying an algebraic term by an algebraic term there our coefficients are much like first and then the unknowns are multiplied when multiplying an algebraic expression by an algebraic term every algebraic term of the algebraic expression needs to be multiplied by the given algebraic term by substituting values for the unknown terms of an algebraic expression we obtain a numerical value for the algebraic expression so when you are simplifying either you can simplify brackets first and then multiply or expand brackets and then substitute the values so practice all these questions examples and exercise and thorough with algebraic expressions

AlgebraicExpression,5Q0FlxcEEIw,"What is Algebra? It's simple. It's all about puzzles. Here's one for you. This plus two equals five. We just have to find the number in this box. Which number when added to two gives us five? Simple! It's three. We can say that three plus two equals five. This thing we see here contains only numbers. This puzzle can also be asked in a different way, We can say that x plus two equals five, find 'x'. We just used a letter in place of the box. These letters are also called as variables. Sometimes also referred to as the unknown since its values is not known to us. This is Algebra. It deals with variables and unknowns and we are expected to find their value. But why use variables? Why not boxes like these? Let's assume there are three unknown numbers. Using shapes we can write it as a square, plus a slant square, plus an empty circle, plus four equals seven. You had to think of different shapes. Using variables we can write it as x plus y plus z plus four equals seven. This was a little more convenient as compared to the previous case. But what's the real advantage of using variables? Read the short story and the question that follows. Your "
,,"friend had a few chocolates with him. A bully came across, took away five of his chocolates. And then he had just seven chocolates remaining with him. How many chocolates did he have before the bully came to him? This question has '40 words'. Let's see if it can shorten the question a bit. Assume your friend had 'x' chocolates with him. The bully took away five of his chocolates, so we subtract five from 'x'. And after all this your friend was left with seven chocolates. This entire thing, "
,,"will then equal seven. Now all we have to do is find 'x'. This entire question of '40 words' can be written like this. So yes, Algebra makes life simple."

AlgebraicExpression,VqfeXMinM0U,Hello everyone can you all tell what comes
,,in to your mind as soon as you hear the word mathematics.
,,"Some might say numbers..some say addition subtraction .. Shapes like circle, triangle"
,,etc. Yes! You all are right...but math is much
,,more than this. Math is part of our everyday life. For example
,,"when we wake up in the morning, our first action is to look at our clock. Then when"
,,we go for breakfast ask for 2 slices of bread We will again be using maths if we dial number
,,to phone. We all love shopping and here too maths plays an important role say if there's
,,a discount then you can see how much it would be if it was maybe 20% off or something. So
,,like this there are many incidents where math is used & hence is so important to learn and
,,understand. But do we really know what mathematics is?
,,Is it only about numbers & shapes? No.
,,There are many more interesting things that we can learn as the word mathematics itself
,,means the things that are learned One of the very first things that we learnt
,,in our childhood is numbers and its counting. We ve also learnt some basic operations that
,,we apply on them. Like addition of numbers.subtraction multiplication
,,"& division the answers that we get are called sum, difference, product & quotient."
,,Now the area of mathematics where numbers are combined with some basic operations & their
,,"calculation s????.. forms a different branch in math called arithmetic, the operations"
,,are called arithmetic operations. The word arithmetic itself means number.
,,Now as time passes we gain more knowledge. So in this session we are going to learn one
,,of the most important branches of math known as algebra which is the foundation for many
,,other topics & a great subject for getting your brain to think differently and sharply.
,,So what is algebra? Is it same as arithmetic? Lets understand it.
,,We know that in arithmetic we can easily say 8+2=10 & 7-5=2 but suppose someone asks the
,,same question in some other way i.e. how much amount do we add to 8 to get total of 10?
,,Or how much should we remove from 7 to get balance of 2. Look at this 8 + ___ . 10
,,7 - ___ .. 2 okay so the answers for these blank place are 2 & 5 resp ? right.
,,Here what we are actually doing? We are finding the value of the empty place
,,which we don?t know yet hence this empty place also called as unknown.
,,But every time we cannot use words like empty place or unknown.
,,Hence in algebra we denote this unknown value..i.e. this empty place by an alphabet & it can be
,,any letter a..b..cor xyso on. So instead of keeping it
,,"So, Algebra simply means finding the value of unknown numbers"
,,I am sure you have now understood the difference between arithmetic and algebra Lets take an example to learn few more things
,,"in it. Suppose, you have a small stationary shop,"
,,"where you sell one pencil for 3 bucks. Customer1 comes and asks for 5 pencils, costomer2"
,,asks for 7 pencils customer3 directly gives you 12 bucks and asks to give as many pencils
,,as you can for 12 bucks. Price of 1 pencil no of pencil amount
,,3 5 ___ 3 7 ___
,,3 ___ 12 Friends here price for a pencil is a fixed
,,amount and what is unknown to us is either no. of pencils or total amount for the same.
,,"Let us first find the unknown values. Now, can you tell what should be the total"
,,amount for 5 pencils in case of customer 1. It is 3*5 = 15 right? Similarly for 7 pencils
,,the amount will be 21 bucks. So what did we do exactly? We have multiplied
,,price of a pencil with number of pencils sold to get the unknown total amount But for 3rd customer .in 12 bucks what will
,,"be the number of pencil? How to find that, all we have to do is divide"
,,the total amount 12 by price of a pencil i.e. 3 and that will give us 4. Observe the table and understand that here
,,cost of pencil is a constant value while the number of pencils purchased by each customer
,,varies and as a result their total amount is also different. So if we denote num of pencils by x & total
,,amount as y ????????in general we can
,,write it as 3x = y Friends 3x simply means that 3 multiplied
,,"by x or sometimes 3 dot x, dot also represents multiplication. Now note that here x & y are unknowns whose"
,,value is not fixed & its varying hence in algebra unknown numbers are also known as
,,variables. And the fixed number here price for a pencil
,,"is known as constant. Now if we concentrate only on 3x, we can see"
,,that we have constant 3 & the variable x& both are combined with an operation.. multiplication.
,,So such type of expressions that involve variables and constants & are combined with the fundamental
,,"operations, it is called as algebraic expression. Therefore 3x is an algebraic expression and"
,,y is also an alg exp as y is a variable and can be written as 1* y
,,And when such algebraic expressions are equated i.e. we put an equal to sign between them
,,", then this whole thing is called an equation. Lets have some more examples of algebraic"
,,expression: I had some money I gave 16 bucks to one of
,,my friend now I have 56 bucks left. How can we form an algebraic expression of
,,this statement? Here the money I had is unknown  so this is the equation and this is expression.
,,These are some examples of equations and expressions match them correctly. Sum of 2 numbers is 15 X = y + 3
,,Mr. x is 3 years elder than Mr. y 7y
,,I had some mango & gave 3 to my brother
,,X - 3 Price for one chocolate y bucks
,,Price for 7chocolates is X + y = 15 Friends in our upcoming sessions we ll be
,,learning in detail about the algebraic expressions and equations. So thats all for this session in our next
,,session well learn more on algebra. But if you have any doubts or anything for this session
,,do let us know in the common below. Also like and share the same. You may help someone needy
,,by sharing the same.

AlgebraicExpression,20BYGqGufY8,are they grenades and welcome to worksheet cloud maths my name is Joe Milligan and I'm going to take you through some facts about algebraic expressions first of all 
,,how to write them then how to simplify them and then how to evaluate them okay if at any stage you don't understand anything and you want to ask a question remember 
,,to just send an email to that email address at the bottom of your page and somebody will get back to you right first of all we have to look at what an algebraic expression actually is it indicates a sequence of calculations that can also be described in words or with a flow diagram so for example multiply a number by 2 and add 6 to the answer that is in words as you can see this would be the flow diagram for that sentence and it's an unknown number x bar 2 and added 6 and that as an algebraic expression would look like that X plus 2 or sorry x times 2 plus 6 okay that would be the expression it's written an algebraic form okay so your expression would 
,,actually look like this 2x plus 6 remember the X is the unknown value you can call that unknown value anything you'd like you can call it a or b or Y or CID but for 
,,today's lesson we're going to refer to unknown values as X okay now you try see if you can write that as an expression two times a number added to three times the same number okay did you get that 2 times X plus 3 times X and if we make it simpler it would just be 2x plus 3x okay right let's go on let's break this down two times a number added to three times the same number okay now give it give the unknown number a name like I said earlier you can give it any name you like but today we are going to call it X so both are no numbers have the same value and they can both be called X if you choose to use y both of them would be called Y okay so these words then translate to 2 times X plus 3 times X as an algebraic expression and can also then be written 2x plus 3x which just looks a whole lot tidier okay let's try one more half a number subtracted from five times of that number it would be 5 X minus 1/2 X you might have written half X minus 5 X but let me explain to you why it's the other way around okay we break this one down we've got half of a number subtracted from 5 times that same number okay if the same number is we're dealing with only one unknown value so we can give it them both the same name and we will call it X again and so we are then we need to look at the word from in this case yeah because we are subtracting 1/2 X from 5 times X so we need to write it 5x minus 1/2 X it would be like me asking you to subtract 2 from 3 if you were to write that it would be 3 minus 2 okay let's go on you can try these now all on your own so you can pause the video and you can try them out and then we'll go over them together right let's see what you did the first one is a number less 7 again you can call it a B why is it whatever you'd like to call it we're going to call it X again and that would be X minus 7 see this time wasn't from 7 it was a number less 7 that means you subtract the 7 from the number okay half of a number added to 6 that would be 1/2 X plus 6 or 6 plus 1/2 X remember adding we can write it any which way we lack any way around okay the next one times a number divided by 2 would be 9x divided by 2 next one 3 times a number increased by 4 you've got it 3x plus 4 and then 1/4 of a number subtracted from 8 remember these are from again let's have a look it would be 8 minus 1/4 X well done guys I'm sure you got those all rights right now we're going to look and see how we can simplify the expressions okay five times a number add it to six times the same number and then subtract 4 wow that seems like quite a long sentence but let's go through it slowly 5x plus 6x minus 4 now because you've got 5x and a 6x those are both the same unknown numbers so we could say we can put them together and say it's 11x minus 4 can you see that you've got an unknown number of that X and that X 5 of those and 6 of the same things you'd get 11 of them if I were to say to you for 5x and 6x then you could say I've got 11x it would 
,,be the same kind of thing see right now you can try try those ones pause the video again have a go and we'll go over them together right let's see how you did two times a number subtracted from 3 times the same number would give you 3 minus 2x is the and then it would be the same as just plain X because you've got three X's and 
,,you - includes from that you left with 1x right the second one for added to a number and subtract 2 times the same number let's see what happens yeah we've got 4 plus an unknown X minus 2x so yeah we've got a positive x and a negative x so if you have minus 2x and you add on an X you she just got EXO it would be four minus X let's go over that one just one more time you've got a positive excellent you - in two x's from it you would end up in with a negative x so it'll be 4 minus X instead of 4 plus X right let's go over the next one and number added to 7 and 3 times that number is subtracted let's see what happens ya X plus 7 minus 3 X again you've got a positive X if there's nothing in front of it it means it's positive and see how you've got a minus 3 X so you adding an X 1 to your minus 3 X so then you would end up with 7 minus 2x you could possibly also write it minus 2x plus 7 it just looks a little bit more messy right so far we've looked at writing algebraic expressions from words and how to simplify the expression now we're going to look at how to evaluate these expressions ok we can only evaluate an expression if we are given the value of x and remember the X is the unknown number so we can't give an expression of value unless we are actually given the value of that X so let's have a look at so if we are told X is equal to 3 then we can work out the value of the expression 2x minus 1 and how do we do this well we would substitute the 3 into the expression in the position of X so it would be 3 2 times 3 minus 1 so we would write it like that or we can write it like that the only reason I wrote it like that was because the X looks sits next to the tooth so it's the same thing 2 times 3 and then minus 1 okay because we now have an actual value we can carry out the operations and the expression to find the answer so 2 times 3 would be 6 and 6 minus 1 would give me 5 rights have you got it so let's go over that again we can only substitute in when we are given the value of the X so we the value up here we are told that X is equal to 3 so 2 times 3 would give me 6 6 minus 1 is 5 and that would be the value of that expression right let's go on to your turn now I want you to find the value of the expression X minus 2 X where X is equal to 2 you can pause the video and 
,,you can try that out and then we'll go over it okay so what's the value of your expression for let's break it down we've got 8 minus 2x where the X is equal to 2 so 
,,it's 8 minus 2 times 2 that's 8 minus 4 and so the value of your expression is 4 okay try those on your own grab a piece of paper write them down pause the video and work them out okay how well did you do 8 minus 2 X where X is equal to 3 we're going to substitute the 3 in for the X so it would be 8 minus 2 times 3x minus 6 which gives me 2 5x minus 7 where X is equal to 2 same thing we're going to go 5 times 2 2 is in place of the X which gives me 10 minus 7 is 3 one thing here you have to write out the whole expression so I can't just write 5 times 2 because I've got an equal sign so my equal sign tells me that what is on this line is actually exactly the same value as to what is on that line so if I left off the 7 5 times 2 does not give me 5x minus 7 it doesn't equal that so we must just be very careful with how we write things down see okay number three 1/2 X where X is 10 half of 10 we all know is 5 3 times 2 X where X is 4 again we're going to substitute in for the X where it's 4 it will be 3 times and in brackets 2 times 4 so we'll do that first then we'll go 2 times 4 is 8 3 times 8 is 24 the next one 3x plus 2x again we substituting in 3 X + 2 X X here is 5 so 5 3 times 5 plus 2 times 5 will be 15 plus 10 and that gives you 25 I hope you all got that but let's look at the next thing remember when we simplified the expression while that last one we could probably simplify so in question 5 was 3x + 2 X where X was equal to 5 so because your variables are the same your unknowns are the same can add them together before you substitute it in so we got 3x + 2 X and that's the same as 5x remember when we simplify the expressions we looked at putting those together okay so X is equal to 5 and we can then multiply it 5 times 5 and we end up with 25 so the answer to that expression would be 25 that is the same answer as what you got when you did when you didn't simplify the expression and you kept the two terms apart it would be 3 times 5 + 2 times 5 which is 15 plus 10 and you also end up with 25 can you see you got the same answer so you could do it either way around you would end up with the same answer right let's look at see if it works for another example where 2 X + 4 X + X is equal to 3 we've got 2 times 3 plus 4 times 3 that's 6 plus 12 and it gives me an answer of 18 or we could go to X plus 4 X is 6 X 6 times 3 is 18 can you see same answer so whichever way suits you to work it out you can work it out like that you're going to get the same answer either way around right let's draw on everything you have learned today to try these ok you can pause the video again try those art and we'll go over them together right let's see how you did 2 times a number subtracted from 3 times the same number we've got 3 X minus 2 X and that would eggs we haven't been given the the value of the X so we can just simplify them right for added to 2 times a number and subtract the same number is 4 + 2 X - X would be 4 + X a number subtracted from 7 and 3 times that number is added it's 7 - x + 3 X and that would give you 7 minus 2 X right it's just revised what you've gone over today what we've learned so you've learned how to first of all write an expression in words then you learned how to simplify the expression and how to evaluate the expression when given a value for the unknown number see I made a little mistake here it's hard to simplify the expression not and expression and how do you evaluate the expression when given a value for the unknown number now you can try the activity that is being posted and then you can check it with the memo thank you for joining us today great and I hope you've understood everything just remember if you haven't understood anything at all you can email in and the email address has been on each side so you can go back and check it it is also an activity worksheet and somebody will get back to you with an answer or an explanation thank you for listening today

AlgebraicExpression,aq7rtToR1Uc,today we will learn factorization by using identities while learning about algebraic expressions and identities we have discussed some standard identities here the left side of standard identities is shown will you be able to tell the right side try it let me tell you do you know with the help of these identities we can also find the factors of some expressions suppose we want to find the factors of 4x square plus 20x plus 25 are there any common factors in the three terms of this expression think think no there are no common factors in these three terms just think we can factorize this expression using one of these standard identities let me tell you 
,,there are three terms in this expression there are two terms on the right side of the third standard identity so we cannot use it there are three terms on the right 
,,side of each of the first and second identity so let's understand which identity we can use we can write 4 x square as 2 x square and 25 as 5 square in this way we see that the first term and the third term in this expression are perfect squares at the same time we also see that the sign of the middle term is positive can you tell me which of these expressions correspond to the right side of the standard identity think think absolutely right this expression corresponds to the right side of 
,,the identity a plus b bracket square is equal to a square plus 2 a b plus b square therefore we can use this identity if we assume a is equal to 2 x and b is equal to 5 then a square plus 2 a b plus b square is equal to 2 x square plus 2 multiplied by 2 x multiplied by 5 plus 5 square that is 4 x squared plus 20 x plus 25 which 
,,is similar to the given expression but according to question a square plus 2 a b plus b square is equal to a plus b bracket square so we can say 4 x square plus 20 x plus 25 is equal to 2 x plus 5 whole square thus with the help of standard identity we have multiplied this expression and these are its factors in this way to factorize an expression first we find the identity which has its right side similar to the expression then we find the factors of the desired expression from the corresponding expression on the left side of that standard identity now suppose we want to factorize 9y square minus 36 y plus 36 then how will we do this think think absolutely right here factor 9 is common in all three terms so under the distributive property we can take it outside the bracket like this we can write the expression written inside the parenthesis like this in this way we see that the expression inside this bracket corresponds to the right side of the standard identity where a is equal to y b is equal to 2 and 2 a b is equal to 2 multiplied by y multiplied by 2 that is 4y therefore we can factorize this expression as y minus 2 whole square thus this gives us the factorization of given expression like this we can also write it like this now pause the video and find the factors of 49 x square minus 100 let 
,,me tell you we can write 49 x square as 7 x square and 100 as 10 square in this way both terms of this expression are perfect squares it corresponds to the right side of this identity a plus b a minus b is equal to a square minus b square where a is equal to 7 x and b is equal to 10. therefore using the third identity we can factorize the given expression as 7x plus 10 into bracket 7x minus 10. now find the factors of the expressions given below so today we have learned factorization using 
,,identities in the next video we will see some interesting examples related to them you

AlgebraicExpression,WwTdAYWOYPs,hello all welcome to math for juniors with me miss Marx and my assistant snail hi friends hmm you seem a bit low today Oh actually I want to go on a holiday to Kashmir holiday again I think you came back from a holiday some time back only and why suddenly you want to go to Kashmir oh I want to see snowfall Oh what was that snail behave yourself hello I'm just practicing how to throw snowballs in Kashmir you throw one more ball at me and I will not give you a holiday for next one year I know miss marks please don't do that okay then behave now what are you wondering about why do we have snowfall in Kashmir but not in Delhi or Punjab Kashmir is closer to the mountains and is at a higher altitude in comparison to Delhi often job hence the climate there is different so altitude is one of the many factors that determine the climate of a place okay so you mean many factors put together determine the climatic condition of a place different factors obviously mean different climate yeah just like in math how like math if you multiply X Y and X plus 2 whole Y you get different results for instance XY plus 2y is the product in second case Oh snail 
,,try to understand if you are given the product XY plus 2y you can express it back to its factors y and X plus 2 whole this process of writing an expression as its products is called factorization Oh how does one do this factorization it seems so tough let's go to the virtual world to learn about factorization of algebraic expressions you have studied algebraic expressions and arithmetic operations on them now let's learn one more operation factorization of algebraic expressions now what is 
,,factorization well the process of writing an algebraic expression as product of two or more other algebraic expressions which are called factors of the first algebraic expression is called factorization in the algebraic expression a X plus a by a is common to both the terms ax and a Y so we take out a from both terms to obtain ax plus ay Y is equal to a multiplied by X plus y the whole here a and X plus y are called the factors of algebraic expression ax plus ay Y so snail how did you find 
,,it oh it was easy really very very interesting too hmm so that means you understood it very well yes quite well very well good then let me give you another algebraic expression and you factorize it me yes you since you find it so interesting huh well I was thinking miss marks why didn't I see a few more examples and then solve your question all right all right let's see some more examples on factorization of algebraic expressions but this time you better pay attention snail or sure I will good off to watch all words let's factorize the expression X plus 6x y minus 9x Z let's check out for the common factors here the common factor to the three terms x 6 XY + 9 XZ is X therefore the expression can be factorized by taking out X common so x + 6 X Y minus 9 XZ is equal to x multiplied by 1 plus 6y - 9z the whole now let's look at another example factorize the expression 6 X raised to power 4 into y raise to the power 3 minus 12 X cube y minus X 5 the common factor in this case is 
,,x times y taking out X Y we get XY x 6 X cubed Y square minus 12 X square minus 1 the whole notice that by multiplying the common term to each of term inside the bracket we obtain the original expression back this way we can verify if the factorization done is correct or not here the factorization is the reverse of expanding brackets back to the real world so snail I hope this time you understood it very well oh yes I did it and it was actually interesting math always is interesting but you need to pay attention mm like you pay attention to movies Auto food she know that I was thinking about a movie oh my god what if she marks me absent yes yes I will 
,,miss max what is that toy on this table can i play with it you can if you find the factors of that toy how can you find factors of the toy is it factorization restricted to numbers and algebraic expressions it is but it has a broader meaning as well which is not just restricted to algebra oh then why don't you tell me about it I will but before that we need to see another method of factorization of algebraic expressions which is by grouping the terms so let's go to the virtual world factorize a cube plus a square plus a plus 1 in the given expression we do not have anything common to all the terms so we shall use another method to factorize the expression that is by grouping the terms first divide the terms of the given expression into groups in order to find the common factor from each group grouping the terms as a cube plus a square and a plus 1 we get a square as a common factor from the first group and one from the second group now both groups have common factor a plus 1 
,,on taking a plus 1 as common factor from both groups the given expression reduces to a plus 1 into a square plus 1 thus a cube plus a square plus a plus 1 is equal to a plus 1 into a square plus 1 mm still wondering about the car yes you brought the car no I just factorized it or reduced it to its basic building blocks oh I didn't get that factorization and mathematics means the same as an English language that is it is reducing or splitting an object into its constituent products or factors the aim of factoring is usually to reduce something to its basic building blocks oh that's why the blocks and now I got it snail I have another very interesting phenomenon to tell you where in the factorization takes place let's check that out in the do you know section do you know that the sunlight also called as white light 
,,can be split into its constituent colors red orange yellow green blue indigo and violet how can you split the sunlight there are two ways to split the sunlight first we can do it with the help of this prison look at this closely friends when the sunlight passes through prism it splits into its constituent colors see Wow and I can see so that is how we factorize the sunlight through a prism yes and there is another way as well what is that I'm sure you all must have seen a rainbow before and that's an example of splitting of white sunlight on a rainy day if you stand with your back to the Sun as you look into falling rain or a mist of droplets you will 
,,notice the rainbow made up of seven colors red orange yellow green blue indigo and violet this range of sunlight colors when combined looks white to dye this property of sunlight was first demonstrated by famous mathematician and physicist Sir Isaac Newton in the year 1666 Wow we just factorize the sunlight first by prayers and 
,,then by a water droplet now it's time that I press the action replay button so that you all can quickly devise all that we have learned today about factorization so 
,,friends sit tight and pay attention factorization is the process of writing and algebraic expressions as product of two or more other algebraic expressions which are called factors of the first algebraic expression so an algebraic expression can be factorized by taking out the common term grouping the terms what are you doing with those blocks actually I broke the car I was trying to create the car model back with these blocks however can you help me ah in the process of reversing the factorization of course he anyways time for me to say goodbye to my dear friends but you continue your fun with algebraic expressions till the next time good bye bye see 
,,you in the next episode

AlgebraicExpression,fUOdon3y1hU,algebraic expressions and equations good day students welcome back to my classroom for today's lesson you are going to learn how to differentiate expression from equation translate variable expressions and equations into algebraic expressions and equations and vice versa and lastly identify a variable in non-algebraic expression and equation let us begin let's cover brain exercise let's take a look at this one we have the sum of eight and nine can you translate this into a numerical expression great job we have here the keyword sum which represents addition this means that we need to add eight and nine so that is eight plus nine and this is an example 
,,of a numerical expression next one we have the sum of four and a number again our keyword here is sum which means addition this means that we need to add 4 and a number here we do not know the value of a number therefore we are going to represent it by a letter let's say letter n so that is four plus n this is an example of algebraic expression next one we have the sum of four and the number is seven again our keyword here is the word sum which means addition and we need to add four and a number which is four plus n and the word is represents equal sign therefore four plus n is equal seven this is an example of algebraic equation now do you know what is the difference between algebraic expression and equation let's go and take a look let us discuss the differences between expression and equation in algebraic expression it is a mathematical phrase for example we have this sum of 4 and a number and as we can see this is not a complete sentence while the algebraic equation is a 
,,mathematical sentence for example we have the sum of four and the number is seven another one is algebraic expression has no equal sign while in algebraic equation it has equal sign which represented by the word is lastly in an expression a value of the letter or the symbol can change for example here we have 4 plus n we can say that the value of n is 5 so that would be four plus five or we can say that the volume n here is nine so that would be four plus nine or let us say it is equal to so that would be four plus two on the other hand in algebraic equation the value of the letter or the symbol cannot be changed it has a fixed volume or fixed answer here n four plus n equals seven we cannot say that the value of n is nine as it will not say that the equation is correct if we say that the value of n here is two the equation would be wrong what if we say that the value of n here is three or plus three equals 7 and that is the correct value of m wonderful now that you know the 
,,differences let's move on to the parts of algebraic expression the first one is the variable the variable is any letter or symbol that represents a number here the variable is letter x the next one is the coefficient the coefficient is the constant value used with the variable it is the factor or the number being multiplied to a variable here the coefficient is two we can always find the coefficient before the variable the next one is the constant the constant is the fixed value that does not change here the constant is number five and lastly we have the term the term is a number or variable a product or quotient of a number and variables separated by 
,,plus or minus sign here in a given example we have the plus sign and it separates two terms which are 2x and 5 remember that addition and subtraction only separate terms while division and multiplication do not separate terms now that you already know the parts and the differences between equation expression let us go and translate some verbal expressions here we have a number plus 3 first one that you need to know is what is the missing here the missing here is a number this means that we 
,,are going to represent it by a variable any letter that we would like to let's say i want letter m the next keyword here would be the word plus which means edition so that is m plus three so our algebraic expression here is m plus three now let's have another example we have the sum of a number and three again let's take a look 
,,for some keywords here the keywords that we have is the word sum which means addition therefore we need to add a number which can be represented by a variable let's 
,,say letter m and the number 3 so that is m plus 3 very good let's have another one we have m increased by 3 here we already have a variable which is m so let us write m next we have the keyword increase by increase by represents addition so that would be a plus sign and lastly the number three next one we have three added to m so again we already have a variable which is m and we need to add 3 to it so that is m plus 3 next one we have 3 more than m again our variable here is m and the word more than represents addition and we have three so that is m plus three now let us identify which are the variables coefficient constant and the number of terms here in our given algebraic expression the variable here is the letter which is and very good next one let us take a look for the coefficient again the coefficient is the number that we see before the variable as we can see there is no number before a variable here but it doesn't mean that we do not have a coefficient remember that a coefficient is a factor or a number multiplied to a variable all variables that do not have a number beforehand has a coefficient of one because it means one times m which is equals m so the coefficient here is one next one the constant here is very good it is three and let's count the number of terms since this algebraic expression is separated by a plus sign or addition our terms here are m and 3. so we have two turns great job let's have another example next one we have a number minus seven again we have here a number which can be represented by a variable so let us say letter f our next keyword here is the word minus which represents subtraction and there is 7 so that is f minus seven next one we have the difference of f and seven so again let's take a look for some keywords we have different and the difference represents subtraction so we need to subtract f and seven all right let's have another example we have f decreased by seven so our variable here is f and we need to decrease this one which represents subtraction by seven next example we have seven subtracted from f so our variable here is is the letter f and we need to subtract seven from it to that will be m minus seven and lastly we have seven less than f and our variable again here is letter f and our keyword is less than which means subtraction 7 so that is f minus seven now let's identify the variable here again our variable is the letter which is very good is letter f and now let's take a look for the coefficient since there's no number before our variable here therefore the coefficient here is one next one is the constant the constant here is negative 
,,seven now let's count the number of terms so we have here minus that separates the term so we have f and seven so that is to turn all right let's go to our next example this time we have a number time two again we have here the missing value which is a number so now let's represent it by a letter let's say letter n times which means multiplication two in an algebraic expression we do not use the multiplication sign as it confuses us into a variable x instead of using the multiplication sign the number we just simply combine the number and the variable so that would be 2 n next example we have twice of n here our variable is n and our keyword is the word to white which means to time so that is two times n therefore that is to n on to our next example we have n multiplied by two here our variable is letter n and our keyword is multiplied by two so we need to multiply n by two so that would be two n next one we have the double of n here our keyword again is double which means times two so we need to times two the letter n so that is two n all right next one we have the product of n and two so our variable here is n and our keyword is product which is the answer for multiplication this means that we need to multiply n and 2 so that is 2 m now let us identify the variable the variable here obvi is the letter and while the coefficient is 2 as it is the number before the variable next one is the constant as we can see we do not have a constant here while the number of terms since there's no addition or subtraction that separates the term we only have one term now let's move on to our next example next one we have a number divided by five again we have the missing volume which is a number so let us represent this by a variable f and we need to divide this by five so we can write this as n divided by five next one we have the quotient of n and phi so again our keyword here is equation which means division so it means that we need to divide n and five so that is n divided by five next one we have one fifth of n so it means that we need to multiply one and n so that is one-fifth n but it can also be written as n over five okay next one we have the ratio of n to five our variable here is n and our clue word here is the ratio we all know that we can represent ratio by a fraction so 
,,that would be n is to five or n over five which also means and divided by five now our variable here is the letter n while the coefficient here is one fifth as this 
,,is the factor or the number being multiplied to the variable n next one is the constant here we cannot see a constant so that would be zero or not well the number of terms since there's no addition or attraction with separate t terms this means that we only have one term great job now that you already know some basics this time 
,,let's try to translate a verbal expression with more than one operation into algebraic expression let's have our first example six more than twice a number so again 
,,we need to take a look for some clues in order for us to translate this one so our clue word here as we can see we have two white a number and we all know that that 
,,means two times a number or a variable so we can say that is two a and next one we have six more than and that is plus six so therefore our expression here is two a 
,,plus six wonderful now let's identify the variable here is a good job well the coefficient here is 2. next one the constant is 6 and we have here two terms which are two a and six let's have another example this time we have 18 less than half a number now let's take a look for some favorite we have here 18 less than and we all know that lessons mean subtract so that is minus eight next one we have have a number and that means one half times a number or a variable so that would be one half y now if we combine them together we have one half y minus eight so that is 18 less than half a number so here our variable is y well the coefficient here is one half well the constant is negative 18 or minus 18. and the number of terms here are two that is one-half y and eighteen now let's have another example we have one plus twice a number is ten so our first clue right here is to rise a number and that means three times a variable so we can say it is to re b next one we have one plot and that means plus one if we combine that together we have three b plus one and we still have more to translate here we have the word estet which means that equals ten so that is three b plus one equals ten so here we have the variable b while the coefficient here is three the constants are one and ten and the number of terms here are three which are three b one and ten this time let us translate an expression into a verbal or word sentences or phrases here we have b plus eight divided by two so first we have b plus eight we can write this one as the sum of b and eight and next we have divided by two so that would be divided by two now we have the sum of b and eight divided by two wonderful let's have another example here we have three n plus 25 equals 31. first let's try to translate plus 25. we can translate this 
,,one as 25 added two but i will use 25 added two next we have three n this means that three times n but we can also say to rise of n and lastly we have equals 31 which means s31 so now we have 25 added tutorials of n is 31. good job students you made it this far now here are the things that you learned today you

AlgebraicExpression,JxkWSDpfOFY,good morning students today we shall revise how to find the area of square and rectangle let's begin what does the term AVR mean easier measures the surface of a simple closed region the units of area are the square of the units of length thus area can be expressed in square units such as square centimeters square meters or square kilometers there are two methods to find the area one is by dividing a region into unit squares and thereafter counting the unit squares and the other is by using formula let's learn about each of these in a bit detail first let's see how to find the area of a simple closed region my counting unit squares when the region is divided into unit squares look at the square a-b-c-d it is divided into 25 equal squares or side 1 centimeter each thus we say that the area of square a b c d is equal to 25 square centimeters square centimeters can also be written as s you see em in short now let's find the area of the hidden figure look at the bigger yeah each 
,,square equals one square centimeter and each half square equals to half square centimeter thus on counting we get that the given figure has 14 squares and 2 half squares therefore the area of this given figure is equal to 14 plus ha plus 1/2 which is 15 square centimeters when finding the area of a plane figure by counting the unit squares remember one we ignore or do not count the squares that are less than half - if a square is more than half we count the area as one square unit now let's see how to find the area using formulas the area of a rectangle can be found by using the formula e is equal to L into B where E is the area L is the length and B is the breadth of the rectangle let's use this formula to find the area of a rectangle p q r s having length 7 units and Brett 5 units rectangle PQRS has length of 7 
,,units and bread or five units therefore by using formula area is equal to length into breadth we get the easier as 35 square units now let's all one more example to 
,,understand it in a better way find the area of a rectangle having length 33 meters and read 10 meters area is equal to Len into red which is equal to 33 into 10 which is equal to 330 square meters the formula to find the area of a square is different it is a is equal to s into s where s is equal to the length of the side of the 
,,square let's find the area of the square W X Y Z having side 13 units using this formula as the length of the side of the square W X Y Z is of 13 units using the formula area is equal to site into site we get to the answer as 169 square units now let's solve one more example to understand it in a better way find the area of a square having side of plan nine centimeters area is equal to side into side which is equal to 9 into 9 which is equal to 81 square centimeters remember the formulas one area of a rectangle is equal to length into red to area of a square is equal to site into side kids if you remember the formulas then finding the area will not be

AlgebraicExpression,8hzPIKmCHUA,"Oh no! A power cut. Let me just get a candle. Ouch! I think I hit a table. Where is... oh, here. Do you know there are some people who have"
,,mastered the art of navigating in darkness. And they are also trained to read
,,and write in the dark. These mighty people are the blind. And they do this with the unique
,,writing system called Braille. I am so excited to tell you about the
,,"amazing story of this invention. Thank god it's back. Come friends, zoom in! The history of this unique writing system"
,,goes all the way back to the early 1800s. Several soldiers in the French Army were
,,using lamps to read the combat messages. A terrible decision. As the light shinning from the lamps told
,,the enemies where the French soldiers were. A man named Charles Barbier saw this problem. And developed a night writing system
,,for the soldiers. It was a system with 12 raised
,,dots in a cell. Which could be read with fingertips. And it helped the soldiers read without
,,"attracting any unwanted attention. Then in 1821, Charles Barbier was invited,.. ..to introduce the night writing system to a"
,,"class of young blind students. However, there was one flaw in this system. It was just impossible to feel all"
,,"the dots with a single touch. Still, it was enough to inspire one"
,,"student, a curious little boy. Named Louis Braille. Braille was blinded at a very young age,"
,,in an accident. When he was playing with an awl
,,"and punching holes in leather. But a physical disability, was no bar"
,,for Braille's bright spirit. Soon he was back in the workshop
,,"with his imagination. And this time, instead of leather,"
,,Braille was punching dots on paper. He worked tirelessly for years to modify
,,Charles Barbier's night writing system.. ..for his fellow blind individuals. And soon enough the hard work of this
,,little genius bore fruit. Braille simplified the night writing system. And reduced the 12 raised dots to 6! This meant that a single letter could now
,,"be recognized with a single touch. Now, that was a big improvement, kids. Because it made reading for the"
,,"blind much easier and faster. They were absolutely delighted. For the next 5 years, Braille refined the"
,,"writing method which was already in use. Finally, in 1829, Braille published a book.. ..explaining the entire Braille code,"
,,"for writing and reading. Despite the great advantages of it,"
,,Louis Braille's own university.. ..refused to adopt the system. But there was no stopping him. He soon started spreading Braille
,,"amongst the students. After being appointed as a teacher. This Braille move by brave... I mean, this brave move by Braille,.. ..helped the students immensely. And in 1854, 2 years after"
,,"Louis Brailles death. The rising demands from the students,.. ..made the university adopt the"
,,Braille writing system officially! Since then the Braille writing system
,,has spread throughout the world. And has been giving vision to the
,,"blind in the form of literacy. Oh! there it goes. That was my last copy of the Braille guide. I'll probably go and get some more. Oh, but wait. Stay right here. TRIVIA TIME! Do you know about these yellow things on"
,,the floor? Probably in train stations. These are actually helping hands
,,for blind people. Enabling them to find their way
,,"and avoid obstacles. And these are known as Braille for feet. Wait! This isn't a train, is it? What is this? Why am I here? Oh look! That's our friend"
,,Louis Braille passing by. Did you know? An asteroid has been
,,"named 9969 Braille.. ..to honor none other than Louis Braille. There it goes. So kids, you see how 1 man's invention"
,,helped so many blind people worldwide! Oh wait! May be he can help me find
,,my way back to earth. Don't forget to tune in next time.

AlgebraicExpression,RwZvvJ7OWx0,hello my dearest friends so today's topic is fact tradition you can see here question on the board question number three and four which i'm going to do today each and every question i'm going to do hope you will enjoy this video and learn these all factorization properly if you are new on my channel please hit this bell button you will get notification of upcoming videos and don't forget to subscribe and share with your friends let's take a start question number three see four question on the board first question number three a m plus one plus two m plus one you can see here here also m plus one m plus one so we can take m plus one common and what is remaining here m so we have to write down m here is plus 2 so we have to write down plus 2 this one is the answer for you look at this one here also same like question number a first of all a minus b is here a minus b so we can take a minus b common yes and what is remaining here a a here is minus b so minus b sometime you can write a minus b whole square also because these two are same so we can write whole square look at this one here is 3 minus y but what is here y minus 3 this both are not same so we cannot take common so what we have to do we have to interchange this we can write x 3 minus y and when you interchange this 2 to make this and this equal in the place of minus we have to write on plus we have to write 2 and we have to interchange this so 3 minus y one thing keep in your mind when you interchange this two term this negative will be positive if you are positive you have to write negative you have to change the sign it means these two are common now now look at here here also 3 minus y here also 3 minus y before what is here y minus 3 to make it same we have to take minus common when you take minus common this minus will be 
,,plus and we will interchange the sign now 3 minus y 3 minus y so we can take 3 minus y common while after taking 3 minus y common what is remaining here x so x here 
,,is plus 2 so plus 2 hope you'll understand this video look at this one here also same like above here is 1 minus a b but what is here a b minus 1 this both are not same so what we have to do we have to take minus common when you take minus common what happen in the place of plus what we have to write down minus in the place of plus we have to write down minus and we have to interchange this two so here we can write 1 minus a b while taking minus common this positive will be negative b and we have to interchange the sign 1 minus a b now look at we have to interchange the place because minus into 1 it will be minus 1 minus minus plus a b okay now you can see here here also 1 minus a b here also 1 minus a b so we can take 1 minus a b common so what is remaining here 1 and here minus b so we can write here 1 minus b 1 is here minus b is here minus b we have to take a numerical with sine hope you understand this question now look at next and the questions are 4x x minus 2 question but e 4x x minus 2 plus 3x x minus 2 okay so here you can see here also x minus 2 here also x minus 2 both are same so no need to interchange both are same means you can take common what is the common here x minus 2 x minus 2 here also here also x minus 2 so we can take x minus 2 common so what is remaining here 4 x so we have 
,,to write here 4 x plus plus what is remaining here 3x 3x this x minus 2 already here so remaining here 4x plus 3 plus 3 is here now solve x minus 2 these two are like terms so we can add 4x plus 3x is equal to 7x so this one is a single term yes monomial this binomial so monomial write down at first 7x x minus 2 hope you understand this question now look at f number you can see here here is m minus n but here is n minus m actually before also when these two are same then only we can take common otherwise we cannot take common it means we have to interchange this after interchanging this in the place of minus what we have to write down plus and we have 
,,to change their places it means we are taking minus common so we have to write here m square m minus n in the place of minus we have to write plus m n and we have to interchange the place m minus and to make it same we have to take minus common when you take minus common this minus will be plus and we these two places are changed now m minus n common here also m minus 1 here also m minus 1 so m minus 1 common what is remaining here m is square plus here is m n now you can see here m minus n here what is the common m common remaining m plus n so m m plus n m minus and m is here m plus n m minus n you can write up to here also or you can write one step more m this in the form of a plus b a minus b so we can write m square minus n square a plus b a minus b means formula of a square minus b square in some book you will get up to here but in some book you will get up to here okay it depends on writer look at question number g first of all look at here here is m e a b minus b c but here bc minus a b again these two are not same to make it same what we have to do we have to in the place of plus we have to write down minus and we have to change 
,,their places so what we have to write here a b a b minus b c to interchange their places in the place of plus we have to write on minus after that we have to change 
,,their places a b minus bc after that we have to take common you can see here these two are same same term so we can take common a b minus b c and what is remaining here here is a b so write down a b minus b c minus b c okay here now what is common here it is a b minus bc here is b here also b so we can take b comma remaining a minus c similarly here also a b minus b c so b common remaining a minus c b and b it will be b square a minus c a minus c it means a minus c whole square hope you will enjoy this video uh now last question of question number three and after that i will do question number four and uh exercise one b question number three i'm going 
,,to do uh because of some demand of some strengths and i will do question number three two of exercise one b look at here now it is two m minus four and and here is four n minus two m these two are not same so first of all we have to make it same to make same what we have to do in the place of minus what we have to write plus and we have to interchange their places so 3 m 2 m minus 4 and in the place of minus we have to write down plus 6 to m minus 4 and when these two are not same you have 
,,to take minus common when you take minus common this minus will be plus and we have to change their places that much now these two are same so we can take common 2m 
,,minus 4n common what is remaining here 3m right on 3m plus 6 plus 6 now again what is common here here is 2 here is 4 2 common remaining m minus 2 n because 2 into 2 it will be 4 here what is the common three common remaining m plus two three into m three m three into two six now number number we can multiply two into three six 
,,and m minus two n m plus 2 either this term here this term here doesn't matter it will be same uh this question number three now look at question number four and after that exercise one b question number three okay you can see here question number four four question on the board now four terms are here first second third four we have to take two terms and we have to take common again we have to take last two terms and we have to take common while taking this what is the common here m a plus and a common is a in a is same in both the term first term second term there is a is common so what is remaining here m plus n m plus n because a already common a already common remaining m m plus n plus n plus from here also you can see here is m b plus and b here is b here also b so b is the common and what is remaining here 
,,m plus n m is here m plus n plus n now you m plus and m plus n we can take m plus n common so what is remaining here a plus b m plus and m plus and common these two 
,,are common here here is a so a plus b plus b hope you understand this question now look at this one i showed you before also first of all from first two term and from last two term we have to take common sometime from first to term there will be no common it means that time we have to arrange the term okay i will show you how to arrange also so from here what is the common here is x y here is 3y y and y common y common here here is x so x we have to write plus what is here 3 so 3 plus from 
,,2x plus 6 so what is the common here from to in 2 table 2 3 6 so 2 is the common remaining x because 2 into x it will be 2 x plus 2 into which number it will be 6 3's are 2 3's are 6. now you can see here here is x plus 3 here also x plus 3 so we can take x plus 3 common here is also x plus 3 here also x plus 3 so we can take x 
,,plus 3 common what is remaining here y so we have to write y plus 2 plus 2 this one is the answer i hope you understand this question now look at this one here also 
,,can we take from first to terms common yes here is a b here is 4a so a is the common from here we can take common yes here is 5 b plus 20 5 4 is a 20 so from first to term also we can take common from last two term also we can take common so what is common here common is a remaining a plus four plus from here we can take five common five here b remaining plus five into which number it will be twenty five fours are twenty now i will tell you one thing uh sorry here is b when you take common 
,,a remaining is b a common remaining b plus a already common so what is remaining 4 and here also 5 common 5 into b 5 b 5 for the 20 again you can see here also b plus 4 here also b plus 4 so we can take b plus 4 common so b plus 4 common so what is remaining here is a so we have to write a here is plus 5 plus 5 hope you understand this question now look at question number d can you take common from here something yes m square minus 5 m n we can take m common and what is here four m minus four n so we can take four common so from first two terms we have to take common and from last two term we have to take common so here common is m so what is remaining here m minus n plus from here common is 4 remaining m minus n again you can see here after taking common look at this term m minus n here also here also m minus n so we can take m minus n common so m minus n here also here also m minus n so we can take m minus n common and what is remaining here m and here plus four so we can write m plus four remaining so this one is the solution of four question of number four now look at next remaining questions of number four now you can see the remaining question on the board uh from first to term can we take something common you can see here can we take something common x square plus 5y if if you take this two term um and this two term can we take common from here we can take x common remaining 5 plus y but from here we cannot take common it means we have to arrange first so first and last look at properly here if we take this two term can we take x common yes we can take x common so what is remaining here x plus 5 and when you take this 2 what is common here y common remaining x plus 5 yes we can take first and third second and fourth so first of all we have to arrange x square plus 5x plus xy plus 5y this one at last now from this two term we have to take common common is x remaining x plus 5 x common x into x it will be x square and x into 5 it will be 5 x plus from here what is the common x y plus 5 y so common is y remaining x plus 5 again here is also x plus 5 here also x plus 5 i told you when these two are same then only you have to take common otherwise we have to interchange so already here same so we can take common x plus 5 here remaining is x plus here is y so answer is x plus 5 x plus y look at here when you take this two term can we take common no we cannot talk here is a square n is 15 b we cannot take anything common from here 
,,we can take common but we cannot take common here so first of all we have to arrange this so if we take this two term a common and remaining a minus five from here we can take three b common remaining a minus five yes first and third we can take second and last we have to take look at how to write first of all we have to arrange a square minus five a plus 3 a b minus 15 b after practicing you will practice more and more then you can understand how to arrange from wisdom we have to take common it depends on your practice okay now from this two term we have to take common common is a remaining a minus five from this two term what is the common here first of all look at number three and fifteen three fives are fifteen so common is three here also b here also b so we have can take b common three b already common so what is remaining a a minus three into which number it will be fifteen definitely five and b already common so a minus five now you can see here also a minus five here also a minus 5 so we can take a minus 5 common and remaining a plus 3 b so a plus 3 b remaining hope you understand this question now look at this one you can see here again it is minus m minus n plus 1 plus m n from this two term we can take common we cannot take anything common from first and third we can take common no common here from first and last can we take common yes there is common so write down like this minus m plus m n and write down plus m minus and first of all we have to arrange in this form now from here we can take common what is the common here m but we have to take minus also because first term what is here minus m so we have to take minus m common what is remaining here 1 and here is plus so we have to change the sign we have to write minus because minus is already common so we have to change sign when minus is common we have to change sign because minus minus it will be plus so if here minus we have to write plus if here plus we have to write down minus so m already common what is the remaining here and so n plus from here what is the common can you tell me comma no common there if no common but we have to write down one so remaining 1 minus and because 1 into 1 it will be 1 1 into n it will be n now 1 minus n 1 minus n so we can write 1 minus n common remaining minus m minus 
,,m plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 here now 1 minus n 1 minus m this one is positive so right on first minus any m is negative so right on it last hope you understand either this one front and 1 minus n at the back no problem because 2 into 4 and 4 into 2 it will be same 8 and so here also multiplication but if add and subtract then there is a problem but this one is multiplication so no problem you can write here and there no now look at here from this two term we cannot take any common now you can see from here we can take x common from here we can take 6y common okay so first of all we have to arrange x square minus 2xy plus 6xy minus 12y square now from this two term we have to take common common is x here is x square here is x so common is x remaining x minus this x already common so what is remaining here 2y so write down 2y plus from this to term we have to take common here is 6 here is 12 so common is 6 here is x y here is y square so common is y 6 y into x x is remaining 6 y already common so what is remaining here x here is minus so right on minus now 6 into which number it will be 12 6 2's are 12. here is y square from y square y is common so how many y remaining 1 so y is here now you can see here is x minus 2 y here is x minus 2 y x minus 2 y x minus 2 y so we can take x minus 2 y common so what is remaining here x and here is plus 6y so x plus 6 y hope you understand this question number 3 and 4. now exercise 1b question number 3. some students demanded that 
,,also so i'm providing in same video from exercise one e here question number three it's very easy uh you can see here the this one this equation in the form this term in the form of a square minus b square now what is the formula of a square minus b square a square minus b square is a plus b a minus b so in the place of a you can see here in the place of a what is here 20 in the place of b what is here 16 so what we have to write a plus b a minus b it means what we have to write here 20 plus 16 20 minus 16 this in the form of a square minus b square in the place of a 20 in the place of b 16 so formula is a plus b a minus b a plus b minus b in the place of a 20 in the place of b16 so 20 plus 16 20 minus 16 and when you add this 2 we get 36 and when you subtract this 2 we get 4 and after that just multiply 6 4s are 
,,24 4 2 4 3 12 13 14. so 144 is the answer hope you will understand this question this one also same and other questions also same you can do yourself also so just concept is necessary if you understand the concept of math concept of problems you can solve yourself each and every question this also in the form of a square minus b square in the place of a 51 and in the place of b here is 50 in the place of a 51 in the place of b50 so we have to write 50 plus 50 51 plus 50 51 minus 50. here also same we have to write 51 plus 50 and 51 minus 50 so when you add this to we get 101 into yes when you add this 2 we get 101 and when you subtract this 2 we get 1 
,,and when you multiply this 2 we have to multiply we get 101 hope you understand this question other questions also you can do in same process and um so thank you so 
,,much for those students who comment and demanding of question number three for of exercise 1a and question number three of exercise 1b like this keep supporting thank you so much keep in touch if and please don't forget to just share with your friends and please ignore this background song thank you

AlgebraicExpression,GYevDfFTCUs,hello grade 9 students today I am here to teach you an algebraic you need that's algebraic expressions chapter 5 we'll take algebraic expressions 3x plus 7 what is this one 3x plus 7 is the algebraic expression and what is 3x 3x is the algebraic term and what's the coefficient of the algebraic term that's 3 so what you call this number this is the constant term 7 so in algebra you need to know what is algebraic expression algebraic term and the coefficient of the algebraic term and the constant look at this algebraic expression 3 a + 5 b -11 write down the algebraic terms in the algebraic expression here 3 a is an algebraic term and 5 B you can't write minus 11 minus 11 is a constant write down the constant term that's minus 11 expanding brackets in algebraic expressions you have done this before in grade 8 how you expand multiply the first term with first and this one second so 3 times X 3 X 3 times 4 plus 12 all the elements inside the brackets must must be multiplied by 3 
,,this is an algebraic expression with algebraic term is 3x so this is the algebraic term the coefficient of algebraic term is 3 and the constant term is 12 now expand this minus 5 times a minus 5 a minus 5 times minus 4 you get plus 20 when multiplying by negative number the terms inside the brackets changed the sign look at here a was positive law - five earlier this was - value now this is Plus expand brackets 3 times a 3 a 3 times 2 + 6 here 5 times X 5x - 5 times 4 26 times a 6 a plus 6 
,,times 1 6 minus 7 times X minus 7 X minus 7 times minus 4 plus 28 minus 3 times 5 minus 50 minus 3 into minus y plus 3 y here - 11 times 3 minus 33 - 11 x minus m plus 11 m take these questions eight times like 8 times X 8 X 8 x - 4 - 32 here 4 times a 4 - 4 times 1/2 so what is 4 times 1/2 that means 2 so minus 2 6 times 2 X 12 X minus 6 this one 5 times 3 15 p phi x cubed minus 5 q this 1 minus 2 times X minus 2 X minus minus plus plus 22 what 1/2 times 4 X here you can do separately 1/2 
,,times 2 X here you get 2 X 1/2 times 8 you get 4 so plus Oh expand brackets a times X X a times 4 4 B times X BX B times minus 3 minus 3 this one C X plus C C times 
,,1 that's C P times Q P Q minus P times 4 you can write minus 4p when you are writing the term write the number first M into M M square M into 4 for M P into P P squared P into minus Q minus P Q 2 way times a 2 a squared 2 a times B 2 a 3 X into X 3x squared 3 X into minus 2 minus 6 X here what happens - is there - 2 P times M minus 2 will write MP in order alphabetical order M first minus 2p times minus 4 plus 8 P here again - values minus 3 X into X minus 3 X square minus 3 X into minus y 
,,plus 3 X 5 - 2 y into Z minus 2 y Z minus 2 into 3 minus 6 Y this 1 minus px - + - + P Y what about this one a square into a square a B and minus 3a X into X x squared X into - y - x - y or first we have to write down the number -2 X Y X into five that's five X we don't say X 5 5 X is the correct way of writing substitute the values in the algebraic expression what we do we can substitute the values given a equals 2 there so the algebraic term is three so how do you do that first write down the expression substitute a is 2 3 times 2 + 7 6 plus 7 that's 13 determine the value of x squared + 5 X minus 11 when x equals 3 what is x squared means 3 times 3 
,,so 3 squared 5 times 3 minus 11 9 plus 15 minus 11 15 minus 11 is 4 9 plus 4 30 what's the expression given here 5x minus 4y plus 7 you asked to find out when x equals -2 and y equals minus 3 substitute 5 times minus 2 y times minus 3 5 times minus 2 minus 10 minus minus plus 12 plus 7 minus 10 plus 12 plus 2 2 plus 7 that's 9 find the value of the algebraic expression by substituting the values for the unknown letters given below a squared minus a is given 3 so that means 3 squared minus 3 3 squared is 9 9 minus 3 you get six seven X minus three y plus four x equals 4 that means 7 times 4 y equals to 7 times 4 28 3 times 2 6 28 minus 6 22 22 plus 4 you get 26 this one you have to substitute a fraction we'll see a equals 1/2 so that means 4 times 1/2 B equals 3 3 times 3 2 times 2 so you get 2 plus 9 minus 9 9 9 get cancel out and you get to them expand brackets and simplify as much as possible first expand brackets 2 times a 2 a 2 times minus B minus 2 B plus 3a plus 21 now 
,,I'd like terms 2 & 3 8 that's 5 8 and - to be there plus 21 here first expand brackets 3x - 6 5 I plus 5 here constant terms we can simplify 3 X plus 5 by minus 6 and plus 5 is minus 1 here 6a plus 6b you know nothing means this is like 1 minus a plus v6 a - a highway 6 b + B it's 7 B expand and simplify 3x + 3 y here 2x minus 2y like terms add 3x and 2x becomes 5x 3 y + minus 2y that's plus y 1y you don't need to write 1 here 5 a minus 10 B minus 3 a minus into minus plus 12 B 5 a and minus 3a 2a minus 10 10 plus 12 plus 2 so plus 2b this one nothing means this is like 1 so a minus 3 multiply these 2 minus M square R and minus - plus 5 m now what are 
,,the like terms you can't simplify further this 1 minus 3 X minus minus plus 6 y + 7 x + 7 by minus 3 X and + 7 X that's 4 X 6 plus 7 13 y 2 x 3 6 6 minus 2 y here nothing means this is like what x + 6 X + X 7 X minus 2 n + y -1 Y that's minus y into a a squared - 3 a 2 times 3 6 a 2 times 4 8 what are the like terms these 2 a squared plus 6 and minus 3 you get plus 3 a + 8 this one x squared minus XY + 3 X +6 so you can't simplify this one further minus 3x minus minus plus 15y plus 7x minus 7y what are the like terms 7x minus 3x that's points 15 minus 7 plus 8y there's a minus sign minus 7 e minus into minus plus 7 b minus three b minus minus becomes plus 3 times 3 9 a what are the like terms 90 + -7 a you get to it 7 b minus 3 B that's for be here three terms but you can do the same thing multiplied by 5 5 X minus 5 bi plus 15 is is this one and then 3 X + 3 y 5x + 3 X 8 X - 5 bi plus 3 by - 2 y + 15 there this one - way - 4 B plus 3 a + 3 B let 2a and 3a 5b 5a plus 3a 8 minus 4 B plus 3b that's - 1b or just you can write B this one 5x - 5 by this 1 minus 3 X plus 3y minus minus plus and 11 Y is there 5x + 3 X - 3 X 2x - 5 plus 3 minus 
,,2 y 11 minus 2 plus 9 substituting fractions - algebraic terms X is half you asked to find out 4 X plus 5 so substitute 4 times 1/2 plus 5 here you can see you can simplify the denominator with the numerator 1 and here so you get 2 + 5 that's 7 equals 1/3 9a plus 2/9 times 1/3 + 2 here 3 times 1/3 times 3 3 + 2 you get 5 x equals 2/3 now 9 x + 1 9 times 2/3 plus 1/3 times 1/3 times 3 so 3 times 2 6 6 + 1 7 here 11 minus 3 when a equals minus 2/3 11 minus 3 times minus 2 over 3 will put brackets here 3 + 3 get cancel out you get 11 minus into minus plus 11 plus 2 answer yes 13 equals 1/2 B equals 1/3 so this should be simple B so we'll substitute the values for a equals 1/2 we cause 1/3 2 times 1/2 times 2 so what's the answer 2 + here are 3 in one three two one so one day three to plus one you'll get three six a six times 1/2 minus 3 times 1/3 substitute a and B two times three three get cancelled out so what's remaining 3 here 1 3 minus 1 is 2 8 E is 1/2 B is 1/3 2 times 1/2 times 4 3 times 1/3 times 2 here 4-2 ours is to 18 times 1/2 six times one thirty two and nine three bit too so what's the final answer nine minus two answer is seven if x equals 2/3 and y equals 1/2 find the value of the following algebraic expressions 6 times 2/3 2 times 1/2 3 times 1/3 times 2 2 times 1/2 times 1/2 times 2 4 here plus one times one one four plus one you get five this one 9 times X what is X X is 2/3 4 times 1/2 3 times 1/3 times 3 2 times 1/2 times 2 so 3 times 2 is 6 2 times 1 is 2 6 minus 2 same question another part 12 X is 2/3 - why why is half substitute 3 times 1/3 times 4 4 times 2 eight here - when to get canceled out you get one there 8 + 1 9 9 X is 2/3 minus 2 times 1/2 3 n here 3 3 times 2 6 2 + 2 get cancelled out you get minus 1 6 - 1 answer is 5 find the value of value if P equals 1/3 so substitute 1/3 for P simplify first 3 times 2 6 2 + 4 that's 6 9 P minus 2/9 times P is 1/3 minus 2 here simplify 3 + 3 3 - 2 you get 12 P P is 1/3 + 3 3 times 1 3 times 4 4 + 3 you get 7 3 P plus 11 3 into 1/3 + ulema 3 + 3 get cancel out 1 plus 11 is 12 so you need to simplify the fractional part that's multiplication and then do the addition find the value if M equals to 4 times 2 + 11 8 plus 11 that's 19 6 times 2 plus 5 multiplication first 12 + 5 17 10 times 2 - 1 xx - 1 that's 19 8 times 2 plus 10 8 times 2 16 + 10 26 find the value when x equals 2l y equals 1/3 for X is 2 y is 138 plus 1/3 how can you write you can write 8 full parts and 135 X plus 3 by 5 X that's not bad by 2 3 y 1/3 is there 3 3 get cancelled out so 10 plus 1 the answer is either 1 another one 8 times 2 minus 6 times 1/3 3 and here too you get 6 8 times 2 16 minus 2 answer is 14 again this one 10 times 2 minus 9 times white why is 1/3 3 times 1/3 times 3 10 times 2 20 minus 3 answer is 17 find the value of M equals 1/2 and in equals 1/2 for these expressions 8m a miss half in Miss 152 times 4 here are 5 times 2 4 times 1 4 2 times 1 2 4 minus 2 you get to do the same thing 16mm is 1/2 it needs 152 with 16 you get eight five and five get canceled out 8 minus 1 is 7 10 mm is half a Miss 152 and ten five five and this 1 so 5 plus 1 you get 6 6 times mm is 1/2 minus 15 times n that's one field to end is 3 5 times 3 15 so you get 3 minus 3 answer is 0 binomial expressions what is 
,,bi means two so expressions means when you get two terms 3x plus 4y is binomial expression X minus 5i so all these are binomial expressions so there are two terms in all these expressions due to one term or both of these terms are algebraic terms these are called binomial algebraic expressions so here one term is constant and the other one is algebraic term here both terms are algebraic terms product of two binomial expressions now X plus 2 is a binomial expression X plus 3 or so another binomial expression now we'll try to multiply these two so this is the product of both binary expressions or binomial expressions expand the brackets and simplify as much as possible now we'll try to do that using this method so we are multiplying here X plus 3 they are we can write x plus 2 here X plus 2 this way row wise X plus 
,,3 column wise X plus 2 so we can use multiply row and columns X into X we know this is X square X into plus 3 plus 3x this one 2 into X plus 2 X 2 into 3 plus 6 so what's the answer when you multiply using this method you get x squared - 3 X 2 X + 6 now simplify I can simplify these two - 3 + 2 5 X + 6 so that's how we can multiply using this method now we'll do the same thing X + 3 is there x + 5 X into X x squared X into 5 5 X 3 into X 3 X 3 into 5 15 so what are the values you are getting here when you multiply you get x squared - 5 X 3x + 15 so when you simplify you get 8x plus 15 - the same thing a plus 4a plus 4a into a a square into 4 4 a 5 into a 5 a 5 into 4 20 so when you multiply you get all these terms so a square plus 4 plus 5a plus 20 so when you can so you can add these to phibn for where you get 9e and this is 20 similar to that one y + 3 y + 7 Y into y Y square my into 3 3 by 7 into y 7y 7 into 3 20 so what's the answer Y squared 3 by 7 y + 20 bucks so these 
,,two terms you can add you get 10 buy and here are twenty one this one now - so a minus two so you can write in one color - to a +3 here a squared - 2 way here plus 3 a + -6 - into + - now what are the terms you are getting a squared minus 2a plus 3 and minus 6 so simply 5 3 - 2 + 1 that's a minus 6 this was X - 5 X - 2 so we need to multiply X into X X square X into minus 5 minus 5 X here you get minus 2 X minus 2 into minus 5 that's + step write down the terms and simplify x squared minus 
,,5 minus 2 minus 7 and you'll get 10 here similar to that one a minus 7 a minus 3 a into a a square minus 7 8 - 3 times a minus 3 a minus 3 times minus 7 plus 25 so what are the terms you are getting a squared minus 7 a minus 3 a + 21 a squared - 7 + -3 minus 10 plus 21 expand and simplify so we'll take the whole expression multiplied with this and this so you get a into a plus 2 here 3 with a plus 2 now expand brackets a into a square plus 2 a 3 into a 3a plus 6 so you get a squared 2a and 
,,3a v b +6 this one through the same thing the whole expression multiplied with this one X into X minus 2 5 into X minus 2 then expand brackets x squared minus 2x plus 5 X minus 10 so x squared minus 2 plus 5 that's plus 3x minus 10 this one this whole expression with this end this p with p + 5 + -7 b 3 plus 5p squared plus 5p minus 7 P minus 35 so you get P squared minus 7 and plus 5 minus 2p minus 35 this one Y with Y minus 3 and minus 4 with Y minus 3 so this term multiplied by these two 
,,terms Y squared minus 3y minus 4y plus 12 so you get Y squared minus 3 minus 4 minus 7y then you get plus expand and simplify again we can write a plus 3 expression 
,,with a plus 7 with this now expand a square plus 3 plus seventy plus 21 but you get a squared 3 a + 7 a 10 a plus 21 what about this one y with y + 7 + 4 with y + 7 
,,now multiply Y into y y square and 4y plus 28 four times seven simplify y squared 7 plus 4 11 y plus 28 this one a minus 3 times M plus 4 times M minus 3 M into M M 
,,squared minus 3 M 4 M minus 12 so you get M squared minus 3 plus 4 plus M minus 12 what about this one p + 7 x p + + 8 x p + 7 you get P squared + 7 p 8 b + 56 p square 7 p + 8 P 15 P Plus 56 look at this one P with P minus 8 and the other one is minus 3 with P minus 8 expand brackets you get V squared minus 18 minus 3 P plus 24 P square 8 + 3 11 so this is minus 24 there this one X with X - 4 - 7 with X - 4 x squared minus 4 X minus 7 X + 28 x squared minus 4 X and minus 7 X minus 11 X and here plus 28 here 4 into 6 + P + + P into 6 + p expand separately 24 + 4 p here 6 P plus P squared so 24 is there here 6 plus 4 10 plus P Square what about this one 4 is there 7 - why - why with 7 - what 4 times 7 28 here - 4 y minus 7y plus y square answer is 28 minus 4 minus 7 minus 11 y + y squared there this one a with a - 
,,8 + 8 with a minus 8a squared - 8 8 plus 8 a + 64 minus 64 a squared - 8 e + 8 a get cancel out you get minus 68 so this one P into P minus 4 and plus 4 with P minus 4p squared - 4 p + 4 P minus 16 yeah also me the term get canceled out P squared minus 16 is what seven with seven plus M minus M with seven plus M when you simplify expand brackets 49 + 7 m - 7 M minus M Squared so what's the value 49 minus M Squared because this these two terms get cancelled out so what are these actually can you remember difference between two squared terms so you get square terms here and here this one give it to a plus three minus five it to a plus three to a squared 
,,plus 3a minus 10y minus fifteen simplify you get 2a squared - 7 8 - 15 question number 19 expand using the arrow now we'll use another method we call it rainbow method or foil so I'll show you how to do that at once without writing separate brackets this one first with first number so that's F a into a that's a square that's F first with first that's the arrow number one now we are taking oh-oh means outside values so outside here with outside that's the second one a with eight get 8a that's outside I mean inside with inside so inside with inside that's number three three with you get three that's I thought 1l l means last with last two last week last 
,,that's fourth one three with eight you get 24 that's so we call this method is foil method first with first outside with outside inside with inside last with last oh they call it rainbow meter this is like a rainbow this one this one this one rainbow so we can call it rainbow method now we'll practice rainbow method or foil method you put the arrows first first with first why square then Oh outside numbers so why then inside 7y and l-last values 28 y squared plus 11 y plus 28 now do the same thing this one p square then the second one is this +7 p third one is minus 2p fourth one is minus 14 simplify you get 7 minus 2 plus 5p this one use rainbow or foil method first with first then outside numbers inside numbers and then last two values simplify you get M Squared 8 minus 7 plus M minus 56 that's why first with first 48 this with this 8 be inside six feet and outside numbers last last numbers P Square this one 48 + 8 + 6 14 P plus P squared rainbow method a squared + AC plus 
,,a B plus C can you simplify this one you can't simplify no like terms are there this one M squared plus 7 minus 2m minus 14x squared plus five M minus 14 this one three-year plus 24x squared + 8 simplify like terms you get 3a + 80 1124 and this one reimu bitter or foil method M squared minus 8 M minus 3 M plus 8 times 3 20 simplify you get 11 m in the middle and here you get 24 they're the same thing you have to use foil of rainbow method P into 7 7 P P into P P squared 11 times 7 77 11 now add these to get 18 P plus P squared plus 77 this one y squared minus 2y plus 2y minus 4 meter term get cancel out minus 2y plus 2y get cancel out you get Y squared minus H squared plus 7 h minus 7 Beach - 49 me turtle get cancel out h squared - 49 this one use rainbow method 12 x - 12 x - 24 12 X 2 X + x squared so 24 there 12 + 2 14 and you get x squared expand brackets using areas now we'll use another method to expand brackets x no Mielec specials so x + 2 X + 3 so we think about the area of a rectangle so X + 3 we write like this this way x + 2 we can fill each area and add it together so X into X x squared X into 3 3 X 2 into X 2 X 2 into 3 6 so what's the total area of the rectangle areas of each rectangle add up to gether X square plus 3 X plus 2 X plus 6 you get 5 X so you can use this method as well considering areas of rectangles because here what is the total area X plus 3 into X plus 2 length into breadth now look at this one X plus 3 one side X plus 4 the other side so fill the areas x squared 4 X 3 X + 12 so what's the total area x squared + 4 X + 3 X + 12 when you add these two together you get 7x plus 12 this one what's the area this is x + 6 + x + 4 multiplication of these two so fill this x squared this is 6 X 4 X + 24 add it together x squared plus 6 X plus 4 X plus 24 is equal 
,,to x squared + 10 x 6 + 4 + 24 they're given that the following equations show that the above equation is true for a equals 3 so we'll do left hand side and right hand side and see whether both are equal so take the left hand side and substitute a equals 3 3 + 2 7 + 3 10 3 + 2 5 10 times 5 50 now we'll take the right hand side and substitute a squared + 9 a plus 40 equals 3 3 squared 9 times 3 + 14 9 9 times 3 27 + 14 what's the value 9 + 7 16 22 through four five so that's also fifty so you can say this is equal so left hand side is equal to right hand and this is so therefore it's true given that the following equation show that the above equation is true for x equals five take the left hand side and substitute five five plus two pi + 3 5 + 2 7 5 + 3 8 8 times 7 56 now take the right hand side x squared + 5 X plus 6 substitute x equals 5 5 squared pi times 5 + 6 here 25 5 times 5 25 + 650 + 6 56 so we can see left hand side is equal to right hand side so therefore the statement is true for x equals 5 given that the following equations show that the above equation is true for x equals 7 so take the left hand side and substitute x equals 7 7 minus 3 7 minus 2 4 times 5 20 now we'll take right hand side and substitute x squared minus 5x plus 6 x squared that means 7 squared minus 5 times 7 plus 6 49 
,,minus 35 plus 6 49 minus 35 you get 14 14 plus 6 that's 20 so you get 20 so left hand side is equal to right hand side therefore this statement is given that the following in question show that the above equation is true for y equals 10 so left hand side substitute Y constant 10 plus 7 10 - 11 so what's 10 plus 7 70 10 - 11 - 117 times minus 1 minus 70 now take the right hand side and substitute Y squared minus 4y minus 77 Y is 10 10 squared - 4 times 10 minus 77 so what's the answer hundred minus 40 minus 77 100 minus 40 60 60 minus 77 is - 17 so we get same answer so left hand side is equal to right hand side so that means this is true when y equals 
,,10 given that the following equation show that the above equation is true for a equals 6 left hand side a squared + 7 8 plus 12 substitute 6 6 squared plus 7 times 6 plus 12 36 42 + 12 so you get 6 plus 2 8 10 and then one remaining 8 9 so 90 now we look at the right hand side a plus 3 is 6 6 plus 3 6 + 4 6 plus 3 9 6 plus 4 10 
,,10 times 9 19 so left hand is equal to right hand side and therefore it's true for equals true we can write true 4 equals 6 review exercise expand the following expressions 5x plus 2 multiply each term with the outside number 3 y plus 3 8m plus this 1 3 X minus 3 4 times 3 12 minus 4 y 6x 2 times minus 2 minus 4 1 negative numbers negative 2 times negative 2 negative 2 times 3 negative 6 negative 6 here negative 3 X this one - tiny - into + -15 big minus 4m minus - plus that's 8 here nothing means this is like - what so you get minus 5 plus y minus 1 into minus 1 here minus - plus 10 times 3 30 30 B minus into minus plus again 10 times 2 20 C expand the following expressions X into a X + 2 X there to be by write the letters in order - 3 2 times a X and you get three a why here this one to ax to a into five ten to

,,cut expert so what is this side 15-6 this width or breadth is 8 cut out expert so this becomes 8 minus 6 so you need the shaded area shaded area the rectangle with 15 minus 6 and 8 minus X so basically you need the multiplication so remaining portion is 8 minus X into 15 minus X now use foil 8 times 15 8 times 5 48 times 1/8 + 4 12 minus 8 X minus 15 XL plus X square minus minus becomes plus 120 minus 8 minus 15 minus 23 X plus x squared so this is the area of the remaining portion so consider X less than 8 means if this is more than it you get a negative length so rectangle length cannot be negative another question question number 9 a rectangular flowerbed of length X meters and breadth 2 meters is shown in the figure two meters are reduced from its length and X meters are added to its breadth and then construct an expression in terms of X for the area of the new flowerbed by using a figure so now this is two meters are reduced so what's the what's this one X minus two now 
,,what's the height X added so this is the new length two plus X now this is the new flowerbed so what's the area X minus 2 into 2 plus X that's the new area now multiply X into 2 2x X into X x squared minus 2 into 2 minus 4 and minus 2 into X minus 2 X so you get 2x and minus 2x get canceled out x squared minus miscellaneous exercise write an expression for the shaded area in the given figure and simplified so this is a composite figure so you can divide into two parts we'll divide from here so we can find out this rectangle and this rectangle then add so what's the area of this one and this one so we'll take the first one first area is X plus 3 into X 
,,plus 2 use foil x squared plus 2x + 3 X + 6 you get x squared plus 5x plus 6 now the second part X plus 1 and X plus 2 so you get x squared plus 2x plus 1 x + 2 you 
,,get x squared plus 3 X plus 2 now you have two areas what's the total area so total area is equal to add these two 1 and 2x squared plus 5x plus 6 plus x squared 3x 
,,plus 2x squared x squared 2x squared 5x + 3 X 8 X 6 + 2 8 another one so you asked to find out the shaded part so we can do subtract the small area from the bigger one so we can do shaded area is equal to what's the bigger one x + 18 2 X + 5 what's the small area so inside rectangle X plus 1 and X plus 2 now we will do separately and subtract x squared + 5 X + 8 X + 40 now subtract this one put brackets x squared + 2 X + 1 x + 1 times 2 that's 2 now subtract these two you get x squared + 8 
,,+ 5 13 x + 40 then subtract x squared is there 2 x + 1 X you get 3 x + 2 now expand bracket six squared plus 13x plus 40 minus x squared minus 3x minus 2 so x squared minus x squared 0 13 X and minus 3x you get 10 X 40 minus 2 you get 38 and the last question find the values of a and B so you have given this statement X plus a into X plus 4 is x squared plus BX plus 12 now we'll expand and see what you get on the right left hand side what you get on the left hand side x squared plus 4x plus a X + 4 that's given equals 2x squared B X plus 12 now we'll write down X term separately can take X out I can write 4 plus a plus 4a is equal to x squared plus BX 
,,plus 12 these two I equal so you can compare the coefficients ya X term X coefficient is 4 plus a what's the X coefficient there that's big what about this one constant term for a is equal to 12 from this you can find a substitute here and find B so divided by 4 a equals 12 divided by 4 that's 3 now substitute 3 here 4 plus 3 you get B so B equals 7 so a equals 3 and B equals 7 we covered all theory part in expanding brackets substituting values in algebraic expressions so practice all these exercises and examples and thorough week as you break expressions

AlgebraicExpression,8MNNWrIO5to,this was the equation we looked at in the previous video X plus 3 equals 10 I have left some space here intentionally there are two ways in which we can solve an equation the phrase solving an equation means finding the value of the variable that satisfies the equation by satisfies I mean a value of the variable that equates the left-hand side and the right-hand side so our aim in linear equations is mainly to find the value of this variable X the first method is the inverse operations method before you understand this method we need to understand a simple concept whatever we do to the left hand side we do the same to the right hand side let us choose 
,,a random number say 5 assume we add this number to the left hand side for the equation to hold true we have to add the same number to the right hand side similarly if we subtract 5 from the left hand side we have to subtract the same number from the right hand side if we multiply the left-hand side by the number we have to multiply the right hand side by the same number but remember we have to multiply the entire side but putting these brackets here it means that we multiplied the entire left hand side by 5 and if we divide the left hand side by the number we also divide the right hand side by the same number note that 5 was a random number now you should be wondering how this concept helps us solve an equation this concept is the crux of the inverse operations method just remember this concept we move to a new page to solve a new linear equation say we want to solve the equation 2x plus 5 equals 13 how do we use the inverse method to solve this equation remember when we have to solve such equations our aim should be to keep only the variable on the left hand we have to eliminate everything else so our first task should be to eliminate five so we will have to subtract five from the left-hand side but we just learnt a concept that said if we subtract a number from the left-hand side we have to subtract the same number from the right-hand side hence we subtract 5 from both sides we get 2x plus 5 minus 5 equal to 13 minus 5 we subtracted 5 from both sides 5 cancels out on the left-hand side and the right-hand side equals 8 hence our equation reduces to 2x equals 8 now to have just the variable on the left-hand side we have to eliminate its coefficient which is 2 so we can just divide the left-hand side by 2 and if we divide the left-hand side by 2 we have to divide the right-hand side also by 2 so we divide both sides by 2 we get 2x by 2 equals 8 by 2 2 cancels out on the left-hand side and 8 by 2 equals 4 hence we get X equal to 4 this tells us that if you put 4 in place of X here you will get a 13 let's review this method quickly our aim was to have only the variable on the left-hand side so we first eliminated 5 by subtracting 5 from both sides and then we eliminated 2 by dividing both sides by 2 which gave us the value of x as for the last step after solving the equation should be to check our answer so on the left-hand side please substitute the value of x and see if it equals the right-hand side the left-hand side is 2x plus 5 substituting 4 in place of X we get 2 x 4 plus 5 that equals 8 plus 5 which is 13 the same as the right hand side so we say that our value of x is correct you

AlgebraicExpression,lDOYdBgtnjY,look at this problem three added to a number gives us ten find that number we know it's seven but that's not the reason why I asked you this question I want to know 
,,how can we represent this problem in a simpler way we can probably say X plus three equals ten find X 3 is added to a number to get 10 we just assign a variable to that number this is called an equation and it helps us write large problems like these in a shorter way this equation has just one variable which is X and it's an unknown and the highest power of X is 1 these kinds of equations are called linear equations in one variable they are also referred to as first degree equations in one 
,,variable they are called linear of first degree because the highest degree of the variable is 1 we will have a deeper understanding of why such equations are called 
,,linear in the coming videos we categorize an equation into three parts we have an equality sign in the center to its left is the left-hand side which is shown here as LHS and to its right is the right-hand side shown here as RHS the problems for such kind of equations require us to solve for the value of the variable there are two ways in which we can solve the equation the first method is called the inverse operations method and the second one is by using the transpose method both the methods give us the same answer but after we solve equations using both the methods we will realize that the transpose method is preferred over the inverse operations method you you

AlgebraicExpression,9BXFmrjUflo,solving algebraic equations hello there students welcome back to my classroom for today's lesson you are going to learn how to solve 40 variable in on algebraic equation let us begin first let's have our first example we have here a number increased by 7 is 25. first we need to translate this one into one equation we have a number which is missing or unknown so let us represent this by a variable let m be our variable next one we have increased by 7 which means addition so that is plus 7 and lastly we have is 25 which means equals 25. now our equation is m plus 7 equals 25. now solving for equations means finding the value of the variable to solve for 
,,the value of the variable we need to separate or leave it alone in one side this means that we need to get rid of the constant seven but how are we going to do that 
,,let's see our first way to get rid of our constant plus seven we need to get its opposite operation which is subtraction therefore we are going to subtract seven here there you go now always remember that whatever we do in one side we also need to do it on the other side since we subtract 7 on our left side we are going to subtract 7 on our right side there now it's time to solve so here we have seven minus seven which is zero so we can simply cancel this out that leaves us the variable f on the other side we have 25 minus seven which is 18 great job therefore the value of our variable is 18. now let's try to answer this one using our second way again 
,,our equation is m plus 7 equals 25 and for our second way we are going to get the opposite operation of our constant since we have plus seven the opposite is minus seven and the next thing that you are going to do is to move it on the other side of our equation there you go now we have m equals 25 minus 7. now let us solve 25 minus 7 is great job it's 18 and we got the same answer now for us to make sure if our answer is correct let us check to check if our answer is correct we need to substitute the value of the variable that we got into our equation there now our n service correct let's go and have another example this time we have the sum of a number and 34 is 49 so let us translate this one first into one equation we have the sum of a number and 34. the sum means addition so that is x plus 34 which is 49 so that is equals 49. our equation is x plus 34 equals 49 again we need to remember that to solve for the variable we need to separate a limit alone in one side therefore we need to get rid of our constant 34. now since it is addition we need to get its opposite which is subtraction therefore we need to subtract 34 and again we need 
,,to remember that whatever we do on one side we also need to do it on the other side so since we subtract 34 on our left side we are also going to subtract 34 on our 
,,right side there you go now let us solve so we have here 34 minus 34 which is zero so we can simply cancel this out and that leaves us the variable x on the other side we have 49 minus 34 and that is wonderful it is 15. now let's try our second way again our equation is x plus 34 equals 49. so the first thing that you need to do is to get the opposite of our constant plus 34 which is minus 34 and then move it into the other side of the equation so that gives us x equals 49 minus 34 49 minus 34 is 15 wonderful we just got the same answer now let's check for our answer let us substitute the value of the variable now our answer is current now let us move 
,,on to our next example this time we have 6 less than a number is 24. again let's translate this into one equation so first we have here 6 less than which means subtraction so that is minus 6. and next one we have a number which means missing so we can represent this by a variable let's say variable y and x1 we have is 24 which is equals 24. now let us solve again we need to get rid of our constant to leave the variable alone in one side so for our first way we have y minus six the opposite 
,,operation of minus six is plus six therefore we are going to add six here and since we add six on the left side we are going to add six also on the right side there 
,,you go now we can see here we have negative six plus six and that is zero so we can simply cancel this out and that leaves us our variable y equals 24 plus six which is 30. great job therefore the value of our variable is 30. now let's try using our second way first thing that we need to do again is to get the opposite of our constant which is negative six or minus six and the opposite of this one is plus six and the next thing that we are going to do is to move this one into the other side of the equation there we have 24 plus sixes 30 great job now let's check our answer there you go now let's have another example this time we have the difference of 
,,a number and 9 is 16. again let's translate this one first into an equation the difference of a number and 9. so this means subtraction so we have x minus 9 is 16 which is equals 16. now let us solve for the variable by getting rid of the constant now let's try our first week so we have x minus nine again we need to get the opposite of minus nine which is plus nine and we need to do it on the other side too there now let us solve so we have negative nine plus nine which is zero so let us cancel this out and that leaves us the variable x next one on the other side we have 16 plus nine and that is 25 very good now for our second way we have again our equation x minus nine equals 16. so again we need to get the opposite of minus nine which is plus nine and move it on the other side of the equation there so we have x 
,,equals 16 plus 9 which is 25 great job now let us check our answer awesome now let's have another example we have twice a number is 36 so let us translate this one first into one equation so we have twice a number which means 2 times a number so that is 2 times b or 2v which is equals 36. so again to get the value of the variable we need to separate or limit alone on one side therefore we need to get rid of the coefficient 2 but how are we going to do that let's have our first way so like we did earlier we can get rid of our coefficient or our constant value by getting it opposite operation so since this is multiplication which is 2 times b we can get 
,,rid of the coefficient 2 by division so we need to divide 2 on both sides now we have 2b divided by 2 equals 36 divided by 2. now to cancel out the coefficient that 
,,is 2 divided by 2 which is 1. so we can simply cancel this out and that leaves us the variable b while on the other side we have 36 divided by 2 which is 18 great job now let's have our second way again our equation is 2b equals 36 now to get rid of the coefficient 2 we are just simply going to move it on the other side of the equation by dividing the other side by the coefficient there you go so that gives us b equals 36 divided by 2 which is 18. great job now to check our answer let's substitute the value of the variable now our answer is correct now let's go and have another example this time we have n divided by 8 is 11. so let us translate this one first we have n divided by 8 which means n over or divided by it is equal 11. again the first thing that we need to do is to separate a little only variable on one side so this means we need to get rid of our constant which is eight but how are we going to do that so let's try our first weight we have n divided by eight equals 11. to get rid of the constant eight we are going to get its opposite operation since it is division the opposite would be multiplication so we need to multiply 8 on both sides there you go now let us solve we have 8 divided by 8 which is one so we can simply cancel this out so that leaves us the variable and equals 11 times eight which is very good 88 and that is the value of our variable now let's have our second way in our second way we are going to get the opposite operation of our constant which is eight and its opposite operation is multiplication and the next thing that we are going to do is to move it on the other side of the equation there you go now that is n equals 11 times 8 which is 88. good job now let us check our answers now our answer is correct now let's have another example this time we have twice a number decreased by three is the sum of nine and two let us translate this one first into one equation so we have first twice a number and that means two times a variable so that would be 2 times x or 2 x next one we have decreased by 3 which means subtraction so that is minus 3. and on the other side we have is the sum of 9 and 2 which is equals 9 plus 2. as you can see we have operations on both sides before we can find the value of the variable we need to simplify first anything that we can simplify on both sides so here we can simplify nine plus u which is eleven while on the underside that leaves us two x minus three now let us try to solve 
,,for the variable by getting rid of all the constants and the coefficient remember the first thing that you need to get rid of is the addition or subtraction so since we have here subtraction which is minus 3 let's remove this one first by getting its opposite operation which is plus 3 now let's add 3 also on the other side so that is 11 plus 3. now we have negative 3 plus 3 which is 0. so we can simply cancel this out and that leaves 2 x equals 11 plus 3 which is 14. now we only have one operation left which is multiplication and that is 2 times x now to get rid of the coefficient 2 we are going to get its opposite operation which is division so let us divide 2 on both sides there you go so we can cancel out 2 divided by 2 since it's equal 1 and that gives us the variable x equals 14 divided by two which is seven 
,,great job now the value of our variable is seven now let us check if our answer is correct great job now let's have another example this time we have 2 more than the quotient of n and 4 is 8. now let's translate this again into one equation so we have 2 more than which means addition and that is plus 2. and next we have the quotient of n and 4 which means division so that is n divided by 4. and lastly we have 8 which means equals 8. again the first thing that we need to get rid of to leave 
,,the variable alone on one side is addition or subtraction since here we have addition which is plus two and its opposite operation is subtraction which is minus two 
,,we are also going to do that on the other side now let us solve so we have positive two minus two so we have two minus two equals zero so let's cancel this out and that leaves us n divided by four equals eight minus two which is six now we are down to our last operation which is division to cancel out the constant 4 we are going to get its opposite operation which is multiplication so we need to multiply 4 on both sides now let us cancel out 4 divided by 4 since it's equal 1 and that leaves us the variable and equals 6 times 4 which is 24. great job now let us try to check our answer there you go now we are down on our last example this time we have a 
,,number plus the product of three and four is 28. so let's translate this one first into one equation so first we have a number plus so a number means unknown so let 
,,us represent this by a variable let us say h so that is h plus and next we have the product of three and four which means multiplication so that would be three times four and lastly we have s28 which means equals 28. now our equation is h plus the product of 3 and 4 equals 28. now first again we need to simplify anything that we could simplify on both sides since we can already simplify three times four we all know that that is twelve so now we have h plus twelve equals twenty eight let's get rid of our constant by getting its opposite operation so since it is addition or plus 12 we need to subtract 12 on both sides there you go now let us simplify so 
,,we have 12 minus 12 which is zero so let us cancel this out and that leaves us the variable h equals 28 minus 12 which is 16 and that is the value of our variable now let us check if our answer is correct great job wonderful now here are the things that you learned today you

AlgebraicExpression,QJr68wc3TM0,hello friends this video on algebraic expressions part 1 is brought to you by exam for calm no more fear from exam topics to be covered in this lesson our introduction algebraic expressions terms like and unlike terms factors coefficients types of expressions wedding we will talk about monomial binomial trinomial and polynomial 
,,addition and subtraction of expressions and finding value of an expression using algebraic expressions now what do you think are we going to study under algebraic expressions so what what is now you are already aware of what algebra is all about now here we will specifically talk about expressions now let's look at this example 
,,let's say that you have got some number of chocolate so we didn't do not know the exact number of chocolates that you have but you have some number of chocolates and your little brother has two less than yours like we do not know the exact number of chocolates that you have all your little brother has but all we know is the number of chocolates with your little brother is 2 less than the number of chocolates with you so how would you express this fact mathematically so you can write it in a sentence saying that I have two chocolates more than my little brother but if I asked you to express the same thing using a mathematical expression or how will you 
,,explain explain express this in terms of mathematics so there we make use of algebraic expressions let's see how so we assume that since we do not know the exact number of chocolates so let's assume that you have X number of chocolates so let's see how do we do it in terms of mathematics so what we will do since we do not know the exact number of chocolates with you so let us assume that you have X number of chocolates so X is our variable so X can take any value its can be six its can be 7 X + 10 X 10 be 200 so let us assume that you have X number of chocolates so if you have X number of chocolates how many chocolates your brother will have two less than yours that means he will have X minus two so you remove two from X so what do you get with X minus 2 so what does this X minus 2 this is nothing but an algebraic expression what is this X for that matter yes it is a variable but at the same time it is also an expression so what we exactly mean by expression is it's a combination of constants variables operators like plus minus sign so this is one perfect example or easier example of expressions you can say you have a variable X you have a constant 2 you have an operator which is the minus sign so this is an example of algebraic expression let's consider another example and say that use code X and your friends code twice as you let's say this is you or let's say this is B and this is a so let's say that a is code twice as that of B so if B is 4 10 then is code 
,,20 if B is 450 then is whole hundred so basically the score of a is twice the score of B so how do we express this in terms of mathematics so let's assume that B's code X so how much would a score a would score 2x so what does this 2x this is also nothing but an algebraic expressions so these are some very simple examples of algebraic expression so with this we can now say what is an algebraic expression it is a mathematical phrase with constants variables and operators like as I told you that any algebraic expression will will have a combination of all of these however it is not compulsory that an algebraic expression must have constants variables and operators all of them it is possible that an algebraic expression does not have constants it is also possible that an algebraic expression does not have multiple operators so all those things are possible so let us look at some examples so even before we look at examples let us quickly recap water constants variables and operators so let us first talk about constant so constants are those which have fixed values that is their value remains the same for example let's talk about five point six so this is the decimal number but five point six always means five point six five point six is never equal to five point seven so this is a fixed value similarly 
,,you think of the numbers five four - one five six zero twenty thousand or even three by two which is a fraction so all of these are numbers and they have fixed values or something which is 3 by 2 will always remain three Bible so the biggest values they have constant value so they are examples of constants now let's talk about variables now variables they do not have a fixed value their values keep changing they are generally denoted by alphabets like X Y Z P Q ABC etc now why are default variables for example let's talk about X now this X let's say you have an equation like this X plus Pole is equal to 0 and you have another equation where 2x plus 2 is equal to 0 so you have these two equations now the value of x in the first equation is minus 4 because if X is minus 4 then this relation holds true whereas the value of x in the second equation is how much it is minus 1 so you see in the first equation the value of x is minus 4 whereas in the second equation the value of x is minus one so depending upon the situation value of X changes so X is a variable so we denote variable using an alphabet book and this alphabet can pick up different values depending on different situations the third one is operator so this operator includes all the operations like addition subtraction multiplication and division these all are operators now let us look at some examples of algebraic expressions so let us try to mix and expressions let's say this is one expression X plus 4 so you have a variable you have a constant you have an operator so X plus 4 is an example of algebraic expression you have something like this 3x minus 9 divided by 2 
,,so here also you have in variables constants operators so this is an example of expression something like 10x it is very simple it what is the meaning of 10x 10x is 
,,nothing but 10 multiplied by X so you have operator constant variables so you see these are all examples of algebraic expressions thank you please visit exam fee or

,,3 3 X 3 times X you don't need to write down the multiplication sign you can write 3x price of 4 pencils one pencil is why 4 pencils for y price of several books one book is zero Peas seven books 7z give the cost of buying all the above in the form of an algebraic expression so the total cost we can add it together 3x plus 4y plus 7c that's an algebraic expression write the terms of this algebraic expression so you have given an algebraic expression what are the terms 3x for bi and 7z coefficient of 3 X we know what is coefficient means the number in front of the letter that's 3 coefficient of 4y what's the number in front that's four coefficient of 77 is the coefficient there build algebraic expression for the following statements we'll try to write in terms of letters you can take these letters given add 7 to the double of X what if double means 2 times X so adding 7 to double of X means 2x 2x plus 7 subtract 6 from the 3 times of X but if three times means 3x 3x and you have to subtract 6 subtract 3 from the sum of x and y sum of x and y means the addition X plus 1 and subtract 3 divided by y how you divide we can write x over 1 divide X by y and subtract from seven so that turns that you have to subtract from seven that means seven - so we'll write seven minus x over Y not X over Y minus 7 because from 7 you have to subtract this amount divided the multiplication of a and B multiplication of a and B by 3 means a B divided by 3 divided the multiplication of 
,,a and B by 3 and subtract from 10 from 10 means 10 minus this value filling the gaps in the following table algebraic expressions are there as you break terms so you have to write down only algebraic terms so what are the algebraic terms 7 x + 3 by what's the coefficient 7 & 3 what are the I do break terms here 6a + 3 B here you don't write down these constants algebraic terms means only terms with letters what are the coefficients 6 & 3 here Excel why hyphens are 1 and 1 in this one 3 a coefficient is 3 this one - 3 X + 7 5 coefficients are -3 here and so this one you get a fraction but here this is an algebraic term 2x over 3 you can write X in the numerator and 3 by over 5 also an algebraic term then what's the coefficient you have to take the whole thing the fraction 2/3 three fits this one this is an algebraic term 5x over 7 and minus 2y over 3 so what's the coefficient there five over seven is the coefficient of x term and minus two-thirds is the coefficient of weiter look at this question the cost of an arranges extra pays the cost of an apple is y rupees the cost of a mango is zero peas build algebraic expressions for the following price of two oranges and five mangoes oranges is X so 2x plus because this is both together five mangoes one mango easy five mangoes 5z price of two mangoes and seven apples two mangoes is to Z and seven apples Apple is why rupee so 7 y cost of six oranges and eight apples six oranges one orange is X plus six six and eight apples one Apple is why that's eight why price of five oranges seven apples and three mangos five oranges that's 5 X 7 apples 7 y then 3 mangoes 3z question number five cost of one orange one apple and two mangoes one Apple is why and one orange is X and two mangoes - Z - look at this one right down the algebraic expression for the total cost to buy three kilos of sugar two kilos of Thailand five kilos of flour we are one kilo of each product is a rupees be rupees and C rupees respectively so what are the values total cost we need three kilos of sugar so sugar is a so three a five kilos then two kilos of Dar Daly's be rupees to be and five kilos of flour flour is C rupees of five C next one one kilo of red dollies extra peas and one kilo of yellow dollies why rupees write down an algebraic expression for the extra mounts pen for buying five kilos of yellow da then three kilos of red that means the price is high when you buy five kilos of yellow da so what's the difference five 
,,kilos of yellow doll yellow one is by rupees 5 i- three kilos of red on red dollies extra piece per kilo so 3x so the difference is this well the capacity of a bucket days M liters and bucket B is in liters you need to use 12 buckets of a and eight buckets of B at once to fill a tank what is the capacity of the track so what's the total amount of a buckets yeah 12 a buckets so M liters are there so 12 M then what about from B buckets so need eight buckets of B each bucket contained in liters so eight and so the capacity of the tank is 12 m + 8 in the father's age in one of the families years the age of the mother is beers the daughter's age is Sears give the sum of ages of the father and mother in the form of an algebraic expression fathers ages a mother's ages B so the total is a plastic give the sum of the age of the mother and daughter in the form of an algebraic expression mother's age is B daughters ages the total of the ages of the father mother and dot all three of them a plus B plus C write the sum of the total age of the three above after 10 years in the form of an algebraic expression so we have to add 10 for each value 10 and 
,,10 and 10 for all three people that means 30 so the total value is a plus B plus C plus 30 so after 10 years this is the total value manufacturers men extra piece to make a table the manufacturer made a profit of twice as much as the cost price and sold it to a retailer the retailer solely to the consumer with a profit of by rupees right the profit of the manufacturer in the form of an algebraic expression so how can you write down an algebraic expression manufacture a spend X to make a table that's the cost value the manufacturer made a profit of twice as much as the cost price so what's the profit to X so write the profit of the manufacturer in the form of an algebraic expression err so that's 2x give the selling price of the table by the manufacturer in the form of an algebraic expression so the profit is 2x and the cost price is X so what's the selling price X plus 2x when you add it that's 3x so that's the selling price right the selling price of the retailer to the consumer in the form of an algebraic expression now the retailer sold it to the consumer with a profit of Y rupees so this is the price this retailer bought that means 3 X and he keeps by rupee profit so you have to add Y so this is the selling price of the retailer to the consumer the shape shown in the above is a square and a rectangle made out of matchsticks give the perimeter of the square in the form of an algebraic expression one side is given X for sides and there X plus X plus X plus X 
,,what's the perimeter for X give the perimeter of the rectangle in the form of an algebraic expression how you find out the perimeter you have to add all these lengths so a plus 2b plus a plus 2b a and a you are getting 2 a 2b and 2b when you add 2 plus 2 4 that's 4 B give the full length of the matchsticks used to construct the 
,,above images in the form of an algebraic expression so total length so length for the squares for X and length for this one is 2a plus 4b subtract the total length of the matchsticks used to make the square from the total length of the matchsticks used to make the rectangle in an algebraic expression so you have to subtract the 
,,lengths of matchsticks used to make the square from this one so what's the total here two way plus 4b and subtract the lengths for this one that's 4x look at this one give the perimeter of the equilateral triangle in the form of an algebraic expression equilateral means all sides I equal a and a n a what's the perimeter 3a right the perimeter of the write angular triangle in the form of an algebraic expression so just add all the lengths together we'll do that X plus X plus 2 plus X plus 1 
,,now you can simplify like terms you can add X X X 3x 2 & 1 that's right the total perimeter of the above diagrams in the form of an algebraic expression so this is the perimeter of the write angular triangle and is the parameter for the equilateral triangle so add it together 3 E + 3 X + 3 multiplying an algebraic expression by 
,,a number so we'll see how we can multiply the algebraic expression by a number width of the rectangle is X this is the width and the length is 1 determine the perimeter of the rectangle x + y + X + 1 so you can write down 2 times X plus y of x + alright separately x + y X plus y when you simplify you get 2 x + 2 I now I want to 
,,just separate these two parts this part separately and this part separately what's the length of this part when you separate this what's the length of this one x + y you get the same length here X + 1 so double of this x + y so length of one part is X plus y length of 2 parts you multiply by 2 so 2 times X plus 1 but we took the same diagram finding perimeter fully and taking separately you have to get the same answer so in both methods the perimeter of the same figure is equal so we can write down 2 x + y is equal to two x plus 2y now look at this one when there's a number in front you are multiplying both these X terms by two so when X plus y is x to both the terms x + y x - so now we observe when there's a number in front of an algebraic expression you have to multiply all terms with that number a box contains 
,,a red glass balls and B blue glass balls determine the total number of glass balls in such high boxes number of total ass balls in a box was that a plus B number of 
,,total glass balls in five boxes you have to multiply 5 times a plus B then number of red colored balls in a box separately there are a red color glass balls so number of red color balls in a box is a number of red glass balls in five boxes that's five B multiplied by five if you take separately blue ones how many blue ones are there be blue ones for five boxes you get five be blue ones in five boxes so what can you say about this one the total the total is now we can write total is 5 a + 5 
,,B the answer received in either of the two methods should be equal so in this case five times a plus B is equal to 5 a plus 5b now look at this one when you multiply by the constant each term you get this one remove the brackets of the following algebraic expressions now we can use that knowledge you gain from the previous two questions there's a number in front this is a minus B is the algebraic expression so what you do multiply the first term as shown by the first arrow so this is the first arrow multiply this value here 3 times a 3 and then multiply the second term as shown by the second arrow I'll put numbers this is one red one pink one is 1 and 
,,the other color I'll take blue so this one multiply this one that's two three times minus B minus 3b now we'll follow that multiply and give me the answer this one with this you get 5x this one with this five times minus y minus five now try first this one seven times m 7m then this one seven times n plus seven ten times P 10 P 
,,plus 10 times Q 10 Q here the arrows are used to show the order to multiply so here always first one we can take first one and this is the SEC and why remove the brackets using arrows now now you can do that I mean there's a number in front of the algebraic expression you have to multiply all terms in the algebraic expression inside the bracket by the outside number yes with this this with this 3 into X 3 X 3 into 2 y + 6 1 now do this 1 7 into a 7 a 7 into minus 4 B that means minus 28 eleven times tu-22m 11 times n 11 4 times 3 P 4 times 3 12 P 4 times minus 2q so that's minus 8q this one 6 times X 6 X 6 times minus 11 by minus 66 1 8 times 3 24h 8 x k8 now look at this one you get three terms but same thing you have to multiply each and every term by the outside number this one three times five a 15 a three times to be six be three times c plus 3 C now do that four times X for X for x - y - y 4 times 7 that's + 28 8 times 2 16 a 8 times 7 56 be 8 times C that's 8 say look 
,,at this one 2 times X - x - x - 7 y minus 14y 2 times 3 z 6z 4 times P 4 P 4 times minus 3q - 12 Q 4 times 2r 8 11 times M 11 M 11 times 3 n 33 and 11 times 2 11 times 2 22 with l22 multiplying an algebraic expression by a negative number so now there's a negative number in front so we'll practice first with negative minus 3 times a minus 3 minus 3 times B minus 3 B negative into positive always you get a negative answer negative 5 times X negative 5x negative 5 into negative Y now negative into negative positive plus 5 minus 1 into 3 minus 3 minus 1 into minus 2 B plus 2 B minus into plus minus and here 5 times 2 10 2 times 2 4 that's plus because minus into minus plus and you get B here 2 times 7 here - into plus minus 14 C now you know how to multiply so plus into plus plus plus into minus minus minus into plus minus and minus into minus plus now we'll remove the brackets so you need to first multiply the first one when this number minus 3 a minus 3 times B minus 3b minus 
,,5 X and here so minus 5x minus 5 minus y you get plus 5i we did that minus 3 a and here minus 3 a you get here - nothing means 1 so this is like 1 minus 1 into 3 a minus 3 minus 1 into minus 2 B that's plus 2b this one this one minus 2 times 3 a what's the value minus 2 times 3a minus 6a this one - two - 2b plus 4b and here - two times seven you get minus 14c remove the brackets now so use arrows to multiply minus 3x minus - plus 6y this one when you multiply minus - plus 3 times 2 6 minus 
,,3 times minus 7 plus 20 months what this one you have to multiply all three terms minus 5 a minus - plus 5 times 4 20 get be your minus 5 times C minus 5 see this one multiply minus 8 times a minus 8 a - eight - seven be multiplication + 56 8 times 7 56 B question number 5 - 7 into minus X plus 7 X minus 7 into 2 y minus 14y - 7 into minus c plus 7z here minus 11 times 2 X minus 22 X minus 11 times -3 plus 33 yeah do all these multiplications try 4 times X 4 X 4 times minus 7y minus 28 y 4 
,,times 5 20 minus 3 times a minus 3 minus minus plus 21 B minus in 2 plus minus 24 6 here minus 11 times 2 minus 22 X here minus minus plus 11 times 3 plus 33 Y here 
,,you get minus 22 this one multiply minus 6 times 2 minus 12 minus 6 minus 7 plus 42 and minus 6 and minus 5 plus 13 this one minus 10 into minus 3 plus 30 minus 10 times chobe - 20 B and minus 10 times sake - 10 see what about this one - 4 times 3 H minus 12 which minus 4 times minus 4 plus 16 K minus 4 times minus 4 plus 60 now we're do multiplying an algebraic term by another algebraic term earlier we multiply by a constant now multiplying by an algebraic term 3x + 4 y how we multiply 3x 
,,times 4 1 so what we do we multiply that numbers first 3 times 4 12 and then x + y so without writing we can write without writing multiplication sign 12x what this 
,,one multiplication 7b into foil we can multiply separately the number 7 times 4 and then be a 7 times 4 28 be a it is better to write down then letters in order 28 a B but this is not wrong VA is okay but it's better it is good to write the letters in English at alphabetical order this 1 minus 3 by minus 5 X so we can multiply minus 3 and minus 5 first and then Y and X minus 3 times minus 5 plus 15 y X you can write 15 X Y to a times 7 B now we'll multiply at once 2 times 7 14 a into B a B 
,,you can write at once 3 X into 5 y 3 times 5 15 X into y X Y now there's a bracket minus sign minus 7 times 3 minus 21 a times B a B this one Phi times -3 minus 15 M times n m in here minus 4 times minus 3 plus 12 a and B you can write a B for x minus seven minus twenty eight Y into X Y X or what's the better one x1 multiplication of an algebraic expression by an algebraic term find the area of the following two rectangles separately so what's the area of the rectangle this one is length into breadth or length into width so area of the rectangle is any times X so what's that the X what's the area of the other rectangle length is B width or break is X B times X VX sum of areas you can just add it a X plus B X now when you combine the two rectangles now you are getting a big rectangle two rectangles are merged in the above diagram what's the length of this rectangle length is a here B here a plus B what's the area of the rectangle now length is a plus B and the with operate is 
,,X so X into a plus B as same rectangles are merged areas are equal now what's the area we got before a X plus B X so we can write a X plus B X is same as X into a plus B now sick how do you get this one so when you multiply the expression here can you see you get a X plus B X it is required to multiply all the terms inside brackets given by the outside term remove the brackets using arrows first one is this second one is this a 2 X a X a into - why - a why B into X BX be in 2 - 3 y - 3 B by C into a see a or a see C into 7 B 7 BC so here you can write AC as well is C + 7 BC when you remove brackets using an arrow first draw an arrow and write it then draw the next arrow and write it we'll do that separately X into a exhale Oh a X X into minus B minus BX X into 2 C 2 CX of XE y into p YP y into 2q minus 2 Q minus 2 y qi qi y into our are Y now try into p a p a into 3 q 3 a key a into for our for a 2 a into X 2x - 3 y that is -6 a why this 1 3 b into m 3b 3b into 4 12 B 5 a into 2 X 10 X 5 a into minus 3y minus 15 a why here - -5 a into z5 a 0 minus 3 into X minus 3 X minus into - now you get plus 6 a 1 plus 6 a expand brackets without using arrows no will do without arrows 3p into x 3p x 3p into minus 2 y minus 6 P for a into 2 where 8 a 4 into minus 3n minus 12 a in this one minus 4 into X minus 4 a X minus 4 times minus 3/12 a y minus 11 8 into 2 B minus 22 a be minus 11 a into minus 3 C you get plus 33 a see this one 7 a mintue l 7m n 7m into 428 look at this diagram area of the entire rectangle length is X with this a so what's the area a times X shaded area now can you see this square with length a a into a or we can write a square area of the unshaded part so you have to subtract total area that's a X minus the shaded area e squared sum of two algebraic expressions when you are adding you have to consider like terms so like terms only you can add or subtract when you consider these two terms what can you do you can add a terms with a 2a and 
,,3a you can add and then 3b and 5b separately so what do you get 5a + 5 + 3 8 at the time of addition or subtraction you have to add or subtract the like terms remove brackets and simplify taking like terms so first you have to multiply and then simplify here without arrows we'll do 2 times X 2 X 2 times y - 1 and then you have to add this 3x so I'd like terms 2x + 3 X you get 5x + 2 y right as it is here five times a five wave hi x minus B 5 B and plus seven B is there five way you can add 
,,separately yeah - five plus seven what's the value plus two so take the difference and put the sign of the bigger number plus two that's me here multiply by 4 8 X 4 
,,times y 4y now what are the like terms 8 XL minus 5x that's 3x plus 4 here you have to multiply both these terms here 3 times X 3 X 3 times y 3 by here 2 times X 2 X 2 times y 2 now add the like terms 3x + 2 X you get 5 X 3 y + 2 y you get high five do it separately 2 times a 2 a 2 times -3 b -6 b plus 5 times a highway by x - Oh Big Ten now I'd like terms - and five seven that's seven minus six and ten take the difference + OB this one seven times - 14 X 7 times y 7y this one three times X minus three x + -3 y add the like terms 14 -3 11 X 7 - 3 + 4 y this one 3 x - 6 a 3 times 5 15 b + 7 e + 10 B what are the like terms a terms 6 + 7:30 15 minus 10 plus 5 so 5 b minus 5 times 7 -35 a minus 5 times -3 plus 15 plus 40 a now like terms add 40 - 35 5 a + 15 subtraction of two algebraic expressions you have to do the same thing right the first algebraic expression in brackets right the second algebraic expression in another brackets remove both brackets and simplify three-year you nothing means just multiply by one yeah - is there so that means this is minus 1 multiplied by minus 1 minus 1 times a minus a minus 1 times minus 2 B you get plus 2 B now like terms added 3 and minus a 2 a 4 B plus 2 B you get 6 this one subtract this from this so that means you have to write this one first 12x plus 7 1 so here just multiply by one 12x plus 7 1 minus this means open brackets with minus 1 minus 1 times 7 minus 7x minus 1 times minus 2 plus 2 I like terms you get 12 minus 7 5 x 7 + 2 9 5 subtract 2x minus 3 from this so from means first this one so 6x + 7 when there's a minus sign change the sign minus 2x and minus minus becomes plus 3 like term 6 and minus 2 4 X 7 + 3 that's 10 subtract this value from this so first you write here so 3p plus 8q - open brackets with minus 1 - P last - q + + 7 3 
,,p + - b - p8 q + 2 Q thank you and our terms you get only this one so that's 7 simplify so that here multiply and first open brackets and then simplify 4 times a 4 4 times -3 minus 12 minus 2 times a minus 2 a minus 2 x - 7 + 14 now like terms that for a and minus 2 a 2 a minus 12 and plus 14 you get plus 2 open brackets first 5x - 5 minus 3 times X minus 3 X minus 3 and minus 2 you get 6 y 5x + 3 X 2 X - 5 I + + 6 Y you get Y this one has a minus 2 in front so when you are multiplying be careful - 2 times 3 - 6 Z minus 2 and minus plus plus times foil the Savoy here you get minus 8b add like terms minus 6a + 4 you get minus 2 a 4 B and minus a 2 B minus 4 B this one Phi P into 2 Q 10 PQ or QP 5 P into 4 20 P here - 3 P into Q minus 3 P Q minus 3 P into 2 minus 6 peace now these are two like terms 10 P Q minus 3 P Q you get 7 PQ 20 P minus 6 P you get plus 14 substituting the values in the edge break expression so now we will see how we can find out the expression with substituting values so what's the first one determine the value of 5 a plus 4 when a equals 3 so substitute a equals 3 there so what happens five times three plus four so 
,,what's five times three 15 15 plus four you get 19 look at this expression seven A plus 2 B now you get two letters so substitute these two values equals three and B equals three so 7 M plus 2 B is the expression so we'll substitute 7 times is 3 7 times 3 plus 2 times B equals 3 so 7 times 3 21 2 times 3 6 21 plus 6 27 look at this one now you get three unknown letters 5 a 2 B 7 C values are given a equals 5 B equals 3 and C equals -2 substitute 5 into a is 5 2 times 3 and say x minus 2 so 
,,minus 7 x minus 2 5 times 5 25 minus 2 times 3 minus 6 and here minus minus becomes positive seven times 2 plus 14 now simplify 25 minus 6 you get 19 19 plus 14 33 determine the value of the following expressions when x equals 2 and y equals minus 3 we substitute 8 times X is 2 y equals minus 3/8 times 2 16 5 times minus 3 minus 15 16 minus 15 you get 1 here 12 times 2 minus 3 times minus 3 12 times 2 24 minus into minus plus 2 so 3 times 3 9 9 plus 4 13 so you get 33 now look at this one so same values you have to plug what are the values x equals 2 and y equals -3 9 mean 2 2 plus XY means X into y so 2 into minus 3 y equals minus 3 9 times 2 18 minus 6 you get 12 2 times X X is 2 5 times minus 3 plus 11 2 times 2 4 minus 15 plus 11 so 4 minus 15 you get minus 11 minus 11 and plus 11 you get 0 this one 4 times X 
,,X is 2 2 times minus 3 plus 8 4 times 2 8 minus 6 plus 8 8 minus 6 2 2 plus 8 10 here X is 2 y is minus 3 plus 2 minus 7 times minus 3 2 times minus 3 minus 6 here plus 2 is they are already according to Bodnar's you have to multiply first minus into minus plus 21 minus 6 plus 2 minus 4 minus 4 plus 21 you get 17 determine the value of the following algebraic expressions when a equals 3 and B equals 5 so what you do first first we'll open brackets and then substitute 3 times 2 6 6 8 3 times 3 you get 9 so 9 B now substitute after you multiply now substitute the value 6 times 3 9 times 5 because B equals 5 and a equals 3 6 times 3 18 9 times 5 45 what's the addition 63 in this one you have given the same question we'll try in a different way earlier we multiplied and then simplify now we'll do we'll simplify inside brackets and then multiply by three so three is there two times a is 3 B equals 5 now simplify inside 3 times 2 6 3 times 5 15 3 times 6 plus 15 21 now multiply 3 and 21 3 times 1 3 3 times 2 6 so you are getting the same answer get the same as if simplify inside brackets or without removing bracket so you can do any method first you can multiply and simplify and then substitute or simplify inside the brackets and then multiply by the outside number remove the brackets and substitute the values so first remove the brackets 7 a plus 14 B substitute the values 7 times 3 plus 14 times 5 say 1 times 3 21 here 5 times 425 times 1 5 and 7 add it you get 91 
,,this one 4 times 3 12 a and 8 B substitute the values of 12 times 3 minus 8 times fun now simplify 12 times 3 36 8 times 5 40 36 minus 40 you get minus here 11 times 2 22 a plus 11b so 22 times a 3 because 566 plus 55 hundred twenty-one this one 9 times 3 27 a 9 x -2 18 B now multiply 27 times 3 and 18 times fun 3 times 7 21 two remaining 3 times 2 6 plus 2 81 minus 5 times 8 44 remaining so you get 90 81 minus 90 you get minus 9 determine the value when a equals 3 B equals -2 and C equals 
,,1 so just substitute the values 2 times 3 7 x minus 2 make sure you put brackets when you get negative numbers 3 times 1/6 minus minus plus 14 plus 3 so 6 plus 3 9 9 plus 14 23 this one 5 times 3/2 x minus 2 and 4 into 1 15 minus 4 plus 4 minus 4 plus 4 get canceled out you get 15 11 x equals 3 B equals -2 and C equals 1 according to what must do the multiplication first 11 times 3 33 minus 2 times minus 2 plus 4 and you get minus 3/4 minus 3/1 33 plus 130 in this one first simplify and then substitute values of the following algebraic expressions when a equals 5 because 3 and C equals -2 so you have given this expression so what you do first open brackets 2 where 2 B 3 B 3 C then what you do simplify the terms add the like terms to a you have to write as it is 2b and 3b becomes Phi B and 3c here now substitute the values equals 5 B equals 3 and C equals -2 2 times 5 10 5 times 3 15 minus 60 so but you get 10 minus 6 4 4 plus 15 19 this one first open brackets 3 a 3 times minus B minus 3 B 4 times B 4 B 4 times C minus 4 C here because there's a negative sign now I'd like terms 3-year you can't simplify minus 3 and plus 4 that's plus 1 B or B minus 4 C now substitute the values 3 a means multiplication 3 times a 3 times 5 B is 3 4 times minus 2 first multiplication according to but must 5 times 3 15 minus 4 minus 2 plus 8 so you get 8 plus 3 11 11 and 15 you get 26 this one first open brackets 3a plus 3b here to be and -2 C 5 C 5 a so each one you have to multiply by the outside number now like terms 3a and 5a 8 a 3 B and plus 2 B 5 B -2 C + + 5 C plus 3 C now multiply 8 times a what's the value for a a 5 3 minus 2 I'll write down here equals 5 B equals minus 3 B is 3 and C equals -2 C equals -2 so a is 5 B 3 C minus 2 8 times 5 14 15 here and -6 15 minus 6 you get 9 9 plus 40 49 this one 7 a 7 B minus 7 C and then plus 2a minus 2b minus 2 C when you multiply by 2 add like terms 7 + + 2 9 e 7 B and minus 2b + 5 b minus 7 and minus 2 minus 9 see now my tip life is five B's tricky and C is minus 2/9 times 5 45 five times three 15 and minus minus becomes plus nine times two eighteen now add all together 1018 one remaining five six seven so 78 is the answer this one you get fractions but same procedure just substitute the values for a eight over be sixteen over C so now substitute equals 2 so 4 over 2 8 / BBS for 16 over C C is 8 now you have to simplify first 4 divide by 2 you get 2 8 divided by 4 you get 2 16 divided by 8 you get 2 2 + 2 + 2 6 this one substitute the values a equals 2 2 divided by 2 B is 4 4 divided by 4 C equals 8 8 divided by 8 simplify division first 2 divided by 2 is 1 4 divided by 4 is 1 8 divided by 8 is 1 1 plus 1 plus 1 you get 3 this one substitute a B means a times B 2 times 4 plus BC means B times that's 4 times C means 8 minus C times a C is 8 and a equals to 8 32 16 so 32 minus 16 is 16 16 and 8 addition you get 24 now we will look at remove exercise complete the table given below algebraic expression is given unknown term of the algebraic expression coefficient of the unknown term terms of the algebraic expression and final column is mathematical operations in the order they appear in the algebraic expression so first of all what's the unknown letter X coefficient is the number in front of the letter that's three and these are called algebraic terms and what is the operation plus and multiplication is three times X now we look at the next one what's the letter here Y what's the coefficient of that term to what are the algebraic terms to Y and 4 and what's the operation first multiplication and then addition next one what's the algebraic letter B coefficient 4 and terms for P and minus hundred and the operation for times P that means multiply and then subtract this one P is the letter coefficient nothing means one terms PN minus 10 and what are the operations used 1 times P times and then - what's the later here in coefficient is + 3 terms 3 n n minus 7 and operation first multiply and then subtract question number two the length of a table is two meters more than its breadth write an algebraic expression for the length of the table by taking its breath as V when you take this table B is the bread length is 2 meters more than its brick so what's the expression B plus 2 back to write

,,by a number each term of the algebraic expression needs to be multiplied by the number that is the coefficient of each algebraic term should be multiplied by the given number and simplify so make sure that you multiply by the coefficient when multiplying an algebraic term by an algebraic term there our coefficients are much like first and then the unknowns are multiplied when multiplying an algebraic expression by an algebraic term every algebraic term of the algebraic expression needs to be multiplied by the given algebraic term by substituting values for the unknown terms of an algebraic expression we obtain a numerical value for the algebraic expression so when you are simplifying either you can simplify brackets first and then multiply or expand brackets and then substitute the values so practice all these questions examples and exercise and thorough with algebraic expressions

AlgebraicExpression,X7LMvlboXW4,how do we write the sum of three and seven in a mathematical way the word sum means addition and we can write this as 3 plus 7 this is an expression and as it has only numbers in it it's called a numerical expression only numbers numerical expression now how do we write the sum of a number and 7 in a mathematical way as we don't know what this number is we can use a variable in its place we can write it as X plus 7 where this X can take any numerical value as this expression also has a variable in it it's called an algebraic expression variables then algebraic just numbers then numerical here's another statement we need to write in a mathematical way the sum of a number and 7 equals 12 this can be written as X plus 7 is equal to 12 a number plus 7 equals 12 this is called an equation it has an expression on each side of the equal to sign apart from expressions and equations the most important concept in this topic is that of terms look at the number 4 it is just one term what about 4 plus X how many terms do we have in this expression two terms 4 and X what about the expression 4 over X this is just one term one term when divided by another gives us only one term not two only plus and minus separate the terms multiplication and division do not so here's the fourth example 4 plus X minus y as we have plus and minus we can say that this expression has three terms and what about for X as 4 and X are multiplied this is just one term so remember plus and minus separate the terms multiplication and division do not what are like and unlike terms we will see that in the next session

AlgebraicExpression,5Q0FlxcEEIw,"What is Algebra? It's simple. It's all about puzzles. Here's one for you. This plus two equals five. We just have to find the number in this box. Which number when added to two gives us five? Simple! It's three. We can say that three plus two equals five. This thing we see here contains only numbers. This puzzle can also be asked in a different way, We can say that x plus two equals five, find 'x'. We just used a letter in place of the box. These letters are also called as variables. Sometimes also referred to as the unknown since its values is not known to us. This is Algebra. It deals with variables and unknowns and we are expected to find their value. But why use variables? Why not boxes like these? Let's assume there are three unknown numbers. Using shapes we can write it as a square, plus a slant square, plus an empty circle, plus four equals seven. You had to think of different shapes. Using variables we can write it as x plus y plus z plus four equals seven. This was a little more convenient as compared to the previous case. But what's the real advantage of using variables? Read the short story and the question that follows. Your "
,,"friend had a few chocolates with him. A bully came across, took away five of his chocolates. And then he had just seven chocolates remaining with him. How many chocolates did he have before the bully came to him? This question has '40 words'. Let's see if it can shorten the question a bit. Assume your friend had 'x' chocolates with him. The bully took away five of his chocolates, so we subtract five from 'x'. And after all this your friend was left with seven chocolates. This entire thing, "
,,"will then equal seven. Now all we have to do is find 'x'. This entire question of '40 words' can be written like this. So yes, Algebra makes life simple."

AlgebraicExpression,VqfeXMinM0U,Hello everyone can you all tell what comes
,,in to your mind as soon as you hear the word mathematics.
,,"Some might say numbers..some say addition subtraction .. Shapes like circle, triangle"
,,etc. Yes! You all are right...but math is much
,,more than this. Math is part of our everyday life. For example
,,"when we wake up in the morning, our first action is to look at our clock. Then when"
,,we go for breakfast ask for 2 slices of bread We will again be using maths if we dial number
,,to phone. We all love shopping and here too maths plays an important role say if there's
,,a discount then you can see how much it would be if it was maybe 20% off or something. So
,,like this there are many incidents where math is used & hence is so important to learn and
,,understand. But do we really know what mathematics is?
,,Is it only about numbers & shapes? No.
,,There are many more interesting things that we can learn as the word mathematics itself
,,means the things that are learned One of the very first things that we learnt
,,in our childhood is numbers and its counting. We ve also learnt some basic operations that
,,we apply on them. Like addition of numbers.subtraction multiplication
,,"& division the answers that we get are called sum, difference, product & quotient."
,,Now the area of mathematics where numbers are combined with some basic operations & their
,,"calculation s????.. forms a different branch in math called arithmetic, the operations"
,,are called arithmetic operations. The word arithmetic itself means number.
,,Now as time passes we gain more knowledge. So in this session we are going to learn one
,,of the most important branches of math known as algebra which is the foundation for many
,,other topics & a great subject for getting your brain to think differently and sharply.
,,So what is algebra? Is it same as arithmetic? Lets understand it.
,,We know that in arithmetic we can easily say 8+2=10 & 7-5=2 but suppose someone asks the
,,same question in some other way i.e. how much amount do we add to 8 to get total of 10?
,,Or how much should we remove from 7 to get balance of 2. Look at this 8 + ___ . 10
,,7 - ___ .. 2 okay so the answers for these blank place are 2 & 5 resp ? right.
,,Here what we are actually doing? We are finding the value of the empty place
,,which we don?t know yet hence this empty place also called as unknown.
,,But every time we cannot use words like empty place or unknown.
,,Hence in algebra we denote this unknown value..i.e. this empty place by an alphabet & it can be
,,any letter a..b..cor xyso on. So instead of keeping it
,,"So, Algebra simply means finding the value of unknown numbers"
,,I am sure you have now understood the difference between arithmetic and algebra Lets take an example to learn few more things
,,"in it. Suppose, you have a small stationary shop,"
,,"where you sell one pencil for 3 bucks. Customer1 comes and asks for 5 pencils, costomer2"
,,asks for 7 pencils customer3 directly gives you 12 bucks and asks to give as many pencils
,,as you can for 12 bucks. Price of 1 pencil no of pencil amount
,,3 5 ___ 3 7 ___
,,3 ___ 12 Friends here price for a pencil is a fixed
,,amount and what is unknown to us is either no. of pencils or total amount for the same.
,,"Let us first find the unknown values. Now, can you tell what should be the total"
,,amount for 5 pencils in case of customer 1. It is 3*5 = 15 right? Similarly for 7 pencils
,,the amount will be 21 bucks. So what did we do exactly? We have multiplied
,,price of a pencil with number of pencils sold to get the unknown total amount But for 3rd customer .in 12 bucks what will
,,"be the number of pencil? How to find that, all we have to do is divide"
,,the total amount 12 by price of a pencil i.e. 3 and that will give us 4. Observe the table and understand that here
,,cost of pencil is a constant value while the number of pencils purchased by each customer
,,varies and as a result their total amount is also different. So if we denote num of pencils by x & total
,,amount as y ????????in general we can
,,write it as 3x = y Friends 3x simply means that 3 multiplied
,,"by x or sometimes 3 dot x, dot also represents multiplication. Now note that here x & y are unknowns whose"
,,value is not fixed & its varying hence in algebra unknown numbers are also known as
,,variables. And the fixed number here price for a pencil
,,"is known as constant. Now if we concentrate only on 3x, we can see"
,,that we have constant 3 & the variable x& both are combined with an operation.. multiplication.
,,So such type of expressions that involve variables and constants & are combined with the fundamental
,,"operations, it is called as algebraic expression. Therefore 3x is an algebraic expression and"
,,y is also an alg exp as y is a variable and can be written as 1* y
,,And when such algebraic expressions are equated i.e. we put an equal to sign between them
,,", then this whole thing is called an equation. Lets have some more examples of algebraic"
,,expression: I had some money I gave 16 bucks to one of
,,my friend now I have 56 bucks left. How can we form an algebraic expression of
,,this statement? Here the money I had is unknown  so this is the equation and this is expression.
,,These are some examples of equations and expressions match them correctly. Sum of 2 numbers is 15 X = y + 3
,,Mr. x is 3 years elder than Mr. y 7y
,,I had some mango & gave 3 to my brother
,,X - 3 Price for one chocolate y bucks
,,Price for 7chocolates is X + y = 15 Friends in our upcoming sessions we ll be
,,learning in detail about the algebraic expressions and equations. So thats all for this session in our next
,,session well learn more on algebra. But if you have any doubts or anything for this session
,,do let us know in the common below. Also like and share the same. You may help someone needy
,,by sharing the same.

AlgebraicExpression,20BYGqGufY8,are they grenades and welcome to worksheet cloud maths my name is Joe Milligan and I'm going to take you through some facts about algebraic expressions first of all 
,,how to write them then how to simplify them and then how to evaluate them okay if at any stage you don't understand anything and you want to ask a question remember 
,,to just send an email to that email address at the bottom of your page and somebody will get back to you right first of all we have to look at what an algebraic expression actually is it indicates a sequence of calculations that can also be described in words or with a flow diagram so for example multiply a number by 2 and add 6 to the answer that is in words as you can see this would be the flow diagram for that sentence and it's an unknown number x bar 2 and added 6 and that as an algebraic expression would look like that X plus 2 or sorry x times 2 plus 6 okay that would be the expression it's written an algebraic form okay so your expression would 
,,actually look like this 2x plus 6 remember the X is the unknown value you can call that unknown value anything you'd like you can call it a or b or Y or CID but for 
,,today's lesson we're going to refer to unknown values as X okay now you try see if you can write that as an expression two times a number added to three times the same number okay did you get that 2 times X plus 3 times X and if we make it simpler it would just be 2x plus 3x okay right let's go on let's break this down two times a number added to three times the same number okay now give it give the unknown number a name like I said earlier you can give it any name you like but today we are going to call it X so both are no numbers have the same value and they can both be called X if you choose to use y both of them would be called Y okay so these words then translate to 2 times X plus 3 times X as an algebraic expression and can also then be written 2x plus 3x which just looks a whole lot tidier okay let's try one more half a number subtracted from five times of that number it would be 5 X minus 1/2 X you might have written half X minus 5 X but let me explain to you why it's the other way around okay we break this one down we've got half of a number subtracted from 5 times that same number okay if the same number is we're dealing with only one unknown value so we can give it them both the same name and we will call it X again and so we are then we need to look at the word from in this case yeah because we are subtracting 1/2 X from 5 times X so we need to write it 5x minus 1/2 X it would be like me asking you to subtract 2 from 3 if you were to write that it would be 3 minus 2 okay let's go on you can try these now all on your own so you can pause the video and you can try them out and then we'll go over them together right let's see what you did the first one is a number less 7 again you can call it a B why is it whatever you'd like to call it we're going to call it X again and that would be X minus 7 see this time wasn't from 7 it was a number less 7 that means you subtract the 7 from the number okay half of a number added to 6 that would be 1/2 X plus 6 or 6 plus 1/2 X remember adding we can write it any which way we lack any way around okay the next one times a number divided by 2 would be 9x divided by 2 next one 3 times a number increased by 4 you've got it 3x plus 4 and then 1/4 of a number subtracted from 8 remember these are from again let's have a look it would be 8 minus 1/4 X well done guys I'm sure you got those all rights right now we're going to look and see how we can simplify the expressions okay five times a number add it to six times the same number and then subtract 4 wow that seems like quite a long sentence but let's go through it slowly 5x plus 6x minus 4 now because you've got 5x and a 6x those are both the same unknown numbers so we could say we can put them together and say it's 11x minus 4 can you see that you've got an unknown number of that X and that X 5 of those and 6 of the same things you'd get 11 of them if I were to say to you for 5x and 6x then you could say I've got 11x it would 
,,be the same kind of thing see right now you can try try those ones pause the video again have a go and we'll go over them together right let's see how you did two times a number subtracted from 3 times the same number would give you 3 minus 2x is the and then it would be the same as just plain X because you've got three X's and 
,,you - includes from that you left with 1x right the second one for added to a number and subtract 2 times the same number let's see what happens yeah we've got 4 plus an unknown X minus 2x so yeah we've got a positive x and a negative x so if you have minus 2x and you add on an X you she just got EXO it would be four minus X let's go over that one just one more time you've got a positive excellent you - in two x's from it you would end up in with a negative x so it'll be 4 minus X instead of 4 plus X right let's go over the next one and number added to 7 and 3 times that number is subtracted let's see what happens ya X plus 7 minus 3 X again you've got a positive X if there's nothing in front of it it means it's positive and see how you've got a minus 3 X so you adding an X 1 to your minus 3 X so then you would end up with 7 minus 2x you could possibly also write it minus 2x plus 7 it just looks a little bit more messy right so far we've looked at writing algebraic expressions from words and how to simplify the expression now we're going to look at how to evaluate these expressions ok we can only evaluate an expression if we are given the value of x and remember the X is the unknown number so we can't give an expression of value unless we are actually given the value of that X so let's have a look at so if we are told X is equal to 3 then we can work out the value of the expression 2x minus 1 and how do we do this well we would substitute the 3 into the expression in the position of X so it would be 3 2 times 3 minus 1 so we would write it like that or we can write it like that the only reason I wrote it like that was because the X looks sits next to the tooth so it's the same thing 2 times 3 and then minus 1 okay because we now have an actual value we can carry out the operations and the expression to find the answer so 2 times 3 would be 6 and 6 minus 1 would give me 5 rights have you got it so let's go over that again we can only substitute in when we are given the value of the X so we the value up here we are told that X is equal to 3 so 2 times 3 would give me 6 6 minus 1 is 5 and that would be the value of that expression right let's go on to your turn now I want you to find the value of the expression X minus 2 X where X is equal to 2 you can pause the video and 
,,you can try that out and then we'll go over it okay so what's the value of your expression for let's break it down we've got 8 minus 2x where the X is equal to 2 so 
,,it's 8 minus 2 times 2 that's 8 minus 4 and so the value of your expression is 4 okay try those on your own grab a piece of paper write them down pause the video and work them out okay how well did you do 8 minus 2 X where X is equal to 3 we're going to substitute the 3 in for the X so it would be 8 minus 2 times 3x minus 6 which gives me 2 5x minus 7 where X is equal to 2 same thing we're going to go 5 times 2 2 is in place of the X which gives me 10 minus 7 is 3 one thing here you have to write out the whole expression so I can't just write 5 times 2 because I've got an equal sign so my equal sign tells me that what is on this line is actually exactly the same value as to what is on that line so if I left off the 7 5 times 2 does not give me 5x minus 7 it doesn't equal that so we must just be very careful with how we write things down see okay number three 1/2 X where X is 10 half of 10 we all know is 5 3 times 2 X where X is 4 again we're going to substitute in for the X where it's 4 it will be 3 times and in brackets 2 times 4 so we'll do that first then we'll go 2 times 4 is 8 3 times 8 is 24 the next one 3x plus 2x again we substituting in 3 X + 2 X X here is 5 so 5 3 times 5 plus 2 times 5 will be 15 plus 10 and that gives you 25 I hope you all got that but let's look at the next thing remember when we simplified the expression while that last one we could probably simplify so in question 5 was 3x + 2 X where X was equal to 5 so because your variables are the same your unknowns are the same can add them together before you substitute it in so we got 3x + 2 X and that's the same as 5x remember when we simplify the expressions we looked at putting those together okay so X is equal to 5 and we can then multiply it 5 times 5 and we end up with 25 so the answer to that expression would be 25 that is the same answer as what you got when you did when you didn't simplify the expression and you kept the two terms apart it would be 3 times 5 + 2 times 5 which is 15 plus 10 and you also end up with 25 can you see you got the same answer so you could do it either way around you would end up with the same answer right let's look at see if it works for another example where 2 X + 4 X + X is equal to 3 we've got 2 times 3 plus 4 times 3 that's 6 plus 12 and it gives me an answer of 18 or we could go to X plus 4 X is 6 X 6 times 3 is 18 can you see same answer so whichever way suits you to work it out you can work it out like that you're going to get the same answer either way around right let's draw on everything you have learned today to try these ok you can pause the video again try those art and we'll go over them together right let's see how you did 2 times a number subtracted from 3 times the same number we've got 3 X minus 2 X and that would eggs we haven't been given the the value of the X so we can just simplify them right for added to 2 times a number and subtract the same number is 4 + 2 X - X would be 4 + X a number subtracted from 7 and 3 times that number is added it's 7 - x + 3 X and that would give you 7 minus 2 X right it's just revised what you've gone over today what we've learned so you've learned how to first of all write an expression in words then you learned how to simplify the expression and how to evaluate the expression when given a value for the unknown number see I made a little mistake here it's hard to simplify the expression not and expression and how do you evaluate the expression when given a value for the unknown number now you can try the activity that is being posted and then you can check it with the memo thank you for joining us today great and I hope you've understood everything just remember if you haven't understood anything at all you can email in and the email address has been on each side so you can go back and check it it is also an activity worksheet and somebody will get back to you with an answer or an explanation thank you for listening today

AlgebraicExpression,aq7rtToR1Uc,eft side of standard identities is shown will you be able to tell the right side try it let me tell you do you know with the help of these identities we can also find the factors of some expressions suppose we want to find the factors of 4x square plus 20x plus 25 are there any common factors in the three terms of this expression think think no there are no common factors in these three terms just think we can factorize this expression using one of these standard identities let me tell you 
,,there are three terms in this expression there are two terms on the right side of the third standard identity so we cannot use it there are three terms on the right 
,,side of each of the first and second identity so let's understand which identity we can use we can write 4 x square as 2 x square and 25 as 5 square in this way we see that the first term and the third term in this expression are perfect squares at the same time we also see that the sign of the middle term is positive can you tell me which of these expressions correspond to the right side of the standard identity think think absolutely right this expression corresponds to the right side of 
,,the identity a plus b bracket square is equal to a square plus 2 a b plus b square therefore we can use this identity if we assume a is equal to 2 x and b is equal to 5 then a square plus 2 a b plus b square is equal to 2 x square plus 2 multiplied by 2 x multiplied by 5 plus 5 square that is 4 x squared plus 20 x plus 25 which 
,,is similar to the given expression but according to question a square plus 2 a b plus b square is equal to a plus b bracket square so we can say 4 x square plus 20 x plus 25 is equal to 2 x plus 5 whole square thus with the help of standard identity we have multiplied this expression and these are its factors in this way to factorize an expression first we find the identity which has its right side similar to the expression then we find the factors of the desired expression from the corresponding expression on the left side of that standard identity now suppose we want to factorize 9y square minus 36 y plus 36 then how will we do this think think absolutely right here factor 9 is common in all three terms so under the distributive property we can take it outside the bracket like this we can write the expression written inside the parenthesis like this in this way we see that the expression inside this bracket corresponds to the right side of the standard identity where a is equal to y b is equal to 2 and 2 a b is equal to 2 multiplied by y multiplied by 2 that is 4y therefore we can factorize this expression as y minus 2 whole square thus this gives us the factorization of given expression like this we can also write it like this now pause the video and find the factors of 49 x square minus 100 let 
,,me tell you we can write 49 x square as 7 x square and 100 as 10 square in this way both terms of this expression are perfect squares it corresponds to the right side of this identity a plus b a minus b is equal to a square minus b square where a is equal to 7 x and b is equal to 10. therefore using the third identity we can factorize the given expression as 7x plus 10 into bracket 7x minus 10. now find the factors of the expressions given below so today we have learned factorization using 
,,identities in the next video we will see some interesting examples related to them you

AlgebraicExpression,WwTdAYWOYPs,hello all welcome to math for juniors with me miss Marx and my assistant snail hi friends hmm you seem a bit low today Oh actually I want to go on a holiday to Kashmir holiday again I think you came back from a holiday some time back only and why suddenly you want to go to Kashmir oh I want to see snowfall Oh what was that snail behave yourself hello I'm just practicing how to throw snowballs in Kashmir you throw one more ball at me and I will not give you a holiday for next one year I know miss marks please don't do that okay then behave now what are you wondering about why do we have snowfall in Kashmir but not in Delhi or Punjab Kashmir is closer to the mountains and is at a higher altitude in comparison to Delhi often job hence the climate there is different so altitude is one of the many factors that determine the climate of a place okay so you mean many factors put together determine the climatic condition of a place different factors obviously mean different climate yeah just like in math how like math if you multiply X Y and X plus 2 whole Y you get different results for instance XY plus 2y is the product in second case Oh snail 
,,try to understand if you are given the product XY plus 2y you can express it back to its factors y and X plus 2 whole this process of writing an expression as its products is called factorization Oh how does one do this factorization it seems so tough let's go to the virtual world to learn about factorization of algebraic expressions you have studied algebraic expressions and arithmetic operations on them now let's learn one more operation factorization of algebraic expressions now what is 
,,factorization well the process of writing an algebraic expression as product of two or more other algebraic expressions which are called factors of the first algebraic expression is called factorization in the algebraic expression a X plus a by a is common to both the terms ax and a Y so we take out a from both terms to obtain ax plus ay Y is equal to a multiplied by X plus y the whole here a and X plus y are called the factors of algebraic expression ax plus ay Y so snail how did you find 
,,it oh it was easy really very very interesting too hmm so that means you understood it very well yes quite well very well good then let me give you another algebraic expression and you factorize it me yes you since you find it so interesting huh well I was thinking miss marks why didn't I see a few more examples and then solve your question all right all right let's see some more examples on factorization of algebraic expressions but this time you better pay attention snail or sure I will good off to watch all words let's factorize the expression X plus 6x y minus 9x Z let's check out for the common factors here the common factor to the three terms x 6 XY + 9 XZ is X therefore the expression can be factorized by taking out X common so x + 6 X Y minus 9 XZ is equal to x multiplied by 1 plus 6y - 9z the whole now let's look at another example factorize the expression 6 X raised to power 4 into y raise to the power 3 minus 12 X cube y minus X 5 the common factor in this case is 
,,x times y taking out X Y we get XY x 6 X cubed Y square minus 12 X square minus 1 the whole notice that by multiplying the common term to each of term inside the bracket we obtain the original expression back this way we can verify if the factorization done is correct or not here the factorization is the reverse of expanding brackets back to the real world so snail I hope this time you understood it very well oh yes I did it and it was actually interesting math always is interesting but you need to pay attention mm like you pay attention to movies Auto food she know that I was thinking about a movie oh my god what if she marks me absent yes yes I will 
,,miss max what is that toy on this table can i play with it you can if you find the factors of that toy how can you find factors of the toy is it factorization restricted to numbers and algebraic expressions it is but it has a broader meaning as well which is not just restricted to algebra oh then why don't you tell me about it I will but before that we need to see another method of factorization of algebraic expressions which is by grouping the terms so let's go to the virtual world factorize a cube plus a square plus a plus 1 in the given expression we do not have anything common to all the terms so we shall use another method to factorize the expression that is by grouping the terms first divide the terms of the given expression into groups in order to find the common factor from each group grouping the terms as a cube plus a square and a plus 1 we get a square as a common factor from the first group and one from the second group now both groups have common factor a plus 1 
,,on taking a plus 1 as common factor from both groups the given expression reduces to a plus 1 into a square plus 1 thus a cube plus a square plus a plus 1 is equal to a plus 1 into a square plus 1 mm still wondering about the car yes you brought the car no I just factorized it or reduced it to its basic building blocks oh I didn't get that factorization and mathematics means the same as an English language that is it is reducing or splitting an object into its constituent products or factors the aim of factoring is usually to reduce something to its basic building blocks oh that's why the blocks and now I got it snail I have another very interesting phenomenon to tell you where in the factorization takes place let's check that out in the do you know section do you know that the sunlight also called as white light 
,,can be split into its constituent colors red orange yellow green blue indigo and violet how can you split the sunlight there are two ways to split the sunlight first we can do it with the help of this prison look at this closely friends when the sunlight passes through prism it splits into its constituent colors see Wow and I can see so that is how we factorize the sunlight through a prism yes and there is another way as well what is that I'm sure you all must have seen a rainbow before and that's an example of splitting of white sunlight on a rainy day if you stand with your back to the Sun as you look into falling rain or a mist of droplets you will 
,,notice the rainbow made up of seven colors red orange yellow green blue indigo and violet this range of sunlight colors when combined looks white to dye this property of sunlight was first demonstrated by famous mathematician and physicist Sir Isaac Newton in the year 1666 Wow we just factorize the sunlight first by prayers and 
,,then by a water droplet now it's time that I press the action replay button so that you all can quickly devise all that we have learned today about factorization so 
,,friends sit tight and pay attention factorization is the process of writing and algebraic expressions as product of two or more other algebraic expressions which are called factors of the first algebraic expression so an algebraic expression can be factorized by taking out the common term grouping the terms what are you doing with those blocks actually I broke the car I was trying to create the car model back with these blocks however can you help me ah in the process of reversing the factorization of course he anyways time for me to say goodbye to my dear friends but you continue your fun with algebraic expressions till the next time good bye bye see

AlgebraicExpression,fUOdon3y1hU,algebraic expressions and equations good day students welcome back to my classroom for today's lesson you are going to learn how to differentiate expression from equation translate variable expressions and equations into algebraic expressions and equations and vice versa and lastly identify a variable in non-algebraic expression and equation let us begin let's cover brain exercise let's take a look at this one we have the sum of eight and nine can you translate this into a numerical expression great job we have here the keyword sum which represents addition this means that we need to add eight and nine so that is eight plus nine and this is an example 
,,of a numerical expression next one we have the sum of four and a number again our keyword here is sum which means addition this means that we need to add 4 and a number here we do not know the value of a number therefore we are going to represent it by a letter let's say letter n so that is four plus n this is an example of algebraic expression next one we have the sum of four and the number is seven again our keyword here is the word sum which means addition and we need to add four and a number which is four plus n and the word is represents equal sign therefore four plus n is equal seven this is an example of algebraic equation now do you know what is the difference between algebraic expression and equation let's go and take a look let us discuss the differences between expression and equation in algebraic expression it is a mathematical phrase for example we have this sum of 4 and a number and as we can see this is not a complete sentence while the algebraic equation is a 
,,mathematical sentence for example we have the sum of four and the number is seven another one is algebraic expression has no equal sign while in algebraic equation it has equal sign which represented by the word is lastly in an expression a value of the letter or the symbol can change for example here we have 4 plus n we can say that the value of n is 5 so that would be four plus five or we can say that the volume n here is nine so that would be four plus nine or let us say it is equal to so that would be four plus two on the other hand in algebraic equation the value of the letter or the symbol cannot be changed it has a fixed volume or fixed answer here n four plus n equals seven we cannot say that the value of n is nine as it will not say that the equation is correct if we say that the value of n here is two the equation would be wrong what if we say that the value of n here is three or plus three equals 7 and that is the correct value of m wonderful now that you know the 
,,differences let's move on to the parts of algebraic expression the first one is the variable the variable is any letter or symbol that represents a number here the variable is letter x the next one is the coefficient the coefficient is the constant value used with the variable it is the factor or the number being multiplied to a variable here the coefficient is two we can always find the coefficient before the variable the next one is the constant the constant is the fixed value that does not change here the constant is number five and lastly we have the term the term is a number or variable a product or quotient of a number and variables separated by 
,,plus or minus sign here in a given example we have the plus sign and it separates two terms which are 2x and 5 remember that addition and subtraction only separate terms while division and multiplication do not separate terms now that you already know the parts and the differences between equation expression let us go and translate some verbal expressions here we have a number plus 3 first one that you need to know is what is the missing here the missing here is a number this means that we 
,,are going to represent it by a variable any letter that we would like to let's say i want letter m the next keyword here would be the word plus which means edition so that is m plus three so our algebraic expression here is m plus three now let's have another example we have the sum of a number and three again let's take a look 
,,for some keywords here the keywords that we have is the word sum which means addition therefore we need to add a number which can be represented by a variable let's 
,,say letter m and the number 3 so that is m plus 3 very good let's have another one we have m increased by 3 here we already have a variable which is m so let us write m next we have the keyword increase by increase by represents addition so that would be a plus sign and lastly the number three next one we have three added to m so again we already have a variable which is m and we need to add 3 to it so that is m plus 3 next one we have 3 more than m again our variable here is m and the word more than represents addition and we have three so that is m plus three now let us identify which are the variables coefficient constant and the number of terms here in our given algebraic expression the variable here is the letter which is and very good next one let us take a look for the coefficient again the coefficient is the number that we see before the variable as we can see there is no number before a variable here but it doesn't mean that we do not have a coefficient remember that a coefficient is a factor or a number multiplied to a variable all variables that do not have a number beforehand has a coefficient of one because it means one times m which is equals m so the coefficient here is one next one the constant here is very good it is three and let's count the number of terms since this algebraic expression is separated by a plus sign or addition our terms here are m and 3. so we have two turns great job let's have another example next one we have a number minus seven again we have here a number which can be represented by a variable so let us say letter f our next keyword here is the word minus which represents subtraction and there is 7 so that is f minus seven next one we have the difference of f and seven so again let's take a look for some keywords we have different and the difference represents subtraction so we need to subtract f and seven all right let's have another example we have f decreased by seven so our variable here is f and we need to decrease this one which represents subtraction by seven next example we have seven subtracted from f so our variable here is is the letter f and we need to subtract seven from it to that will be m minus seven and lastly we have seven less than f and our variable again here is letter f and our keyword is less than which means subtraction 7 so that is f minus seven now let's identify the variable here again our variable is the letter which is very good is letter f and now let's take a look for the coefficient since there's no number before our variable here therefore the coefficient here is one next one is the constant the constant here is negative 
,,seven now let's count the number of terms so we have here minus that separates the term so we have f and seven so that is to turn all right let's go to our next example this time we have a number time two again we have here the missing value which is a number so now let's represent it by a letter let's say letter n times which means multiplication two in an algebraic expression we do not use the multiplication sign as it confuses us into a variable x instead of using the multiplication sign the number we just simply combine the number and the variable so that would be 2 n next example we have twice of n here our variable is n and our keyword is the word to white which means to time so that is two times n therefore that is to n on to our next example we have n multiplied by two here our variable is letter n and our keyword is multiplied by two so we need to multiply n by two so that would be two n next one we have the double of n here our keyword again is double which means times two so we need to times two the letter n so that is two n all right next one we have the product of n and two so our variable here is n and our keyword is product which is the answer for multiplication this means that we need to multiply n and 2 so that is 2 m now let us identify the variable the variable here obvi is the letter and while the coefficient is 2 as it is the number before the variable next one is the constant as we can see we do not have a constant here while the number of terms since there's no addition or subtraction that separates the term we only have one term now let's move on to our next example next one we have a number divided by five again we have the missing volume which is a number so let us represent this by a variable f and we need to divide this by five so we can write this as n divided by five next one we have the quotient of n and phi so again our keyword here is equation which means division so it means that we need to divide n and five so that is n divided by five next one we have one fifth of n so it means that we need to multiply one and n so that is one-fifth n but it can also be written as n over five okay next one we have the ratio of n to five our variable here is n and our clue word here is the ratio we all know that we can represent ratio by a fraction so 
,,that would be n is to five or n over five which also means and divided by five now our variable here is the letter n while the coefficient here is one fifth as this 
,,is the factor or the number being multiplied to the variable n next one is the constant here we cannot see a constant so that would be zero or not well the number of terms since there's no addition or attraction with separate t terms this means that we only have one term great job now that you already know some basics this time 
,,let's try to translate a verbal expression with more than one operation into algebraic expression let's have our first example six more than twice a number so again 
,,we need to take a look for some clues in order for us to translate this one so our clue word here as we can see we have two white a number and we all know that that 
,,means two times a number or a variable so we can say that is two a and next one we have six more than and that is plus six so therefore our expression here is two a 
,,plus six wonderful now let's identify the variable here is a good job well the coefficient here is 2. next one the constant is 6 and we have here two terms which are two a and six let's have another example this time we have 18 less than half a number now let's take a look for some favorite we have here 18 less than and we all know that lessons mean subtract so that is minus eight next one we have have a number and that means one half times a number or a variable so that would be one half y now if we combine them together we have one half y minus eight so that is 18 less than half a number so here our variable is y well the coefficient here is one half well the constant is negative 18 or minus 18. and the number of terms here are two that is one-half y and eighteen now let's have another example we have one plus twice a number is ten so our first clue right here is to rise a number and that means three times a variable so we can say it is to re b next one we have one plot and that means plus one if we combine that together we have three b plus one and we still have more to translate here we have the word estet which means that equals ten so that is three b plus one equals ten so here we have the variable b while the coefficient here is three the constants are one and ten and the number of terms here are three which are three b one and ten this time let us translate an expression into a verbal or word sentences or phrases here we have b plus eight divided by two so first we have b plus eight we can write this one as the sum of b and eight and next we have divided by two so that would be divided by two now we have the sum of b and eight divided by two wonderful let's have another example here we have three n plus 25 equals 31. first let's try to translate plus 25. we can translate this 
,,one as 25 added two but i will use 25 added two next we have three n this means that three times n but we can also say to rise of n and lastly we have equals 31 which means s31 so now we have 25 added tutorials of n is 31. good job students you made it this far now here are the things that you learned today you

AlgebraicExpression,JxkWSDpfOFY,good morning students today we shall revise how to find the area of square and rectangle let's begin what does the term AVR mean easier measures the surface of a simple closed region the units of area are the square of the units of length thus area can be expressed in square units such as square centimeters square meters or square kilometers there are two methods to find the area one is by dividing a region into unit squares and thereafter counting the unit squares and the other is by using formula let's learn about each of these in a bit detail first let's see how to find the area of a simple closed region my counting unit squares when the region is divided into unit squares look at the square a-b-c-d it is divided into 25 equal squares or side 1 centimeter each thus we say that the area of square a b c d is equal to 25 square centimeters square centimeters can also be written as s you see em in short now let's find the area of the hidden figure look at the bigger yeah each 
,,square equals one square centimeter and each half square equals to half square centimeter thus on counting we get that the given figure has 14 squares and 2 half squares therefore the area of this given figure is equal to 14 plus ha plus 1/2 which is 15 square centimeters when finding the area of a plane figure by counting the unit squares remember one we ignore or do not count the squares that are less than half - if a square is more than half we count the area as one square unit now let's see how to find the area using formulas the area of a rectangle can be found by using the formula e is equal to L into B where E is the area L is the length and B is the breadth of the rectangle let's use this formula to find the area of a rectangle p q r s having length 7 units and Brett 5 units rectangle PQRS has length of 7 
,,units and bread or five units therefore by using formula area is equal to length into breadth we get the easier as 35 square units now let's all one more example to 
,,understand it in a better way find the area of a rectangle having length 33 meters and read 10 meters area is equal to Len into red which is equal to 33 into 10 which is equal to 330 square meters the formula to find the area of a square is different it is a is equal to s into s where s is equal to the length of the side of the 
,,square let's find the area of the square W X Y Z having side 13 units using this formula as the length of the side of the square W X Y Z is of 13 units using the formula area is equal to site into site we get to the answer as 169 square units now let's solve one more example to understand it in a better way find the area of a square having side of plan nine centimeters area is equal to side into side which is equal to 9 into 9 which is equal to 81 square centimeters remember the formulas one area of a rectangle is equal to length into red to area of a square is equal to site into side kids if you remember the formulas then finding the area will not be 
,,difficult

AlgebraicExpression,8hzPIKmCHUA,"Oh no! A power cut. Let me just get a candle. Ouch! I think I hit a table. Where is... oh, here. Do you know there are some people who have"
,,mastered the art of navigating in darkness. And they are also trained to read
,,and write in the dark. These mighty people are the blind. And they do this with the unique
,,writing system called Braille. I am so excited to tell you about the
,,"amazing story of this invention. Thank god it's back. Come friends, zoom in! The history of this unique writing system"
,,goes all the way back to the early 1800s. Several soldiers in the French Army were
,,using lamps to read the combat messages. A terrible decision. As the light shinning from the lamps told
,,the enemies where the French soldiers were. A man named Charles Barbier saw this problem. And developed a night writing system
,,for the soldiers. It was a system with 12 raised
,,dots in a cell. Which could be read with fingertips. And it helped the soldiers read without
,,"attracting any unwanted attention. Then in 1821, Charles Barbier was invited,.. ..to introduce the night writing system to a"
,,"class of young blind students. However, there was one flaw in this system. It was just impossible to feel all"
,,"the dots with a single touch. Still, it was enough to inspire one"
,,"student, a curious little boy. Named Louis Braille. Braille was blinded at a very young age,"
,,in an accident. When he was playing with an awl
,,"and punching holes in leather. But a physical disability, was no bar"
,,for Braille's bright spirit. Soon he was back in the workshop
,,"with his imagination. And this time, instead of leather,"
,,Braille was punching dots on paper. He worked tirelessly for years to modify
,,Charles Barbier's night writing system.. ..for his fellow blind individuals. And soon enough the hard work of this
,,little genius bore fruit. Braille simplified the night writing system. And reduced the 12 raised dots to 6! This meant that a single letter could now
,,"be recognized with a single touch. Now, that was a big improvement, kids. Because it made reading for the"
,,"blind much easier and faster. They were absolutely delighted. For the next 5 years, Braille refined the"
,,"writing method which was already in use. Finally, in 1829, Braille published a book.. ..explaining the entire Braille code,"

AlgebraicExpression,RwZvvJ7OWx0,hello my dearest friends so today's topic is fact tradition you can see here question on the board question number three and four which i'm going to do today each and every question i'm going to do hope you will enjoy this video and learn these all factorization properly if you are new on my channel please hit this bell button you will get notification of upcoming videos and don't forget to subscribe and share with your friends let's take a start question number three see four question on the board first question number three a m plus one plus two m plus one you can see here here also m plus one m plus one so we can take m plus one common and what is remaining here m so we have to write down m here is plus 2 so we have to write down plus 2 this one is the answer for you look at this one here also same like question number a first of all a minus b is here a minus b so we can take a minus b common yes and what is remaining here a a here is minus b so minus b sometime you can write a minus b whole square also because these two are same so we can write whole square look at this one here is 3 minus y but what is here y minus 3 this both are not same so we cannot take common so what we have to do we have to interchange this we can write x 3 minus y and when you interchange this 2 to make this and this equal in the place of minus we have to write on plus we have to write 2 and we have to interchange this so 3 minus y one thing keep in your mind when you interchange this two term this negative will be positive if you are positive you have to write negative you have to change the sign it means these two are common now now look at here here also 3 minus y here also 3 minus y before what is here y minus 3 to make it same we have to take minus common when you take minus common this minus will be 
,,plus and we will interchange the sign now 3 minus y 3 minus y so we can take 3 minus y common while after taking 3 minus y common what is remaining here x so x here 
,,is plus 2 so plus 2 hope you'll understand this video look at this one here also same like above here is 1 minus a b but what is here a b minus 1 this both are not same so what we have to do we have to take minus common when you take minus common what happen in the place of plus what we have to write down minus in the place of plus we have to write down minus and we have to interchange this two so here we can write 1 minus a b while taking minus common this positive will be negative b and we have to interchange the sign 1 minus a b now look at we have to interchange the place because minus into 1 it will be minus 1 minus minus plus a b okay now you can see here here also 1 minus a b here also 1 minus a b so we can take 1 minus a b common so what is remaining here 1 and here minus b so we can write here 1 minus b 1 is here minus b is here minus b we have to take a numerical with sine hope you understand this question now look at next and the questions are 4x x minus 2 question but e 4x x minus 2 plus 3x x minus 2 okay so here you can see here also x minus 2 here also x minus 2 both are same so no need to interchange both are same means you can take common what is the common here x minus 2 x minus 2 here also here also x minus 2 so we can take x minus 2 common so what is remaining here 4 x so we have 
,,to write here 4 x plus plus what is remaining here 3x 3x this x minus 2 already here so remaining here 4x plus 3 plus 3 is here now solve x minus 2 these two are like terms so we can add 4x plus 3x is equal to 7x so this one is a single term yes monomial this binomial so monomial write down at first 7x x minus 2 hope you understand this question now look at f number you can see here here is m minus n but here is n minus m actually before also when these two are same then only we can take common otherwise we cannot take common it means we have to interchange this after interchanging this in the place of minus what we have to write down plus and we have 
,,to change their places it means we are taking minus common so we have to write here m square m minus n in the place of minus we have to write plus m n and we have to interchange the place m minus and to make it same we have to take minus common when you take minus common this minus will be plus and we these two places are changed now m minus n common here also m minus 1 here also m minus 1 so m minus 1 common what is remaining here m is square plus here is m n now you can see here m minus n here what is the common m common remaining m plus n so m m plus n m minus and m is here m plus n m minus n you can write up to here also or you can write one step more m this in the form of a plus b a minus b so we can write m square minus n square a plus b a minus b means formula of a square minus b square in some book you will get up to here but in some book you will get up to here okay it depends on writer look at question number g first of all look at here here is m e a b minus b c but here bc minus a b again these two are not same to make it same what we have to do we have to in the place of plus we have to write down minus and we have to change 
,,their places so what we have to write here a b a b minus b c to interchange their places in the place of plus we have to write on minus after that we have to change 
,,their places a b minus bc after that we have to take common you can see here these two are same same term so we can take common a b minus b c and what is remaining here here is a b so write down a b minus b c minus b c okay here now what is common here it is a b minus bc here is b here also b so we can take b comma remaining a minus c similarly here also a b minus b c so b common remaining a minus c b and b it will be b square a minus c a minus c it means a minus c whole square hope you will enjoy this video uh now last question of question number three and after that i will do question number four and uh exercise one b question number three i'm going 
,,to do uh because of some demand of some strengths and i will do question number three two of exercise one b look at here now it is two m minus four and and here is four n minus two m these two are not same so first of all we have to make it same to make same what we have to do in the place of minus what we have to write plus and we have to interchange their places so 3 m 2 m minus 4 and in the place of minus we have to write down plus 6 to m minus 4 and when these two are not same you have 
,,to take minus common when you take minus common this minus will be plus and we have to change their places that much now these two are same so we can take common 2m 
,,minus 4n common what is remaining here 3m right on 3m plus 6 plus 6 now again what is common here here is 2 here is 4 2 common remaining m minus 2 n because 2 into 2 it will be 4 here what is the common three common remaining m plus two three into m three m three into two six now number number we can multiply two into three six 
,,and m minus two n m plus 2 either this term here this term here doesn't matter it will be same uh this question number three now look at question number four and after that exercise one b question number three okay you can see here question number four four question on the board now four terms are here first second third four we have to take two terms and we have to take common again we have to take last two terms and we have to take common while taking this what is the common here m a plus and a common is a in a is same in both the term first term second term there is a is common so what is remaining here m plus n m plus n because a already common a already common remaining m m plus n plus n plus from here also you can see here is m b plus and b here is b here also b so b is the common and what is remaining here 
,,m plus n m is here m plus n plus n now you m plus and m plus n we can take m plus n common so what is remaining here a plus b m plus and m plus and common these two 
,,are common here here is a so a plus b plus b hope you understand this question now look at this one i showed you before also first of all from first two term and from last two term we have to take common sometime from first to term there will be no common it means that time we have to arrange the term okay i will show you how to arrange also so from here what is the common here is x y here is 3y y and y common y common here here is x so x we have to write plus what is here 3 so 3 plus from 
,,2x plus 6 so what is the common here from to in 2 table 2 3 6 so 2 is the common remaining x because 2 into x it will be 2 x plus 2 into which number it will be 6 3's are 2 3's are 6. now you can see here here is x plus 3 here also x plus 3 so we can take x plus 3 common here is also x plus 3 here also x plus 3 so we can take x 
,,plus 3 common what is remaining here y so we have to write y plus 2 plus 2 this one is the answer i hope you understand this question now look at this one here also 
,,can we take from first to terms common yes here is a b here is 4a so a is the common from here we can take common yes here is 5 b plus 20 5 4 is a 20 so from first to term also we can take common from last two term also we can take common so what is common here common is a remaining a plus four plus from here we can take five common five here b remaining plus five into which number it will be twenty five fours are twenty now i will tell you one thing uh sorry here is b when you take common 
,,a remaining is b a common remaining b plus a already common so what is remaining 4 and here also 5 common 5 into b 5 b 5 for the 20 again you can see here also b plus 4 here also b plus 4 so we can take b plus 4 common so b plus 4 common so what is remaining here is a so we have to write a here is plus 5 plus 5 hope you understand this question now look at question number d can you take common from here something yes m square minus 5 m n we can take m common and what is here four m minus four n so we can take four common so from first two terms we have to take common and from last two term we have to take common so here common is m so what is remaining here m minus n plus from here common is 4 remaining m minus n again you can see here after taking common look at this term m minus n here also here also m minus n so we can take m minus n common so m minus n here also here also m minus n so we can take m minus n common and what is remaining here m and here plus four so we can write m plus four remaining so this one is the solution of four question of number four now look at next remaining questions of number four now you can see the remaining question on the board uh from first to term can we take something common you can see here can we take something common x square plus 5y if if you take this two term um and this two term can we take common from here we can take x common remaining 5 plus y but from here we cannot take common it means we have to arrange first so first and last look at properly here if we take this two term can we take x common yes we can take x common so what is remaining here x plus 5 and when you take this 2 what is common here y common remaining x plus 5 yes we can take first and third second and fourth so first of all we have to arrange x square plus 5x plus xy plus 5y this one at last now from this two term we have to take common common is x remaining x plus 5 x common x into x it will be x square and x into 5 it will be 5 x plus from here what is the common x y plus 5 y so common is y remaining x plus 5 again here is also x plus 5 here also x plus 5 i told you when these two are same then only you have to take common otherwise we have to interchange so already here same so we can take common x plus 5 here remaining is x plus here is y so answer is x plus 5 x plus y look at here when you take this two term can we take common no we cannot talk here is a square n is 15 b we cannot take anything common from here 
,,we can take common but we cannot take common here so first of all we have to arrange this so if we take this two term a common and remaining a minus five from here we can take three b common remaining a minus five yes first and third we can take second and last we have to take look at how to write first of all we have to arrange a square minus five a plus 3 a b minus 15 b after practicing you will practice more and more then you can understand how to arrange from wisdom we have to take common it depends on your practice okay now from this two term we have to take common common is a remaining a minus five from this two term what is the common here first of all look at number three and fifteen three fives are fifteen so common is three here also b here also b so we have can take b common three b already common so what is remaining a a minus three into which number it will be fifteen definitely five and b already common so a minus five now you can see here also a minus five here also a minus 5 so we can take a minus 5 common and remaining a plus 3 b so a plus 3 b remaining hope you understand this question now look at this one you can see here again it is minus m minus n plus 1 plus m n from this two term we can take common we cannot take anything common from first and third we can take common no common here from first and last can we take common yes there is common so write down like this minus m plus m n and write down plus m minus and first of all we have to arrange in this form now from here we can take common what is the common here m but we have to take minus also because first term what is here minus m so we have to take minus m common what is remaining here 1 and here is plus so we have to change the sign we have to write minus because minus is already common so we have to change sign when minus is common we have to change sign because minus minus it will be plus so if here minus we have to write plus if here plus we have to write down minus so m already common what is the remaining here and so n plus from here what is the common can you tell me comma no common there if no common but we have to write down one so remaining 1 minus and because 1 into 1 it will be 1 1 into n it will be n now 1 minus n 1 minus n so we can write 1 minus n common remaining minus m minus 
,,m plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 here now 1 minus n 1 minus m this one is positive so right on first minus any m is negative so right on it last hope you understand either this one front and 1 minus n at the back no problem because 2 into 4 and 4 into 2 it will be same 8 and so here also multiplication but if add and subtract then there is a problem but this one is multiplication so no problem you can write here and there no now look at here from this two term we cannot take any common now you can see from here we can take x common from here we can take 6y common okay so first of all we have to arrange x square minus 2xy plus 6xy minus 12y square now from this two term we have to take common common is x here is x square here is x so common is x remaining x minus this x already common so what is remaining here 2y so write down 2y plus from this to term we have to take common here is 6 here is 12 so common is 6 here is x y here is y square so common is y 6 y into x x is remaining 6 y already common so what is remaining here x here is minus so right on minus now 6 into which number it will be 12 6 2's are 12. here is y square from y square y is common so how many y remaining 1 so y is here now you can see here is x minus 2 y here is x minus 2 y x minus 2 y x minus 2 y so we can take x minus 2 y common so what is remaining here x and here is plus 6y so x plus 6 y hope you understand this question number 3 and 4. now exercise 1b question number 3. some students demanded that 
,,also so i'm providing in same video from exercise one e here question number three it's very easy uh you can see here the this one this equation in the form this term in the form of a square minus b square now what is the formula of a square minus b square a square minus b square is a plus b a minus b so in the place of a you can see here in the place of a what is here 20 in the place of b what is here 16 so what we have to write a plus b a minus b it means what we have to write here 20 plus 16 20 minus 16 this in the form of a square minus b square in the place of a 20 in the place of b 16 so formula is a plus b a minus b a plus b minus b in the place of a 20 in the place of b16 so 20 plus 16 20 minus 16 and when you add this 2 we get 36 and when you subtract this 2 we get 4 and after that just multiply 6 4s are 
,,24 4 2 4 3 12 13 14. so 144 is the answer hope you will understand this question this one also same and other questions also same you can do yourself also so just concept is necessary if you understand the concept of math concept of problems you can solve yourself each and every question this also in the form of a square minus b square in the place of a 51 and in the place of b here is 50 in the place of a 51 in the place of b50 so we have to write 50 plus 50 51 plus 50 51 minus 50. here also same we have to write 51 plus 50 and 51 minus 50 so when you add this to we get 101 into yes when you add this 2 we get 101 and when you subtract this 2 we get 1 
,,and when you multiply this 2 we have to multiply we get 101 hope you understand this question other questions also you can do in same process and um so thank you so 
,,much for those students who comment and demanding of question number three for of exercise 1a and question number three of exercise 1b like this keep supporting thank you so much keep in touch if and please don't forget to just share with your friends and please ignore this background song thank you

AlgebraicExpression,GYevDfFTCUs,hello grade 9 students today I am here to teach you an algebraic you need that's algebraic expressions chapter 5 we'll take algebraic expressions 3x plus 7 what is this one 3x plus 7 is the algebraic expression and what is 3x 3x is the algebraic term and what's the coefficient of the algebraic term that's 3 so what you call this number this is the constant term 7 so in algebra you need to know what is algebraic expression algebraic term and the coefficient of the algebraic term and the constant look at this algebraic expression 3 a + 5 b -11 write down the algebraic terms in the algebraic expression here 3 a is an algebraic term and 5 B you can't write minus 11 minus 11 is a constant write down the constant term that's minus 11 expanding brackets in algebraic expressions you have done this before in grade 8 how you expand multiply the first term with first and this one second so 3 times X 3 X 3 times 4 plus 12 all the elements inside the brackets must must be multiplied by 3 
,,this is an algebraic expression with algebraic term is 3x so this is the algebraic term the coefficient of algebraic term is 3 and the constant term is 12 now expand this minus 5 times a minus 5 a minus 5 times minus 4 you get plus 20 when multiplying by negative number the terms inside the brackets changed the sign look at here a was positive law - five earlier this was - value now this is Plus expand brackets 3 times a 3 a 3 times 2 + 6 here 5 times X 5x - 5 times 4 26 times a 6 a plus 6 
,,times 1 6 minus 7 times X minus 7 X minus 7 times minus 4 plus 28 minus 3 times 5 minus 50 minus 3 into minus y plus 3 y here - 11 times 3 minus 33 - 11 x minus m plus 11 m take these questions eight times like 8 times X 8 X 8 x - 4 - 32 here 4 times a 4 - 4 times 1/2 so what is 4 times 1/2 that means 2 so minus 2 6 times 2 X 12 X minus 6 this one 5 times 3 15 p phi x cubed minus 5 q this 1 minus 2 times X minus 2 X minus minus plus plus 22 what 1/2 times 4 X here you can do separately 1/2 
,,times 2 X here you get 2 X 1/2 times 8 you get 4 so plus Oh expand brackets a times X X a times 4 4 B times X BX B times minus 3 minus 3 this one C X plus C C times 
,,1 that's C P times Q P Q minus P times 4 you can write minus 4p when you are writing the term write the number first M into M M square M into 4 for M P into P P squared P into minus Q minus P Q 2 way times a 2 a squared 2 a times B 2 a 3 X into X 3x squared 3 X into minus 2 minus 6 X here what happens - is there - 2 P times M minus 2 will write MP in order alphabetical order M first minus 2p times minus 4 plus 8 P here again - values minus 3 X into X minus 3 X square minus 3 X into minus y 
,,plus 3 X 5 - 2 y into Z minus 2 y Z minus 2 into 3 minus 6 Y this 1 minus px - + - + P Y what about this one a square into a square a B and minus 3a X into X x squared X into - y - x - y or first we have to write down the number -2 X Y X into five that's five X we don't say X 5 5 X is the correct way of writing substitute the values in the algebraic expression what we do we can substitute the values given a equals 2 there so the algebraic term is three so how do you do that first write down the expression substitute a is 2 3 times 2 + 7 6 plus 7 that's 13 determine the value of x squared + 5 X minus 11 when x equals 3 what is x squared means 3 times 3 
,,so 3 squared 5 times 3 minus 11 9 plus 15 minus 11 15 minus 11 is 4 9 plus 4 30 what's the expression given here 5x minus 4y plus 7 you asked to find out when x equals -2 and y equals minus 3 substitute 5 times minus 2 y times minus 3 5 times minus 2 minus 10 minus minus plus 12 plus 7 minus 10 plus 12 plus 2 2 plus 7 that's 9 find the value of the algebraic expression by substituting the values for the unknown letters given below a squared minus a is given 3 so that means 3 squared minus 3 3 squared is 9 9 minus 3 you get six seven X minus three y plus four x equals 4 that means 7 times 4 y equals to 7 times 4 28 3 times 2 6 28 minus 6 22 22 plus 4 you get 26 this one you have to substitute a fraction we'll see a equals 1/2 so that means 4 times 1/2 B equals 3 3 times 3 2 times 2 so you get 2 plus 9 minus 9 9 9 get cancel out and you get to them expand brackets and simplify as much as possible first expand brackets 2 times a 2 a 2 times minus B minus 2 B plus 3a plus 21 now 
,,I'd like terms 2 & 3 8 that's 5 8 and - to be there plus 21 here first expand brackets 3x - 6 5 I plus 5 here constant terms we can simplify 3 X plus 5 by minus 6 and plus 5 is minus 1 here 6a plus 6b you know nothing means this is like 1 minus a plus v6 a - a highway 6 b + B it's 7 B expand and simplify 3x + 3 y here 2x minus 2y like terms add 3x and 2x becomes 5x 3 y + minus 2y that's plus y 1y you don't need to write 1 here 5 a minus 10 B minus 3 a minus into minus plus 12 B 5 a and minus 3a 2a minus 10 10 plus 12 plus 2 so plus 2b this one nothing means this is like 1 so a minus 3 multiply these 2 minus M square R and minus - plus 5 m now what are 
,,the like terms you can't simplify further this 1 minus 3 X minus minus plus 6 y + 7 x + 7 by minus 3 X and + 7 X that's 4 X 6 plus 7 13 y 2 x 3 6 6 minus 2 y here nothing means this is like what x + 6 X + X 7 X minus 2 n + y -1 Y that's minus y into a a squared - 3 a 2 times 3 6 a 2 times 4 8 what are the like terms these 2 a squared plus 6 and minus 3 you get plus 3 a + 8 this one x squared minus XY + 3 X +6 so you can't simplify this one further minus 3x minus minus plus 15y plus 7x minus 7y what are the like terms 7x minus 3x that's points 15 minus 7 plus 8y there's a minus sign minus 7 e minus into minus plus 7 b minus three b minus minus becomes plus 3 times 3 9 a what are the like terms 90 + -7 a you get to it 7 b minus 3 B that's for be here three terms but you can do the same thing multiplied by 5 5 X minus 5 bi plus 15 is is this one and then 3 X + 3 y 5x + 3 X 8 X - 5 bi plus 3 by - 2 y + 15 there this one - way - 4 B plus 3 a + 3 B let 2a and 3a 5b 5a plus 3a 8 minus 4 B plus 3b that's - 1b or just you can write B this one 5x - 5 by this 1 minus 3 X plus 3y minus minus plus and 11 Y is there 5x + 3 X - 3 X 2x - 5 plus 3 minus 
,,2 y 11 minus 2 plus 9 substituting fractions - algebraic terms X is half you asked to find out 4 X plus 5 so substitute 4 times 1/2 plus 5 here you can see you can simplify the denominator with the numerator 1 and here so you get 2 + 5 that's 7 equals 1/3 9a plus 2/9 times 1/3 + 2 here 3 times 1/3 times 3 3 + 2 you get 5 x equals 2/3 now 9 x + 1 9 times 2/3 plus 1/3 times 1/3 times 3 so 3 times 2 6 6 + 1 7 here 11 minus 3 when a equals minus 2/3 11 minus 3 times minus 2 over 3 will put brackets here 3 + 3 get cancel out you get 11 minus into minus plus 11 plus 2 answer yes 13 equals 1/2 B equals 1/3 so this should be simple B so we'll substitute the values for a equals 1/2 we cause 1/3 2 times 1/2 times 2 so what's the answer 2 + here are 3 in one three two one so one day three to plus one you'll get three six a six times 1/2 minus 3 times 1/3 substitute a and B two times three three get cancelled out so what's remaining 3 here 1 3 minus 1 is 2 8 E is 1/2 B is 1/3 2 times 1/2 times 4 3 times 1/3 times 2 here 4-2 ours is to 18 times 1/2 six times one thirty two and nine three bit too so what's the final answer nine minus two answer is seven if x equals 2/3 and y equals 1/2 find the value of the following algebraic expressions 6 times 2/3 2 times 1/2 3 times 1/3 times 2 2 times 1/2 times 1/2 times 2 4 here plus one times one one four plus one you get five this one 9 times X what is X X is 2/3 4 times 1/2 3 times 1/3 times 3 2 times 1/2 times 2 so 3 times 2 is 6 2 times 1 is 2 6 minus 2 same question another part 12 X is 2/3 - why why is half substitute 3 times 1/3 times 4 4 times 2 eight here - when to get canceled out you get one there 8 + 1 9 9 X is 2/3 minus 2 times 1/2 3 n here 3 3 times 2 6 2 + 2 get cancelled out you get minus 1 6 - 1 answer is 5 find the value of value if P equals 1/3 so substitute 1/3 for P simplify first 3 times 2 6 2 + 4 that's 6 9 P minus 2/9 times P is 1/3 minus 2 here simplify 3 + 3 3 - 2 you get 12 P P is 1/3 + 3 3 times 1 3 times 4 4 + 3 you get 7 3 P plus 11 3 into 1/3 + ulema 3 + 3 get cancel out 1 plus 11 is 12 so you need to simplify the fractional part that's multiplication and then do the addition find the value if M equals to 4 times 2 + 11 8 plus 11 that's 19 6 times 2 plus 5 multiplication first 12 + 5 17 10 times 2 - 1 xx - 1 that's 19 8 times 2 plus 10 8 times 2 16 + 10 26 find the value when x equals 2l y equals 1/3 for X is 2 y is 138 plus 1/3 how can you write you can write 8 full parts and 135 X plus 3 by 5 X that's not bad by 2 3 y 1/3 is there 3 3 get cancelled out so 10 plus 1 the answer is either 1 another one 8 times 2 minus 6 times 1/3 3 and here too you get 6 8 times 2 16 minus 2 answer is 14 again this one 10 times 2 minus 9 times white why is 1/3 3 times 1/3 times 3 10 times 2 20 minus 3 answer is 17 find the value of M equals 1/2 and in equals 1/2 for these expressions 8m a miss half in Miss 152 times 4 here are 5 times 2 4 times 1 4 2 times 1 2 4 minus 2 you get to do the same thing 16mm is 1/2 it needs 152 with 16 you get eight five and five get canceled out 8 minus 1 is 7 10 mm is half a Miss 152 and ten five five and this 1 so 5 plus 1 you get 6 6 times mm is 1/2 minus 15 times n that's one field to end is 3 5 times 3 15 so you get 3 minus 3 answer is 0 binomial expressions what is 
,,bi means two so expressions means when you get two terms 3x plus 4y is binomial expression X minus 5i so all these are binomial expressions so there are two terms in all these expressions due to one term or both of these terms are algebraic terms these are called binomial algebraic expressions so here one term is constant and the other one is algebraic term here both terms are algebraic terms product of two binomial expressions now X plus 2 is a binomial expression X plus 3 or so another binomial expression now we'll try to multiply these two so this is the product of both binary expressions or binomial expressions expand the brackets and simplify as much as possible now we'll try to do that using this method so we are multiplying here X plus 3 they are we can write x plus 2 here X plus 2 this way row wise X plus 
,,3 column wise X plus 2 so we can use multiply row and columns X into X we know this is X square X into plus 3 plus 3x this one 2 into X plus 2 X 2 into 3 plus 6 so what's the answer when you multiply using this method you get x squared - 3 X 2 X + 6 now simplify I can simplify these two - 3 + 2 5 X + 6 so that's how we can multiply using this method now we'll do the same thing X + 3 is there x + 5 X into X x squared X into 5 5 X 3 into X 3 X 3 into 5 15 so what are the values you are getting here when you multiply you get x squared - 5 X 3x + 15 so when you simplify you get 8x plus 15 - the same thing a plus 4a plus 4a into a a square into 4 4 a 5 into a 5 a 5 into 4 20 so when you multiply you get all these terms so a square plus 4 plus 5a plus 20 so when you can so you can add these to phibn for where you get 9e and this is 20 similar to that one y + 3 y + 7 Y into y Y square my into 3 3 by 7 into y 7y 7 into 3 20 so what's the answer Y squared 3 by 7 y + 20 bucks so these 
,,two terms you can add you get 10 buy and here are twenty one this one now - so a minus two so you can write in one color - to a +3 here a squared - 2 way here plus 3 a + -6 - into + - now what are the terms you are getting a squared minus 2a plus 3 and minus 6 so simply 5 3 - 2 + 1 that's a minus 6 this was X - 5 X - 2 so we need to multiply X into X X square X into minus 5 minus 5 X here you get minus 2 X minus 2 into minus 5 that's + step write down the terms and simplify x squared minus 
,,5 minus 2 minus 7 and you'll get 10 here similar to that one a minus 7 a minus 3 a into a a square minus 7 8 - 3 times a minus 3 a minus 3 times minus 7 plus 25 so what are the terms you are getting a squared minus 7 a minus 3 a + 21 a squared - 7 + -3 minus 10 plus 21 expand and simplify so we'll take the whole expression multiplied with this and this so you get a into a plus 2 here 3 with a plus 2 now expand brackets a into a square plus 2 a 3 into a 3a plus 6 so you get a squared 2a and 
,,3a v b +6 this one through the same thing the whole expression multiplied with this one X into X minus 2 5 into X minus 2 then expand brackets x squared minus 2x plus 5 X minus 10 so x squared minus 2 plus 5 that's plus 3x minus 10 this one this whole expression with this end this p with p + 5 + -7 b 3 plus 5p squared plus 5p minus 7 P minus 35 so you get P squared minus 7 and plus 5 minus 2p minus 35 this one Y with Y minus 3 and minus 4 with Y minus 3 so this term multiplied by these two 
,,terms Y squared minus 3y minus 4y plus 12 so you get Y squared minus 3 minus 4 minus 7y then you get plus expand and simplify again we can write a plus 3 expression 
,,with a plus 7 with this now expand a square plus 3 plus seventy plus 21 but you get a squared 3 a + 7 a 10 a plus 21 what about this one y with y + 7 + 4 with y + 7 
,,now multiply Y into y y square and 4y plus 28 four times seven simplify y squared 7 plus 4 11 y plus 28 this one a minus 3 times M plus 4 times M minus 3 M into M M 
,,squared minus 3 M 4 M minus 12 so you get M squared minus 3 plus 4 plus M minus 12 what about this one p + 7 x p + + 8 x p + 7 you get P squared + 7 p 8 b + 56 p square 7 p + 8 P 15 P Plus 56 look at this one P with P minus 8 and the other one is minus 3 with P minus 8 expand brackets you get V squared minus 18 minus 3 P plus 24 P square 8 + 3 11 so this is minus 24 there this one X with X - 4 - 7 with X - 4 x squared minus 4 X minus 7 X + 28 x squared minus 4 X and minus 7 X minus 11 X and here plus 28 here 4 into 6 + P + + P into 6 + p expand separately 24 + 4 p here 6 P plus P squared so 24 is there here 6 plus 4 10 plus P Square what about this one 4 is there 7 - why - why with 7 - what 4 times 7 28 here - 4 y minus 7y plus y square answer is 28 minus 4 minus 7 minus 11 y + y squared there this one a with a - 
,,8 + 8 with a minus 8a squared - 8 8 plus 8 a + 64 minus 64 a squared - 8 e + 8 a get cancel out you get minus 68 so this one P into P minus 4 and plus 4 with P minus 4p squared - 4 p + 4 P minus 16 yeah also me the term get canceled out P squared minus 16 is what seven with seven plus M minus M with seven plus M when you simplify expand brackets 49 + 7 m - 7 M minus M Squared so what's the value 49 minus M Squared because this these two terms get cancelled out so what are these actually can you remember difference between two squared terms so you get square terms here and here this one give it to a plus three minus five it to a plus three to a squared 
,,plus 3a minus 10y minus fifteen simplify you get 2a squared - 7 8 - 15 question number 19 expand using the arrow now we'll use another method we call it rainbow method or foil so I'll show you how to do that at once without writing separate brackets this one first with first number so that's F a into a that's a square that's F first with first that's the arrow number one now we are taking oh-oh means outside values so outside here with outside that's the second one a with eight get 8a that's outside I mean inside with inside so inside with inside that's number three three with you get three that's I thought 1l l means last with last two last week last 
,,that's fourth one three with eight you get 24 that's so we call this method is foil method first with first outside with outside inside with inside last with last oh they call it rainbow meter this is like a rainbow this one this one this one rainbow so we can call it rainbow method now we'll practice rainbow method or foil method you put the arrows first first with first why square then Oh outside numbers so why then inside 7y and l-last values 28 y squared plus 11 y plus 28 now do the same thing this one p square then the second one is this +7 p third one is minus 2p fourth one is minus 14 simplify you get 7 minus 2 plus 5p this one use rainbow or foil method first with first then outside numbers inside numbers and then last two values simplify you get M Squared 8 minus 7 plus M minus 56 that's why first with first 48 this with this 8 be inside six feet and outside numbers last last numbers P Square this one 48 + 8 + 6 14 P plus P squared rainbow method a squared + AC plus 
,,a B plus C can you simplify this one you can't simplify no like terms are there this one M squared plus 7 minus 2m minus 14x squared plus five M minus 14 this one three-year plus 24x squared + 8 simplify like terms you get 3a + 80 1124 and this one reimu bitter or foil method M squared minus 8 M minus 3 M plus 8 times 3 20 simplify you get 11 m in the middle and here you get 24 they're the same thing you have to use foil of rainbow method P into 7 7 P P into P P squared 11 times 7 77 11 now add these to get 18 P plus P squared plus 77 this one y squared minus 2y plus 2y minus 4 meter term get cancel out minus 2y plus 2y get cancel out you get Y squared minus H squared plus 7 h minus 7 Beach - 49 me turtle get cancel out h squared - 49 this one use rainbow method 12 x - 12 x - 24 12 X 2 X + x squared so 24 there 12 + 2 14 and you get x squared expand brackets using areas now we'll use another method to expand brackets x no Mielec specials so x + 2 X + 3 so we think about the area of a rectangle so X + 3 we write like this this way x + 2 we can fill each area and add it together so X into X x squared X into 3 3 X 2 into X 2 X 2 into 3 6 so what's the total area of the rectangle areas of each rectangle add up to gether X square plus 3 X plus 2 X plus 6 you get 5 X so you can use this method as well considering areas of rectangles because here what is the total area X plus 3 into X plus 2 length into breadth now look at this one X plus 3 one side X plus 4 the other side so fill the areas x squared 4 X 3 X + 12 so what's the total area x squared + 4 X + 3 X + 12 when you add these two together you get 7x plus 12 this one what's the area this is x + 6 + x + 4 multiplication of these two so fill this x squared this is 6 X 4 X + 24 add it together x squared plus 6 X plus 4 X plus 24 is equal 
,,to x squared + 10 x 6 + 4 + 24 they're given that the following equations show that the above equation is true for a equals 3 so we'll do left hand side and right hand side and see whether both are equal so take the left hand side and substitute a equals 3 3 + 2 7 + 3 10 3 + 2 5 10 times 5 50 now we'll take the right hand side and substitute a squared + 9 a plus 40 equals 3 3 squared 9 times 3 + 14 9 9 times 3 27 + 14 what's the value 9 + 7 16 22 through four five so that's also fifty so you can say this is equal so left hand side is equal to right hand and this is so therefore it's true given that the following equation show that the above equation is true for x equals five take the left hand side and substitute five five plus two pi + 3 5 + 2 7 5 + 3 8 8 times 7 56 now take the right hand side x squared + 5 X plus 6 substitute x equals 5 5 squared pi times 5 + 6 here 25 5 times 5 25 + 650 + 6 56 so we can see left hand side is equal to right hand side so therefore the statement is true for x equals 5 given that the following equations show that the above equation is true for x equals 7 so take the left hand side and substitute x equals 7 7 minus 3 7 minus 2 4 times 5 20 now we'll take right hand side and substitute x squared minus 5x plus 6 x squared that means 7 squared minus 5 times 7 plus 6 49 
,,minus 35 plus 6 49 minus 35 you get 14 14 plus 6 that's 20 so you get 20 so left hand side is equal to right hand side therefore this statement is given that the following in question show that the above equation is true for y equals 10 so left hand side substitute Y constant 10 plus 7 10 - 11 so what's 10 plus 7 70 10 - 11 - 117 times minus 1 minus 70 now take the right hand side and substitute Y squared minus 4y minus 77 Y is 10 10 squared - 4 times 10 minus 77 so what's the answer hundred minus 40 minus 77 100 minus 40 60 60 minus 77 is - 17 so we get same answer so left hand side is equal to right hand side so that means this is true when y equals 
,,10 given that the following equation show that the above equation is true for a equals 6 left hand side a squared + 7 8 plus 12 substitute 6 6 squared plus 7 times 6 plus 12 36 42 + 12 so you get 6 plus 2 8 10 and then one remaining 8 9 so 90 now we look at the right hand side a plus 3 is 6 6 plus 3 6 + 4 6 plus 3 9 6 plus 4 10

,,next part second part x equals -2 so that's the same question and x equals -2 so take the left hand side substitute x equals -2 minus two plus 5 minus 2 plus 6 the answer pi minus 2 3 6 minus 2 for 4 times 3 12 right hand side x squared that means minus 2 squared plus 11 x minus 2 plus 13 minus 2 squared is 4 11 x minus 2 minus 
,,22 plus 30 30 minus 22 you get 8 8 plus 4 so left hand side is equal to right hand side so therefore we can say true 4 x equals -2 verify this one for each instance 
,,given below so first one is x equals 1 take left hand side and substitute 1 minus 2 1 plus 3 minus 1 into 4 you get minus 4 take the right hand side x squared that means 1 square plus 1 minus 6 1 squared is 1 plus 1/2 2 minus 6 minus 4 so you get the same answer left hand side is equal to right hand side therefore it's true for 
,,x equals what now what's the second part x equals 4 so take the left hand side substitute x equals 4 4 minus 2 4 plus 3 2 & 7 so you get 14 right hand side x squared so 4 squared plus 4 minus 6 16 plus 4 minus 6 20 minus 6 you get 14 so both are the same so you can write left hand side is equal to right hand side so both sides are equals we can write true for x equals question number 6 verify that this statement for each instance given below so this is the third part x equals 0 take left hand side x is 0 substitute 0 minus 2 0 plus 3 you get minus 2 times 3 minus 6 right hand side x squared x squared it means 0 squared plus 0 minus 6 you get minus 6 so you get the same answer left hand side is equal to right hand side we can say therefore true for x equals zero question number seven verify this statement for each 
,,instance so this is another question you have to substitute x equals two so we'll take left hand side is equal to x equals 2 2 minus 2 and 4 minus 2 2 minus 2 0 0 times 2 you get 0 right hand side 2 squared minus 6 times 2 plus 8 4 minus 12 plus 8 8 plus 4 12 12 minus 12 you get 0 so left hand side is equal to right hand side so therefore this is true for x equals 2 verify this statement when x equals 3 take left hand side substitute 3 2 minus 3 4 minus 3 minus 1 1 you get minus 1 right hand side x squared that means 3 squared minus 6 times 3 plus 8 you get 9 minus 18 plus 8 8 plus 9 17 17 minus 18 minus 1 so you get the same answer so left hand side is equal to right hand side they are both true for x equals 3 verify this one when x equals minus 2 same thing take left hand side substitute x equals -2 2 minus minus to make sure that you put brackets - - - that becomes 2 plus 2 here 4 + 2 4 into 6 that's 24 right hand side x squared so minus 2 whole thing's square minus 6 into minus 2 plus 8 minus 2 times minus 2 plus 4 minus - here plus 12 plus 8 so 12 plus 12 24 so you're getting the same answer left hand side is equal to right hand side so true for x equals -2 question number 8 worded problem the length and width of a rectangle piece of decorative paper are 15 and 8 we'll try to draw that 15 and 8 2 strips of bread X centimeters each are cut off from the length and the breadth so this one so excellent cut off cut off from length X length cut off from WIC using a figure obtain an expression for the area of the remaining portion so what's the remaining portion this one so this one is the remaining portion so how we find out the remaining portion we can find out the full area - this one or you can find out the new length and the new width of the rectangle the full length is 15 and you 
,,cut expert so what is this side 15-6 this width or breadth is 8 cut out expert so this becomes 8 minus 6 so you need the shaded area shaded area the rectangle with 15 minus 6 and 8 minus X so basically you need the multiplication so remaining portion is 8 minus X into 15 minus X now use foil 8 times 15 8 times 5 48 times 1/8 + 4 12 minus 8 X minus 15 XL plus X square minus minus becomes plus 120 minus 8 minus 15 minus 23 X plus x squared so this is the area of the remaining portion so consider X less than 8 means if this is more than it you get a negative length so rectangle length cannot be negative another question question number 9 a rectangular flowerbed of length X meters and breadth 2 meters is shown in the figure two meters are reduced from its length and X meters are added to its breadth and then construct an expression in terms of X for the area of the new flowerbed by using a figure so now this is two meters are reduced so what's the what's this one X minus two now 
,,what's the height X added so this is the new length two plus X now this is the new flowerbed so what's the area X minus 2 into 2 plus X that's the new area now multiply X into 2 2x X into X x squared minus 2 into 2 minus 4 and minus 2 into X minus 2 X so you get 2x and minus 2x get canceled out x squared minus miscellaneous exercise write an expression for the shaded area in the given figure and simplified so this is a composite figure so you can divide into two parts we'll divide from here so we can find out this rectangle and this rectangle then add so what's the area of this one and this one so we'll take the first one first area is X plus 3 into X 
,,plus 2 use foil x squared plus 2x + 3 X + 6 you get x squared plus 5x plus 6 now the second part X plus 1 and X plus 2 so you get x squared plus 2x plus 1 x + 2 you 
,,get x squared plus 3 X plus 2 now you have two areas what's the total area so total area is equal to add these two 1 and 2x squared plus 5x plus 6 plus x squared 3x 
,,plus 2x squared x squared 2x squared 5x + 3 X 8 X 6 + 2 8 another one so you asked to find out the shaded part so we can do subtract the small area from the bigger one so we can do shaded area is equal to what's the bigger one x + 18 2 X + 5 what's the small area so inside rectangle X plus 1 and X plus 2 now we will do separately and subtract x squared + 5 X + 8 X + 40 now subtract this one put brackets x squared + 2 X + 1 x + 1 times 2 that's 2 now subtract these two you get x squared + 8 
,,+ 5 13 x + 40 then subtract x squared is there 2 x + 1 X you get 3 x + 2 now expand bracket six squared plus 13x plus 40 minus x squared minus 3x minus 2 so x squared minus x squared 0 13 X and minus 3x you get 10 X 40 minus 2 you get 38 and the last question find the values of a and B so you have given this statement X plus a into X plus 4 is x squared plus BX plus 12 now we'll expand and see what you get on the right left hand side what you get on the left hand side x squared plus 4x plus a X + 4 that's given equals 2x squared B X plus 12 now we'll write down X term separately can take X out I can write 4 plus a plus 4a is equal to x squared plus BX 
,,plus 12 these two I equal so you can compare the coefficients ya X term X coefficient is 4 plus a what's the X coefficient there that's big what about this one constant term for a is equal to 12 from this you can find a substitute here and find B so divided by 4 a equals 12 divided by 4 that's 3 now substitute 3 here 4 plus 3 you get B so B equals 7 so a equals 3 and B equals 7 we covered all theory part in expanding brackets substituting values in algebraic expressions so practice all these exercises and examples and thorough week as you break expressions

AlgebraicExpression,8MNNWrIO5to,this was the equation we looked at in the previous video X plus 3 equals 10 I have left some space here intentionally there are two ways in which we can solve an equation the phrase solving an equation means finding the value of the variable that satisfies the equation by satisfies I mean a value of the variable that equates the left-hand side and the right-hand side so our aim in linear equations is mainly to find the value of this variable X the first method is the inverse operations method before you understand this method we need to understand a simple concept whatever we do to the left hand side we do the same to the right hand side let us choose 
,,a random number say 5 assume we add this number to the left hand side for the equation to hold true we have to add the same number to the right hand side similarly if we subtract 5 from the left hand side we have to subtract the same number from the right hand side if we multiply the left-hand side by the number we have to multiply the right hand side by the same number but remember we have to multiply the entire side but putting these brackets here it means that we multiplied the entire left hand side by 5 and if we divide the left hand side by the number we also divide the right hand side by the same number note that 5 was a random number now you should be wondering how this concept helps us solve an equation this concept is the crux of the inverse operations method just remember this concept we move to a new page to solve a new linear equation say we want to solve the equation 2x plus 5 equals 13 how do we use the inverse method to solve this equation remember when we have to solve such equations our aim should be to keep only the variable on the left hand we have to eliminate everything else so our first task should be to eliminate five so we will have to subtract five from the left-hand side but we just learnt a concept that said if we subtract a number from the left-hand side we have to subtract the same number from the right-hand side hence we subtract 5 from both sides we get 2x plus 5 minus 5 equal to 13 minus 5 we subtracted 5 from both sides 5 cancels out on the left-hand side and the right-hand side equals 8 hence our equation reduces to 2x equals 8 now to have just the variable on the left-hand side we have to eliminate its coefficient which is 2 so we can just divide the left-hand side by 2 and if we divide the left-hand side by 2 we have to divide the right-hand side also by 2 so we divide both sides by 2 we get 2x by 2 equals 8 by 2 2 cancels out on the left-hand side and 8 by 2 equals 4 hence we get X equal to 4 this tells us that if you put 4 in place of X here you will get a 13 let's review this method quickly our aim was to have only the variable on the left-hand side so we first eliminated 5 by subtracting 5 from both sides and then we eliminated 2 by dividing both sides by 2 which gave us the value of x as for the last step after solving the equation should be to check our answer so on the left-hand side please substitute the value of x and see if it equals the right-hand side the left-hand side is 2x plus 5 substituting 4 in place of X we get 2 x 4 plus 5 that equals 8 plus 5 which is 13 the same as the right hand side so we say that our value of x is correct you

AlgebraicExpression,lDOYdBgtnjY,look at this problem three added to a number gives us ten find that number we know it's seven but that's not the reason why I asked you this question I want to know 
,,how can we represent this problem in a simpler way we can probably say X plus three equals ten find X 3 is added to a number to get 10 we just assign a variable to that number this is called an equation and it helps us write large problems like these in a shorter way this equation has just one variable which is X and it's an unknown and the highest power of X is 1 these kinds of equations are called linear equations in one variable they are also referred to as first degree equations in one 
,,variable they are called linear of first degree because the highest degree of the variable is 1 we will have a deeper understanding of why such equations are called 
,,linear in the coming videos we categorize an equation into three parts we have an equality sign in the center to its left is the left-hand side which is shown here as LHS and to its right is the right-hand side shown here as RHS the problems for such kind of equations require us to solve for the value of the variable there are two ways in which we can solve the equation the first method is called the inverse operations method and the second one is by using the transpose method both the methods give us the same answer but after we solve equations using both the methods we will realize that the transpose method is preferred over the inverse operations method you you

AlgebraicExpression,9BXFmrjUflo,solving algebraic equations hello there students welcome back to my classroom for today's lesson you are going to learn how to solve 40 variable in on algebraic equation let us begin first let's have our first example we have here a number increased by 7 is 25. first we need to translate this one into one equation we have a number which is missing or unknown so let us represent this by a variable let m be our variable next one we have increased by 7 which means addition so that is plus 7 and lastly we have is 25 which means equals 25. now our equation is m plus 7 equals 25. now solving for equations means finding the value of the variable to solve for 
,,the value of the variable we need to separate or leave it alone in one side this means that we need to get rid of the constant seven but how are we going to do that 
,,let's see our first way to get rid of our constant plus seven we need to get its opposite operation which is subtraction therefore we are going to subtract seven here there you go now always remember that whatever we do in one side we also need to do it on the other side since we subtract 7 on our left side we are going to subtract 7 on our right side there now it's time to solve so here we have seven minus seven which is zero so we can simply cancel this out that leaves us the variable f on the other side we have 25 minus seven which is 18 great job therefore the value of our variable is 18. now let's try to answer this one using our second way again 
,,our equation is m plus 7 equals 25 and for our second way we are going to get the opposite operation of our constant since we have plus seven the opposite is minus seven and the next thing that you are going to do is to move it on the other side of our equation there you go now we have m equals 25 minus 7. now let us solve 25 minus 7 is great job it's 18 and we got the same answer now for us to make sure if our answer is correct let us check to check if our answer is correct we need to substitute the value of the variable that we got into our equation there now our n service correct let's go and have another example this time we have the sum of a number and 34 is 49 so let us translate this one first into one equation we have the sum of a number and 34. the sum means addition so that is x plus 34 which is 49 so that is equals 49. our equation is x plus 34 equals 49 again we need to remember that to solve for the variable we need to separate a limit alone in one side therefore we need to get rid of our constant 34. now since it is addition we need to get its opposite which is subtraction therefore we need to subtract 34 and again we need 
,,to remember that whatever we do on one side we also need to do it on the other side so since we subtract 34 on our left side we are also going to subtract 34 on our 
,,right side there you go now let us solve so we have here 34 minus 34 which is zero so we can simply cancel this out and that leaves us the variable x on the other side we have 49 minus 34 and that is wonderful it is 15. now let's try our second way again our equation is x plus 34 equals 49. so the first thing that you need to do is to get the opposite of our constant plus 34 which is minus 34 and then move it into the other side of the equation so that gives us x equals 49 minus 34 49 minus 34 is 15 wonderful we just got the same answer now let's check for our answer let us substitute the value of the variable now our answer is current now let us move 
,,on to our next example this time we have 6 less than a number is 24. again let's translate this into one equation so first we have here 6 less than which means subtraction so that is minus 6. and next one we have a number which means missing so we can represent this by a variable let's say variable y and x1 we have is 24 which is equals 24. now let us solve again we need to get rid of our constant to leave the variable alone in one side so for our first way we have y minus six the opposite 
,,operation of minus six is plus six therefore we are going to add six here and since we add six on the left side we are going to add six also on the right side there 
,,you go now we can see here we have negative six plus six and that is zero so we can simply cancel this out and that leaves us our variable y equals 24 plus six which is 30. great job therefore the value of our variable is 30. now let's try using our second way first thing that we need to do again is to get the opposite of our constant which is negative six or minus six and the opposite of this one is plus six and the next thing that we are going to do is to move this one into the other side of the equation there we have 24 plus sixes 30 great job now let's check our answer there you go now let's have another example this time we have the difference of 
,,a number and 9 is 16. again let's translate this one first into an equation the difference of a number and 9. so this means subtraction so we have x minus 9 is 16 which is equals 16. now let us solve for the variable by getting rid of the constant now let's try our first week so we have x minus nine again we need to get the opposite of minus nine which is plus nine and we need to do it on the other side too there now let us solve so we have negative nine plus nine which is zero so let us cancel this out and that leaves us the variable x next one on the other side we have 16 plus nine and that is 25 very good now for our second way we have again our equation x minus nine equals 16. so again we need to get the opposite of minus nine which is plus nine and move it on the other side of the equation there so we have x 
,,equals 16 plus 9 which is 25 great job now let us check our answer awesome now let's have another example we have twice a number is 36 so let us translate this one first into one equation so we have twice a number which means 2 times a number so that is 2 times b or 2v which is equals 36. so again to get the value of the variable we need to separate or limit alone on one side therefore we need to get rid of the coefficient 2 but how are we going to do that let's have our first way so like we did earlier we can get rid of our coefficient or our constant value by getting it opposite operation so since this is multiplication which is 2 times b we can get 
,,rid of the coefficient 2 by division so we need to divide 2 on both sides now we have 2b divided by 2 equals 36 divided by 2. now to cancel out the coefficient that 
,,is 2 divided by 2 which is 1. so we can simply cancel this out and that leaves us the variable b while on the other side we have 36 divided by 2 which is 18 great job now let's have our second way again our equation is 2b equals 36 now to get rid of the coefficient 2 we are just simply going to move it on the other side of the equation by dividing the other side by the coefficient there you go so that gives us b equals 36 divided by 2 which is 18. great job now to check our answer let's substitute the value of the variable now our answer is correct now let's go and have another example this time we have n divided by 8 is 11. so let us translate this one first we have n divided by 8 which means n over or divided by it is equal 11. again the first thing that we need to do is to separate a little only variable on one side so this means we need to get rid of our constant which is eight but how are we going to do that so let's try our first weight we have n divided by eight equals 11. to get rid of the constant eight we are going to get its opposite operation since it is division the opposite would be multiplication so we need to multiply 8 on both sides there you go now let us solve we have 8 divided by 8 which is one so we can simply cancel this out so that leaves us the variable and equals 11 times eight which is very good 88 and that is the value of our variable now let's have our second way in our second way we are going to get the opposite operation of our constant which is eight and its opposite operation is multiplication and the next thing that we are going to do is to move it on the other side of the equation there you go now that is n equals 11 times 8 which is 88. good job now let us check our answers now our answer is correct now let's have another example this time we have twice a number decreased by three is the sum of nine and two let us translate this one first into one equation so we have first twice a number and that means two times a variable so that would be 2 times x or 2 x next one we have decreased by 3 which means subtraction so that is minus 3. and on the other side we have is the sum of 9 and 2 which is equals 9 plus 2. as you can see we have operations on both sides before we can find the value of the variable we need to simplify first anything that we can simplify on both sides so here we can simplify nine plus u which is eleven while on the underside that leaves us two x minus three now let us try to solve 
,,for the variable by getting rid of all the constants and the coefficient remember the first thing that you need to get rid of is the addition or subtraction so since we have here subtraction which is minus 3 let's remove this one first by getting its opposite operation which is plus 3 now let's add 3 also on the other side so that is 11 plus 3. now we have negative 3 plus 3 which is 0. so we can simply cancel this out and that leaves 2 x equals 11 plus 3 which is 14. now we only have one operation left which is multiplication and that is 2 times x now to get rid of the coefficient 2 we are going to get its opposite operation which is division so let us divide 2 on both sides there you go so we can cancel out 2 divided by 2 since it's equal 1 and that gives us the variable x equals 14 divided by two which is seven 
,,great job now the value of our variable is seven now let us check if our answer is correct great job now let's have another example this time we have 2 more than the quotient of n and 4 is 8. now let's translate this again into one equation so we have 2 more than which means addition and that is plus 2. and next we have the quotient of n and 4 which means division so that is n divided by 4. and lastly we have 8 which means equals 8. again the first thing that we need to get rid of to leave 
,,the variable alone on one side is addition or subtraction since here we have addition which is plus two and its opposite operation is subtraction which is minus two 
,,we are also going to do that on the other side now let us solve so we have positive two minus two so we have two minus two equals zero so let's cancel this out and that leaves us n divided by four equals eight minus two which is six now we are down to our last operation which is division to cancel out the constant 4 we are going to get its opposite operation which is multiplication so we need to multiply 4 on both sides now let us cancel out 4 divided by 4 since it's equal 1 and that leaves us the variable and equals 6 times 4 which is 24. great job now let us try to check our answer there you go now we are down on our last example this time we have a 
,,number plus the product of three and four is 28. so let's translate this one first into one equation so first we have a number plus so a number means unknown so let 
,,us represent this by a variable let us say h so that is h plus and next we have the product of three and four which means multiplication so that would be three times four and lastly we have s28 which means equals 28. now our equation is h plus the product of 3 and 4 equals 28. now first again we need to simplify anything that we could simplify on both sides since we can already simplify three times four we all know that that is twelve so now we have h plus twelve equals twenty eight let's get rid of our constant by getting its opposite operation so since it is addition or plus 12 we need to subtract 12 on both sides there you go now let us simplify so 
,,we have 12 minus 12 which is zero so let us cancel this out and that leaves us the variable h equals 28 minus 12 which is 16 and that is the value of our variable now let us check if our answer is correct great job wonderful now here are the things that you learned today you

,,hello friends this video on algebraic expressions part 1 is brought to you by exam for calm no more fear from exam topics to be covered in this lesson our introduction algebraic expressions terms like and unlike terms factors coefficients types of expressions wedding we will talk about monomial binomial trinomial and polynomial 
,,addition and subtraction of expressions and finding value of an expression using algebraic expressions now what do you think are we going to study under algebraic expressions so what what is now you are already aware of what algebra is all about now here we will specifically talk about expressions now let's look at this example 
,,let's say that you have got some number of chocolate so we didn't do not know the exact number of chocolates that you have but you have some number of chocolates and your little brother has two less than yours like we do not know the exact number of chocolates that you have all your little brother has but all we know is the number of chocolates with your little brother is 2 less than the number of chocolates with you so how would you express this fact mathematically so you can write it in a sentence saying that I have two chocolates more than my little brother but if I asked you to express the same thing using a mathematical expression or how will you 
,,explain explain express this in terms of mathematics so there we make use of algebraic expressions let's see how so we assume that since we do not know the exact number of chocolates so let's assume that you have X number of chocolates so let's see how do we do it in terms of mathematics so what we will do since we do not know the exact number of chocolates with you so let us assume that you have X number of chocolates so X is our variable so X can take any value its can be six its can be 7 X + 10 X 10 be 200 so let us assume that you have X number of chocolates so if you have X number of chocolates how many chocolates your brother will have two less than yours that means he will have X minus two so you remove two from X so what do you get with X minus 2 so what does this X minus 2 this is nothing but an algebraic expression what is this X for that matter yes it is a variable but at the same time it is also an expression so what we exactly mean by expression is it's a combination of constants variables operators like plus minus sign so this is one perfect example or easier example of expressions you can say you have a variable X you have a constant 2 you have an operator which is the minus sign so this is an example of algebraic expression let's consider another example and say that use code X and your friends code twice as you let's say this is you or let's say this is B and this is a so let's say that a is code twice as that of B so if B is 4 10 then is code 
,,20 if B is 450 then is whole hundred so basically the score of a is twice the score of B so how do we express this in terms of mathematics so let's assume that B's code X so how much would a score a would score 2x so what does this 2x this is also nothing but an algebraic expressions so these are some very simple examples of algebraic expression so with this we can now say what is an algebraic expression it is a mathematical phrase with constants variables and operators like as I told you that any algebraic expression will will have a combination of all of these however it is not compulsory that an algebraic expression must have constants variables and operators all of them it is possible that an algebraic expression does not have constants it is also possible that an algebraic expression does not have multiple operators so all those things are possible so let us look at some examples so even before we look at examples let us quickly recap water constants variables and operators so let us first talk about constant so constants are those which have fixed values that is their value remains the same for example let's talk about five point six so this is the decimal number but five point six always means five point six five point six is never equal to five point seven so this is a fixed value similarly 
,,you think of the numbers five four - one five six zero twenty thousand or even three by two which is a fraction so all of these are numbers and they have fixed values or something which is 3 by 2 will always remain three Bible so the biggest values they have constant value so they are examples of constants now let's talk about variables now variables they do not have a fixed value their values keep changing they are generally denoted by alphabets like X Y Z P Q ABC etc now why are default variables for example let's talk about X now this X let's say you have an equation like this X plus Pole is equal to 0 and you have another equation where 2x plus 2 is equal to 0 so you have these two equations now the value of x in the first equation is minus 4 because if X is minus 4 then this relation holds true whereas the value of x in the second equation is how much it is minus 1 so you see in the first equation the value of x is minus 4 whereas in the second equation the value of x is minus one so depending upon the situation value of X changes so X is a variable so we denote variable using an alphabet book and this alphabet can pick up different values depending on different situations the third one is operator so this operator includes all the operations like addition subtraction multiplication and division these all are operators now let us look at some examples of algebraic expressions so let us try to mix and expressions let's say this is one expression X plus 4 so you have a variable you have a constant you have an operator so X plus 4 is an example of algebraic expression you have something like this 3x minus 9 divided by 2 
,,so here also you have in variables constants operators so this is an example of expression something like 10x it is very simple it what is the meaning of 10x 10x is 
,,nothing but 10 multiplied by X so you have operator constant variables so you see these are all examples of algebraic expressions thank you please visit exam fee or

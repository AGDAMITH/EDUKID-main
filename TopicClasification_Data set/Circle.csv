Circle,tXhvauc2DPc,hello great 10 students today I'm here to teach you chapter 31 in your textbook that's called angles in a circle so this is another important geometry lesson first we'll look at some of the terms that we need to identify in this unit when you take a circle this is called a center so this point is the center so here when you take this length what you call that so that's less than half of a circle so we call this is minor arc then what about the other part the remaining part we say that's the major luck now we need to identify what is this anger now with this sock this is the center joining these radius you get this angle so what you call this angle so we call the angle subtended by the minor arc a be at the center so it's really important to identify the anger so this means this is the center joining the two points on the arc with that we call those our radius so when you combine those two you get this angle so what is this angle a o B so we need to identify what is a o B so we'll write down what is a OB 8 OB is the angle subtended by there my Knock this is the minor subtended by the minor arc a B add the center then what about this diagram this is the other part so this is the major so this this part is the major so what is what you call this angle so this is also a OB but we can write this is a OB 
,,reflex angle because reflex means more than 180 and less than 360 so this is a reflex angle so we have to say this is also angle subtended by the major this is major rock so we'll write down this is for this one and I'll write here this means a OB reflex angle is the angle subtended by the major arc me jock also a B major arc a 
,,B and the center then what you call this one this is the mine arc but this angle is other side on the other side so we call this remaining part of the circle so we write down angle subtended so this what you call this one ACB not at the centre here because centre is here this one is the center angle subtended by the is about my 
,,Knock ACB is the angle subtended by the minor arc a B on the remaining part of the circle on the remaining part remaining part of the circle now what about this one 
,,this one this is the major arc when you take major arc this is on the other side the remaining part so this is also same as before but only difference is about the arc this one is in major this one is in wine arc and the other one is in the major arc so how can you write down this angle this is AC B is the angle subtended by the major arc major arc a B on the remaining part of the circle so you need to identify this angle this is the angle at the center this is on the circle now we'll take 
,,these diagrams and identify what are these angles what is X can you identify X angle X is there this is my Knock angle subtended by their weight shocked by their my 
,,Knock cuz this is it my knock my knock a be at the center then what about Y what can you write about Y now you have to think about why is this suck I'll take another color I'll take red color this one is a la Doc so this is the angle subtended at the center so how can you write down why why is there right here why is the angle subtended by the minor arc bosina by the minor arc BC at the center now if I ask you what is this this whole angle e OC angle and I can write here XS what XS a o P angle another way of writing angle AOB angle Y is B Oh see angle then what about X plus y how can we write x plus y X plus y is the angle subtended by the mine arc AC 
,,at the center so I'll write down here again X plus y and write down here X plus y is there oh I can write x plus y is same as a OC angle in your C angle that's the angle subtended by the minor arc AC at the center now take this diagram identify what is a and B try to write down first what's the angle so the angle is if I say what is a a is the angle subtended by the minor Kb on the remaining part of the circle so you need to identify not at the center now so what is a angle subtended by the arc mine arc a be a business mine are a B on the remaining part remaining the circle then what is B B also same thing only difference is the letters when you are writing the angle with letters it is a PB & B means a QB but same thing same my knock on the remaining part of the circle so same thing you can write down here angle subtended by the my knock a B on the remaining part of the circle now try to identify this one x and y now this is the center so this is the angle at the center with 
,,this my Knock so if we label this is a B this is C we can write x is a Oh B angle or same thing we can write angle subtended by the minor arc AV at the center then what is y why is a CB ACB what's that the angle subtended by the minor arc a B on the remaining part of the circle now we'll see this one this diagram this one identify X Y what's X X is a I'll put a letter here P X is a P P a P B so how you write down angle subtended by the my Knock a B on the remaining part of the circle then what is y Y means b pc anger b p c angle that's also same thing what's the difference now this is minor arc bc not AV so same thing you are getting but different arc 
,,so i can write down this wall b pc angle is same as y is the angle subtended by the minor arc but ya know minor PC on the remaining part of the circle the remaining 
,,part of the circle no if I ask you what is X +5 identify X plus y is with the AC arc so you have to say angle subtended by the mine arc AC on the remaining part of the circle now here I have drawn several angles now here this one is the angle at the center so because it's these two lines attached to the center so angle subtended at the center by the mine arc what about these angles all these are other angles yeah all these other angles these angles are the angles subtended by the mine arc on the remaining remaining part of the circle then here this one both are given this is the angle subtended at the center this is the angle subtended on the remaining part of the circle so we are trying to find out a relationship between these angles in this lesson we look at example 1 the centre of the circle in the given figure is o write down the angle that is subtended by the minor arc PR so identify PR is this one minor arc PR on the remaining part of the circle so which one is that PE 
,,si R P see our angle is that in the second part the angle that is subtended at the center by the minor arc PR so this is the Minor which angle sub did subtended at the center this one this is the pre yes 1 and here what yeah go P oh now look at the next one write down the angle that is subtended by the major arc PR now I'll take a different color and show you which one is major op PR means this one this sunk the angle that is subtended by the major arc PR on the remaining part of the circle so on the remaining part means opposite side so we Challenger listen this angle so P Q R other part the angle that is subtended at the center by the major arc PR so this is the major man so which one subtended at the center this one so how can we write down this mod p o R but you have to ride out reflex angle P you are P R reflex exercise 31.1 copy the four circles in the figure given below on to your exercise book the center of each circle is denoted by oh so these are the sentence mark each of the angles indicated below first one it says an angle that is subtended on the remaining part of the circle by the minor arc in Figure a so this is figure a which one is mine arc this is my Knock but we want the angle subtended on the remaining path so which one is remaining the opposite part so we can mark any point P and then mark this angle this angle is the angle subtended on the remaining of the circle by the my Knock a B so how can you write down this angle a P B look at the next one the angle subtended at the center by the minor arc in the figure P so mine arc is this and girls subtended at the center so this one so this angle is the angle subtended at the center so we can write e OB third one an angle that is subtended on the remaining part of the circle by the major arc in Figure C so which one is 
,,made me jock this part is the major arc we want angle subtended on the remaining part remaining part is this one so we can take any point P and this angle is the angle on the remaining part so we can write a P B next one the angle subtended at the center by the major arc in Figure D so major arc is this one subtended at the center means this angle how can we write down that angle a or b reflex angle because this is a reflex angle question number two according to the figure right down for the minor arc a B so where's mine okay be identified first this one the angle subtended on the remaining part of the circle on the remaining part of the circle means opposite to that so this angle they want so we have to write down the angle so how can you write out a y be my big angle in the next one the angle subtended at the center so this is the mine arc angle subtended at the center means this one a o be angle next one write down for the major arc a B I'll take a different color now major Op means this one this is major angle subtended on the remaining part of the circle remaining part so this is the major arc remaining part is this so this angle they are talking about so what's the angle a X big next one the angle subtended at the center so we are considering the major arc now what's the angle subtended at the center we said a OB reflex angle question number three the center of the circle in the given figure is Oh the point X is on the major arc PQ so here this is minor major arc is this so X is on the major arc right down the anger that is subtended on the remaining part of the circle by the minor arc PQ so my Knock identify and we 
,,want the angle on the remaining part of the mine arc so what's the remaining part this one so this angle is the angle they want so what's the angle P X Q right on the angle that is subtended at the center by the minor arc PQ mine arc PQ is this so angle subtended at the center so they're talking about this angle P or Q and Mark 
,,any point on the minor arc PQ mine arc is this PQ and name it Y define the angle P by Q mark any point on the mine arc so I'll mark it the different color okay so here this point is y on the mine arc then I didn't define the angle P by Q P by Q angle this angle how can we define this is if you take the major arc this is the remaining part of the circle so how can we write down P y cube angle subtended so this is opposite is a major subtended by the major arc which are major R P Q on the remaining part of the on the remaining part of the circle next one fourth one right down the angle that is subtended at the center of the circle by the major arc PQ now PQ may joke is this which one is the angle subtended at the center this one so write down the anger so which and then is that P o Q but this is the reflex angle so 
,,you have to write down reflex angle question number four the center of the circle in the figure is o NIEM an angle that is subtended on the remaining part of the circle by the minor arc AC now first you need to identify the minor this is the minor arc AC angle subtended on the remaining part that means on the other side and here part of the circle so this side which circ which angle is that this is the angle so a d c anger next one write down the angle that is subtended at the center by the minor arc AC AC is the minor here angle at the center is this one e o sick next one write down an angle that is subtended on the remaining part of the circle by the major arc AC so which one is may Jacque may junk is this so we want the angle subtended on the remaining part remaining part means opposite side of the circle by the major Casey so which one is opposite side this angle a B C angle write down the angle that is subtended at the center by the major arc AC so major arc the angle subtended at the center is this month a OC anger but that's a reflex angle question number five the center of the circle in the figure is oh right down for the minor arc a B so identify the my nog this is the my Knock the angle subtended on the remaining part of the circuit subtended on the remaining part means opposite side so to this one that's this angle in a sea pig angle next one the angle subtended at the center so to this one and subtended at the center is this one 8 o P next one now you have to take the mine arc B C so I'll take another Colin ahooo BC is this one the angle subtended on the remaining part of the circle so remaining part means opposite to that which one with this this these two later so this is the angle so see a B and next one the angle subtended at the center so we are talking about this BC 
,,with BC what's the angle at the center this one see Oh B now we are trying to find out a relationship between angles angles subtended at the center and angle subtended on the other part of the remaining part of the circle now look at this diagram so this is Center will take center and this is given 40 and this is given 30 now what do you know about circles when you take the center and this one this is the radius P o or a OB are radii of the circle so what can you say about the ready radii all are equal so we can say this is equal to this one and this is equal to this one now look at the triangle this triangle is isosceles triangle two sides are equal so first you can write a o is equal to OB is equal to o P olá radii of the circle and this is given for T so we can write a P o is an isosceles triangle so if this is 40 what can you say about this Sanga this is also 40 in an isosceles triangle their angles corresponding angles to the equal sides are equal so we can write this is 40 so what can you say about this angle look at carefully AP or when you extend P your line you get this angle what you call that that's the exterior angle so a o will say this is q AO q angle is what yo q angle is the sum of these two angles exterior angle is add up to is equal to some muff opposite interior angles so we can write this one as 40 plus 30 so what's the value 70 is this one then we can do the same thing for the other side you get an isosceles triangle if this is 30 this is also 30 then 30 and 30 becomes here 30 plus 30 you get 60 so I can write B Oh Q angle is 30 plus 30 that's 60 degrees these are all because of exterior angle then what can you say about a Oh be angle what say a or B this full thing 70 plus 60 so I can write a ob angle is 70 plus 60 that's 130 what about a PB anger a PB angle is 40 plus 30 here we made it big mistake what's the value here 40 plus 40 is 80 all these eight this is 80 40 plus 40 this becomes 80 80 plus 60 you get hundred 40 and 
,,this one 40 30 30 60 other side is okay so APB APB angle is 40 plus 30 is 20 what can you say about these two angles angle subtended at the center an angle subtended on the remaining part of the circle be the same arc 1740 this is double so we can say the angle subtended at the center a OB angle is twice of AP angle subtended on the remaining part of the circle so we'll see we'll take another example l identify this take this example which one is angle subtended at the center so angle subtended and the center is this one an angle subtended on this remaining part of the circle is this one so we are trying to find out a relationship between these two so 
,,what we can do we can draw a line and extend it to up to Q we know again these two all these lengths are equal because all are radii this is an isosceles triangle this is 20 this is 20 and this is 50 this is 50 then again we can write 50 plus 50 is hundred here 20 plus 20 you get 40 here then what can you say about a PB and a PB that means the whole thing 50 plus 20 what's the value you get 70 degrees now think about a OB angle AOB angle is 100 plus 40 so you get hundred 40 now look at the 
,,relationship what can you say 70 and 100 40 70 times 2 so we can write a ob anger is equal to twice of a pee-pee and top twice off a PB anger now look at this again 
,,you have given this is 40 this is 35 so we'll draw a line and extend this to Q same theory these all are equal because of radii this is 40 this is 40 because of isosceles triangle this is 35 this is 35 because these isosceles triangle now 40 and 40 here this angle becomes 80 exterior angle is equal to the sum of opposite interior angles what about this one 35 and 35 you get 70 again same thing exterior angle is equal to the sum of opposite interior angles then what can you say about a OB angle is 80 plus 70 that's hundred fifty degrees then what about a PB anger a PB angle is 40 plus 35 so what's that 75 look at these two 75 times 2 is 150 so we can write a OB angle is twice of a P B angle so we took three examples to see what type of relation ship is there with these angles now we'll take this the theorem now we'll take a general mon-sol without giving numbers we can take x and y now what happens this is general case this is also this is the angle subtended at the center and this is the angle subtended on the remaining part of the circle a o is same as OB is same as Opie what's the reason all these are radii of the circle then if this is X this is also X this is if this is why this is why why because of isosceles triangle we can write ap Oh AP Oh triangle is an isosceles triangle then what can you 
,,say about will take this one q 8 oq e o q is same as X annex X plus X what's the reason some of the interior angles equals to the exterior and so we can write this is because of exterior and then you get 2x so this is 2x then what about q OB angle Y plus y that's also same reason exterior angle is equal to the sum of opposite interior angles that's to Y then what can you say about the full thing a Oh B anger you can say a ob angle is 2x plus 2y I can take 2 out from the from both of these terms X plus y what is X plus 5 X plus y is a which changa AP be angle so I can write Y be angle is twice of e P be angle so when you take general value also you get 
,,a relationship the angle subtended at the center is twice as the angle subtended on the remaining part of the circle so we'll take that one as a theorem so theorem number one is the angle subtended by an arc you take a B by an arc at the center so this angle is twice the angle subtended by the same arc on the remaining part of the circle so same mark on the remaining part of the circle is this one I take P so this one if if I take this one Oh a OB angle is twice of two times AP bien so we'll try to prove this will try to prove this so what you know what you know a B P points on the circle a BP points on the circle and we know o is the center of the circle so what you need to prove to be proved a OB is twice of a P P anger so we need a construction so what you need we need to draw P or line and extend to Q draw P o line and extend to Q point then we can it's not to prove that so what is the first thing we can say these all these men's are equal e Oh be your pee all are equal because of radii of a circle then when you take P o a or AP Oh triangle is an isosceles triangle so this is equal to this one so I can write apo is an isosceles triangle so a P or angle this angle is equal to this angle a PA o anger AP o AP o angle is equal to oay AP because of Isis racetrack then what is this one this one so we 
,,will put X here X X X then you get 8o q angle is this Plus this so ap Oh angle plus o in AP angle that is 2 X same angle then again you can write the same thing for 
,,the other triangle hey what is the other angle except a we can put me same thing with the BP Oh triangle is an isosceles triangle so that's y equals we put Y here is y so you can write o PB o P being angle is equal to OB P and that's why then this one BOQ angle b oq angle is some of the these two answers Oh PB angle + OB p angle that's to Y now we can add these two this is the first one this is the second one because we need to add these two to get to get this big angle so this means this these two and this means we have to add these two angles so we can write down when you add one and two when you add one and two what do you see a or q + q OB angle is a Oh angle that's equal to 2x + 2 y 2x + y I can take two out so 2 times X plus y X plus y is same as AP being you know be angle is equal to double of APB and basically that means the angle subtended at the center is equal to the equal to double twice off the angle subtended on the remaining part of the circle by the same arc now we'll look at example number one the center of the circle in the given figure is o using the information in the figure find P Q R whereas P Q R is this angle so what you can do now you have to remember the theorem number one so this is if you take R Q as the mine arc this is the angle subtended on the remaining part of the circle and this is the angle subtended at the center so what can you say about Q o our angle that's double of 50 because according to the theorem number what so theorem number one is the reason then we found this is 100 this is 15 and also we know this is equal to this because of radii o Q is same as o are because of radii of the 
,,same circle so if we know this is 100 and put X here X here because this is an isosceles triangle you can find X so we'll do that to X plus hundred is equal to Andre need some of angles in a triangle sum of angles in a triangle so solve this 2x equals 180 minus 100 means 80 X equals divide by 2 you get 40 X is 40 so we know this is 40 this is 15 this is 50 and we need this angle this whole thing not X exists the small amount so how can we write down the other angle we can think about o PR triangle when you take OPR triangle we can see 50 plus 15 plus 40 plus PQ our angle is equal to 180 sum of angles in a triangle then add together you get 5 here 4 5 5 10 105 plus PQ R equals 180 so what is P QR hundred eighty minus hundred five you get 75 degrees for the required angle exercise thirty one point to the center of each of the circle given below is o find the values of X based on the given data so this is the angle subtended at the center 100 this is the angle subtended on the remaining part of the circle so what's the relationship this excess half of it half this one other way around this is double so 2x is equal to hundred x equals one hundred divided by two so straight away we can write hundred divided by two that's 50 degrees look at the other one X is now the angle at the center subtended at the center this is the angle subtended the remaining part of the circle so what's the relationship X is equal to double Kirti so double of 30 is 60 degrees next one if you take this one this arc what is X remaining part the angle subtended on the remaining part of the circle and this is the angle subtended at the center so what can you say about X 2 X is equal to 50 so what is X divided by 250 divided by 2 you get 25 decrease now let's take this one now here this is the minor arc and this is the a duck so this is the angle subtended on the remaining part of the circle by the major so you need the angle subtended at the center for the major arc this angle so what is this angle 360 minus 50 you get 310 so this is 310 so what is this one what's the relationship between this and this this is half of this so x equals three 
,,hundred and ten divided by two so you get hundred fifty-five look at this one when you take this 80 this is the angle subtended by this sock so this is the same triangle so what's the relationship if this is 80 this is 160 but X is other one so X is with the odd duck so you need this value so what is this value 360 minus hundred 60 you get 200 so this is 200 now we can find out the relationship between xn 200 so you have to divide by 2x is equal to 200 divided by 2 that's 100 degrees next one look at carefully with this arc this is 70 that's the angle subtended at the center now look at carefully this diagram o is the center this is equal to this one is an isosceles triangle this length is equal to this length radii of the circle so if this is X this is also X then Savitch a either exterior angle we can write x plus x equals 72 x equals 70 means x equals 70 divided by 2 that's 35 degrees question number two the center of each of the following circles is denoted by Oh providing reasons find the value of y based on their given data so we have to give the reasons as well so when you take the minor arc PR this is the angle subtended at the center this is the angle subtended at the on the circumference or on the remaining part of the circle so what's the relationship we can write Y is equal to 100 divided by 2 that's 50 according to the theorem number 1 angle subtended at the center is twice as angle subtended on the remaining part of the remaining part of circle that's that look at carefully this one this arc is here line is passing through the center that's the diameter given and we know all these lengths are not this one so 
,,here all these three lengths are equal so if this is why this is why isosceles triangle so we first we can write Oh a/c angle is why because of what's the reason Oh 
,,AC is an isosceles triangle then look at this one the exterior angle is 90 now so the sum of opposite interior angles add up to the interior angle y plus y equals 92 I equals 90 why is 90 divided by 2 that's 45 so what's the reason exterior angle is sum of opposite interior angles now look at the next one it's given ABC ABC is 70 so this is 70 given and ACB ACB is 60 so what can you say about this angle B is C rangel is 180 minus this show got sum of angles in a triangle is 180 so 70 plus 60 so when you subtract from 180 you get 50 degrees so this is 50 so here what's the result angle sum sum of angles in a triangle now we know this is 50 so what is y 
,,y is double of that 50 times 2 you get 100 degrees according to theorem 1 next part why is this one so here look at carefully this length is equal to this length and also it's equal to this one so you get isosceles triangle this is 20 this is 20 this is 30 this is 30 so now you can easily find out why so you have to first write 
,,down CB o anger is 20 and a B oh and ER is 30 both because of an isosceles triangle then we know this angle is b/c angle is 30 plus 20 get 50 degrees if this is 50 so what is the Y value y is double of 50 you get 100 degrees the reason is theorem number one the angle subtended at the center is twice as the angle subtended on the remaining part of the circle look at the other one when you take the major arc PR so we can find out this angle because this handle is given hundred check so Pio our reflex angle is half of double of 110 110 times to 220 so if that is 220 what's why subtract from 360 you get 140 degree so why this is anger at us point angle at 
,,a point is 360 that's why we subtracted that value by 360 next one why is here we can find out if this is 30 this is 30 because isosceles triangle all the sides are 
,,equal now if this is y this is y then 30 plus y is the angle subtended on the remaining part of the circle that's equal to half of hundred tip so half of hundred and ten is fifty five so 30 plus y is fifty five y is equal to 55 minus 30 you get 25 decrease now look at this question here in this question here we know this is equal to this one and also what can you say about B OC angles that's double of 70 because of theorem number one so this is hundred forty now when you draw connect this one with a line what's this angle these two are equal so you can find out that angle will put X here 2x plus 140 is equal to 180 sum of angles in a triangle x equals 
,,180 minus 140 40 divided by 2 so you get 20 degrees for X naught think about the whole triangle ABC triangle we can write 70 Plus this is y plus 20 and this is also 
,,y plus 20 so these two sides are equal I so series triangle that's equal to 180 sum of angles in a triangle 70 plus 20 1990 plus twenty hundred ten so 2y equals 180 
,,minus hundred ten that's 70 degrees so y equals 70 divided by two you get 35 degrees next one look at carefully the diagram here this side is equal to this side we know in this isosceles triangle this is 50 so if this is 50 this is 50 we can find out this angle because angle sum of a triangle is 180 so we can write Q o our angle is 180 minus 150 plus 50 you get 80 degrees here now this is the angle subtended at the center this is the angle subtended on the remaining part of the circle so what's the relationship between y and 80 y is equal to 80 divided by 2 so if you get 40 degrees next one when you take the my Knock this is the angle subtended at the 
,,center and we can find out this and be a see hanger is 130 divided by 2 sixty-five because of theorem number one if we know this is 65 so this is a straight angle so y plus 65 is 180 because of straight angle so Y becomes 180 minus 65 you get hundred fifteen degrees example number one the points a B and C lie on the circle of center Oh if ACB ABC equals a OB show that AC equals a B so we will take a diagram you take a circle and here o is the center and ABC on the circle II we did see ACB a CB ABC ABC when you add it a OB you say show that a C equals a B these two sides are equal now we'll see when you take this triangle we can say a OB this angle is twice of a CB and according to theorem number one yeah in this question this is given again a OB is given as a CB plus ABC it's given take this one as first one and this is second one these two are equal one equals to two so we can try to AC B equals a CB plus a B C now can you see same angle so I can take this one to this side two-way CB angle minus ACB angle is equal to ABC so two minus one means this is ACB anger that's equal to a b c ACB angle is equal to a pc this one so what can you say about this triangle so therefore ABC either is an isosceles triangle because two sides are two angles are equal if corresponding angles are equal the opposite sides of these corresponding angles also equal so we can say is see opposite to this angle is a sea opposite to this one is a B so AC is equal to a exercise 31.3 the points a b and c lie on a circle of center Oh if Oh B equals a be sure that ACB is 30 a C V this one is 30 now look at carefully this is given OB is equal to a B but we know this is also equal to this one radii OB is equal to AU a that's radii of the same circle that means a b is equal to AU a equals to OB all sides are equal so you get an equilateral triangle then what is this sangha in an equilateral triangle one angle is 60 degrees 8o v angle is 60 degrees if that is 60 we can straight to be find out ACB angle is half of 60 that's 30 degrees question number 2 PQ R and S sub points on on a circle prove that PQ R plus PS are is equal to 180 so we'll take this one what can you say about PS r and PS our angle is half of P you are because of theorem number one yeah I'll put X here then this is 2x oh I can write 2x here then what else I can say then what is this angle this is 180 minus 2x and this angle I can write down another relationship so what is P o P Q R angle P Q R angle is P Q R this angle is half of P o qi r reflex now when you add these two together so here i'll write with numbers letters PS r i to cast X this is X and this is to X 
,,so you get X here this one half of P o R so here this one I can write P o R P o r reflex angle is 360 minus 2x so half of 360 minus 2x I can simplify and write 180 minus X so what's peak you are angle PQR angle is half of that now we'll add these two 1 and this is 2 1 plus 2 what you get 1 plus 2 is P is our angle plus PQ our angle is X plus 180 minus X xx get canceled out you get hundred eighty degrees question number three a B C and D are points on a circle of sento if a OC AOC is equal to ABC these two angles are equal sure that a DC angle is 60 so in DC angle we have to find out so what can we write down about ad C angle I can write down a d.c angle is half of you know CN because according to theorem number one then what can you say about this angle and this one ABC angle is equal to half off this end this is 
,,equal to 360 minus a or C angle I'll put letters if I take this size X this is 2x so what is this one 360 minus 2x so when you divide by 2 and substitute 360 minus 2x when take two out and divide by 2 you get 180 minus X that's a B C angle what is a OC angle both are equal so I can plug this value here so a DC angle is equal to 
,,that's x value is equal to half of hundred this value is same as AOC you will see same as ABC so I can write this is half of 180 minus X that's equal to X now solve 
,,the equation multiply by 2 I get 1 ran 80 minus X is equal to 2 times X 2x then take minus X to this side 3x equals 180 divided by 300 80 divided by 3 you get 60 degrees so X is 60 degrees so X means ADC anger question number 4 PQ n are our points on the circumference of the circle of sento if opq o p q is equal to AU r qu o RQ 
,,these two angles are equal we'll put X here and this is X show that P o our angle this angle is equal to 4 times o RQ o our Q so for X you have to show that this is 
,,for X so joint or and cube oh and Q joint thank you ok we'll join these two so what can you say if this is X this is also X and this is given so this is also X so what is this enter P o our angle is twice of this so twice off P Q R that means 2 times P Q R is 2x so 2 times 2x is 4x so 4 times X you can write down in terms of o R Q so P o R is equal to four x over R Q so you have to write down the reason so here this is twice of this P o R is twice of this is because of theorem number one and here why this is 2x because of isosceles triangle you have to write down separately this is because of isosceles triangle and then again when you multiply this one you get 4x question number 5 the points a B and C lie on a circle of Center sure that AOC angle is twice off your C angle is twice of B AC b a c plus CB c a b c these two connection between these two so will first look at carefully what is e OC anger you know see anger is a OB plus B or C cos B plus B you see but what can you say about a OB angle AOB angle is the angle subtended at the center that's what's the relationship between AC B angle so that angle is twice of a be twice of ACB anger twice of this angle is twice of this angle then what can you say about these to be your C angle B you see angle is twice of this angle be a C and now look at carefully we can plug these two two and three in equation one take the equation one and plug these values over what is a OC angle AOC angle is twice of AC B plus twice of B AC so when you take 2 out from this equation we get so BAC BAC angle is there plus BC a ACB is same as we see you know C equal to this one now we'll try to find out the relationship between the angles in the same segment what is segment means now earlier we discussed about arcs major arc L my Knock now about segment so when you look take the circle divided by a chord we call these are segments so this is called the smaller part we call - segment big part we call major segment look at this diagram so this part is minor segment this is major segment so this angle is in the major segment so we can write a xB is the angle in the major segment then when 
,,you take the this life a be here this is major Sigma so all these angers we can say angles in the major segments so angles in the same segment so we can drive a p b 
,,AQ b angle and 8r b ola angles in the same segment those are in major segments this one at the Vera so this is minus Sigma small amount minus segment so these are angles in the - segment so we can say a KB a lb a MB angles are angles in - segments are same segment so you need to identify what are the angles in the same segment now we will try to find out a relationship look at this diagram so this is a B when you take this part is this - segment this whole big part is the major segment so what are the angles in the major segment this angle but we will try to find out a relationship this is the angle subtended by the minor arc on the remaining part of the circle that's equal to try half of the angle subtended at the center so if this is 80 what can you write about a QB anger 80 divided by two that's 40 degrees because of theorem number one now look at this angle this is this angle also the angle subtended on the remaining part of the circle by the my Knock so same arc so we can write ap B is 8 divided by 2 that's also 14 what about our anger a our B angle this is also same thing this is the angle sub the center always half of that so 80 divided by 2 now what can you say about same segment angles we got all our same value so here we see when you take an example we see all these same segment angles are equal so this is your second theorem so theorem number 2 the angles in the same segment of a circle are equal so we'll try to prove that so it says if this is a B is the chord you take this angle and another one here this is au plus P this is Q so a OB egg so what first I can write a Q B angle is equal to half of e o b angle because of theorem number one then I can write ap B angle a PB angle is half of you then from this one one and two Bota equal 1 equals to 2 so therefore AQ b angle is 
,,equal to AP b and so those are the and in the same segment so we can see angle in the same segment of a circle are equal example number one find the magnitude of BD 
,,c v d c this one using the information in the figure look at carefully how we identify same segment angles so think about before I do this one if you take any two points on the circle okay so here keep your fingers like this and here if you draw another point angle like this how can we identify same segment angles here look at carefully it goes here up down here you can go to another direction here you can go to the other direction with same fingers you can do that two fingers here goes down so here this one is one angle this is another one this is the other one so look at carefully and see what our same segment angles now look at these two points here one angle and the other angle is this so here this end these two are equal look at the diagram this is 100 and these two lengths are equal so what can you say about this angle if this is X this is also X so we can write 2x plus hundred is 180 then what is X - x equals 80 180 minus hundred x equals 80 divided by two that's forty degrees so this is 40 degrees so we found this is 40 but we know these two angles are the same segment angles so we can write B s-see is equal to VDC angle same segment angles so if these two are equal that means what is the value of the DC angle VDC angle is same as we see that's equal to 40 degrees exercise 31.4 find the value of x in the following exercises look at carefully this one so if this is X this is X what's the reason VDC angle is X because same segment angles if this is X this is also X I so sillies triangle because these two sides are equal so we can form an equation 2x plus this is given 110 so 2x plus 110 equals 180 2x equals 180 minus hundred 10 you get 70 so x equals 70 divided by 2 that's 35 degrees now look at this one same segment angles are equal so here when you take this if this is 40 this is 40 and this is 30 but here you can get a triangle so you can find X 30 plus 40 plus X equals 180 70 plus X equals 180 so what's the x value I'm gran 80 minus 70 
,,so hundred 10 next one a B equals AC a B equals AC these students are equal given so if this is 50 this whole thing is 50 then look at carefully this is same segment angles this is X then this is also X so what is X look at this ABC triangle X plus 50 plus 50 is 180 sum of angles in a triangle X plus 100 equals 180 so what is X 
,,hundred eighty minus hundred you get eighty degrees this one these lengths are equal when you take BC arc my Knock this is the angle no you have not given the center so this is not the angle at the center so we have to look at another way but we know if this is this is X same segment angles then if this is X this is also X here 
,,these two lengths are equal now we can see X and X becomes hundred X plus X because the exterior angles add up to other sum of opposite interior angles now we can form a common equation X plus x equals hundred ten 2x equals hundred change X equal a sub n divided by 2 that's equal to 55 this question you get carefully when you take this way these two angles I call same segment angles is this 70 then look at carefully if this is 70 this is 70 isosceles triangle so what is X X is sum of 70 and 70 so X is equal to 70 plus 70 that's 140 so you can write down because of exterior next one X is the full thing if this is 70 this is also 70 look at ABC triangle 
,,this length is equal to this length so isosceles triangle so you get this one is 70 now you can find out X when you take ABC triangle seventy plus seventy plus x equals 180 140 plus x equals 180 so what is X 180 minus 140 you get 40 degrees this question if this is 120 what is this angle 180 minus 120 that's 60 that's C B P angle this is 60 so same segment angles are equal so this is 60 again see II D angle CED angle is 60 same segment angles theorem number two if this is 60 what is X sum of X and 60 is equal to hundred eighty straight angle then X equals 180 minus 60 you get hundred twenty this one this handle is 50 so this is 50 same segment angles are equal so if this is 50 what is X 180 minus 50 so we can write B AC angle is 50 because of same segment angles then if this is 50 you can write X plus 50 is equal 
,,to 180 because of a straight angle then what is X I've an 80 minus 50 you get hundred 30 degrees now look at this one here this is 70 given what can you say about this anger b.a.p anger this is also 70 same segment angles are equal now X is given the whole thing so what can you say about X X is equal to seventy plus thirty what's the reason exterior angle is equal to sum of interior angles the value X is 100 example number one prove that AC is equal to BD is equal to BD using the information in the figure C is equal to BD now look at carefully here these two lines are parallel so we can say this angle is equal to this angle alternate angle so you guys 
,,will write a B D angle it's same as BD c anger and other way around this angle is equal to this angle be a C angle is equal to AC D anger because of alternate angles but can you see if you take these two angles are equal because same segment angles same segment angles are equal we can write a b d angle is equal to Acy dangle same segment angles are equal now if we want to show that AC equals BD this length is equal to this length we have to show that this length is equal to this length this length is equal to this net so how can we show that we know so this is equal to this one so if this is X this is X but this is X this is also X because of alternate angles so from this we can say a xB triangle is an isosceles triangle these two angles are equal so if these two are equal we can say a X is equal to xB then when you take the small one this is equal to X as well as this is also equal to X because of same segment angles so when you think XD see triangle is also an isosceles triangle so I can write I write XC first XC in this triangle XC is equal to XD so this is 1 this is 2 so when you add 1 & 2 what you get a X plus XC is equal to X B plus XT or BX plus XD I get when you add these two together I get X plus XC ax ax plus XC is AC B X plus X D becomes BD so you get AC is equal to BD exercise 31.5 if a 
,,b is parallel to DC now here you have to show a DC angle is equal to BC the angle will take this one if I take this one is a ad B angle ADB angle is same as this angle a/c bien because same segment angles then if I take B DC angle this angle is same as this angle same segment angles b a b a c angle that's also same segment angles but I know these two are parallel so if this is B this is also so I can write instead of BAC BAC angle is same as a CD angle these two because of alternate now if 
,,I add this and this and replace with this one what can I say ad B angle ADB plus VDC one plus two I'm getting AC B plus B AC but instead of BAC I can write a CD you 
,,see I can write a CD so instead of that I can't like a CD so what is ACB ACB and a CD I am getting BC T anger so this side I am getting v CD angle what about this side a DB plus B DC I get ad C angle so these two are equal question number two if px is equal to XQ or QX show that PQ is parallel to SR okay so here when you take this segment so these two angles are equal if this is a this is a I can write Q P our angle is same as Q is our angle same segment angles then if I take this triangle 
,,isosceles triangle these two I equal this is also a so P Q s angle is equal to this is all are younger this is also a because of isosceles triangle isosceles triangle now this is equal to this because of same segment anger so I can write PQ s angle is same as P R s angle same segment angles no what can you say about we see these two are the same so therefore Q P our angle is same as P R s angle from these two we can write down this so that means these are alternate angles alternate angles are equal alternate angles are equal means the two lines are parallel so PQ therefore P Q is parallel to SR question number three if ad is parallel to BC these two lines show that ax is equal to D X these two now look at the diagram if these two are parallel if this is a this is a so you can write a D be angled is same as DBC angle that's it and also this angle DBC angle is same as this angle D a/c AG what's the reason so this is alternate angles and this is same segment angle now what can you say about this so therefore ad a/d C angle this one so can you see these two are equal when you take a XD triangle what can you say a angle is equal to t angle so that's an isosceles triangle therefore X should be equal to XT because these two sides should be equal a X should be equal to DX because of isosceles triangle question number 4 show that a XC a X C angle is equal to a by B a my now we'll take a litter here what is if we put a here B X C angle is C mass B by C angle the same segment angles are equal C segment angles are equal then if these two are equal then subtract from 180 both angles B X C 180 minus b YC I'm subtracting from 180 so what am I getting 180 minus this is same as a X C 180 minus bx e is a x c 180 minus B by C is same as a by B we can see these two are equal question number five if b PQ 
,,b p q angle is equal to b RQ b r q angle this angle sure that be e ve is the b e is the bisector of AE c that means we have to show that these two angles are equal that's the truth now how can we do that will take letters now we can see when you take same segment angles are equal so this is if we put a this is a and this is also a same segment angles are equal then if this is B this is also B because of the given information and this is also V so what is this angle this angle is 180 minus a plus B then when you take this whole triangle this is a this is B what is this angle 180 minus a plus B so you get same angle so this is the bisector so we will write down first you have to write down these angles e a D and the same as e b d angle is same as e CD anger is equal to a same segment angles then you have given b PQ 
,,angle is same as B R Q angle we put B later that's given and this is also equal to you can write out this is given first you write down this is given and we can write down v PQ is same as AP younger opposite angles are equal and also and also we can say you know first I'll write down this is opposite angles are equal now you can say when you consider a p/e triangle what is a II Bianca a EB angle is 180 minus a plus B and these two and subtract from 180 that's one then when you take B II are triangle B II are triangle we can say B II C angle is also 180 minus a plus B so that's second from one and two both are equal so therefore we can say a B angle is 
,,equal to PE c angle so these two are equal means bisector so therefore we can write down therefore b e is the by sector by sector of AE c and question number six if 
,,a B equals a see you soon in cycle show that C D X C D X nice angle is double off twice off a b c a b c we have to show that double of this okay so will first take if this is a these two lengths i call this is a isosceles triangle then if you take this one so here if you take these two points so this angle if this is X this is also X same segment angles are equal then what about this angle this angle becomes a minus X this is a minus 6 this is a and X when you add it together you get this angle so what is that a minus X plus a plus X minus X plus is plus 6 get cancel out you get 2 a so this becomes 2 a so we get double of this one so we will have to write down all steps ABC angle is same as a C V angle that's a isosceles triangle then a B D angle is same as ECD angle that's X same segment angles then what about DBC and DBC angle is a minus X then what is BCD angle BCD angle is a plus X when you add these two 1 plus 2 you get CD X angle C D X angle is equal to a minus 6 plus E Plus X X get cancel out you get 2 e so 2 times a instead of a I can write a b c so c DX is a equal to 2 times ABC question number 7 if XB is equal to XC these two lengths are given equal show that AC AC is equal to BD so will take AC X triangle and B D X triangle we know that this sandal is equal to this side why what's the reason same segment angles are equal so I can write see a example is same as B D X angle that's a same segment equal and this angle is common for both triangles a XD angle is common and also it's given if you take this triangle C X is equal to B X that's given so when you look at these three two angles and one length so these two triangles are congruent so if the two triangles are congruent corresponding elements are also equal so opposite to this one is AC opposite to this one for this triangle is beating so easy should be equal to BD because of corresponding elements are equal here what's the reason these to convert angle-angle-side to angle then one side equal question number 8 if X s X s is equal to X are these two lengths are equal show that X P is equal to XQ X P is equal to so we have to show that these two ah equal now we'll do using angles if these two are equal this is these two are equal then if this is say this is also a same segment angles are equal and if you take 
,,other way around this is this should be a now when you take this triangle these two are equal then P X or X P should be equal to XQ so that's what you have to fine so we'll do that so we can write x s r XS r is equal to XR s girl that's a because of isosceles triangle but we know is our X or XR s is same as P Q exact same Figment angles I then from these two we can say X SR is equal to PQ X these two are equal therefore PQ s ez is an isosceles triangle so if these two I so see let's try the triangle is isosceles triangle we can say corresponding sides are equal P X is equal to X cube I can write X P as well so X P is equal to X cube now we look at the 
,,relationship between angles in a semicircle what is semicircle means when you divide the circle into two equal parts so that means this is the diameter so we call equally divided semicircle so one part so this part we call semicircle now we are trying to find out the angles in the semicircle so this is the angle in the semicircle here this is the angle in the other semicircle so here what are the angles here we can identify a Cuby angle and AP be APB angles are angles in a semicircle now we'll see if this is the diameter this is a straight line so what is the this angle 180 so that's the angle subtended at the center if you take this a be arc this is the angle subtended at the center then what about this one this is the angle subtended on the other side of the circle remaining part of the circle so what's the relationship but we found out according to theorem number one this is half of that so if this is hundred and eighty what should be this angle 180 divided by two that's 90 degree so that's a theorem so we are now taking this one as 90 degrees angles in a semicircle is always 90 degrees so we'll take that theorem now that's theorem number three an angle in a semicircle is a right angle that means 90 degree so take a diameter and this is a B and this is we take P and here you have to take a OB angle so how can we prove that what is a OB angle is equal to 180 because it's a straight angle but we know a OB is double of a pee-pee anger what's the theorem theorem number one theorem number one says angle subtended at the center is twice is equal to twice the angle subtended on the remaining part of the circle so according to 
,,this 1 1 & 2 what can you say about these 2 1 & 2 both are equal you can say 180 equals 2 APB so what is APB 180 divided by 2 so that's 90 degree so all these angle 
,,in a semi-circle is 90 degrees example number 1 PQ is a diameter of the circle p q r s PQ is the diameter of the circle PQRS if QP r q PR this is given 20 and PS equals q r PS is equal to q r find the magnitude of r PS that means this should be an r PS and our p s angle so we need this angle so this is a semicircle so what can you say about this angle this is 90 degrees and this is also 90 degrees so first thing you can write down p SQ it's same as p RQ that's 90 degrees according to theorem three angle in a semi-circle angle in a semicircle it's 90 degrees then if we know this is 20 so what is this angle this angle is 90 minus 20 that's 70 if this is 
,,70 how can we find out this angle now we'll take P R Q triangle and P s Q triangle what can you say about these triangle we know P s equals P s equals R Q that's given these two lengths are equal and this is a right angle triangle so you get P R Q we found out this is 90 degree so you don't need to write it again and also PQ is 
,,common left so what can you say about these three this is a right triangle triangle and this is the hypotenuse and one side equal so therefore these two triangles are PR q triangle is congruent to PS q triangle what's the situation right angle triangle hypotenuse side RHS so we found out these two are equal that means this angle if you take with another color opposite to this side is this angle is equal to opposite to this one so this angle so this is visa equal so therefore I'll put this is X so X plus 20 is equal to 70 degrees X plus 20 is 70 degrees so what is X x equals 70 minus 20 so 70 minus 20 is 50 degrees so X is the angle our pili yes so that's the angle we want our P so that's 50 degrees exercise 31.6 the center of each of the following circles is denoted by Oh find the value of X based on the data in the field so we can see this is the diameter and this is 90 according to theorem number three angle in a semi-circle is 90 degrees if this is 90 what can you say about this chart triangle the T plus 90 plus X is 180 angle sum of a triangle is 180 so 90 plus 3 30 is 120 plus X is 180 so x equals 180 minus hundred 20 that's 60 degrees this one again semicircle semicircle means this is 90 degree angle inner semicircle and also these two sides are equal means this is X isosceles triangle now angle sum X plus X plus 90 is 180 angle sum of a triangle is 180 2x plus 90 is 180 so 2x equals 180 minus 90 means 90 what is X 90 divide by 2 you get 45 degrees look at this one this is also diameter so this angle is 90 degrees if this is 90 what is this one what is this handle will put X here X plus 60 plus 90 equals 180 so X plus 150 equals 180 so what is X hundred eighty minus 150 that's 30 degrees now look at carefully this big triangle if this is X this is also X here I need to use different letters because X is already there so we'll take a different letter I take all wise this is y so I found why not X now I this is why this is also why because of isosceles triangle now I can find out X here this is 90 this is 90 when you take this triangle 90 plus X plus y equals 180 now plug the Y value Y we found out 30 120 plus x equals 180 so what is X 180 minus 120 that's equal to 60 so x equals 60 degrees question number 4 look at carefully if this is X this is also X same segment angles are equal then this is the time eater passing through the center so this angle is 90 degrees angle inna semicircle now you can think about this triangle ADB 
,,X plus 50 plus 90 equals 180 X plus 140 equals 180 so what is X 180 minus 40 you get 40 decrease look at this one this whole thing is given X so this is a diameter this is 90 this is 90 angles in a semicircle is equal to 90 degrees now you can use there's some coordinate angles in a quadrilateral sum of angles in a quadrilateral X plus 90 plus 90 plus hard 10 is equal to what's the sum of sum of angles in a carbonara 360 so X plus you get under any eighty 180 and hundred and ten you get two hundred ninety is equal to 360 so x equals 360 minus 298 so you get 70 degrees as example number one PQ is a diameter of the circle p q r s the chord RS this one has been produced 2x prove that r PQ r p q + p sx p s XPS x is this one when you add these two that's 90 degrees so what's the first step we can think of can you see this is a time eternal so this angle is 90 degrees and also this angle is 90 degrees so we have to first write down p SQ angle is equal to p r q angle is equal to 90 
,,degrees angles in a semicircle is right angles that's 90 degrees then if this is a this is also a same segments angles are equal and if this is b this is equal to be same segment angles are equal then what can we say if you take this slide 90 plus so how can you find out this angle this Plus this Plus this is 180 and how can we 
,,find out this angle this is B so when you add those two we'll see whether we are getting 90 degrees so we can write down the next step is we can write down it's Q P 
,,angle is same as is our P angle that's a and our sq angle is same as QP our angle that's B same segment angles theorem number one now how can we find out X s s p or 
,,p sx p sx is equal to or p sx + 90 + b value is equal to 180 so what is P is X subtract you get 180 minus 90 minus B so you get 90 minus B that's first one so what is our P Q angle are PQ angle that's B we found that same segment angles are equal when you add these two when you add these two one and two but you get one plus two 
,,you get r PQ + p sx and is 90 minus b plus B we get cancel out you are getting 90 degrees example number two the Centers of the given two circles are X&Y these are the two center centers prove that AE b AE b angle is equal to c e d c e TN these two are equal so here when you take this circle what is this angle this is 90 when you take this circle this is 90 so can you see when you subtract the middle angle you get the same value so we will first write down a be a EC and not be a C angle is 
,,90 degrees that's okay equal to b e d angle be easy and of course angle in a semi-circle then yes we can subtract B EC angle from both sides 1 minus 2 what you get V ad angle minus B EC egg be e t angles B EC angle you get CED angle c e D angle in other side ie see a girl - B seeing what you get a C ie C angle minus B EC and you get a e P anger so that's what we need to prove a B angle is equal to C e TN exercise 31.7 AC is a diameter of the circle ABCD show that BA D be AD this angle plus 
,,BC D we see D angle is 180 we know that if this is the diameter this is 90 this is 90 then we can write out the sum of angles in a quadrilateral is 360 and you can find out the other two so first you can write a DC angle is equal same as a B C angle that's 90 degrees and girls in a semicircle then if you take the quadrilateral e BC D contralateral we know that sum of angles in a quadrilateral add up to 360 so I can write B ad plus BC D plus 90 plus 90 is equal to 360 sum of angles contralateral then these two becomes hundred eighty when you subtract hundred eight from 360 but you get you get hundred eighty so we get we ad plus BC D is equal to a grant 
,,eighty question number two PR is a diameter of the circle p q r s if PQ is equal to s r RS sure that PQ R is a rectangle so here opposite side if it's a rectangle opposite sides are equal so we need to show that this side is equal to this side but we know this is the diameter this is 90 degrees so we can take P SR triangle and PQ are triangle so P s r is equal to PQ R that's 90 degrees because of angles in a semi-circle and P R is common and PQ is equal to si that's given so when you look at this right angle triangle hypotenuse and one side equal so these two are congruent BS our triangle is congruent to PQ our triangle what's the situation right angle triangle hypotenuse side so therefore what can you say about the corresponding elements corresponding elements are equal so here we can say opposite to this one and opposite to this one these two lengths are equal so our Q is equal to PS and also we can see this is not in - this is 90 so these also we can prove that from the congruent this is equal this one is equal to this one and here alternate angles equal means parallel as well opposite sides parallel and also this is 90 degrees so when you take this one this length this angle is equal to this angle opposite to this one is this angle and also when you take this one this angle is equal to this angle so you can prove that this is also 90 and 90 because when you take this one the triangle 90 Plus this Plus this is equal 280 so this one plus this one is 90 degrees so you can prove that will write down that also when you take I'll take this is a this is B we can show that this is B this is a B plus a plus 90 degrees is equal 
,,to 180 so a plus B is also 90 degree so each angle a plus B is 90 and opposite sides are equal so therefore PQRS is a rectangle question number three PQ is a diameter of the circle PQ R if PQ equals Q X and P R is equal to R Q is equal to rx show that PX q p xq is 90 degrees now PQ is the time it so this is 90 degrees if this is a this is a why this is isosceles triangle and what else we can say this is 90 and here this side is equal to this side so if this is a this is a so we have to show that a equals 90 degrees so when you take this one a yeah look at this triangle this is a this is also a now we can write down a formula for all these first we write down P R cube is 90 degrees angle in a semicircle then R P Q is equal to P Q R is equal to a I so see these triangle again we can write down if you take P X q triangle the big triangle QP x angle is same as a pxq angle that's also a because of these two sides are equal isosceles triangle then when you take the big triangle we 
,,can write down a plus a plus a plus a get Phi is is equal to 180 its angle sum of a triangle now for a equals hundred eighty what's a hundred eighty divided by four 
,,so this is equal to 45 now what's the angle we want PQ x PQ X is what P Q X so this angle is PQ x that's two way two times a so two times 45 you get 90 degrees question number 4 AC is the diameter that means passes through the center and of the circle ABCD if BC is parallel to ad sure that ABCD is a rectangle how can we show that if these two are parallel this angle is equal to this angle alternate angles are equal and we know this is 90 and this is 90 same angles in a semicircle now when you take these two triangles the congruent the hypotenuse is the same and two angles one side and two angles are the same so you can see these two are congruent then 
,,this length is equal to this length opposite corresponding elements are equal so we'll use that method so first thing you can write ABC angle is same as ATC angle that's 90 degrees angle in a semicircle then you can write out B C angle is same as C 80 angle we put a that's alternate angles because the two lens are sides are power and if we take this ABC triangle and ACD triangle we can see AC is common so two angles at one side equal so therefore ABC triangle is congruent to a CD triangle because of angle angle side so angle angle side then you can say corresponding elements are equal opposite to angle is a be opposite to a and at least CD so ii b is equal to CD as well as bc is equal to ad and parallel as well so opposite sides are equal and one pair is parallel and also here you can say these two angles also 90 
,,degrees and how can we show that this is also 90 this is equal to this one is equal to this angle because of corresponding elements so we can write down this a plus 
,,this angle is also 90 degrees so all angles 90 degrees and the opposite sides are equal so therefore this is the rectangle so we have to write down the angles also I can write down a CD angle is same as be a C angle these two then if I take a plus X this triangle I can write a plus I'll put X as the other angle a plus X plus 90 
,,is 180 so a plus X equals 180 minus 90 so that means all angles are a plus X means this angle all 90 degrees and opposite sides are equal so therefore a b c d opposite sides are equal and angles are 90 degrees question number 5 PS q is a diameter of the larger circle and s q is a diameter of the smaller circle if RQ intersects the smaller circle at X show that PRS PRS angle is equal to r sx r sx this angle look at carefully if we can show that these two lines are parallel that means alternate angles are equal so we'll see whether we can show that these are parallel now look at carefully the big circle this one is 90 and also in the when you take the small amount this is 90 so P R Q angle is equal to SX Q angle that's 90 and in a semicircle then look at carefully these are the corresponding angles to PRN s6 lights 
,,so that's it closer so you can write down those are corresponding angles so corresponding angles are equal corresponding angles are equal that means P are parallel to s6 now we found out PR is parallel to P X so therefore P AR s angle is same as R s X because these are alternate question number six PR is a diameter of the circle PQRS if s RP s are P is equal to Q R P Q R P these two are equal show that spr this one is equal to QP are these two ok so we'll put this one a and this is also a because it's given first we'll write down P naught P s RP s are P angle s RP angle is equal to Q R P that's given and this is a diameter so this is 90 this is 90 so we can write down P s our angle is equal to PQ our angle that's 90 angle in a semicircle then what can you say about when you add these two together and subtract what can you say about P R P Q and r PQ angle is 180 minus the sum of these two angles 90 Plus 8 so when you simplify you get 90 minus a that's your first one when you take the other triangle what's SP our angle SP are also 180 minus 90 plus when you simplify you get 90 minus a so this is your second equation look at 1 & 2 1 is equal to 2 so therefore we can write SPR is VR anger the same as QP question number 7 the two circles in the figure intersect at P and Q px and py are diameters px and py are diameters of the two circles show that x qy is a straight line x qy is a straight line means we have to show that this is adam 208 these two angles add up to 180 when you take this one this is the time eater so what is this angle p eq x angle is 90 degrees because of anger in a semicircle then when you take this one what is this angle is also 90 p qy is 90 degrees angle in a semicircle when you add these two 1 & 2 you get PQ x + PQ y PQ x + PQ y is equal to 90 plus 90 that's hard read 80 so these two and up 280 means that's a straight line so this is a straight angle so therefore xqy is a straight line miscellaneous exercise mark the given data on the given figures and solve the problems the center of the circle ABC is oh if a b o is equal to OB c OB c and a b or a B or is 40 degrees find the magnitude of AC o SC o means we have to find out this one we put X here we need to find out X if this is 40 this is 40 it's given and we know these two are radii this is equal to this so if this is 40 this is 40 then we know this angle what's this angle 180 is equal to 40 plus 40 40 plus 40 plus you take why why so what's the Y value Y is 180 
,,minus 80 that's 100 degrees so this is 100 then what happens to this angle so be a C anger becomes half of that so hundred divided by 2 that's 50 degrees because of 
,,theorem number one now look at the big triangle ABC 50 plus 40 plus 40 plus 40 plus X is hundred eighty sum of angles in a triangle so add all together 1930 170 170 
,,plus x equals 180 so what's X 180 minus 170 you get 10 degrees question number 2 BD is a diameter of the circle ABCD BC equals CD BC equals CD and a CB ACB is 35 find the magnitude of ABC ABC so we need this angle we'll put this one as X we'll put this one we want X and this one as Y if we put this one as why what's this angle this is why because same segment angles are equal if this is y this is y so you can find out a relationship between this and this x and y so when you take the bigger 
,,triangle i can write x plus y plus 35 is equal to 180 this angle Plus this angle Plus this is 180 so what is X plus y 180 minus 35 so you get 145 for X plus y but we need to find out why this is the diameter yeah this is the diameter so what is this angle this is 90 degree so we can find out what is the value of y so 90 degree so y plus y plus 90 is 180 so what is 2y equals 180 minus 90 is 90 y equals 45 degrees 45 plug it here X plus 45 is 145 X is hundred 45 - 45 you get hundred degrees question number 3 the center of the circle ABCD is oh if BC is parallel to do or or D and ABC ABC is 60 degrees find the magnitude of the angle b c d BCD means nice angle we need to find out how can we find out look at carefully if this is 60 this is 60 and because why this is 16 corresponding angles are equal now look at carefully here if you take this one BD as the arc this is the angle if you take the major arc this is the angle subtended on the other side of the remaining part of the circle is this angle what about the angle subtended at the center we can find out that's this angle so what is that triangle this is 60 this is 180 180 plus 60 you get 
,,240 degrees the angle subtended at the center so that's the reflex angle d-ohh be angle so that's D OB reflex angle now if this is hundred 240 what is this angle DC 
,,be agar is half of that 240 divided by 2 you get hundred twenty what's the result theorem number one so you want VCD angle so BCD angle or this is DC be same thing that's equal to hundred twenty degrees question number four the center of the circle ABC is o AC has been produced 2 X such that we see is equal to CX sure that a OB 
,,OB is equal to four times B X C B X so we'll take this one as X so you have to show that this is 4 times X for X so if this is X this is X then what is this 1 this becomes X plus X 2x exterior angle if this is 2x you get double of that you get 4x so you can't prove that so we'll write down see XB is equal to C X B is equal to C 
,,B X that's equal to X angle because of isosceles triangle then you can write down ACB angle ACB angle is X plus X that's equal to 2x because of exterior angle then you can write down a obi angle is double of a see the angle because of theorem number bar then 2 times ACB is same as 2x 2 times 2x is 4x now instead of X I can write down CB x cb X is same as X CB x is 4 times CB X is equal to a Oh big question number five the points a b c and d lie on the circle that ad equals BC show that DB this length is equal to see this full length so we'll take this point and so and consider a or D triangle and B or C triangle it's given ad equals BC that's already given and here this handle is equal to this hand alternate the opposite angles are equal D Oh angle is equal to CE o V angle opposite angles and also when you take this angle and this angle Bota equal same segment angles 80b angle is same as AC v angle same segment angles are equal now what can you say about these two triangles those are congruent angle and a sight therefore e OD triangle is congruent to v OC triangle that's angle angle side now what can you say about the corresponding elements e o is equal to OB as well as OD OD is equal to AU d is equal to OC now when you add these two what you get 1 plus 2 but you get one plus two you are getting a o + OC OB NOS OD now we look at the diagram you can see a o + OC what's that is OB + OG that's BD it's or DP so we can straight away write down there for a a + OC is 
,,AC OB + OD is dbj so these two names are equal question number 6 PQ is a diameter of the circle with centre o also QR is parallel to QR q r is parallel to oh s sure 
,,that SR is equal to SP s R is equal to SP so these two lens are equal so that means we can show that these two angles are equal we can do that so we'll see from this diagram we can write P R Q angle is 90 because of angle in a semicircle what is these two lines are parallel so that means if this is 90 this is 90 so P I'll put X 
,,or something that is 90 degrees and also what is we can see corresponding angles are equal so when you take this sock is peoc what can you say about this and this angle this is the angle subtended at the center this is angle subtended on the remaining part of the circle so if this is X what can you say about this angle this is 2x so first I can write down s are P is X then P o s is 2x because of theorem number what and if this is 2x this is 2x Esper so what's the theorem what's the rule their corresponding angles because the two lines are parallel so we can write POS angle is same as P Q R angle that's 2x because of corresponding angles now look at carefully and what is this hand again this is 90 this is 19 so that means this all 90 degrees because here also corresponding angles so we write that doubt if this point is X will take pqrst this point is T so P t/o angle is 90 because also corresponding now when you take SP or triangle SP or triangle we know that OS is equal to Opie radii of the same circle those are equal so this is equal to this so that means this angle is equal to this angle so we'll put Y or something this is y and this is y so we can't say what is y 2y plus 2x is equal to 180 so 2y equals 180 minus 2 X so y equals divide all these by 2 you get 90 minus X so this angle you found 90 minus X this is 90 minus 6 this is 90 so what is this angle you get this is X so we can write down P s/o and girl is 90 minus X that's why Y angle 90 minus X so when 
,,you take s PT child s PT triangle we can say this angle SP that's the other side SP r SP r SP r and that is equal to PS oh that's equal to these angles are both X this angle and this angle equals x so this is an isosceles triangle so therefore it's an isosceles triangle so what can you say about isosceles triangle in isosceles triangle lens ax equal so therefore we can write down P s is equal to SR because these students are equal in this lesson we discussed about angles in a circle and we 
,,discussed in three important theorems what are the theorems angles in a semicircle is 90 degrees angles in the same segment are equal and angle subtended at the center is twice as the angles subtended on the remaining part of the circle so remember those three theorems and apply in exercises

Circle,5AyrGcUTcxM,hello students today I'm here to teach you chapter 27 in your textbook that's called chords of a circle so we'll see what are chords you have started circles in grade six so today you are learning more about circles so let's take a circle what you call this point we call it Center what's the line joining from the center to any point on the circle we call it radius what's the letter we use for radius we used simple ah now we'll take another circle so here if we join any two points on the circle but passing through the center what you call that any line passing through the center we call it diameter so we use the letter D we'll take another circle what you call this outer length we call it circumference and we use the letter C for that now today we are learning about chords what's a chord so chord is a line segment 
,,joining two points on a circle but not passing through the center so here I'll draw two cards like this so these are cards so we'll see what are the properties in codes now we'll take the circle and then I want to draw a chord a B let's say a B is 12 centimeters that means here to here the length is 12 centimeters and if I say I want to take the midpoint of the chord so what is midpoint means dividing this chord into two equal parts so if I take B as the midpoint we know that what's the distance of a P if P is equal to 12 divided by 2 because equally divide this into two parts let's become six centimeters what about PB then PB also same length now we'll take another one again we'll take any card a be here if this is the center will stake as oh I want to connect this Center with the midpoint of this chord a B so P 
,,is the midpoint so I want to connect so what you call this line this is the line joining with the center and the midpoint of the court so here we can write what is Opie Opie is the line joining Center to the midpoint of the call now we'll take another circle again will draw chord C D or something this is the center oh now when you connect midpoint of this chord city will take as ye or something there's a property here this line and this line becomes perpendicular so we'll see how we can show that with that formal proof so here there's a property when you join the center with the midpoint of the chord is always perpendicular to the chord so here we can 
,,write for e is perpendicular to C D so here these are all about chords now we will look at the theorem number one related to cause it says the straight line joining 
,,the center of the circle to the midpoint of a chord is perpendicular to the car so here they want to show that when you take the center oh and if the chord is a B the straight line joining the center to the midpoint so here we'll take P as the midpoint this line is perpendicular to the chord so we need to show this is 90 degrees so here what we know about this circle we know o is the center and a B is the chord and P is the midpoint so what you need to prove we need to prove that opie line 
,,is perpendicular to a B now we need to do a small construction so what we need to do just join Oh a n OB join or a and OB now we'll see how we can prove this so the 
,,formal proof of this theorem here we have to take these two triangles or AP and o PB triangle when you take these two triangles what you know about those two we know AP is equal to VB why what's the reason P is a midpoint then we know Oh P is same as o P that's the common length common side and what as we know what are we an OB 
,,those are radii from the same circle so those are equal so a Oh a is equal to OB radii from the same circle so what can we say about these two triangles side-side-side so these two triangles are congruent so therefore o a P triangle is congruent to OPB triangle what's the reason side side side so when they are congruent what are the other elements that are equal corresponding elements that are equal when you take these two triangle we can say that this angle opposite to this line is this angle is same as this angle so here therefore we can say Oh PA angle is equal to all P be congruent elements if these two are equal what can you say so this is put X and X here so 2 X X plus 6 so this is a straight line so straight angle you are getting so we can say 2x equals 180 so what is X x equals 90 degrees so 90 degrees means this line is perpendicular to a B so we can therefore we can say Oh P 9 is perpendicular to a so that's how we can prove the theorem number one so what it says when you connect the center with the midpoint of the chord it's always appendicular to the caught now we'll try to apply this theorem in several situations in your textbook example number one it says a B is a chord of a circle with Center oh so we'll try to draw that so it says a B is a chord so I can draw any line with a B Center Oh so mark Oh radius is 5 centimeter so that means this length is 5 centimeter so here also 5 centimeters the midpoint of a B is C so here when you equally divide this one that's C point if a B is 8 so given that a B is 8 centimeters find the length of or C so you are asked to find this length so how can we use the theorem number one so here this is the midpoint and this is the line joining the center with the midpoint of the chord so we know that this is perpendicular according to the theorem number one if this is perpendicular we get a right angle triangle so and also we know C is the midpoint so what is the length of AC we can straight away write AC length is a divided by 2 4 centimeters here so we know this is 4 centimeters now we'll take this triangle we get a right-angled triangle oh is C this length is 4 centimeters and this is 5 centimeters now you are asked to find out the length of so we'll put X there so what can we apply think about carefully what's the role we can use this is the right angle triangle so we can use Pythagoras theorem so when you are using Pythagoras theorem what can you say this is the hypotenuse away the hypotenuse so hypotenuse squared is equal to the square sum of square terms of the other sides four squared plus x squared so now let's try to simplify this five squared is 25 4 squared is 16 so when you take 16 to the other side what is x squared 25 minus 16 you get 9 what is the square root of 9 that's a perfect square take the 
,,square root you get plus or minus 3 but this is about length so you can't take the negative value so we can say the OC length should be 3 centimeters now we'll see the next example in your textbook so here it's also given the other circle so we'll take this circle PQ is a cord so you know what is a cord so you can straight away 
,,draw PQ cos and O is the center and the midpoint of PQ is R so here we'll take R and this is equally divided because it's the midpoint if qo r q or r is 40 degrees so here it's given this angle is 40 degrees find OPR o p r this angle so we will say this is X how we can do this so this is also about a chord this line is the line 
,,joining the center with the midpoint of the chord so we know that this is perpendicular so this is 90 degrees if you know this is 90 degrees how can we find out this angle so this angle is the same as this angle why what's the reason we know this length is equal to this length so we can write all P length should be equal to OQ that's the radii of the same circle so if you know this think about opq triangle OPQ triangle should be an isosceles triangle because these two sides are equal so that says isosceles triangle so here if this is X this also is equal to X so look at the small triangle and we can use the sum of angles in the triangle so when you look at oqr triangle we can say 90 plus 40 plus X is equal to 180 what's that what's the theorem the sum of angles in a triangle sum of angles in a triangle so now try 
,,to solve for X 90 plus 40 130 because 180 so X is equal to 180 minus 130 we can straight away write down that's 50 degrees so what's the angle of o P R that's equal 
,,to 50 degrees let's take the exercise number twenty seven point one and the first question find the value of x in each of the following figures using the given data 
,,in each figure is the center of the circle now look at the diagram carefully XY is a chord and O is the center and here can you see these two lengths are equal means Z is the midpoint of X Y so that means according to theorem number one we know that this is 90 degrees or Z is perpendicular to X Y because of the theorem number one one about chords if you know this is 90 degrees now think about all Z by triangle what can you say about angles X plus 90 plus 30 degrees is equal to I'm granny T 
,,that's a triangle the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 so when you check solve this X plus 90 plus 30 is 120 is equal to 180 X becomes take hundred 22 the other side 180 minus 120 you get 60 degrees now we'll take the second part so here look at the diagram carefully a B is a cord or is the center and C is the midpoint of a B 
,,chord so here definitely we can first thing we can say oh C is perpendicular to a B what's the reason theorem number one the line joining from the center to the midpoint of the cord is perpendicular to the core theorem one related to chords and also look at this triangle is C is given equal to OC so that means that cell isosceles triangle o is see is an isosceles triangle so we know if it's an isosceles triangle the corresponding angles are equal so if this is X this is also X now we can use the sum of angles in a triangle when you look at o AC triangle what can we see we can write X plus X plus 90 degrees is equal to 180 because the sum of angles in a triangle is unready to degrees then try to solve X annex becomes 2x plus 90 is 180 so take 90 to the other side 2x becomes 180 minus 90 so you get 90 there if 2x is 90 so how we can find X X is equal to 90 divided by 2 that means 45 degrees now let's take the third part again look at carefully so PQ is a cord or is the center and this line Oh s line is the line joining the center and the midpoint of the court so straight away what can you see we can easily write this should be perpendicular so here Oh s line should be perpendicular to PQ cord that's theorem number one related to chords and also look at carefully we see Opie and OAS Lin cycle why what's the reason radii so here radii of the same circle Oh P is equal to O s radii from the same circle now here when you look at this triangle what can you say this is 
,,an isosceles triangle so here o-p-s angle is also 55 degrees this angle is also 55 now we'll take this one is y okay if you take this one as Y we can easily find out this Y value how we know when you take P s so here there's no letter here when you take the smaller triangle we can write Y plus 90 plus 55 is equal to 180 so that's this smaller triangle the angle sum of a triangle is hundred eighty so when you simplify this y plus hundred forty-five is equal to 180 y equals 180 minus 145 so what's 180 minus 145 35 degrees we know this is 35 degrees but the full angle we found out that's 55 so how can we find X so we can easily find out X plus y we found 
,,that's 55 before but Y is now 35 so plug the value they are and subtract so X is equal to 55 minus 30 five what's the answer 20 degrees so this value becomes 20 decrease now we'll take the fourth part so when you look at the diagram again we can see a B is a chord and X is the midpoint and O is the center now when you look at carefully we know that this is perpendicular to each other because this is the center with the midpoint here also when you look at this chord BC chord this is center with the midpoint so that's also 90 degrees so straight away according to theorem number one you can write or xB angle is 90 degrees as well as or Y B angle is 90 degrees what's the reason chords we can write according to theorem number one related to chords now look at carefully what is o X B Y that's a quadrilateral so when you look at o x b vy quadrilateral we know the sum of angles in a quadrilateral is 360 so here we can write 90 plus hundred ten plus another ninety plus X becomes 360 that's the sum of angles in a quadrilateral now try to simplify so when you add all these together what you get 290 plus X is 360 so what is X value take 292 the other side and subtract so you get 70 degrees for the x value now we'll take the fifth part again we can see a B is a chord AC is a chord and O is the center so here straight away according to theorem number one we can say that these all are 90 degrees because the line joining the center with the midpoint of the chord is perpendicular to the chord so what can you say about Oh p AQ quadrilateral so we can say the sum of angles in a quadrilateral is equal to 360 so 45 plus 90 plus x plus 90 is equal to 360 so sum of angles in a in a quadrilateral so try to simplify this so when you add all together you get 9 9 18 18 plus 4 22 so 225 plus X is equal to 360 so what is X X becomes 360 minus 225 so when you subtract what you get 510 so you get three three six minus three three three minus two is 135 as their as this anger now we'll look at the next part this is about a circle and PQ is a cord QR is a cord and given that x is the midpoint of PQ cord and y is the midpoint of QR cord so straight away we can take these two angles are 90 degrees because the line joining the center with the midpoint of the cord is perpendicular to the cord so when you look at the diagram again or x qy quadrilateral we can straight away write 90 + 60 + 90 + x is equal to 360 what's the reason the sum of angles in a quadrilateral so 
,,try to simplify this you when you add you get 240 plus 6 is 360 so how can we find X 360 - 240 you get 120 now we'll move to the next question now it says PQ is a cord and the center is or the midpoint of the cord is R so if this is the midpoint you can straight away MA these are PR is equal to q so the whole length is 12 centimeters and Oh our so our length is given 8 centimeters find the radius of the circle so here we will draw this line so you need to find out the opie length and also we know PQ length is what's the length 12 centimeters so what is PR length if this AR is the midpoint so you can divide by 2 and get 6 centimeters for PR and also according to theorem number one PQ and o are perpendicular to each other so here o R is perpendicular to PQ that's theorem number one about chords so here we know that 
,,this is a right angle triangle now this is 90 degrees now it's perpendicular so if this is 90 and this is 6 centimeters this is 8 centimeters you are asked to find out this length so this is about a right angle triangle and you have to find one length and the other two lengths are given so what's the theorem we can use we can use Pythagoras theorem so according to Pythagoras theorem it says the hypotenuse squared is equal to the sum of square terms of the other two sides so when you simplify 6 squared is 36 8 squared is 64 36 Plus 64 is hundred so square root of hundred you get plus or minus 10 but this is about length so you take the plus value so 10 
,,centimeters because the unit's given in centimeters so we know the radius of this circle is 10 centimeters now we look at the third question it says a b and b c are 
,,chords of a circle with center o which are perpendicular to each other so this line a B and BC given that that's 90 degrees and also the midpoint of a b and b CI x and y so when these are midpoints I can mark like this and here it's not given to equal so you can put these these lengths out so equal and then you are asked to find out the perimeter of the quadrilateral or X B Y so that means you have to find out the lengths so we know a B is 12 centimeters so what's the length of XV half of it because X is the midpoint so here you can divide by two and get six centimeters so this is six centimeters and also what about BC BC length is given eight centimeters so that means you can straight away find out B Y that's half of that four centimeters so here this is four centimeters this is six centimeter and according to the theorem number one what you know this one is perpendicular to each other this is also perpendicular so what you get here 90 90 90 90 with different lengths that's 
,,a rectangle so here straight away we can write down o X B Y is a rectangle so if this is six this is also six centimeters this is four centimeters opposite sides are equal inner rectangle so you can watch the perimeter so perimeter of X be my is equal to just add all length parameter is the outer length of a figure so six plus four plus six plus four so what you get ten ten plus ten twenty centimeters so the perimeter of the quadrilateral given is twenty centimeters now we'll take the fourth question in the fourth question it says a b and b c are two chords so these are two chords and center is or and also both are perpendicular so a b and b c are perpendicular so that means it's given this is ninety yeah perpendicular means this angle is ninety degrees the midpoints of a B is X and midpoint of BC is y so already 
,,marked with equal lengths if a B is 8 centimeters so a B is given eight centimeters and BC this length is given six centimeters find the perimeter of the quadrilateral be x over so this is similar question to the question number three so you are asked to find out now we found this is nine and what is we can find out we know these also perpendicular according to theorem number one or X is perpendicular to a B and over I perpendicular to BC so both are related to theorem number one in codes so here that means Oh X B by either rectangle now we know a B is 8 that means what is BX BX is a divided by 2 that's 4 centimeter because X is the midpoint of a B we 
,,know BC is 6 so what is B by 6 divided by 2 that's 3 centimeters so here we know this is 3 centimeters this is 4 centimeters so what's the perimeter of the rectangle so the perimeter becomes 4 plus 3 multiplied by 2 or you are just adding 4 plus 3 plus 4 plus 3 so I do 2 times 4 plus 3 4 plus 3 7 7 times 2 14 centimeters now we'll look at fifth question so the vertices P Q and R P Q and R of the triangle PQR lie on a circle with Center o the midpoints of P Q and Q R are given a and B so already marked there P Q is 16 so P Q is 16 centimeters so straight away you can write Oh a is the heart is half of 16 that's 8 centimeters Oh ay OH ay is given 6 centimeter so this is 6 centimeters and this is OH q this is not or a midpoint of PQ is a so aq so here Q a is 8 centimeters and again it's given Obie's square root 19 this is square root of 19 and you are asked to find out the length of Q R so here when you look at the diagram we know a and B are midpoints of those cords so straight away we can write these two angles are 90 degrees because a is perpendicular to PQ as well as OB is perpendicular to Q R so this is according to theorem number one 
,,related to chords now here when you draw a line here when you connect OQ length you get 2 right-angled triangles now we'll draw the first triangle right angle triangle you get a is 90 degrees Oh Q so or Q we don't know the length and a Q is 8 centimeters or a is 6 centimeters now we can find out the OQ length so we'll put X here so this is the right angle triangle and you can use Pythagoras theorem so according to Pythagoras we can say x squared is equal to 8 squared plus 6 squared so according to Pythagoras so here 8 squared is 64 6 squared is 36 when you add you get hundred square root of 100 is 10 centimeters so we found or Q is 10 centimeters now look at the other triangle now when you draw the other triangle this is oq now we already found this is 10 centimeters so we know OB is square root of 19 and we need 
,,to find out the length of B Q why we need B Q because they are asking to find out the length of Q R so the length of Q R is double of P Q because B is the midpoint of the cord so we'll put Y for this length again we know this is 90 degrees use Pythagoras theorem again hypotenuse squared is equal to sum of squares of the other two terms what is Crower root of 19 square so square root and square term get canceled out and you get 19 so you get hundred here y squared plus 19 y squared is 100 minus 19 you get 81 so what's the Bible you Y value is the square root of 81 is 9 centimeters so here we found that B Q length is 9 centimeter so if B Q B Q is 9 centimeters so what is the Q our length double of that so two times nine centimeters so you get 18 centimeters for the tough QR now we'll look at examples in your textbook so here you are given a circle with a B and C D are chords and O is the center and also given the midpoints of these chords are x and y so that means straight away you can write down this length is equal to this length this one is equal to this length because x and y are midpoints and you are asked to show that oh X is equal to Y so here you have to prove that so to be proved Oh X is equal to or Y so here we have to look at the two triangles so what are the two triangles we need to look over I see triangle and O B X triangle what you know about those two triangles we know this is perpendicular the line joining the center with the midpoint of the car 
,,is perpendicular to the car so straight away you can write or Y is perpendicular to Oh X or Y is perpendicular to DC and oh X perpendicular to a B and we can see these two are right angle triangles so here Oh Y seed angle is same as oh X be angle that's 90 degrees and also we know this this length OC length is equal to OB what are those so when you take this circle OC and obeah radii so here radii of the same circle so I can write this lamp is equal to this length and also we know these are equal chords equal chords means I don't need to take different names so here a X I can write xB should be equal to YC why what's the reason because it's given DC is equal to a B and when you take half of it both sides you get x BN YC so those two lengths are equal so now I don't need to write down with a different lengths so I 
,,can write these are equal so here we know that one angle and two lengths are equal so here we can see these two are congruent to each others so what's the reason oh 
,,why see triangle is congruent to OB x triangle so here we can see this is the hypotenuse hypotenuse I equal and one side equal so in a right angle triangle hypotenuse and one side equals we call RHS so these two triangles are congruent then what can you say about corresponding elements so o X and/or Y are corresponding lengths so here straight away you can write o Y is equal to o X because corresponding elements of a congruent triangle so that's how you show o x equals o Y now we'll take example number two so it says this is the midpoint of the cord already mark there and center o OS produced means the circle at R if R is equal is Oh R is equals is so 
,,sure that Opie RQ is a rhombus so here you asked sure this is a rhombus so what's the rule we can apply now here it's already given P s is equal to s Q because s is 
,,the midpoint and also it's given as R equals o s already given so here if you take this Opie our Q quadrilateral what can you say about that quadrilateral the diagonals bisect each other so here in our PRQ quadrilateral we see diagonals bisect each other and also when you look at the diagram what can you say about o our line and PQ r lie here s is the midpoint and O is the centre when you draw the line from the center to the midpoint of the chord that's perpendicular to the chord so here we can see that this is 90 degrees so here we can see p s is perpendicular to R according to the theorem number one related to chords so here we see diagonals bisect at 90 degrees so therefore diagonals bisect at 90 degrees so what can you say about diagonals bisect each other as well as by six at ninety degrees so when you look at this property what can you say about the PRQ quadrilateral we can say this is a rhombus so here with these two diagonals bisect each other as well as diagonals bisect at 90 degrees we can say oh p RQ is a rhombus now we will look at exercise 27.2 in your textbook and the first question it says r is the midpoint of PQ chord and O is the center our or Q is 45 will mark this our OQ so that means this angle is given 45 sure that our Q is equal to oh ah ok so we'll try to do that now this is about a card and this is the midpoint we can straight away take o our is perpendicular to PQ so this is 90 degrees if this is 90 degrees what can you say about this triangle o our Q triangle we can say the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 so 45 + 90 + o Q our angle should be equal 280 the sum of angles in a triangle so when you simplify this you get 135 plus oq our triangle is 180 so what is oqr angle I'm granny 80 minus 135 you get 45 so we found this is also 45 now look at carefully this angle is 45 and also this is fortified you get an isosceles triangle so this is 45 this is 45 so we can say this length is equal to this length so here o our Q is an isosceles triangle so what you know about isosceles triangle we know corresponding let's lens also equal so we can say Q R or R Q is equal to o because corresponding corresponding lengths of an isosceles triangle so that's what you need to prove our Q is equal to or now we'll take question number two so it says a B is a chord 
,,and O is the center and C is the midpoint already marked with equal lines and when OC is produced o'seas produce meet the circle at D show that ad equals DB so that 
,,means we have to connect ad and EB so we need to check whether these two are equal so again we can use the two triangles and C so we'll take a CD triangle and CD p triangle what you know about those two triangles we know AC is equal to CB already given C is the midpoint and CD is common common side what do you know about this angle we know this is perpendicular angle is 90 degrees so we can write a CD angle and DC B angle both are 90 degrees that's according to theorem number one related to cons so here when you look at these two triangles one angle and two lengths and also this angle the included angle included and go to to these two equal lengths so 
,,that means these two triangles are congruent so we can write a CD triangle is congruent to b CD triangle what's the situation it's a side angle site so if these two 
,,are congruent what can you say about corresponding elements so corresponding elements are equal so when you look at a D and D B both are equal because those are corresponding elements of the con ruint triangles so here that's what you have to prove now we'll look at question number three the vertices ABC of the triangle ABC lie 
,,on a circle with centre o the midpoint of BC the midpoint of BC is given X if all lies on ax all eyes on the center lies on ax show that a b is equal to AC so here again we need to look at the two triangles so here we'll try to prove that we take first AC x triangle and a xB triangle but you know about those we know a X is common length and also we know C X is equal to X B because X is the midpoint what as we know we know this is passing through the center means the Oh X is perpendicular to BC so what can you say about the angle we can say a X C angle and a xB angle both are 90 degrees according to theorem one in quads so these two lengths and this is 
,,also included angle so what can you say about two triangles two triangles are congruent so we can straight away write down a AC X triangle is congruent to a X B triangle what's the situation side angle sight and an angle is the included angle to these two lengths so we can straight away these two are controvert so what about the corresponding elements corresponding elements are also equal so we can write down AC is equal to a B what's the reason corresponding elements of congruent about two triangles corresponding elements of congruent triangles so we prove that a B should be equal to AC now we'll see the fourth question so it says P Q and Q are our two chords of a circle with Center o which are perpendicular to each other so here P Q and Q are both are perpendicular the midpoint of P Q and Q are I x and y so these two are midpoints show that o xq y o xq y is a rectangle so we did a similar question to this before so how can we show that this is a rectangle so that means we have to show all these angles are 90 degrees so when you look at the circle we know that o X is perpendicular to P Q that means this is 90 degrees and also we see o Y is perpendicular to Q R according to theorem number 1 we did in this lesson so here we found that this is 90 this is 90 and definitely if this is 90 and this is 90 
,,the sum of angles in a quadrilateral is 360 so this is also 90 degrees now we found out all angles are 90 degree each and the two lengths are different so what can you say about this quadrilateral it's a rectangle so here we can say all angles in the quadrilateral equal to 90 degrees so therefore we can say Oh x qy either rectangle so we'll move to the next question so in question number 5 it says a B and C D are two chords this is a b and c d are two chords of a circle with centre or the midpoints of a b and c d given as P and Q the chords a B and D C produce meet at M show that P or Q P or Q this angle and p mq p mq this angle are supplementary angles what is supplementary means supplement remains add up to 180 degrees so here we have to show that so what we need to sure to be proved P or Q angles plus b MC angle should be equal 280 now what are the information given here this is about Cod's so it straight away you can say this is 90 degrees and this is also 90 degrees so we like that Opie is perpendicular to a B or C or Q well Q is perpendicular to C D theorem number one about chords so can you remember the theorem the line joining the center to the midpoint of the chord is always perpendicular to the chord so these are perpendicular so you can straight away write down Oh p-m angle and Oh Q in Mangal both are 90 degrees so if these are 90 degree now think about the quadrilateral or pmq we know the sum of angles in a quadrilateral is 360 so we can write down 
,,90 plus P or Q angle plus 90 degrees again this 1 plus P M Q angle that should be equal to 360 now try to simplify 1990 becomes 180 so 180 plus p oq' triangle plus p mq p mq triangle angle p mq p mq is same as this angle is equal to 360 so to hundred eighty to the other side we can straight away write down p oq + PM q is 360 minus 180 becomes I'm granny 80 so here we found these two angles add up to 180 180 means those are supplementary now we'll look at question number 6 it says the midpoint of the chords a B this one is given as P and center is au and the other midpoint given as Q show that P or Q so we'll see what's be your cue this angle is equal to B AC b AC this angle plus AC b ACB this angle so you have to show this angle is equal to the sum of the other two angles so here again this is about chords you can straight away write down this is 90 degrees Oh P perpendicular to AV as well as OQ perpendicular to BC related to theorem number one about chords and then what can 
,,you say about this one so here we'll take this one when you take this side in the opie be Q quadrilateral we can write the sum of angles in a quadrilateral is 360 so we can write P or Q angle plus 90 plus 90 plus ABC angle is equal to 360 so when you take 90 and 90 becomes 180 and when you take it to the other side what can you 
,,say P or Q plus ABC angle is 360 minus 180 that's equal to 180 we'll take this one as 1 now when you look at the triangle ABC what can you see when you take ABC triangle we know that the three angles add up to 180 so b a c angle plus a CP angle plus ABC that's equal to 180 because sum of angles in a triangle now here what can you say about ABC now here we'll take this one to the other side or you can just equate here both are equal so this is equation number two so according to one and two 
,,both sides are equal we can write p or q + ABC this side is equal to b c + ACB and ABC no can you see ABC in both sides you can subtract so when you subtract these two what you get p or q is equal to b a c plus ACB so that's why we need to prove now we look at the seventh question it says PQ and RS are two equal chords PQ equal 
,,chords means when you look at the midpoints also the lengths are equal so x and y are midpoints and show that XPS XPS this angle is equal to y SP y s P so you have to show these two are equal so first thing we can do look at this diagram you can straight away write down Oh X perpendicular to PQ because this is the chord and the 
,,line joining the midpoint and the center and also Oh Y is perpendicular - yes sir perpendicular because of the theorem 1 so we can write so this is 90 degrees okay so here if you know this is 90 degrees what can you say about the lengths we know P Q is equal to SR it's given because it's two equal chords so when you take half of this you get this length and this length both are equal so we can straight away write down P X is equal to s Y because X and via midpoints now we know these two lengths are equal so here now we will look at these two triangles and see so we'll take P X or triangle P X or triangle N or is my triangle what do you know about those two triangles we know P X is the equal to s Y because that's those are midpoints and also we know that this angle is 90 degrees so here pxo angle is equal to sy o angle that's equal to 90 degrees so this is about a right angle triangle and one length is equal and what you know about these two lengths so those are equal why what's the reason those are radii of the same circle so Oh P is equal to O s radii of the same circle so here this is the right angle triangle and hypotenuse are equal and one length is equal so these two are congruent what's the case we can say in a right angle triangle hypotenuse and side RHS so these two are congruent means we can straight away write down the corresponding elements so the corresponding elements means this angle is equal to this angle so we can write down X P Oh angle is equal to Oh s my angle what's the reason corresponding elements of a congruent triangle and also when you take o-p-s triangle these two lengths are equal means this angle is equal to this angle so here we can write down o-p-s angle is equal to o s P angle because o P is is an isosceles triangle so we can write because o P is equal to O s and this is an isosceles triangle now if it's equal now we'll take this one as two and this one as one they say question as one will try to add these two so when you add one and two what you get Oh PS Oh PS this angle plus XP oh this angle what you get when you are adding you get the full angle XP yes when you do the same 
,,thing for the right-hand side Oh sy Oh sy this angle and PS Oh angle what you get you get PS y or y SP angle so these are y SP and so these are definitely equal now 
,,we'll look at theorem number two so that's the converse of theorem number one so what is theorem number one we said the line joining the center to the midpoint of the chord is perpendicular to the chord now the converse is the perpendicular drawn from the center of the circle to a chord bisects the chord so we'll take this theorem and try to prove so here I'll take a circle so what it says here it says the center is oh and there's a chord and when you draw the perpendicular to the chord you take this one as a B is this is the perpendicular that's ninety degree angle and we'd have to check whether these two lens are equal bisect the chord means so the this if it's C is the midpoint is he should be equal to CB now we'll try to prove that so here what you need to prove we need to show that AC is equal to CB what you 
,,know we know o is the center and Oh C is perpendicular to a B so that means this is 90 degrees we already know that and we'll take these two triangles because we need to show that AC is equal to CB so when you take o AC triangle and obese C triangle what can you say we know that OC is common and what is we know we know this is equal to this one what's that those are radii of the same circle so whoa a is equal to OB those are radii of the same circle and we know this angle is 90 degrees OC a angle is equal to OC B angle that's 90 degrees because we have drawn the perpendicular to the chord so here when you look at the these two lengths and this one what you get this is a right angle triangle because there's 90 degree angle and the hypotenuse and one side equal so what can you say about these two triangles these two triangles are congruent so therefore we can say Oh a C triangle is congruent to a OBC triangle what's the reason right in a right angle triangle the hypotenuse and 
,,one side equal so if these two are congruent what can you say about the corresponding elements corresponding elements are equal so that means AC is equal to CB we if these two are equal means the chord bisects so therefore the chord bisects so what's the converse of the theorem one it says when you draw a perpendicular from the 
,,center to the chord the chord bisects each other so here this theorem is the converse of theorem number one now we will try to use this theorem in exercises and examples so here in your textbook the example one so it says a b and b c r2 equal chords so here a b and b C two equal chords and with the centre o the perpendicular drawn from o to two chords ah oh x2 y so here it already marked so these are perpendicular so X B Y X B Y is seventy degrees then find the magnitude of B X Y B X Y so you are asked to find out this and so we'll try to find out so what you know about converse theorem converse theorem said when you draw a perpendicular the chord bisects so here and also it's given BC and a B are equal chords so definitely all these lengths are equal half of when you divide by to both sides you can see that B X is equal to B Y now when you look at this triangle b vy x triangle what can you say two lengths are equal you get an isosceles triangle so here it's an isosceles triangle so if this angle is this one so that's equal to b by x angle because the corresponding angles are equal so here we can write if this is X this is also X so when you look at the triangle we can write x + X + 70 is 180 sum of angles in a triangle and then 2x plus 70 equals 180 2x becomes take 72 the other side 180 minus 70 you get hundred ten so when you divide by two you get x equals fifty five degrees so here that means be XY angle is 55 degrees now we'll look at example number two so 
,,here in this example it says oh r is the perpendicular drawn from the circle with the center or to the chord PQ and the or given three centimeters so this is the one three centimeters and PQ this whole thing is given eight centimeters find the radius of the circle so according to the converse theorem we know when you draw a perpendicular from the center to the chord the chord bisects so that means these two lengths are equal so PR is equal to RQ why account Converse theorem so here when you look at PQ length it's 8 centimeters so half of it half of it becomes PR so 8 divided by 2 you get 4 centimeters now look at the triangle P or R triangle but you know we know this is a right angle triangle and this is 4 centimeters and this is 3 centimeters so here you asked to find out the radius so radius is o P so put X here and find out what is the x value so this is a right angle triangle you can use Pythagoras theorem so what's the Pythagoras theorem says the hypotenuse squared is equal to sum of square terms of the other two sides so when you do that 4 squared is 16 3 squared is 9 16 plus 9 25 square root of 25 becomes 5 centimeters so here we 
,,found that Opie Opie is the radius of the circle so the radius is equal to 5 centimeters now we'll look at exercise 27.3 so question number 8 says ABC is an equilateral triangle what's an equilateral triangle all sides are equal so we can straight to be mark all these sides are equal and what else we know we know all angles are 
,,60 degrees and it's given oh is the center the perpendicular drawn from all to BC is Oh X and if X B is 6 centimeters find the perimeter of the triangle ABC so to find out the perimeter you need to now one lint and then multiply by three because this is an equilateral triangle so here if xB is 6 centimeters so here according to 
,,the converse theorem when you draw a perpendicular from the center this is bisects each other so here that means you can't find out the whole length of CB is double 
,,of that two times six so what's the answer 12 centimeters now we know one side is 12 centimeters so what's the perimeter so perimeter of the triangle ABC is 12 into 
,,3 because this is an equilateral triangle so the answer is 36 centimeters now we'll look at question number two so in this question it's given PQ is a chord and Center oh and the perpendicular drawn from o to P Q is or PQ is 12 so this is given PQ is 12 and oh R is 8 centimeters find the perimeter of the triangle OPQ to find out the perimeter you need to know the lengths so here what can you say about the PR length PR length is half of PQ because when you draw a perpendicular from the center to the chord the chord bisects so when you do that you can straight away find out PR that's 12 divided by 2 that's 6 centimeters so this length is 6 centimeters now this is the right angle triangle you can use Pythagoras theorem and find out the radius of the circle so here use Pythagoras theorem x squared is equal to h squared plus 6 squared h squared is 64 6 squared is 36 when you add you get hundred square root of 100 is 10 centimeters now we found out this side is 10 so here we know if this is 10 this is also 10 because those are Opie and OQ are radii of the same circle so here we can write down so what's the perimeter perimeter of opq triangle is 10 plus 10 plus this is 6 and this is 6 so 6 plus 6 so what's the answer 20:32 10 + 10 20 26 26 + 6 32 this is in centimeter so the answer is 32 centimeters now we'll look at third question so it says PQ is a chord of a circle with centre o the perpendicular drawn from all - PQ is o X already given and PQ is 6 centimeters so here P Q is given 6 centimeters and the radius of the circle is 5 centimeter so that means OQ or feel this is 5 centimeter given find the length of or X so you have to find out this length so here you have given PQ is 6 centimeters so according to converse theorem what can you say about X Q distance the chord bisects when you draw a perpendicular from the center so X Q is half of that so 6 divided by 2 that's 3 centimeters so we know this is 3 centimeters so when you look at the triangle or 
,,X Q triangle so this is 5 centimeters and this is X Q is 3 centimeters and you need to find out o X that's X so use Pythagoras theorem v square is the hypotenuse squared is equal to 3 squared plus X square sum of square terms of the other two sides 3 squared is 9 5 squared is 25 + x squared when you take 9 to the other side 25 minus 9 becomes 16 so 16 is equal to x squared and X is square root of 16 that's so - 4 but we take the positive value so you get 4 centimeters so here we can write Oh excellent this four centimeters now we'll take fourth question it says PQ and RS are two parallel chords so it already marked with arrows and which lie on opposite sides of the center oh the radius of the circle is 10 centimeters so here we can write from here to here or here to here that's the radius so here it's given 10 centimeters so this is 10 and this is also 10 PQ is 16 so this length is 16 and SR is 12 find the distance between the two chords so here you are asked to find out the 
,,perpendicular height so here you are asked to find out this side and this side so here what can you say about this according to converse theorem when you draw a perpendicular line the chord bisects so when you are drawing the perpendicular we can say this length equally divided as well as this length equally divided so here if you know that you can straight away find out the lengths so we'll take this triangle the upper triangle and find out the height so here this is the triangle you know 
,,this is 10 centimeters and this is 90 degrees so 16 is full length half of it is 8 centimeters so you can find out this length using pythagoras theorem and also when you look at the other triangle here this is 10 centimeters given and this whole thing is 12 and half of it is 6 centimeters so you can find out this side so the total of these two Heights becomes the distance between the two chords so here use Pythagoras theorem you can find 10 squared is equal to H squared plus X square so what is 10 square that becomes hundred 8 squared is 64 and then when you subtract 64 from hundred you get 36 square root of 36 is 6 centimeters now we found out this distance is 6 centimeters what about this triangle when you use Pythagoras theorem you know hypotenuse squared is equal to square of T sum of square terms of the other two lengths so 10 squared is 100 6 squared is 36 so when you subtract this what you get Y squared is 100 minus 36 becomes 64 square root of 64 is 8 centimeters so what's the distance between the two chords that's equal to X plus y so we can write down just X's what's the x value we found 6 centimeters what's the Y value 8 centimeters so the total distance is 14 centimeters we'll see question number 5 so in question number 5 it says P Q and R is a two parallel chords of the circle with centre o as shown in the figure the radius of the circle is 10 centimeters so how can we draw they're so big I can draw here or here Bota radius so that's 10 centimeters PQ is 12 PQ the whole length is 12 and SR is 16 so this is 16 given find the distance between the two chords so in this case when you are finding the two distances 
,,you will see this one you can find easily you can't find this total height as well so if you want that distance between two chords now you have to take the difference not the addition so previous some the chords were far away opposite side of the center but now the two chords in the same side so in this case you have to subtract the two distances to get the difference between two chords so here we'll try to find out so we know according to this diagram or we'll put this one is X or something this is what Oh X our triangle this is 10 centimeters and we know the full length is 16 according to converse theorem when you draw a perpendicular from the center the caught by six so that means you can straight away write XR is half of 16 that eight centimeters so here we can put the distance this one is X when you look at the bigger one you get ten centimeter as the radius here that's all why cue triangle and what tells we know we know this full length is 12 half of it is six-centimeter so here we'll put why here the difference between these two lengths why an X is the distance between the two cords so we'll try to solve that using Pythagoras theorem 10 squared is equal to x squared plus 8 squared 10 squared is 100 8 squared is 64 and then 100 minus 64 you get 36 when you take the square root of 36 you get 6 
,,centimeters now do the same thing for this triangle use Pythagoras theorem 10 squared is equal to Y squared plus 6 squared 10 squared is 100 6 squared is 36 when you subtract 100 minus 36 you get 64 so square root of 64 is the Y value so that becomes 8 centimeters so what's the distance between the two chords so the distance between two chords is equal to the difference between the two lengths so here 8 minus 6 that becomes 2 centimeters now we'll look at example 1 in your textbook and it says a b and b zr two equal chords of a circle with centre or the perpendicular drawn from or two chords are x and y prove that Oh X equal Y now we'll take a circle and see what we have to prove so it says a b and b bc are two equal chords so we will try to draw that a B and BC but two equal chords so here I looked like this the 
,,perpendicular drawn from all to the two chords so here draw a perpendicular that becomes X draw a perpendicular there that becomes Y prove that Oh x equals o Y so here you have to prove this distance is equal to this distance now we'll try to use the converse of the theorem and we'll connect OB now what can you say about the two triangles I can write o XB triangle and all YB triangle what can you say when you look at the two triangles I see OB is the common side and also I can write X B equals B Phi what's the reason so here according to the converse theorem the chord bisects when you draw a perpendicular from the center so that means this length is equal to this length and also the two chords are equal so that means if this also equals so that's why these two are equal so according to converse theorem these two are equal and also can you see this is a right angle triangle so we can say these two are congruent so o XB triangle is congruent to oh by b triangle what's the reason this is a right angle triangle and hypotenuse and one side equal so when the two triangles are congruent we can say that the corresponding elements are also equal 
,,so corresponding elements are or X and/or Y so here we can write Oh x equals o y because corresponding elements are equal so that's how you prove this now we will look at exercise 27.4 and the first question so what it says you have given a diagram P Q and R is our two chords of a circle with Center o so centers o the perpendicular is drawn from o to P Q and RS r o X and/or Y yeah these are the two perpendicular so here also already marked 90 degrees it says if X is equal to or Y so here these two lengths are equal so you are asked to prove that PQ so what is PQ this length is equal to RS so that means basically you are asked to find out the two chords are equal so here you need to show to be proved PQ is equal to RS now what you know from these two triangles we know when you draw a perpendicular these two Linzer 
,,equal because the chord is bisecting so here we can write down or when you look at this one Q X is equal to X P as well as when you look at this bisector I'll put another symbol here our Y is equal to Y is both are equal because of the converse Pyrrha and also what can you say about the lens now I'll draw two lens OS and OQ what can you say about those two lengths those are equal because radii of the same circle so again we can say Oh s is equal to OQ radii of the same circle so we know this is a right angle triangle and hypotenuse and the lengths are equal and also can you see from these two triangles or Y is given equal to o X that's given okay so here we know this is given and look at these two triangles these are right angle triangles so we can say according to this diagram or s Y triangle is congruent to Oh Q X triangle what's the reason reason is this is a right angle triangle and the hypotenuse and one side are equal so if these two triangles are congruent what can you say about the corresponding elements we can straight away write down s y is equal to Q X because these are corresponding elements so if this iqual now we'll multiply this by two so here s y x 2 + QX x 2 so when you multiply by 2 it becomes the whole length of the cord so here QX x 2 becomes PQ when you multiply this by 2 you get the cord is sum so we can straight away write down the cord SR is equal to PQ now we'll look at question number 2 so in this diagram it says vertices ABC of the triangle ABC lie on the circle with center the perpendicular is drawn from o to a B ah o to a b and b CR o x + o vy respectively if a X a X is equal to C Y so these two lengths are equal then prove that b AC b AC angle is equal to BC a so you need to show these two angles are equal so here what we need to prove we need to prove B 
,,AC angle is equal to BC a now look at the diagram here we see according to converse theorem when you draw a perpendicular from the center to the chord the chord bisects so here that means if this is equal to this one this is also equal to this one so here we can write straight away a X is equal to X B by C is equal to Y B according to converse theorem but we know these two also equal so when this is equal to this one when you multiply by two so what can you see when you multiply this by 2 a B is double of a X a B C is double of Y C and these two are equal that means we can say a B is equal to BC when you look at the ABC triangle these two lengths are equal means this is an isosceles triangle so the opposite lends to those equal angles are equal according to the isosceles triangle so here we can straight away write down the angle therefore B AC angle is equal to BC a angle so that's what we need to prove now we'll look at the third question so in the third question it says a b and b c are two equal chords so here two equal chords given so a B is equal to BC given and the center is all which are perpendicular to each other so here these chords are perpendicular to each other it's already marked prove that Oh X B Y is a square so here that means you have to show that all lengths are equal because we see all angles are 90 the extra properties all sides ah equal in a square so we'll try to show that now we know this a B chord is equal to BC chord cuz to equal called schema so when you take half of it because according to the converse theorem we know that a Y is equal to YB and B X equal to XC so that's the converse theorem because the chord bisects each other when you draw a perpendicular from the center so here when you are multiplying by two so that means this is equal to this but as this a B is equal to BC this is also equal to this one so what can you say up from this diagram according to this one we see YB is equal to B X so how do we know the this is also equal because this is a quadrilateral with 90 degree angles so here opposite you know the opposite lengths are equal either in a rectangle or a square so 
,,this side is equal to this side because opposite side so YB is equal to AU X as well as B X is equal to or Y so opposite plants are equal now what we can see all sides are equal according to this all sides are equal so we can say o XB by either square now we'll take the next question it says a B and a C are two chords of a circle with Center o the perpendicular drawn from o to AC is given OQ and if two times a B 2 times a B is equal to AC so that means 2 times a B is equal to AC prove that 
,,a B is equal to a cube so we need to show these two lenses equal so here what you need to prove a B is equal to aq now we'll say this is a chord and this is the center so here according to this one so here this is a perpendicular given we know this is 90 degrees if this is a perpendicular we know according to the converse theorem this length is equal to this length so here we can write down OQ according to converse theorem a Q is equal to Q C so here this length should be equal to this one 
,,according to converse theorem so when you multiply this by 2 what you get Q C double what you get so here when you multiply by 2 you get AC equals 2 times Q C and also this information is given so you have given AC is also equal to 2a B from these two what can you see 2 times Q C is equal to two times they'd be to get canceled out when you divide by two so you get a B equals QC so what is QC QC is same as a cube according to the converse theorem so here we can straight away write down a b is equal to a Q now we look at the miscellaneous exercise in your textbook so here they have given information about a circle so we'll take a circle now and we try to mark all these information a chord of a circle lies eight centimeter from the center so here when you want to mark this so here we take this is the chord so this is eight centimeter from the center so if the center is this so this perpendicular distance is given eight centimeters if the length of the chord is 12 so this whole length is 12 centimeters when you look at this length and find the radius of the circle now according to the Converse theorem when you draw a line perpendicular line 
,,from the center to the chord the chord bisects each other so what can you say about this chord if we put a B as the chord we can say you could see here a C length is equal to C B according to the Converse theorem now when you look at this triangle now so here full length is 12 for a B so what is the length AC half of 12 that's six centimeter and when you look at the triangle you see triangle we know this is six centimeters for AC and this is eight centimeters so this is a a is the radius of the circle so you want to find out the radius so use the Pythagoras theorem the hypotenuse squared is equal to the square term sum of square terms of the other two 
,,sides so 8 squared is 64 6 squared is 36 and when you take the square root of that you get 10 centimeters so what's the radius of this circle here so the radius is 10 centimeters now we'll look at the second question so here in this question it's given the radius of a circle with centre o is 5 centimeters so here how can I mark 
,,this I can mark this distance Oh a is the radius that's given five centimeters and the length of the chords a B and BC are six and eight a B 6 and these two lengths 
,,are equal means this is 3 and this is 3 because it's already given so that this length is 8 so when you divide by 2 we know this is 4 and this is for the midpoints of the chords are x and y so that's what it says equally divided find the perimeter of the quadrilateral or X B bar so you need to find out the perimeter of this so we'll try to find out now according to theorem 1 when you drop join the center and the midpoint of the chord the two lines are perpendicular so here they one and this one perpendicular so according to theorem number one this is perpendicular and this is also perpendicular so we can write down or X is perpendicular to a B and also so Y is perpendicular to BC so what can you say so these two are equal so we can write C Y is equal to B by that's four centimeters and we can write B X and X that's three centimeters now we know this is 90 degrees so what can you say about this diagram this is a rectangle so we can write all x be my is a rectangle because the 
,,angles inside ah all angles are 90 degrees so this is a rectangle so opposite sides are equal so how can you find out the perimeter of X V by we can add these two and multiply by 2 so here 4 and 3 give ur 4 plus 3 x 2 so here 4 plus 3 7 7 times 2 so the perimeter of this rectangle is 14 centimeters now we'll look at third question so in the third question it says the length of the chord a B of the circle with centre o is 8 centimeters so here a B length is given 8 centimeters the perpendicular drawn from Oh Kord intersects the cord at X and means the circle at y if X Y is equal to 3 centimeters this is 3 find the radius of the circle so when you look at this diagram so we'll connect this one Oh ay that's the radius so we'll put our here and also we know Oh Y is also the radius so if you take this one as radius so 
,,what is this length R minus 3 now we'll try to draw the small triangle when you draw the small triangle we see this is R and this is this length is R minus 3 and what about this height it's given the a B chord length is 8 centimeters now according to the converse serum when you draw a perpendicular from the center to the chord the chord bisects so with this information we can write a to this length is half of 8 so 4 centimeters so when you look at this triangle it's a right angle triangle so you can use Pythagoras theorem to find out ah so according to Pythagoras theorem the hypotenuse squared is equal to square out the sum of square terms of the other two lengths so 4 squared plus R minus 3 squared now try to simplify 4 squared is 16 when you expand brackets can you remember now when you expand brackets what you 
,,get our squared plus square of the last term that's 9 double of the middle two terms minus 6 R is equal to R square now can you see R squared get cancel out so here 
,,we'll take minus 6 are to this side that becomes plus 6 R is 16 plus 9 so what's the answer 16 plus 9 is 25 6 R is 25 so what's our value 25 divided by 6 so roughly 
,,how much 6 times 4 24 1 over 6 centi meters because the lens are given in centimeters now we'll look at question number 4 so in question number 4 it says a B is a chord of a circle bit Center o and the midpoint of the chord is X so already mark these two lengths are equal the point C lies on the line drawn from X through the point O so here this is the 9 proved that AC ad is equal to BC AC is equal to you have to show that to be proved AC equals BC now we look at the big triangles a X C triangle and XB c triangle when you look at this triangle we know that ax is equal to xB and also we know this is perpendicular according to theorem number one when you draw a line joining the same and the midpoint of the cord these two are perpendicular so here we can say see X a angel' is equal to CX p angle so that's 90 degrees 
,,according to theorem 1 and also we know CX is common so here angle and two sides side angle side and also we know this this angle is the included angle so this is the included angle to these two lengths so we can say straight away a XC triangle is congruent to XB c triangle what's the reason side angle side so if these two are congruent we can straight away write down AC is equal to BC because the corresponding elements are equal so that's how we can show that AC is equal to PC now we'll look at fifth question so you have given a diagram and it says PQ and PR are two cords PQ and PR with center o the perpendiculars drawn from all two PQ o - PQ it's given Oh X and the other side it's all Y if X r XR + qy are straight lines prove that PQ equals P R so you need to show these two lengths I equals so to be proved PQ is equal to P now when you look at these two triangles and see what we can find out we take o xq triangles and all Y our triangle what you know we know this is 90 degrees so here o xq angle is equal to o why are it's 90 degrees cuz it's perpendicular to the cause and then we know this angle is equal to this angle Y what's the reason opposite angles are equal so we can write x or Q is equal to Y or so the reason is opposite angle opposite angles are equal now look at these two triangles BC o Q is equal to or what's that that's the radius OQ and O are radii so radii of the same circle now according to this angle angle and a side so we can say Oh xq triangle is congruent to Oh Y our triangle what's the reason this is angle angle side so if these two triangles are congruent what can you say about the corresponding elements so we can say opposite to this angle is X cube X Q is equal to opposite to this one is y ah so that's corresponding elements now when you double that what happens so when you double both sides 2x q is equal to two Y R so here we know if when you draw the perpendicular the chord bisects each other so that means this is also same length if it's this one this is also same length now we found out these also same let's so here when you double it you get PQ when you double why are you get PR 
,,so we can see that PQ is equal to PR now we'll look at question number six so this is also about a circle so we'll take a circle and try to draw the given information a chord of length 24 centimeters lies five centimeter away from the center of the circle so this is the center so there's a chord you'll take a B and the length is given 24 centimeters and it's away from Center means the perpendicular distance is given five centimeters and another chord lies 12 centimeter from the center find 
,,its length so here there's another chord 12 centimeters away from the center so we'll draw another chord some somewhere here and this length is given 12 centimeters 
,,and you are asked to find out the length of this chord so we'll put CD or something so how can we do that now according to the given information we know if you drop 
,,when you draw the perpendicular line the chord bisects each other so here if this is 24 what is this half of this we'll put C here now we'll put take another letter 
,,m and we'll take in here so what is the length of a M that's half of 24 that's 12 centimeters if you take this triangle what can you say about this triangle it's a right angle triangle and one side is 5 centimeter this side is twelve so we can't find out the radius of the circle so we will put our here so how can we find we can 
,,use Pythagoras theorem so we can use r-squared is PI squared plus twelve squared and when you simplify this is 25 plus 144 you get 169 have you find out our square root of 169 so what is square root of 169 you get 13 centimeters so we know the radius of this circle is 13 centimeter now we can think about this triangle this is also radius so when you take this triangle in OC triangle what you know we know this is 12 and OC the radius we already found that's equal to thirteen centimeters and 
,,you can find out this length we'll put X or something so again this is a right angle triangle you can use Pythagoras theorem so according to Pythagoras theorem you can write the hypotenuse squared is equal to 12 squared plus x squared 12 squared is 144 13 squared is 169 when you take 144 to the next side you get x squared is equal to 169 minus 144 that's equal to 25 so when you take the square root of 25 you get 5 centimeters so here we found C in length is 5 centimeters now how can we find out the length of CD we know when you draw a perpendicular from the center to the chord the chord bisects so that means this length is equal to this length when you double that you get the length CD so have you find out the length CD double of C n so what is seeing here we found that's five centimeters so 2 times 5 centimeter you get 10 centimeter as the length of the other chord now we'll look at question number seven so question number seven is also about a circle and it's given the vertices ABC of the equilateral triangle ABC so it's given this is an equilateral triangle that means all sides are equal so here a B is equal to BC is equal to AC because it's given in Greek lateral triangle and also what are the other information given Center is oh the perpendicular is drawn from o to a B is o X and when you draw 
,,the other perpendicular line it's Oh Y and the other one is OC prove that Oh X is equal to o y is equal to Z so you need to prove oh x2 Oh Y is equal to OC now when 
,,you look at this triangle equilateral triangle all these sides are equal and also according to the converse theorem when you draw the perpendicular line from the center the chord bisects so here this length is equal to this length and also we know all these sides are equal means all these lens are equal because caused by sex each other so here first thing you can write down B Z is equal to Z C is equal to all these lengths are equal so you can write what's the reason converse of theorem one about odds so here when you take all these lengths we can see that ABC is an equilateral triangle and all these lengths are equal now I want to draw a line here and I want to compare these two triangles so we'll take Oh Z see triangle and OC why triangle what can you say about these two triangles so here these lengths are equal and this is a right angle triangle so here hypotenuse is common that's a common link and also we know Z C is equal to C by that's already done here so here hypotenuse and one side equal means we can say Oh Z see triangle is congruent to Y C so congruent triangles because what's the reason right angle triangle hypotenuse and one side if these two are equal the corresponding elements also equals so I can write Oh why is equal to o see corresponding elements now here we found these two are equal now if you take other way around these two triangles I can prove the same thing so here when I if I draw this line I can show that the two triangles I can write 
,,similarly so I write here similarly similarly I can say according to OB x triangle and B Z or triangle I can say o X should equal to Z that's also same reason right 
,,hand right angle hypotenuse and a site so if you know these two are equal what can you say Z is equal to or Y again ozzie equals o X so therefore I can say oh X is equal to o by equals to Z now we will look at the last question in your textbook so here again this is about a circle PQ n RS are two chords of a circle with centre o the perpendicular is drawn from o to P Q and R is ax o xn o why already given perpendicular and you have to show that P Q squared so this one so you need to show PQ squared is minus R s squared is equal to 4 Oh Y squared minus 4x square so you need oh why this one and P Q P Q length and RS now I'll draw a triangle yeah I'll connect these two lengths what are those two I know this visa radii so I can write o Q is equal to OS and I'll put R for that those are radii of the same circle now when you look at this one so these are two perpendiculars drawn from the center according to converse theorem what can you say when you draw a perpendicular from the center to the chord the chord bisects so that means these two lengths are equal and also this one these two lengths are equal so we can write down X Q is equal to P X 
,,as well as our Y is equal to YS because converse theorem so when you look at XQ here I can write down using pythagoras theorem a small equation when you look at or xq triangle o xq triangle what I can write I can write x q square plus X or you write o X or x squared is equal to R square and here X cube is there what is X cube half of PQ now why I am using PQ there because you have to show this one in this equation we don't have X cube so we can write in terms of X Q so I need to convert that to PQ so I can write instead of X cube that's equal to PQ divided by 2 and i can write o x squared that's equal to R square and I can simplify this what I get P Q 
,,squared over 2 squared becomes 4 plus o x squared is equal to R squared I I want to multiply the whole thing by 4 so I get P Q squared plus 4 times x squared is equal to 4 R squared so we take this minus first equation now we will take the other triangle when you take other triangle oh by s triangle what can you say about this triangle I can write according to Pythagoras theorem R squared is equal to y squared plus y squared again in the given equation by s is not there so I can try in terms of our s so what can I write I can write instead of this this is equal to RS divided by two then simplify this I get R squared is over I squared plus R squared over four when you square 2 you get 4 multiply everything by 4 you get 4 R squared is equal to 4 0 y squared plus R squared now we'll take this one as second equation now look at 1 & 2 what you get you get 4 R squared here for R squared here so these two are equal so I can equate 1 & 2 and write P Q squared plus 4 or x squared is equal to 4 y squared plus R squared now look at the given one that you have to show PQ square is there here we can take RS square to this side so when I take this one to this side and we'll move this one to the right hand side so I can write down P Q squared minus R squared is equal to so this one right as it is and I'm moving for Oh X square to the other side - for Oh X squared now see we got the same thing so that's how we can prove this so in this lesson we learnt about two theorems so the first theorem says when you join the same and the midpoint of the cord the cord and the lime vodka perpendicular and what's the converse theorem we learned when you draw a perpendicular from the center to the chord the chord bisects so when you get questions related to chords make sure that you apply those two theorems

Circle,VTCo-aUzwEE,hello children welcome to my maths class starting from grade 6 to 11. as you know you overcome a big hurdle in your life that's your scholarship exam again you have 
,,to take a challenge in your life that's your o-level exam so join with me you can overcome all your difficulties in maths maths is not hard it is a really easy subject and it's fun if you're good at maths you can succeed in any field so stay with me i'll teach you all the basic concepts related to maths so the first lesson in your textbook is circles so in this lesson we'll identify items which have the circular shape and circular designs using items which have the circular shapes what is the name of this figure you already know that that's a circle so we can write the name of this figure is a circle right several objects you know having a circular shape what are the shapes what about this one we all have this with us coins so coins are circular shape and what about this one this is a cd compact disk what about this you like to eat yogurt so this is circular shape yogurt cup class so you get circular shape you can write glass what else plate what about this one these are t strainers so here when you take this one is a circular shape what about when you go to the carnival what you see going round and round very sweet when you take vehicles tire tire off the vehicle girls what about this you need this letter makeup powder puff so you can write makeup powder puffs then in the kitchen have you seen safe so all these are circular shapes so every day you see circular shape figures and solids now we will see how we can draw circles so you need to know how to do it properly so draw three circles with the help of a two rupee coin so you know you get two types of two rupee coin the smaller one and the bigger one so i'll take the bigger one and show you how to draw it properly so you what you do you keep it on your paper and then you hold it with your finger in the middle and then you draw it properly so here you can start from one end like this go round and round but you have to hold it tight so that's how we draw a proper circle so we'll draw three circles so keep it here and you can draw round and round but make sure that you hold it properly another circle so hold it with a finger and draw around it so that you get a nice circle so here we drew three circles with the two rupee coin now we'll take the next one draw a circle using a compact disk so that's easy because it's a big one so here you get a small circle in the middle as well as outer circle so we'll draw the outer circle so keep it here and then you hold it with your finger in the middle and then you draw it round so that's how you draw it properly see how you draw the circle then what we have to do draw a circle using a bottle top so we'll take a bottle top keep it here hold it tightly in the middle and then draw round the circle so you get nice circles what about the other one draw three circles using 
,,a five rupee coin that's a small one so this is five rupee coin so we'll keep it here and try to draw it hold it in the middle and draw it around the circle here we'll draw another one two circles you need three circles so we'll take it and draw it again so round and round so you'd better to take a sharpened pencil to draw circles another one here now we'll see another two circles using a small glass so i have a not a very small one i'll try to draw this circle so keep it here on top of your paper and hold it with the finger and make sure that you draw the circle with one try so we'll start from here and then go round and round here so how many circles you need to draw two circles so here again we'll try again keep it tightly hold it with the finger and then we'll start from here and with one try you have to complete the full circle if you can't do it then take another try so we did glass now we need to draw two circles using carom disk so that's a small one small circle we'll try to draw this so how many circles you need two circles so keep it and hold this with the finger and then try to draw it properly so with one try like this we'll take another one hold it tight in the middle and then right round with one try sometimes it's difficult when you have bigger ones it's difficult to go around with one try now what's the next one so by using various items to draw circles do the sizes of the circles differ or not look at carefully what do you think about the sizes those are not the same so we can write differ or not sizes are different this is an activity for you i did with two rupee coin now you have to do four circles using one rupee coin so again you get two types of coins a smaller one rupee coin and a bigger one so you can try with both so try to draw four circles using one rupee coin so take it keep on top of on your paper hold it tightly and try to draw the circle with one try now we'll look at this one draw a small circle using a small glass on a piece of paper cut along margin with a pair of scissors so take colored paper and cut a circle like this so this is the circle and then fold the above circle 
,,right into two and draw a broken line along this fold so you have to take the circle so fold it into two parts like this and then what you have to do you have to draw a broken line like this then what's the next step you have to fold the circle right into two other directions so again another way like this fold it and you can again take it here and fold it again like this then what you do when you draw the lines you get something like this so after you fold it when you draw broken lines you get something like this so all the broken lines meet at a point do you agree with that when you take all these broken line what is this point this is the point of intersection so what is the name given to this point this is not in your syllabus but i'll teach you because it's a small word so try it now we call it center of the 
,,circle so how we write center c e n t r e this is british way we are writing er also okay that's american way so we got used to write center c e and tre center of the circle so that's the intersecting point look at this circle write the distance from center or to the point p so how can we measure you can take the ruler take the 
,,ruler and we need to measure op length so keep the zero point on the center point and then you can keep it like this and measure the length so what's the length from here to here i get 4 centimeters so this is op distance is 4 centimeters now write the distance from the center to the point q so we'll take the ruler and here we'll rotate and see and you have to keep it here on top of the center and measure so that's also 4 centimeters write the distance from the center o to the point r r is 
,,here so i'll rotate this i'll take this i have to take this way because starting from zero so i'll keep it here and then rotate it so here this distance that's also 
,,4 centimeters write the distance from the center o to the point s so we'll take any point s here i'll take s here now we'll try to measure so i'll just keep the s this zero point on the center and measure this distance that's also 4 centimeters so we can see all these lengths are equal so o p o q o r o s all these lengths are equal that's four centimeters each of these distances is known by the name what you call that this is not in your syllabus but it's good to know all these terms so we 
,,call that's the radius radius of a circle a circle has many radii all are equal in length so when you take all these radius we call the fruital term radii so all these radii are equal in length look at this one you get three circles what's the center center is o point so what are the radii o a that's a small circle what about ob that's the inner circle the other circle and oc is the radius of the outer circle measure the length of these radii so we'll take the ruler and try to measure all these so we can keep zero point on top of this center point and we get oa is two point seven two point seven centimeters then you can measure here to here now what's 
,,that four point four four point four centimeters for ob what about oc from here to here you get five point nine five point 5.9 centimeters that's oc so what can you 
,,say about these values all are different so center and the radius of a circle is not in your grade six new syllabus but it is good to know so here we can see when you take different size of circles the radius values are different so radii are different values look at this circle is the point x inside outside the circle so here this is a circle it's inside so we call this area is inside out of that we call outside the circle so the point x is inside the circle where is the point y situated that's on the circle we call it it's on the circle where is the point z that's outside the circle so now you know how to identify whether any point is inside or outside or on the circle look at this circle write the points situated inside the circle what are the points inside we get a p q those are inside write the point situated on the circle on the circle you get y z and x write the point situated outside the circle what are the points outside k l m k l s those are the points outside the circle mark points a b c inside the circle so this is the circle you have to mark three points inside a b c mark points p q r is outside the circle so outside you can put p q r s mark points klm on the circle so you can mark on the circle k l m three points on the circle using a ruler mark six points six centimeter away from point o so we'll take this is point o and we'll measure six centimeter length so from here we can mark six centimeter length so i'll keep a dot here six marked another point six centimeter away from point o so i can rotate this but center is the same i can mark another six centimeter again rotate six centimeter here again you can rotate this and mark six centimeter away here again rotate this and keep the center point and the zero point together and mark six centimeter away from that so likewise mark more points first 10 more points and then we'll increase the number of points further so another point here six centimeters away another point here six centimeters away make sure that you keep the center and the o point together and then another point so likewise when you mark more points likewise manner increase the number of points still further what you get so we are drawing now more points we are drawing more points here what you get now increasing again so i'm drawing more points in between i'll draw it here also more points what can i say just observe when you draw the when you draw more points in between you see a special ship what's that ship okay so last one we'll take this one so what you see so what is the shape you are getting so you get a circle so this is the center point so what is the shape 
,,you get you get a so you get a circle considering o to be the center so this is o is the center what is the diagram of obtain all such points equal distance from o r joint so what's the name here to here we use that word radius so equal distance when you mark points around one fixed point you get a circle so this is a circle so 
,,what you call this point in the middle that's the center of the circle what about the shape shape is a circle and what you call this distance from the center to the 
,,circle we call it as radius so you are you learned three words the shape is a circle the center point is the center of the circle and the equal distance from center 
,,to the circle is called radius draw two circles on a straight line a b using a 5 rupee coin so what you can do take 5 rupee coin keep on top of this line and draw the circle so you need two circles so i use this tool to draw circles but you have to use five rupee coin so i'll draw circles like this so imagine my 5 rupee coin is 
,,like this and i can draw two circles so i'll take another copy and keep it here so these are the two circles i'll keep it here and here on a b line so you can use five rupee coin to draw circles like this with the help of two rupee coin draw several circles to make a design color these in various shades so think about this is the two rupee coin and you can take how many circles several circles so i'll take three and try to make a design so i'll keep one here and i'll take another one and i'll keep it like this and i'll take another one and keep it like this so you get a design like this now we'll try to color that so i'll use colors in rainbow so one fairy came in violet and one more indigo i'll take this color indigo in blue green yellow orange red so these are the rainbow colors so all seven colors are there so 
,,you can use any shade to collect with the help of a two rupee coin draw a different design and color this so take a two rupee coin and you can create another design 
,,so i'll take something like this something like this and we'll try to color this one so i used how many circles i used i used four circles here so i can shade it i'll use different colors now i'll use this one green color and another green color here and here and i'll make it in the middle light colors purple something like this and something like this a design you can create your own design and color it using a larger one rupee coin draw a design and color it so we'll take one rupee coin so this is my one rupee coin will try to make a design now so i can i'll make it smaller i'll do smaller one rupee coin and the big one rupee coin something like this and now i'll try to color that so different colors you can use and i'll put red color in the middle something like that you can create your own design in the diagram shown above shade the area common to both circles so this is one circle there's a another circle overlaps with the first circle so which area is common for both that's b area so shade it with a color so i can shade like this so that's the area common to both the circles shade the circles shown in this diagram so you get a rectangle shape and a circle so they're asking just to color the circle part so that's the circle in this diagram shared the remaining area inside the rectangle leaving 
,,out the circle so not the circle and outside the circle but inside the rectangle so which area this area so we'll try to color that so i'll use red color to color this so that's the area outside the circle and inside the rectangle look at this diagram how many circles are there in this diagram so i see one two three three circles are there so i'll right three circles are there write the letters pertaining to the shaded areas so these are the shaded ones a and b is not shaded c and e those are shaded write the letters pertaining to the unshaded area unshaded paths are d those are iron shaded part as well as as well as i can write f also f is not shaded 
,,how many equal parts is this circle divided so here this is the circle divided into how many parts two equal parts how many parts are shaded out of two one part is shaded look at this circle now how many equal parts in this circle are divided so one two three four four equal parts are there and how many parts are shaded just one part shaded so one part shaded now look at this one how many equal parts is this circle divided one two three there are three equal parts how many parts are shaded 
,,only one part shaded so you can write one part shaded look at this one how many equal parts is this circle divided one two three four five six seven eight one two three four five six seven eight parts are there so eight how many parts are shaded one two two parts are shaded look at this one write the numbers inside the circle inside the circle is this so what are the numbers there one 3 twice written 7 9 so you don't need to write 3 again so 1 3 7 9. write the numbers inside the rectangle but outside the circle inside the rectangle but outside the circle these numbers 0 2 4 6 8 0 2 4 6 8. look at this diagram in this diagram shade the areas common to all three circles write the relevant letters one two three so this region is a common region so this part is the common region so what's the letter relevant letter is e that's e how many circles are there in this diagram so we can circle it and see we'll count this is one two three four five and six so how many circles are there 
,,there are six circles in this diagram how many circles are there in this diagram so we can start from here one two three four five six seven eight nine and 10 so there are 10 circles how many circles are there in this diagram one two three four and five so all together five circles are there in this diagram shared all four circles in this diagram so there are four circles we'll shade it this one i'll use different colors this is a another circle this is another circle and this is the other 
,,one so four circles are there how many half circles are there in this diagram half circles so we'll try to draw it and see so this is one half one this is another one two three and this one is four so you get four half circles in this diagram now look at this one this is in your textbook so here you can you see there's a purple 
,,color circular card is there and several shapes cd disk what about this one clock a drum is there and a tin whisker tip so those are circular shapes figures exercise 1.1 from the following item select and write down the ones in which the circular shape can be observed mathematics book textbook that's not circular that's a rectangle drum yes you get a circular shape in drop cricket but that's not circular that's like oval shape here in the corner so that's like here not a circular shape oval shape see if in the kitchen you get see that's a circular shape figure we knowing fan so we knowing fan also it's a circular figure wheel of vehicle yes that's circular steering wheel of a car that's a circular one teaspoon that's like oval shape so something like this so not circular pot so when you take the mouth of the pot something like this yeah some pots yes this mouth of the pot is circular shape exercise 1.2 from the following collection of items given below select the ones that can be used to draw circles and write down the corresponding numbers with the bottle yes we can draw a circle here this nut but if you take outside you can't but you can draw circles with the inside this circle so you can draw circles with the inside part this one code yes you can draw eraser you can't do drum yes this is a circular shaped figure and this is a prism you can't draw circles from that so you can here you can with the inside not with the outside here these three shapes you can draw circular shapes from the figure shown below select those which are circles and write down the corresponding numbers this is like oval shape not circle here this is a small circle this is a circle and this one is a circle all the others are not circles this is half of a circle in this figure which letters indicate positions inside the circle so look at carefully and write down the points inside the circle you get o a and point p inside the circle which letters indicate positions on the circle on the circle e l b x e l b x on the circle which let us indicate positions outside the circle what are the points outside just k k is outside the circle in a competition of throwing darts onto a circular board by standing at a location in front of it 10 points are awarded if the dart hits the circle so that means on the circle you get ten marks and five points are awarded if the dart hits inside of the circle but no points are awarded if the dart hits outside of the circle so how you 
,,get marks 10 points awarded when you hit on the circle and five points for uh inside and no marks given for outside points now look at this one who are the students 
,,who were awarded 10 points 10 points given if it's on the circle so sanjeeva sanjiva then who else mohan so sanjeeva and mohan get 10 marks who are the students who 
,,were awarded five points that means inside the circle sunil nafil and pradeep so they get 5 points each who are the students who did not receive any points rajita didn't get any points if each of these student is given two more opportunities to throw dats what is the maximum number of points that mohan could receive in total so 
,,mohan now gets 10 marks so already 10 marks so again giving another two opportunities so what's the maximum number so another 10 and 10 so all together 30 marks he can get which of this one is given two more opportunities to throw dots what is the maximum number of points that mohan could receive in total so you if he can get another two tens so the maximum is 30 marks look at these designs three circular designs created using circles are shown below such designs can frequently be seen on clothing materials festivals decorations and in religious places so how many circles used to draw this one how many 1 2 3 4 5 6 seven circles used to draw this one what about this one one two three four five six seven eight 10 11 12 13 14 circles used to draw this one so how many circles here one two three four five 6 7 8 9 10 10 circles so you can create different designs using circles now we'll see to create another design so i'll take these circles and try to create a design so how many circles are there something like that one two three four five six circles you can create a different pattern look at this one we see how many circles i used to create this one so we'll see we'll count and see you get a small circle here one two three four and five circles using five circles you can create that design we'll take another one we'll count afterwards how many circles i'm using to create this one what do you think i'm trying to do what's the shape what do you think that's my tree 
,,i'll put it here so these are the branches so my circle trick so you can create different designs using circles we'll try to create another design one two three two 
,,three i'm trying to create a symmetric pattern with circles so so you can create your own design yes count how many circles i'm using yes see you can create beautiful designs one two three four five six seven eight nine ten 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 circles i used to create this design so in this lesson we looked at all types of circular shapes and now you know how to draw a circle properly and how you create beautiful designs using circles

Circle,nSNKX0k9kKs&t=5s,hi there and welcome to another video video 7 and this is the tutorial on circles as always with these videos these are help to students who have previously done the foundation paper and trying the higher paper and the explanations of the topics that are coming up in the higher AQA unit 3 and that a previous foundation students 
,,should be able to do okay this topic is circles it's going to build on our knowledge from foundation topics of circles and we're going to show how we can answer the 
,,higher questions there after you've done this video I expect that you would have a revision card that summarizes this video and then you move on to the accompanying 
,,video 8 and past paper exam questions on circles okay let's start straightaway okay here we have a circle and this is the center of the circle and so we need to be able to label some key things about the circle now a line from the center to the perimeter of a circle or the outside of a circle is called a radius okay that's a radius there and the distance around the outside of a circle has a special name and that's called circumference the circumference is the perimeter of a circle circles have their own name for the perimeter perimeter now a line joining from the scomp one inch of this compass the other going through the center okay this needs to go through the center is called a diameter so this here is called a diameter okay and going through the center and it's clear that the diameter is to lots of the radius so the diameter is always two times the radius now how would you remember these these terms well radius is like a sunray is a line coming out from the center from the center of the Sun like a ray so radius you might remember whay diameters just double the radius d4 double and the circumference is the distance around the outside starts the same as a circle there are a couple of other things we should really know about a circle and we should know the following and the area enclosed by two radii of a circle so this sort of but this area here in it is what's known as a sector that's a sector it's almost like a slice of a piece of circular part a sector is this area enclosed in here and this is where the higher Circle Circle work focuses on it really focuses on sectors and apart length of a circumference a a little part of the circumference like this amount here in this sector that amount of curved distance there that's not the whole circumference that's part of this conference and we call it an arc okay or not length okay so they're the main things a couple of other things that you you might know but they're the ones that come up most often so just focus your attention on learning those now you should know from foundation work the area of a whole circle the area of a whole circle is PI R squared okay and you must be able to remember that that's not given in the formula booklet I remember it because I think areas usually units are centimeters squared or meters square hence I've got I know pi is going to be in there R squared the square matches with the unit that's how I tend to remember okay and the other thing you need to know 
,,is the distance around the outside of a circle how to work it out okay the distance around the outside how to work out the circumference well that is 2 PI R and the 
,,way I remember it if I remember the area 1 I just bring down the 2 in front and I've got 2 pi R as a circumference so if I can remember the area 1 I almost get the circumference 1 for free ok what do these things mean well PI R square means pi times R times R and two PI R means two times pi times R okay that's how we used those 
,,formulas there just want to show you on a picture of a calculate where the PI button is and because it in higher you don't want to be using pi is 3.14 as you might have done in foundation you want to use the PI button on your calculator so on this picture of a calculator I know a lot of people got it the PI button is actually here and you have to press shift that button to get pi and you'll get PI you need to find on your calculator where the PI button is okay so key things here you need to know what a sector is an arc length they're the two new bits of information probably for you and you should know radius diameter and circumference and you should know the two key formulas that the area of a circle is PI R squared and the circumference is 2 PI R okay I'm going to do a couple of questions now and I don't want to 
,,show you most of this is foundation so how to work out areas and and circumference --is of circles and then we're going to move on to some genuine hire paper circle 
,,circle work but this foundation what does come up as well so let's take a look at some questions here we go there are four questions there and I want to show you and how to set your working out properly and to get the answer right every time okay here's a circle it says find the area the first thing I would do I always write down what I know about the circle I know that the radius is three okay centimeters I always want to write down the radius okay at some point before I start the question I also know the area formula of a circle the area okay well areas measures are centimeter squared meter squared so I'm going to remember this isn't in the form of Bukit that the area of a circle is PI R squared okay PI R squared so to work out the area of this circle I do PI times 3 times 3 and I would get if I say round to one decimal place twenty-eight point three centimeters squared okay and I'm done quite easy now want you to want to make a really big point about this in the higher paper they tend to say leave your answer to the area in terms of pie okay so they don't want to work down two decimal places they want it in terms of pie well in most calculators if you type PI times 3 times 3 they will leave it in terms of pi and it would be 9 pi okay and if your calculator doesn't do that for you the unit again is centimeter square if your calculator doesn't do that for you just leave the pie alone forget about the pie and multiply all the numbers it left together and then whatever you get so 3 times 3 here is the 9 and write your pi after so this is a hire paper sort of question instead of using in the foundation you would had that question and it would say using pi is 3.14 now either if we're doing it decimal places we find the PI button on our calculator or we give it algebraically in terms of pi okay this next one find the circumference of this circle well what did they tell us they tell us the diameter is 8 so I want you to always write down your radius is therefore 4 centimeters okay you need to remember the formula for the circumference with a circumference is is like the area formula but you bring down the 2 is to 2 pi R which means 2 times pi times R which we said is 4 okay if you work that out on your calculator you get say to one decimal place 25 point one twenty five point one and the unit here is circumference is distance so it's centimeters if you were to leave your answer in terms of pi 2 times pi times 4 just times the numbers forget about the pi and write the pi after that would be 8 pi centimeters again this is a higher level at a higher paper type question okay next question find area of 
,,this here which is a semicircle what did they tell you well they tell you the diameter is 10 so always write down your radius your radius is therefore 5 centimeters 
,,the area of a whole circle let's work at the area of a whole circle with these features well that's PI R squared PI R squared which is pi times 5 times 5 and which we would get as 78 point five centimeters squared so the area of a semicircle is 1/2 that so you would have into 1/2 times 78 point 5 centimeter squared and you would get twenty nine point three so twenty thirty so thirty nine point three centimeters square if you left it in terms of of pi here you would have had a half times and this would be PI R squared sort of beam pi times five times five and you would have got 12.5 PI centimeters squared okay okay find the perimeter here while they tell you the radius is six now be very careful here this is one little extra technicality R if you if you were to work out that distance there that would be half the circumference of a circle but if they want the perimeter of this shape they also want you to add in this straight-line distance here so do not forget about that so the half-ass cumference so half a circumference would be equal to well it would be 1/2 times 2 pi r 2 times pi times R which is 6 ok and if you work that on your calculator leaving it in terms of pi 4 now I would just get 12 pi okay and don't forget to add in this green distance here so we would have to add on to that 6 and 6 which is 12 so the total perimeter would 12 pi plus 12 okay and if we actually work that out to 1dp it would be forty nine point seven forty nine point seven centimeters 
,,okay so hopefully you found that quite useful just refreshing some of the knowledge you had from foundation next thing we need to move on to genuine high-level topics involving circles let's take a look now if it is a genuine hi paper question like a B or an A grade question they tend to be about sectors of circles I parts of a 
,,circle so here is an overall circle and let's say the radius here was 10 centimeters okay and they might ask you could you work out the area of this sector here they might say to you what is the area of this part of the circle here okay that's a higher grade question they also might ask you what is the length of that distance there so there are two higher level topics but it's actually very very straightforward because you just use your knowledge of normal circles so let's take a look let's go for the area one first the area okay now how would you work out the area of that well how much of the whole circle do I have I know angles around a point add to 
,,360 degrees so how much of the circle is contained here with this I've got 60 degrees out of 360 okay and I multiply that by PI R squared because that's the area of 
,,a whole circle okay so I would work out 60 over 360 that's how much of the circle I've got multiplied by pi times ten times ten okay and it's as simple as that if I 
,,was writing that to one decimal place I would get myself an area there of 52 points a four two meters squared okay and it's as simple as that in general if that wasn't 60 if it was some angle theta a theta degrees the area the general formula of the area I'm just going to rub this out now to make a general formula of the error the general formula the error is how much time we've got theta over 360 multiplied by PI R squared and that is your formula for the area of a sector okay what about an arc length this green thing here is the arc length how would we work out that curve distance well it's very similar how much of the circle do you have when in this case you've got 60 out of 360 and you've got that fraction of the circumference and this conference is 2 PI R so you would do 60 over 360 times 2 times pi times 10 
,,and you would work that out on your calculator and rounding to say 1 DP here I would get ten point five centimeters because it's a distance there okay so in general 
,,I'll rub that out now in general what's the formula for the arc length well it's very like the area it's the fraction of the circle we have theta over 360 ok multiplied by two PI R which would have been a whole circle it's as simple as that okay and that is your art clip now one last point to just say here just say they asked you for the perimeter of that shape having found the arc length you'd have to add in the 10 and the 10 again two radii ok so just be careful if they're asking the perimeter of that shape or just the arc length which is the curved section okay we're going to do some questions now and very using this knowledge here and these are all a high grade topics so work through these with me make a revision card and you should be ready to do the exam questions then so let's take a look okay find the area of this sector well we're working out area here let's write down what we know the radius is equal to five centimeters okay so how much of the surfer do we have let's work area well we've got 60 out of 360 degrees of a circle and we're going to times that by PI times five times R squared times five okay now you could write that 
,,two decimal places but if I just do 60 out of 360 and times pi I would get the answer there I would get is thirteen point one centimeters squared if you left it in terms of pi well 60 over 360 simplifies to a six as a fraction a six times five times five is 25 over six pi okay so that is the equivalent answer centimeter squared 
,,okay find the area of this sector well the area they said to be very careful not to fall for a simple trick this is this here a sector has to be bound with inside a 
,,circle so 60 degrees isn't the angle Willie we're interested in we're interested in this angle here which must be 300 so how much of the circle do we have well we have 300 out of 360 times pi times R squared which is 5 times 5 and we can work that out the normal way and we get sixty five point four centimeters square or leaving 
,,it in terms of pi if you left it in terms of pi you would get 125 over six PI centimeters squared okay now it says find the arc length here well the arc length is just there just interested in the curve bit today in that section so they're just interested in the curve bit how much of the circle do we have have sixty out of 360 times pi times five times five a slight mistake here sorry 60 out of 360 times two times pi times R which is five okay so if you go ahead and work that out you'll get yourself five point two five point two centimeters or leaving it in terms of pi pi you would get five thirds pi centimeters okay I find the perimeter where the perimeter is almost the exact same shape so we need that curve distance but also don't forget to add in the radius here once and the radius again twice so it would just 
,,be the answer above which is five point two plus 10 which would give me fifteen point two centimeters or we would get five thirds pi plus ten centimeters unlikely they would ask in this form here more likely they would ask it in that type of form there so that's all you really need to know about areas and perimeters of circles in the higher level so we had to know all this stuff we knew for foundation plus how to work out the area and perimeter of safe arcs or sectors in circles so I hope you find the following useful move on straight away to the next video which will be video eight on all the exam questions that have come up on circles in a great unit three higher thank you for watching

Circle,hU0HMvuXqYQ,hello children today i'm here to teach you circles that's chapter 18. so can you remember in grade 6 first lesson we did circles there we took several objects and we drew circles in this lesson we are drawing circles by handling a pair of compasses identify what the center radius diameter of a circle and create circle designs using a pair of compasses grade six we used several objects to draw circles now we are using compass to draw circles in grade six you have started to learn how to draw circles using different objects so we use two rupee coins five rupee coins and then you can use a small glass to draw a circle and a bangle and a carom disc so if you are still not okay with drawing circles practice again take a two rupee coin five rupee coin a glass bangle and caramel disc and see whether you can draw circles 
,,properly so this is a circle drawn using a glass and then what you can do you can fold it into four equal parts so fold it half again fold it another half you get these folded lines so what are a b and c d those are folded lines fold it line here and this is also folded line then the intersecting point of a b and c d is the point o using the protractor measure and write down the angles so what you can do you can take the protractor and we can measure the angle keep the projector here and you can measure aoc this angle so what's the angle 90 degrees and we can measure boc angle as well that's also 90 degrees what about aod so you can turn upside down and measure the other two angles so what's a od angle this angle that's 90 degrees and b or d angle that's also 90 degrees so when you fold it twice you get each angle is 90 degrees measure and write down the lengths o a o b o c o d so we can measure so we'll take the ruler ao here to here 5.4 ob 5.4 and we'll measure this one okay now we'll measure o d here you get the same length 5.4 oc 5.4 so we see all the lengths are 5.4 centimeters are all lengths above equal yes all are equal what is the name given to those lines can you remember we discuss in grade six we call center to this point is radius so those are radial what is the name radius what is the 
,,name of the point o o is the intersecting point of the two folded lines this point the center center of the circle that's the center of the circle when drawing circles using objects not possible to change the size of the circle as required we all know if it's a bangle so you can draw the size of that bangle a circle with that size you can't change it so how can we draw circles with different sizes so this is one method you can take a thread pin and the pencil so take the thread here if this is a thread attach it this thread to a pin here so this is the pin and here you can attach the pencil this is pencil now what you can do you can rotate this when you rotate this you get a circle so you can draw the circle so here this is the pin and this is the pencil and this is the thread when you take the pencil around this 
,,one you get a circle so that's one way you can draw circles so what's the other way to draw circles that's using the compass so look at this circle what are the parts of a circle above circle is drawn keeping compass on point o so you can keep the compass here and the other end you get the pencil so when you draw it you get this circle so o is the center of the circle and distance between the compass and the pencil is the op distance and it is called the radius so this is the radius and radius and the center of the circle should be known to draw a circle so if you want to draw a circle you need to know the length of the radius using the compass draw a 
,,circle with radius 4 centimeters and the center o so what you can do you can first mark the point o i'll mark who is here so then 4 centimeter length you have to take so take the ruler and the compass so take the compass you keep on top of zero point first and take four centimeter length so four centimeter length so four centimeter length then what you do you take the compass keep on top of the center oh and you can hold it here and then draw the circle so that's the circle with radius 4 centimeters so here to here 4 centimeters draw a circle with radius 4.1 centimeter with center o using a compass so what we do you can take any point oh 4.1 centimeters so take the compass now you have to take 4.1 centimeter length 4.1 this length now you can draw the circle so keep on top of the point hold it tightly and then draw the circle with radius 4.1 now here to here is 4.1 centimeters draw a circle with radius 5 centimeters with center take the compass again now measure five centimeters so make sure that you keep the compass on top of the zero point and now we can measure five centimeter length and now we can draw so mark the point o first now keep the compass on top of the point o and draw the circle so this is the circle with 5 centimeter radius so this is 5 centimeters draw a circle with center a and radius 3.8 centimeters using a compass so we can mark the point a first that's the center then take the compass and measure three point eight centimeters 3.8 3.8 is here now you keep the compass on top of point a that's the center and now draw the circle so that's the circle with center 3.8 so this length is 3.8 centimeters draw a 
,,circle with center a and radius 3.3 so we are practicing how to draw circles using the compass point a radius 3.3 now again keep the compass on top of the ruler now 
,,take three point three three here so three point three now you can draw the circle keep on top of the center o and draw the circle so this is the circle with center 
,,a and radius 3.3 centimeters taking b as the center draw three circles with radius 2 3.5 and 4.5 so we need the center b take the compass first we'll draw with 2 centimeter length take 2 centimeters and you can draw the circle first that's 2 centimeter radius that's first circle next one 3.5 3.5 here now same center center b now draw the other circle 3.5 now now the last one is 4.5 radius so measure 4.5 now this one 4.5 that's the third circle center is b draw the third circle so those are 
,,the three circles with center two three point five and four point 4.5 now look at this one draw a circle with radius a b and center it draw a circle with radius bc and center b draw a circle with radius c d with center c and draw a circle with radius dc and center d so basically you have to draw several circles there so we need 
,,the compass so i can take any length so first i'll mark the point a a is here so a is the center so first i'll draw the first circle so that's the circle with center a and i can mark this one as b radius a b now i need to draw a circle with center b and center b bc is the radius so i can take the same length and draw a circle so i can mark c is the radius bc bc is the radius and b is the center now that's the second one third one draw a circle with radius c d with center c now i can take the compass here now the center is c you can draw a circle and i can mark any point as d because cd is the radius now the last one center d center d i can take the compass here and draw another circle so that's the dc is the radius and the center is t so that's the diagram look at this one a b straight line passes through the center o this is the diameter of a circle so what is the diameter means a straight line joining two points on a circle which passes through the center of the circle so a b is the diameter of the circle dial meter p and q points are on the circle these two points the line segment pq does not pass through the center so this line is not passing through the center is that the diameter no we call that is a chord of a circle so pq is a chord what is the longest chord can be drawn to a circle so longest chord is the diameter so passes through the center so we can say the longest chord can be drawn to a circle is a diameter look at this diagram identifying the difference between a diameter and the chord so center is o we can say center is o chord what are the chords you can see the lines not passing through the center so p q 
,,and r s both are chords what's a diameter diameter is this a b length and what are the radii radius the plural word for radius is radii so we can say o to b that's ob diameter is twice as long as radius we'll find out by measuring the lengths we'll find out what's the a b length we get a b length as 10.2 what's the length of a oh ao is you get here to here five point one o a is five point one now see whether it's true multiply by two and see two times one two two times five 10 so that means this is correct diameter is twice as long as radius because o a is the radius so this is the radius and this is the diameter what is the diameter of the circle if radius is 5.7 centimeters so we found out the diameter is the twice of radius so diameter is twice of radius so two times radius is 5.7 multiplied by 2 ignore the decimal point just multiply by 2 2 times 7 14 1 remaining 2 times 5 10 10 plus 1 11 and 1 decimal place so 11.4 centimeters is the diameter what is the diameter of the 
,,circle if radius is 17.5 so diameter is 2 times the radius 2 times 17.5 ignore the decimal point and multiply 2 times 5 10 1 remaining 2 times 7 14 plus 1 15 1 remain 2 times 1 2 2 plus 1 3 and 1 decimal point 35 centimeters is the diameter of that circle what is the radius of a circle if diameter is 25 other way around so you have to divide this by two diameter is 25 divide by two two times one two two times two four for ten that's five so twelve point five centimeters what is the radius of a circle if the diameter is 35 so 35 divided by 2 diameter divided by 2 is the radius 2 times 1 2 for 15 that's 7. 2 times 7 14 1 remaining and for 10 that's 0.5 17.5 centimeters is the radius of that circle look at this one fill in the blanks so you have to fill radius as well as diameter so 12 is radius so what's the diameter double of that so double of 12 24 centimeters diameter is given 36 divide by two you get the radius so 18 centimeters 22 radius how you get the diameter double it 
,,multiply by 2 44 centimeters diameter is given you divide by 2 to get the radius 14 and 11.2 is the radius multiplied by 2 to get the diameter 4 2 2. so here 22.4 centimeters is the diameter so now you know the relationship between radius and diameter diameter is twice as radius now look at this one draw any circle with center o so you can take the compass and draw a circle so take any length so center is o so you can mark the center o and draw any circle so you can take any length and draw a circle then so here center o any circle mark any point a on the circle so you can mark any point a on the circle extend a o line till the line meets the circle again at b so take the ruler from a or extend it till you get the other point that's the point b measure o a radius measure a b diameter so what's oa length so we can 
,,keep the ruler and measure the length so i can keep on top of this point and rotate my ruler and i get here first ob oboroa i'll measure ob or a first 5.4 5.4 centimeters is o a now i'll measure a b full length so i get here to here 10.8 a b is 10.8 now see whether this is twice as that 2 times 4 8 2 times 5 10. so you can see the diameter is twice as radius now we'll do the exercises in your textbook exercise 18.1 draw a circle by keeping a distance of 4 centimeter between the point of the pair of compasses and the pencil point that means radius is 4. so you take the ruler and the compass measure 4 centimeters 4 centimeter length so no need to mark the center so just draw the circle so four centimeter is the radius between the point of the pair of compass and the pencil mark a point o on a clean sheet of paper keep the point of the pair of compasses on point o and draw three circles by changing the distance between the point of the pair of compasses and the pencil point so you can take the compass so same center three different sizes so i'll take this length and draw a circle i can now change the length to this one and draw another circle and i can change the length to another distance and draw another circle so they want same center o with three different radii lengths draw a straight line segment a b of length three centimeters so we'll take the ruler and first i'll mark the point here that's a a b length is 3 centimeters so here 3 is here i can draw a line 
,,from here to here that's a b that's a b that's three centimeters keep the point of the pair of compasses at point a and extend it until the pencil point reaches the 
,,point p so we'll take the compass keep the compass on top of point a and extend it until the pencil point reaches the point b so that means take this length now draw the circle which goes around point a so you can draw the circle so this is the circle you get then keep the point of the pair of compasses on point b and extend it 
,,until the pencil point reaches the point a so now keep on top of b and now extend this compass till you get a now draw the circle which goes around point b so that's another circle so you get same radius and center a and center b draw a square abcd in your square ruled exercise book by taking the length of 4 squares as one side 
,,here 4 centimeters 4 centimeters so we'll take four centimeters so we have to take one square means one centimeter so i'll take four and four so here two three four 
,,five six seven eight nine so i'll keep one two three four one two three four one two three four this is the square width length 4 centimeter as the side length then 
,,take the distance between the point of the pair of compasses and the pencil point to be the length of two squares of your exercise book and draw four circles around 
,,the points a b c and d so we'll first mark the points this is a b c d now take the compass so you have to take a as the center and two squares means two centimeter length and we can draw the per circle center a and the radius is 2 centimeter now take the same thing b is the center now and you have to take the 2 centimeter now here now you can draw the other circle next one c as the center draw the other circle and the last one is t as the center and draw the other circle so that's the diagram you get four circles with center a b c and d several circle designs are created by using a pair of compasses and a pencil are shown below create these designs or 
,,some other circle designs using a pair of compasses and a pencil so we'll try to draw these diagrams the first one look at carefully you get three circles with the same radius so first we'll do that i'll take so here two centimeter for the radius two centimeter radius and draw the circle that's the first circle and then look at 
,,carefully you have to take the center as any point on the circle and same radius draw another circle so that's the second one and third one is same as before you take the radius point the center point on this circle and draw a circle those are the three circles then what you have to do now we need to keep the compass on top of this line and here you have to draw this arc so what you can do you can keep it so that this end is the pencil there so now when you draw it you get the other arc like this so that's this how we draw this one so same thing you have to do so what you have to do you have to keep hear the center somewhere there so that you get this 
,,is the pencil point so here you can change it now see this is the center and this is the pencil point now you can draw the other arc now we did this side so same thing you have to do to the other side so what you have to do you keep somewhere there so that the pencil should be on top of this so you change it here from here you can draw the other yeah up to here now again you have to draw the other point so take compass somewhere here and the point should be here so if it's not okay you keep it properly and now you can draw the other arc now i think we did all size now we can color this you can put any color that you like i'll take blue so you can color all these petals like this so that's the diagram now how we draw this one so you need the compass so you can take any length and first draw the circle so you can take any length that you like and draw a circle then you can take any point now take the compass same radius you can't change it so you can keep on top of the circle and draw arcs like this one knock here now take the compass to the next point and draw the other same distance and take the compass to the next point and you can draw the other arc so likewise you can move the place around the circle and you can draw arcs like this so you get petals now when you take this point you get the other 
,,petal and the last one you have to keep it here and draw the other petal now we drew the flower now we'll color this so we can take any color that you like i'll take orange so you can color the petals like this so that's the diagram now we'll try to draw this one so in this circle we can see if this is the big one this is half of that the diameter is half of that so we'll measure it and draw so we'll take the compass and the ruler will take 4 centimeter lengths so it's easy when you first draw two perpendicular lines and then think about how to draw this so four centimeters so that's the big circle so you can draw this and now we need to take the half 
,,of that as the radius now before that we'll take the ruler and just mark two points i'll mark two points one point descent and this set and i want to mark the other 
,,side also just to make sure that it's perpendicular to this one just mark the points here and here now we need to take half of four that's two centimeter length so that's the other circle we need two centimeter length and what we can do we can keep in between these two points and passes through both the center and the and this point so keep it here and we'll draw the circle now this is one circle so that's passes through the center now we'll take these two points in between these two points we have to draw the other circle so here now draw the other circle so that's the second one now in between these two we take the other one i'll keep it here and the other point should passes through this point so keep it in between here now we can draw the next circle and the fourth one in between these two so we're taking between these two and passes through the center now we'll draw the other circle so those are the four circles inside now we can color these petals you put something like this so here you get something like that and light color here we'll put a light color on these ones and light green color around so we can create the same thing how we draw this one so you need to draw a bigger circle middle circle and small circle so we'll take the compass and take five centimeter radius that's the big bigger 
,,one so five centimeter radius circle that's the big part then we'll take three centimeters length three centimeter so this is five here i'll take three centimeter that's the middle circle i'll take two centimeters and draw the other circle then the other one you have to draw one centimeter length radius because if you take one centimeter length radius you get other circles fit into the this gap so one centimeter length centimeter length this should fit into this one so what we can do we draw we'll check whether the length is what's this length here this length that's like two point two divide by two one point one 1.1 so now you can draw circles so 1.1 
,,is the radius here so you have to keep in the middle so that you get the circle touches this point as well as this point so here we'll change it slightly now you can draw the circles like that so you have to draw circles around this you keep it properly otherwise you are not getting exactly what you want so keep it somewhere here so that it touches this circle and here also it touches this also you have to check it now check this touches this this slightly here now it's better so you can draw the other circle so like this you draw around this and then you can color it so you can do that i'm not going to draw all the circles you can try out that i'll draw one more circle okay so here like that you draw around and color this what about this one this is just three one two three four four circles so you can take any length take any length so same radius you have to keep so you draw a circle now just move slightly to this side and draw the other circle move slightly towards this side draw the other circle so we need one more move towards this side and draw the other circle so you get this diagram after that you can erase these points this one how can we draw this so we'll take a circle with five centimeters it's easy when you measure it and do because this is half of that so you draw a circle and now you have to draw the half of that so here 5 we took 5. now half of that is 2.5 now take 2.5 here and what you can do you can keep it in between here so that you can draw an arc here so we can draw an arc up to here then you need to draw the other so you keep here in between these two and we can continue this in between these two if i keep somewhere here so you get you can draw up to this point so here we draw the other arc somewhere here now you get this one and then you can color this so you 
,,can erase these two points and color this now this is another design i created so you can create any design you like with the compass create a design suitable for a 
,,wall hanging by drawing circles using pair of composers and a pencil so we'll try to draw take the compass and the ruler will measure it and do and we'll take a circle with radius radius five so take the compass and draw a circle first with five centimeter radius and then take half of it half of it is two point 2.5 2.5 and then 
,,you keep in between these two points so i'll just put a mark here so that i know that half of this is here now i can keep this one here and draw a circle here and i 
,,want to again take now 2.5 half 2.5 half is 1.25 so i'll take 1.25 here so somewhere here and then draw another circle here taking this as the center in between and 
,,see whether it passes through the center and yeah so here draw another circle so then you can color it so i'll put different colors now so i'll put green pink and yellow hip and now i can draw same figure all over the place and make a wall hanging so i'll take a copy and see now you can copy this and i want to rotate this cell here make a design i want to keep it here and you can take another one and i can rotate this and put it somewhere here so you can create any design like this for wall hanging exercise 18.2 do the following for the circle shown in the figure name the center of the circle so what's the center center is o name the radii what are the radii o a name a diameter passing through the center a sticks is the diameter draw a circle of radius 4 centimeters so take the compass and the ruler measure four centimeter length and draw a circle and it says name the center as o and the radius is four centimeters and point on the circle as x produce x o until it meets the circle again at y so draw a line passes through the center and this end we can label it as y write down the name used to define x y that's the diameter measure the length of x y and write it down so we'll measure x and y length so 8 centimeters so x y length is 8 centimeters we can see double of the radius draw a straight line segment a b such that a b is 3 centimeters take the ruler and the compass now we need to draw three centimeter length three centimeter length so a b so we can mark it a and three centimeters here and draw the line segment a b this is a and b draw two circles of radius three centimeter each taking the points a and b as the two centers so i can i'll take the compass measure three centimeter length and draw a circle with center a first and then center b so these are the two circles measure the lengths of a p and b p name the points of intersection points p and q so i can label this is p this is q and we need to measure apn bp so we'll take the compass and see what's this distance here to here yeah that's a p b p from here to here we'll check it whether it's the same thing here you get the same distance so what's the distance now you can check it it's the distance three centimeters so ap bp both three centimeters join pa and produce it until it meets the circle with center a again and again at r so take the ruler join p a and then extend it so that you get another point on the circle that's r what name is used to define the straight line segment pr so this is a line segment passes through the center so that's the diameter question number four b c and d are the centers of the circle shown in the figure the 
,,radii of all three circles are equal here a e is 10 centimeters so the full length is 10 centimeters find the length of ac now can you see this is the diameter so here equal size of circles so if this is 10 so what is ac half of e so you can straight away write down ac is half of 10 centimeters that's five centimeters then second part find the radius of each circle so what's the radius of each circle half of ac ac is the diameter so radius of the circle is half of 5 centimeters so half of 5 centimeters is 2.5 centimeters so radius is 2.5 abc is an equilateral triangle the perimeter of the triangle abc is 12. so the perimeter is given 12 centimeters three circles of equal radii and centers abc respectively have been drawn as shown in the figure calculate the length of the side ac so how can we find ac ac is the side of the equilateral triangle so you can divide by three so ac length is equal to 12 centimeters divided by three four centimeters second part calculate the radius of the circle with center a now can you see when you draw the circle this is half of that ac we found four so what's the radius of the circle radius is half of that divided by two that's two centimeters then calculate the diameter of the circle with center b center b the diameter so radius is 2 centimeters and 2 and 2 the diameter becomes a b length that's same as 4 centimeters so it says diameter is twice as radius so you get four centimeters draw a circle of radius three centimeters name its center o you need the compass and the ruler three centimeters so take three centimeter length and draw a circle so take the three centimeter length and draw a circle mark and you have to mark the center o mark a point on the circle and name it a draw a circle of radius 3 centimeters with a as its center mark one of the intersecting points of this circle and the first circle as b so you need the compass with three centimeter length now the center is a so we can draw a another circle it says the intersecting point you can mark as what's the point b mark 1 of the intersecting point of the circle this one b draw a circle of radius 3 centimeters with center b again so we can take the same thing now center b draw a circle similarly draw another four circles such that the centers of these circles all lie on the first 
,,circle and the radius of each circle is 3 centimeters so you can keep now in the other intersecting point so i can draw another circle here so how many circles draw 
,,it says similarly draw another four circles so you can draw like that so you can keep on top of the intersecting point and draw the other circles and we need a another one you take this one and draw another one so we do four circles do all the circles with centers that lie on the first circle pass through o look at carefully and see this is the point o do all the circles with centers that lie on the first circle pass through o what can you say about this so all the circles pass through the 
,,center point so you can say yes draw a straight line segment a b of length four centimeters draw a circle such that av is a diameter so take the compass measure four centimeter length so we can do it here so i can mark this point and this point four centimeter and taking the ruler i can mark this line segment a b that's 4 centimeter now we have to take a b as the diameter so that means center is in between take the compass you measure two centimeters and you can keep in between a and b and 
,,draw the circle let's check whether both the points passes through yes so you can draw the circle with diameter a b draw two circles having a and b as their centers 
,,and a be the radius of each circle so you have to take the compass and the radius is now a b length so you keep on top of a and draw one circle now keep on top of b 
,,and draw the other circle so two circles now a b the radius of each circle so we covered all theory related to circles so what did we do here we identify the center 
,,radius and the diameter a straight line segment joining the center of a circle to a point on the circle is called the radius of the circle and the straight line segment joining two points on a circle which passes through the center of the circle is called a diameter and what's the relationship between diameter and radius the diameter of a circle is twice its radius so remember this diagram center is in the middle and this is radius and double of that twice of that is the diameter you

Circle,onO4mffGQZs&t=5s,"Hello friends,"
,,Theorems I never understood why people are so much
,,afraid about this word? Theorems are nothing but a given statement
,,"which we have to prove with the given information and by applying logic and math to it. Today, I am going to try to break the myth"
,,"that theorems are difficult and very tough. In this session of circles, we are going to"
,,"deal with 12 theorems, two minutes for each theorem. May be a minute up or down. So, before we actually move to the theorems,"
,,"we will go through some facts, some basic concepts which we will be using in the theorems"
,,to prove them. So lets start with basic concepts and terms
,,"related to a circle itself. Well, we can see in this chart, a circle has"
,,"a radius, diameter, sector, segment, chord, secant, and arc. We will be using these terms frequently in"
,,"this session, so please do understand the meaning of each term. Next we are going to see some basic properties"
,,"about triangles, majorly, how to prove two triangles congruent. Again we have a chart in front of us; this"
,,"chart shows us some criterions that we are going to use to prove triangles congruent. Now, you must be thinking, why suddenly we"
,,"are talking about triangles, during a session related to circles!!! Dont worry; you will come to know about it"
,,as soon as we reach to our first theorem itself. And some extra reminders like angles in triangle
,,"add to 180o and pair linear angles are also 180o. One last thing before we start the theorems,"
,,"the addition of the remote interior angles of a triangle is equal to the exterior angle. Believe me, if you understood the first two"
,,"minutes, the rest of the things are going to flow as smooth as water. You can pause this video at minute you want,"
,,because it may go little fast for some of the viewers and you can through the first
,,two minutes again if you feel like before we move to the theorems. =Lets move to the first theorem: Equal chords
,,"of a circle subtend equal angles at the center. So according to the statement, we have two"
,,chords AB and CD. We have to prove that
,,"Now as we can see, if we can prove that both the triangles are congruent, then we can say"
,,"that both the angles are also congruent. So, if we have a look in"
,,AO = OC BO = OD (because they all are radii of same
,,circle) and AB = CD . ( because we are Given that both
,,the chords are equal) So we have 3 sides which are congruent
,,"So SSS test of congruency, both the triangles are congruent. Now, if the triangles are congruent,"
,,"Which means they are equal in all aspects? So, (which is nothing but a corresponding"
,,"angle of the congruent triangle) Now, Lets see the converse of this theorem,"
,,"Theorem 2: If the angles subtended by the chords of a circle at the center are equal,"
,,"then the chords are equal. Again we can have a look at the same diagram,"
,,"Now, its given that both the angles are congruent, And we have to prove that the chords are also"
,,"congruent. Again we have same triangles,"
,,AO = OC BO = OD ????? (Both are radii of
,,same circle) But now . (Given)
,,"So what do you think, using which criteria we can say that both the triangles are congruent?? Yes you are right,"
,,"Using SAS criteria of congruency. Now since triangles are congruent,"
,,We can say that Chord AB = Chord CD . (which is nothing but a corresponding side of the
,,congruent triangle) Lets move to the third theorem: The perpendicular
,,from the center of a circle to a chord bisects the chord. This theorem is also known as a perpendicular
,,"bisector theorem. So as per the statement, we have a chord BC"
,,"and a perpendicular from center A on the chord BC. Lets name the point as D. So, AD is perpendicular"
,,"BC. We can see two triangles,"
,,"In these triangles, AD = AD because its just the common side in"
,,both the triangles AB = AC because its the radii of the same
,,circle. And = 90o .. since we are Given that AD BC
,,So from this we can say that both the triangles are congruent by RHS criterion
,,"Now since both the triangle are congruent, BD = DC"
,,"Now since BD = DC, we can say that D is the midpoint of chord BC. Hence we can say that AD is perpendicular"
,,"bisector of chord BC. Lets move to the fourth theorem, I believe"
,,its going easy so far. Theorem 4: The line drawn through the center
,,of a circle to bisect a chord is perpendicular to the chord
,,"We know now, that if we want to prove a converse of the previous theorem, then we have to prove"
,,"that the segment AD is perpendicular to BC If we see in the same circle again, if we"
,,"prove that then we can prove that AD is perpendicular to BC. We again have same triangles,"
,,AD = AD and AB = AC. same like previous theorem. BD = DC because its given to us now
,,"So, both the triangles are congruent now by SSS test of congruency. Now we have . (1)"
,,"But from this we cannot say that both the angles are 90o. But, we know ? ADB = 180o because both are"
,,supplementary angles or we can say linear pair of angles.. (2)
,,"Now, from 1 and 2, We can say that ? ADB = 180o"
,,2 ? ADB = 180o ? ADB = 90o = ? ADC
,,So we have proved that AD is perpendicular to BC
,,"Here we are done with four theorems. I hope you all are with me. If its going fast, you can stop the video"
,,at second and revise the things. Lets take an easier one this time and a little
,,different one. Theorem 5: There is one and only one circle
,,passing through three given non-collinear points. We will prove this one using few geometric
,,"constructions. Lets take three different points, lets say"
,,"A, B and C. Now we will join them. Now in order to draw a circle, we need a center"
,,which will be equidistant from all the three points and there is one more thing we need
,,"to draw a circle, yes!! a radius. So, if we draw perpendicular bisectors on"
,,"both the segments, i.e. AB and BC. We can see that both the perpendicular bisectors"
,,meet at one common point lets name it as O. If we consider this as the center and draw
,,"a circle considering AO or BO or OC as a radius, we can see that we are having a circle which"
,,"is passing through A, B and C. You can try this on paper taking any three"
,,"non collinear points and make a circle passing through them. Well, We have just completed another theorem"
,,doing this activity. I hope we are going well so far. See you in the next session where we will
,,"use these theorems to prove further more theorems of circles. Till then keep watching, keep learning. And yes, dont forget to like comment and subscribe. Thank you."

Circle,neyl2p3oT5o,hello children today i'm here to teach you chapter 23 in your textbook that's circles so in grades 6 and 7 you learnt about circles and now you know how to use the pair of compasses to you draw the circles in this lesson we identify access of symmetry chord what is a segment a sector so draw a circle using pair of compasses or any circular shaped object now you can do that and cut this circle and fold it so that you get a symmetrical line so you know how to do that we did that before take a circle and after you cut it you fold it so that you get symmetrical lines so take the circle fold it so that you get symmetrical line so this is 1 so you get one symmetrical line like this and then you can fold this several times so that we get symmetric lines so likewise i'm doing several times fold this so after you get this 
,,one so this is what you are getting so you get all the symmetrical lines like this so in the third diagram you see all the symmetrical lines so what can you say about this circle you get lot of symmetrical lines so we'll see what are the properties so you will see infinity number of axis of symmetry to a circle so these are called axis of symmetry because one side is same as the other side and all the symmetrical lines are diameter of a circle so what's the diameter the line passes through 
,,the center so when you take a symmetrical line like this this is a diameter and this is also a diameter so any symmetrical line here also a diameter this is also diameter so all the symmetrical lines are diameter of a circle and the intersecting point of all symmetrical lines is the center so where's the center this is the center of the circle so i'll label this this is the center the distance from center to a point on the circle is the radius so where's the radius so from center to any point so this is the radius of a circle so where's the diameter right this is the diameter so when you take a circle what are the points you need to know the center diameter radius look at this diagram identify what's the diameter and the center diameter is the line passes through the center so center is o and the diameter we can label as a b look at this diagram write down all radii that means radius plural form we say radii so what are the radii here from center to a point on the circle so o e o e also write all diameters diameters means a line passes through the center a b here to here a b and c d and write all radii you can write o a o b o c o d so we'll do an activity to identify a chord of a circle using a pair of compasses and a pencil draw a circle of radius 4 centimeter on a piece of paper so you can take the ruler measure 4 centimeters and using the compass you can draw a circle so i'll just draw a circle without considering the size you can do the correct circle so this is the circle mark the center of the circle and name it o so i can mark this one is o mark a point on the circle and name it x join x and o so i'll draw a point on the circle any point x and then join ox these two points produce xo to meet the circle again and name the point of intersection as y so we'll produce that produce 
,,x o so that you get the point on the circle is y then mark a few points on the circle and name them a b c d e f a b c d e f join the above points to x so we can join these lines to x so i can join here here to here here to here xd x e x f measure and write the lengths of x a x b x c up to x y and observe that the longest line among them is x y so you can measure so use the ruler to measure these lengths take the ruler to measure the lens now so we'll measure xa my missions measurements are 
,,different because i took random points and as well as i didn't take four centimeter radius so you can draw a proper one ax is 5.9 xa 5.9 centimeters then xb that's 4.7 4.7 xb is 4.7 centimeters xc xc you get 2.3 xd xd you can measure it it's like 2 1.5 x e 3.8 xf i get 5.5 x y six point observe that the longest line among them is x y look at all these values 5.9 4.7 here x y is the longest one so what is x y the diameter is the longest chord so what are all these these are chords of a circle when you connect any two points on the circle we call that's a chord we'll do another activity using a pencil and a pair of compasses draw a circle of radius four 
,,centimeters on a piece of paper mark four points on the circle and name them p q r and s respectively join p and r highlight the section p q r of the circle in blue 
,,and the section psr in red so we'll draw a circle you can measure and draw four centimeter radius mark four points on the circle mark the points p qrs p q r s join pnr these two that's a chord highlight the section p q r of the circle in blue and the section psr in red so pqr in blue so pqr so this is in blue this part and psr psr other side in red so p s r what you call this we say these are arcs the smaller one we say minak bigger one we say major arc so this is mynack now you know what are arcs you get two arcs when you connect two points on a circle minor arc and the major arc smaller one minor now we'll look at the exercises in your textbook exercise 23.1 draw a circle of radius three centimeters and name its center o so you need the ruler and the compass so three centimeter is the radius so you measure three centimeters and then you can draw a circle name the center as o draw a diameter of this circle and name it pq so what's a diameter a line passes through the center 
,,so you can draw any line passes through the center and then label it as p q measure the length of the diameter so we'll measure the length so you get six centimeters so pq is six centimeters question number two draw a circle of radius 3.5 centimeters mark a point a on the circle draw several chords starting from a find the length of the longest chord you have drawn so take the ruler and the compass now the radius is 3.5 so you can drop the circle first and mark a point a on the circle that's any point draw several chords starting from a so i'll draw several chords one two three four five six several chords fine the length of the longest chord you have 
,,drawn so what's the longest one longest one is diameter so we'll measure and see so you get 7 centimeters so a b is the longest one that's seven centimeters that's the diameter draw any circle and mark the points a b c and d on it draw the chord ac so you can draw any circle so this is any circle mark the points a b c d d on it 
,,draw a chord ac name the two arcs separated by the chord ac so what are the two arcs you get a b c this is the minor arc smaller one we say minor arc the next one is the major arc from here to here this is the major arc so minor arc and the mage arc draw a circle of radius 4 that means you need to take the compass and the ruler 
,,radius is 4 centimeters draw a circle with radius 4 draw a chord such that two equal arcs are obtained name it a b so 2 equal arcs so that should be the diameter then so we'll draw a diameter a line passes through the center this is equally into equal parts so what's the chord here that's the diameter a b what is the name suitable for the chord a b diameter draw a circle of radius 5 centimeter name its center o take the compass and the ruler 5 centimeter length take five centimeter and draw a circle and name the center as o draw a chord which is six centimeter in length and name it ap so i'll take any point here a and we need to measure six centimeters so we can take the compass take six centimeter length and what you can do you can keep the compass on top of a and mark the other point on the circle so that becomes 6 centimeter length chord so this is b and you can connect this is a b that's the chord a b that's six centimeters name the midpoint of a b as p and join op so we 
,,can take the compass and measure 3 centimeter half of 6 because midpoint means exactly divide six centimeter into two parts so you need three centimeter length so half of six so i can mark the point p on that this is p this is 3 centimeters and this is p so this distance is equal to this distance and join op measure and write down the magnitude of apo and bpo angle so we'll join o and p now we'll measure using the protractor we'll measure using the protractor and c a p o apo we get 90 degrees and bpo bpo is also 90 degrees so that means when you connect the midpoint of any cord to the center these two lines are perpendicular you get 90 degree angles we'll do another activity in your textbook activity 4 draw a circle on a sheet of paper using a pair of compasses and a pencil so you can draw it i'll take a circle draw a chord a b of the circle which is not a diameter so that means any length not passing through the center that's a b mark two points c and d on the circle on either side of the chord a b as shown in the figure i'll mark c here d here color the region bounded by the chord a b and the minor arc a c b in blue this chord and a c 
,,b arc minor that's in blue so we'll color it in light blue this region blue and the region bounded by the chord a b and the major arc adb in red this one is in red so what what's this this is called the segment minus segment and the major segment of a circle so when you draw any chord you get two segments so what's this minor segment and the other one we call major segment look at this one a region of a circle bounded by a cord and the arc is called the segment of a circle so minor segment 
,,and major segment the region bounded by the chord a b and the major arc adb is called the major segment of the circle so we identify through the activity what are major segments and minor segments another activity to identify the sector draw a circle using a pair of compasses and a pencil and name it center o so we'll take the compass take any radius you can draw a circle and then mark the center o mark two points a and b on the circle and join ao and vo e b mark connect ao and vo color in 
,,blue the region bounded by the radii a o and b o and the arc a b where aob is an acute angle aob is an acute angle in blue so this is in blue and it says the region 
,,bounded by the radii a o and b o and the arc a b v r a o b is a reflex angle so this side in red so now we get sectors so what you call this so when you get an acute angle we say this is a minor sector and when you get the reflex angle we call it major sector so this is what we did in a circle a region bounded by two radii and an arc is called a sector of the circle the angle subtended at the center of the circle by the arc is called the central angle so here this central angle is a reflex 
,,angle here the central angle is an acute angle the sector bounded by the minor arc and two radii is called a minor sector and the sector bounded by the major arc and two radii is called the major sector the acute angle aob is the central angle of the minor sector and the reflex angle aob is the central angle of the major sector 
,,now you know the difference between a segment and a sector segment is this one and sector is this one so this is like when you take the pizza cut it you get a sector take a bun and cut it into two parts you get a segment exercise 23.2 from the given term select and write the most suitable term for each of the regions indicated by an english letter so these are the terms you can use a radius a sector a chord minor minor segment major segment a diameter a major arc and a central angle so we'll identify all these what's this a line not passing through the center a chord what's this this is arc but the bigger one major arc and c c is the angle central angle is there a central angle there yes a central angle what about d t is a segment but this is a big one major segment this one this is a sector a big one major sector do we have a major sector no we have just a sector you can say this is a sector now here small lamp minor arc this one is a segment but it's a small one minus segment and this is the radius from center to any point on the circle radius and this is the line passing through the center that's the longest chord diameter so we identified all tops fill in the blanks a straight line segment which joins the center of a circle to any point on the circle is called a radius center to any point on the circle we call radius of the circle the longest chord of a circle is called a diameter if the diameter of a circle is 200 millimeters then its radius is in centimeters now 200 divided by 2 you get 100 millimeters for the radius but convert to centimeters divide by 10 when you divide by 10 you get 10 centimeters a region of a circle bounded by a cord and an ark what you call that chord and an arc we call a segment a region of a circle bounded by two radii and arc is called a sector now you 
,,know the term segment sector arc minor major everything name the segments in the figure what is the segment so you get two segments this one this part is minor segment and this one is a major segment shade the minor segment of the circle we'll shade the minus segment so i'll take the so i'll first separate it and then put a color so you get this one so shade the minus segment of the circle so that's the minus segment look at this question draw a circle of radius 3.5 centimeters and name it 
,,center o so we'll draw a circle with compass 3.5 3.5 and draw a circle and name the center as of draw a chord a b through o so draw a chord a b through o what can you say about the two segments you get so this is the diameter so the diameter divides the circle into two equal parts so what can you say about the two segments you get both are equal so you get equal segments what is the suitable name for the above two segments so this is a semi circle you can't say major or minor because both are the same so you can say semicircle what is the name given to the shaded part of the circle so what you see this is a sector but it's the smallest one so we can say that's the minor sector write down its boundaries o x o y radii and x y akh what is the name given to the angle xoy xoy we say that's the central angle draw a circle with center o mark two points m n in on the circle such that a minor arc and a major arc are obtained so you can draw any circle you can take any length and draw 
,,a circle mark the center as o and any two points m and n on the circle such that a minor arc and the major arc are obtained shade the sector with central angle equal to the reflex angle mom so we need to connect the two radii omn mn and central angle is a reflex angle means this one so this is the reflex angle so you need to shade the major segment so we can shade it using any color so i'll color this i'll put lines so this is the major segment draw a circle with center o draw a diameter a 
,,b mark a point exon circle distinct from a and b so draw any circle mark the center o draw a diameter a b that means the line passes through the center a b that's the diameter mark a point x on the circle distinct from a and b now shade the sector a x b a x b now this sector is different because now the two radii is on the same 
,,line so when you shade it you get this part so axb sector is just the semicircle so what is a sector a region bounded by two radii and the uk so this is ax beziarch 
,,two radii o a and o b measure and write down the magnitude of the central angle of the sector a x b so without measuring also you can see that what's the angle you get 180 because it's a straight angle can you see this is a straight line so you get 180 degrees so ax central angle is ao aob eob is 180 degrees and this is the sector ax b draw a circle of radius 5 centimeters and name its center o so you take the ruler and the compass so you can measure five centimeter length and drop a circle and name the center as o mark a point p on the circle mark any point p and join op using the protractor draw the sector p o q poq such that poq is 60 degrees so take the protractor and measure you need to measure 60 degree angle poq so from here 60 degrees so i can mark the point here that's q and this is po q at 60 degrees draw the sector q o r q o r such that that's 150 degrees so you take the protractor again and you need to measure 150 degrees now here empty this is anti-clockwise 150 
,,means here to here 150 degrees from here this is 150 so that's the our point so we'll connect it and show this is 150 degrees so this angle is 60 this angle is 150 name the remaining sector and write the magnitude of its central angle so name the remaining sector so how can we name the remaining sector so sector is this one you 
,,can label it like ba sector bounded by o r o p and pr up so what's the angle now we know this is the point o around the point the sum of angles is equal to 360. so what's this angle 360 minus these two so 150 plus 60 you get 210 and subtract from 360 you get the remaining angle 150 degrees so por angle is 100 50 degrees so 360 minus these two 150 so we completed all theory related to circles a circle has infinity many axis of symmetry a line segment which joins any two points on a circle is a chord of the circle the longest chord is the diameter the section of a circle between any two points on the circle is known as an arc a region of a circle bounded by two radii and an arc is known as the sector of the circle and the region of the circle bounded by a cord an arc is called the segment of the circle so you have to remember all these radius diameter segment and sector and what's the other one akh akh means when you take a circle the length of this one is akk so remember all these because these are important in geometry maths you

Circle,KD7hpblvxxY,hello grade 9 students today i'm here to teach you chapter 18 in your textbook that circumference of a circle you started circles in grade 6. so you know how to draw a circle and what are the terms related to circle today we are discussing more about circles and about circumference we'll see what are those what are the characteristics of a circle you already know the midpoint of a circle we call center center of a circle the distance from the center to the circumference or the outer length 
,,what's the distance from the center to the circle radius we call it radius what's the letter we can use simple r so outer length we can call it as circumference we can use c letter for circumference so center radius and circumference what about this one a line joining two points on the circle along the center what do you call that that's the diameter so what's the letter we can use simple d and here this is the circumference see observe carefully so this distance is radius again this is radius how i can write d the diameter in terms of radius we see 1 diameter equals 2 r so d equals 2 r the diameter is twice the radius so if you take diameter sd radius is r so this is a formula you can use d equals 2 r okay so again when you take this circle this is the diameter the line joining two points on the circle passing through the center diameter what is this one not passing through the center any two points on the circle connected but that line is not passing through the center what do you call that chord we call it as chord the largest chord of a circle is the diameter the diameter cuts across the center if the circumference is divided into two parts with this chord what you call the bigger part we call that's the major arc so this is the major mark so if i draw that one so this is this one here two here 
,,that's the major so what's the other one we call it minor arc the smaller arc we call this is mine so remember this is the major arc and this is the minor so this divided with a chord complete the following table radius is given and you are asked to find out the diameter so we know that when you multiply it by 2 you get the diameter 7 times 2 14. 3 3.5 times 2 2 times 5 10 1 remaining 2 times 3 6 plus 1 7. now other way around diameter is given you divide by 2 to get the radius 12 divided by 2 you get 6 21 divide by 2 as a decimal you get you can divide by two you get one and four this is zero for ten that's five ten point five centimeters this is 17.5 so how do you find out the diameter multiplied by 2 so multiply by 2 2 times 5 10 2 times 7 14 plus 1 15 two times one plus one three so you get thirty five now we'll see how we can measure circumference to measure the circumference of a circle measuring tape which is used when stitching clothes can be used by placing the tape 
,,along the circumference it can be measured so we'll see how we can measure so this is the measuring tape so we use the centimeter side and if you want to measure okay any circular surface so this one how we do we take the measuring tape you keep here and take the measuring tape around this and measure the value so here you get 30 centimeters this one exactly 30 centimeters again if you have something like a bottle how you find out the circumference of this so you keep it along so hold it from one end and then go around and find the measurement so here 18 centimeter so this way using a measuring tape you can measure circumference i showed you how to measure the circumference using a measuring tape so we'll see another method to find out the circumference now we'll see how we can measure the diameter of a circle to 
,,measure the diameter of a circle the two set squares and the ruler from the instrument box can be used so what you do you take the ruler and the two set squares so keep like this only touches the circle with two set squares here and you can measure this length so we'll do that how you measure so you take the ruler and you need a circle so i'll take a circle so i want to measure the diameter of this so what i can do i take the two set squares and the ruler first i can keep the ruler like this only touches this one and i can just extend this and take the one take one set square and keep it like this only touches this one and here on top of the ruler the 
,,other set square you take it like this and keep on the other side only touches the circle and needs to keep on top of the ruler like this now here you can take a whole number here so you can move the ruler so that you get a whole number here so 3 is the measurement here here what's the measurement 11.2 so this is 11.2 this is 3 
,,how we can find out the diameter you can write 11.2 minus 3. so you get 8.2 centimeters for this diameter so keep the two set squares only touches the circle and then you can measure this length what's the other way of measuring if you have a circle on a paper you can cut it and you can take the ruler and you can fold it like that so here i have two circles there so what you can do you can fold it into two now this is the diameter so this is the diameter so what you can do you keep this one on top of the ruler so like this yeah so this is roughly three point three so the value is three point so the value is 3.3 centimeters now take another circle you can fold it into two parts and keep on top of this straight line so the ruler is like this so 3.5 3.5 centimeters so this way also you can measure the diameter look at this one the following table shows the measurements of the circumference and diameter of various objects put the answer in the last column so what are the objects 
,,bottle cap mouth of a cup compact disc mouth of a glass and marmite lid so circumference is measured and the diameter so circumference and diameter ratio we are finding circumference divide by the diameter so we'll see what we get so you know how to use the calculator we'll calculate circumference divide by the diameter so first one 22 over 7 22 divided by 7 you get 3.14 twenty five divided by seven point six three point two eight thirty three point five divided by ten point eight three point one zero eighteen point five divided by six point one three 3.03 25 divided by 7.7 you get 3.22 4 now when you take the measurements like this we can take here 3.1 as the rough value for this ratio so we'll now look at the ratio so observe the answer in the table 3.1 is the nearest answer as this is a constant value it is denoted by the greek letter pi so this is the green glitter pie so pi will take as 3.1 so we found out circumference divided by the diameter is 3.1 multiply both sides 
,,by d what do you get d d get cancelled out you get circumference is equal to 3.1 d now 3.1 we can take as pi so if this is pi what's the formula we are getting c equals pi d if you know the diameter when you multiply by the pi value the constant value you can find out the circumference this is the formula to find out the circumference of a circle so c equals pi d so pi is 3.1 or we can take as a fraction this is approximately all approximated values that's 22 over 7. so we take 22 over 7 as the pi value because pi is an irrational number you can't just write down the exact value so these are estimated values now we know c equals pi d but we know the relationship between diameter and the radius so when you substitute radius instead of diameter what we get pi instead of d i can write 2r and when i take 2 in the 2 in the front what am i getting 2 pi r so what's the new formula c equals circumference of a circle is 2 pi r so if you know the radius you can use 2 pi r if you know the diameter you can use sequence pi d so remember this formulae to find out the circumference of a circle so this is the other formula to find out the circumference 
,,using radius 2 pi r r is the radius c is the circumference and you can take pi as 22 over 7 if you are taking the decimal answer it's 3.14 all these are estimated values find the circumference of a circle whose diameter is 14 diameter is given so you can use c equals pi d pi we'll take as 22 over 7 and d is 14. here fraction into a whole number multiply the numerator separately and here 7 is the denominator 7 times 1 7 times 2. so 2 times 22 you get 44 what's the unit centimeters find the circumference of a circle whose diameter is 35 now still the diameter diameter is 35 pi we can take 22 over 7 us to find out the circumference use pi d formula 22 over 7 and 35 you can multiply the numerator separately and denominator is 7 7 times 1 7 times 5 22 times 5 5 times 2 10 5 times 2 10 plus 1 11 so what's the unit centimeters 110 centimeters find the diameter of a circle whose circumference is 44 circumference is 44 other way round given so you asked to find out the diameter now now we can write pi d equals c this way because we need to find out d then we can do writing the formula in this way is more suitable so what's d c divided by pi so c 
,,c is 44 divided by i can write divide by pi value pi 22 over 7 this is division you can convert to multiplication by taking the reciprocal then 44 times 7 in the numerator and 22 in the denominator when you simplify you get 14 is the diameter of this circle that's centimeters find the diameter of a circle when circumference is 220 now circumference is given you are asked to find out the diameter so pi d equals c now d equals pi divided by c oh other way around so d equals c divided by pi let's see 220 divided by 22 over 7 so convert to multiplication that's reciprocal of this now 220 multiplied by 7 divided by 22 when you divide by 22 you get 1 and 10 
,,10 times 7 70 centimeter is the diameter of this circle a circle is made out of a 4.4 meter length of thin wire find its diameter so here this is given in meters when you multiply by 100 what you get 440 centimeters now they asked to find out the diameter so what's c c is the outer length that's the circumference so that's 440 centimeters pi value 22 over 7 and you need d so what's the formula c equals pi d so we need diameter so you can write pi d equals c so what's d c divided by pi c is 
,,440 divided by 22 over 7 so convert to multiplication we get 7 over 22 440 multiplied by 7 divided by 22 so 22 times 1 this is 2. so 20 times 7 140 what's the unit this is centimeters finding the circumference when radius is given now radius is given 7 pi we can take 22 over 7. now what's the formula c equals 2 pi r 2 times 22 over 7 radius is 7 so you can multiply the numerators and then denominator becomes 7 7 get cancelled out 2 times 22 that's 44 centimeters that's the circumference find the circumference of a circle whose radius is 40 radius is 14 pi is 22 over 7 so you can use 2 pi r 2 times pi 22 over 7 times 40. so you can multiply the numerator and divide by 7 you get the circumference 7 times 1 and 2 here so 2 times 2 4 4 times 22 88 centimeters find the circumference of a circle whose radius is 3.5 now 
,,it's a decimal by using 3.5 it is difficult to solve problem so what we do we can convert 3.5 to a fraction three and a half so what's the improper fraction 3 and a 
,,half means 7 over 2. so it's easy when you use a fraction 7 over 2. so we'll see so radius is 7 over 2 pi is 22 over 7 so what's the circumference 2 times pi 22 over 7 r is 7 over 2. now multiply the numerator and denominator becomes 7 times 2 so 7 get cancelled out 2 with 2 you get 22 centimeters for the circumference find the 
,,circumference of a circle whose radius is 10.5 so what we can write 10.5 is 10 and a half convert to improper fractions 21 over 2 so you can use 21 over 2. now substitute 22 over 7 the pi value r is 21 over 2. now multiply what you get this way it's easy so you can simplify easily 7 times 1 this is 3 2 get cancel out and you get 1. so 3 times 22 66 centimeters find the circumference of a circle whose radius is 17.5 17.5 i can write 17 and a half and this is 35 over 2 as an improper fraction so 35 over 2 pi is 22 over 7 so you need c so we have radius so what's the circumference 2 pi r here instead of 17.5 35 over 2 is more appropriate 2 times pi 22 over 7 r is 35 over 2. so multiply the numerator and the denominator becomes 7 times 2. now simplify 2 2 get cancel out 7 times 5. so 22 times 5 5 times 2 10 1 remaining 5 times 2 10 plus 1 11 so 110 centimeters when you get a decimal it's easy to convert to a improper fraction an improper fraction and using fraction is more appropriate to solve problems by revolving 200 times find the distance in meters a bicycle wheel travels if the radius of the wheel is 35 centimeter so here we need the circumference so 35 is the radius and this is 200 times revolving so you need to first find for one revolution what's the circumference and multiply by 2 so what's c circumference is 2 pi r so 2 times pi is 22 over 7 and r is 35 so what's the value 2 times 22 times 35 divided by 7 7 times 1 and 5. here 5 times 210 10 into 22 220 centimeters this is for one revolution 200 revolutions are there so what's the distance traveled 220 multiplied by 200. so that means two zeros and three zeros multiplied by two you get forty four so forty four thousand centimeters you can divide by 100 and you can write 440 meters so when you divide by hundred two zeros get cancel out so you get 440 meters look at this question how many times must a wheel of radius 35 centimeters revolve to travel a distance covered by a wheel of radius 14 
,,which revolves 80 times first we'll find out for this wheel so the radius is 40. the radius is 40 and pi you can take 22 over 7 and we need to find out the circumference so you can use 2 pi r 2 times pi 22 over 7 times r so what's the value 2 times 22 times 14 divided by 7. so you get 2 times 2 4 4 times 22 88. so this is 1 revolution but it revolves 80 times so what's the total distance traveled 88 for 1 and multiply by 80 you get the total distance 0 8 times 8 64. 6 remaining 8 times 864 
,,plus 6 74 this is 70 meters now what about the big one big wheel radius is 35 so what's the distance there c equals 2 pi r 2 times 22 over 7 times 35 so you get 2 times 22 times 35 divided by 7 7 times 5 5 times 2 10 10 times 22 220 centimeters so now we need how many times the wheel need to rotate to get the same distance so distance covered by one revolution for this one is 220 centimeters number of times the larger wheel should be revolved you have to divide so this is the distance covered by one revolution this is 220 centimeters so how can we find out we can divide 7040 is a total distance divided by 220 you get how many times you need to revolve 
,,to get the same distance zero get cancel out so divide by two 2 times 1 11. so 2 times 3 6 for 10 that's 5 so 2. so you can divide by eleven eleven times one eleven 
,,times three thirty three two remaining for 22 that's two so how many times you need to revolve 32 times find the perimeter of a semicircular sector what's perimeter 
,,outer length so this is a semi-circle so you need this length and this length so what's the circumference of a semi-circle for a full circle that's pi d if the diameter is d perimeter first circumference of semicircle circumference is pi d divided by 2 because this is half of a circle you have to divide by 2. diameter is d this 
,,length is d so what's the perimeter half of a circle plus t so pi d over 2 plus t so this is the formula to find out the circumference of a semicircle plus the diameter that's called the perimeter of a semicircular sector so how can you write down i can take d out and write down pi over 2 plus 1 or i can take the common denominator also possible 2 as the common denominator but i can write this as well perimeter now we can use p p is the perimeter of the semicircular sector is d plus pi d over 2. find the perimeter so what's the d value d is given 28 centimeters and we need perimeter so what's the perimeter pi d over 2 plus t now what's pi value we can 
,,take pi as 22 over 7 so 22 over 7 multiplied by 28 and this 2 there plus 28 here 22 times 28 over 7 times 2 plus 28 7 times four two times eleven so eleven times four forty-four plus twenty-eight so add these two eight plus 4 12 1 remaining 4 plus 2 6 plus 1 7 so 72 centimeters is the perimeter of the semi-circular sector the diagram shows piece of land consisting of a rectangular section and a semicircular section find the perimeter so what's the d value here this semi circular path d is the same length 70 pi is 22 over seven so we need this part the circumference of a semicirc so length of the semicircular section so you can do pi d over 2 because full circle is pi d divided by 2. so 22 over 7 and d is 70 and 2 is there so 22 times 70 over seven times two two times eleven here seven times ten eleven times ten is hundred and ten centi this is meters 110 meters now what's the perimeter now we found this part so perimeter means you have to add these three lengths so 110 plus 90 another 90 and 70. so add all together zero nine and nine eighteen eighteen plus seven twenty five twenty five plus one twenty six two remaining two plus one three check it again 110 plus 90 200 290 so 300 and 360. so what's the unit this is 360 meters find the perimeter of the shaded region in the below diagram so we'll first find out the circumference of this part half of a circle semi-circular part what's the diameter there 14 and 14 28 so c you need to find so you can do pi d over 2 or half pi d so half pi is 22 over 7 d 28 so what's the value 22 times 20 divided by two times seven seven times four two times two so you get forty-four that's centimeters now we'll take the smaller circles so we need to find out this one and this one you get two semicircular sections when you take two what you get a one full circle so we can use pi d straight away for the small one what's the diameter 4 t and how we find out the circumference of a full circle pi 22 over 7 d is 40 22 times 
,,14 divided by 7 you get 44 did you observe something when you get a big one you get the same thing when you add these two so from the next question you will figure out when you divide any circular part into several uh smaller ones the circumference is the same now we'll do the other part now we found out this is 44 centimeters so what's the perimeter of the shaded region you add these to 44 plus 44 you get 88 centimeters is the perimeter of the shaded region now this one divided into three 
,,parts we'll see this circumference is the same as when you add all three together what's the diameter for the larger one 14 plus 14 plus 14. we get 40 two and so diameter is 42 pi is 22 over 7 so you need the circumference so you can use half pi d pi d divide by 2 pi is 22 over 7 d is 42 so you get 22 into 42 and here 2 and 7 7 
,,times 6 2 times 3 so you get 66 centimeter for the bigger semicircle now what's the diameter of the smaller semicircle 14. pi is 22 over 7. now we need to find out the circumference and multiplied by 3 because there are three semicircles so what's the value half pi is 22 over 7 d is 14 and multiplied by 3 you get 22 times 14 times 3 over 2 times 7 so 7 times 2 and these 2 get cancelled out you get 66 so the same answer when you divide into 4 you get the same answer as a bigger one so what's the perimeter of the shaded part so these 3 and this one so just add the two values 66 and another 66 you get 132 centimeters now we look at review exercise fill in the blanks using suitable words the locus of the point on a plane which are at a constant distance from a fixed point is a circle so you did this before in lokai and constructions the point right at the middle of a circle is known as the center copy the two columns a and b given below and using the given figure join the relevant pass point o is the center look at the diagram o a center to the any point on this circle that's called radius bc the chord the largest chord passing through the center that's bc that's diameter ob is the radius so you can connect this pq is just a caught so this is a cot question number two what is the length of the diameter 
,,of a circle of radius five so we know d equals two r twice as radius 2 times 5 so you get 10 centimeters what is the length of the radius of a circle of diameter 7 otherwise so radius is divide by 2 diameter divided by 2. so you can write 7 over 2 or as a decimal 3.5 centimeters if the radius of a circle is r and the diameter is d write an equation expressing the relationship between d and r t equals 2 r example number one find the circumference of a circle of radius 7 use 22 over 7 for the value of pi so what's the circumference formula with radius 2 pi r 2 times pi 22 over 7 times radius is 7. so we multiply the numerator values and denominator is 7 
,,7 get cancel out 2 times 22 you get 44 centimeters exercise 18.1 find the circumference of the circle with the measurement given below use 22 over 7 as the pi value 
,,so radius is 7. so what's the formula 2 pi 2 times 22 over 7 times 7. so 2 times 22 times 7 divide by 7 here 7 get cancel out 2 times 22 you get 44 centimeters now the diameter is given so what's the formula we can use pi d so pi is 22 over 7 and d is 21 so 22 times 21 over 7 you get 3 times 22 66 meters as a circumference radius 10.5 so what's the easiest way to do convert to a fraction 10.5 10 and a half or you can write as 21 over 2. now use the formula 2 pi r 2 times pi 22 over 7 times 
,,radius 21 over 2. so multiply the numerator and denominator separately 2 and 2 get cancelled out 7 times 1 and this is 3. so 3 times 22 66 centimeters 17 and a half 
,,convert to improper fraction so you get 35 over 2 is the diameter now what's the suitable formula pi d pi is 22 over 7 and d is 35 over 2 so 22 over 7 here 35 in the numerator this is 2 here 7 times 1 and 5. 2 times 11 11 times 5 55 meters radius 7 over 2 already as a fraction so we can use c equals 2 pi r 2 times pi 22 over 7 r is 7 over 2 so 2 times 22 times 7 over 7 times 2 7 get cancelled out 2 with 2 so what's the answer 22 meters diameter is 28. so what's the formula you can use pi d 
,,pi is 22 over 7 times 28. so you can write 22 times 28 over 7 7 times 1 and here 4 you get 88 centimeters now 15.4 is the radius so decimal value so we have to take 
,,the decimal value so r equals 15.4 so what's the circumference 2 pi r so 2 times 22 over 7 times 15.4 so 2 times 22 times 15.4 divided by 7 so you can divide by 7 here 7 times 1 2 14 and another 2. so you get 22 times 22 times 2. so 44 times 22 20 and 2 so you get 968 but here decimal point is there so keep one place to the left 96.8 centimeters is the circumference diameter three and one over nine we can convert to improper fractions nine times three twenty seven plus one twenty eight so circumference is pi d pi 22 over 7 d is 28 over 9. now simplify first write down the numerator and denominator like this and try to simplify 7 times 1 and here's 4 9 
,,you can't divide so 88 over 9. what's that 9 times 9 81 7 remaining so 7 over 9 meters is the circumference example number one find the perimeter of the semicircle shown in the figure use 22 over 7 for the value of pi diameter is given 21 centimeters now this is a semi-circle and you are asked to find the perimeter so how you find out the perimeter first find out the circumference of half of a circle so what's the circumference half of a circle half into pi t half into 22 over 7 into d is 21 you get 22 into 21 over 2 into 7 7 times 3 2 times 11 so that's 33 centimeters for this semicircular part now perimeter perimeter is we have to add the diameter to that 33 and 21 so you get 54 centimeters for the perimeter of the this semicircular sector example two a compound figure consisting of two semicolon laminars of radius 14 and diameter 14. diameter 14 means this one respectively is shown in the figure find its perimeter so this whole perimeter means first we'll find out the smaller one smaller circle smaller semicircle diameter is 40. so how do you find out the circumference this is a semicircular part half pi d so we can use half pi is 22 
,,over 7 and d is 14. so what you get 22 into 14 over 2 times 7 7 times 2 and these 2 get cancel out you get 22 centimeters that's this part now we need the bigger circle this part so what's the largest semicircle what's the diameter we know diameter is 28 but radius is 14 given r is 14 now so we can find out the circumference there half into 2 pi r half times 2 times pi 22 over 7 times 40. what's the value of 2 times 22 times 14 over 2 times 7 2 get cancelled out 7 and 2. so you get 40 4 centimeter so this is 44 this is 22. so what's the perimeter for a meter you need to add this length as well so another 14 you have to add so 22 plus 44 plus 14. so what's the answer 4 four eight ten ten one remaining four five seven and eight eighty centimeters exercise 18.2 find the perimeter of the semicircular lamina with the measurement given below use 22 over 7 as the pi value so this is perimeter and the radius is given 40. so what's the perimeter so straight away shall we find out perimeter perimeter is half of the semicircular part half of 2 pi r plus 14 and 40. so you get half and here 2 pi is 22 over 7 and r is 14 plus 28. so 7 times 2 these two get cancelled out you get 44 plus 28 72 centimeter for the perimeter of this semicircular part this one diameter is 7. so when you draw this you get diameter is 7. so how you find out the perimeter at once half of pi d we can use half of pi d because diameter is given so pi d formula plus and you have to add d so half pi is 22 over 7 d is 7 plus 7 again this one 22 into 7 over 2 times 7 plus 7 2 into this 11 7 get cancel out 11 plus 7 you get 18. so 18 centimeters is the perimeter of this semicircle question number two find the perimeter of the shaded part of each of the figures given below the curved parts in the figures are semi-circles use 22 over 7 for the value of pi this is a square so this is 40 so that means diameter is 40. so what's the perimeter i can write at once we'll find out this part half of pi d plus 14 three times now substitute the values half pi is 22 over seven d is 14 plus 12 1 is remaining so 42 14 times 3 this one 22 into 14 2 and 7 so 7 times 2 and 
,,this 2 get cancelled out so you get 22. so 22 plus 42 64 centimeters what about this one this one diameter is seven so how do you find out the perimeter of the full 
,,figure so this part half of pi d plus this part is 5 this is 5 5 times 2. now substitute the values half pi is 22 over 7 diameter is 7 this is 10. now 22 into 7 over 2 times 7 7 get cancel out and you get 11 11 plus 10 you get 21 centimeter as the perimeter of this figure this one how we find out the perimeter radius given so first we can find out the smaller one circumference and here small the bigger one and then you can add these two lengths okay so we'll find out the total perimeter smaller one radius is 7 so you can write half of 2 pi 22 over 7 r r is 7 that's this part and bigger one radius is given and 10.5 you can write as 10 and a half convert to improper fractions you get 21 over 2. that's easy to use 21 over 2. so what's the circumference of the bigger one half 2 pi 22 over 7 into r r is 21 over 2. now 
,,this is smaller one bigger one now you need to add these two so how you find out one distance 10.5 minus 7 so what is 10.5 minus 7 you get 3.5 so multiplied by 2. so 3.5 x 2. now we'll do the simplification 2 times 22 over 2 times 7 and here's 7 also there this one 2 times 22 times 21 over 2 times 7 times 2 and 35 3.5 times 2 you get 7 7 get cancel out 2 get cancelled out you get 22 here this one 2 get cancel out and 7 times 3 and 2 times 11 11 times 3 33 and another 7. so when you add what you get 7 plus 3 10 10 plus 2 12 1 remaining 3 plus 3 6 62 centimeters example number one a wheel of radius 35 centimeter moves along a straight road find in meters the distance it moves during one full rotation so that means the circumference so you are asked to find in meters first we'll find out the circumference what's the 
,,suitable formula radius is 35 so 2 pi r so 2 times 22 over 7 times 35 you get 2 times 22 times 35 over 7. 7 times 5 5 times 2 10 10 into 220 so 10 into 22 you get 220 centimeters now how you convert to meters divide by 100 so when you divide it moves two decimal places to the left 2.2 meters second part what is the distance it moves in meters during 100 rotations one rotation is 2.2 hundred rotations you multiply by hundred hundred into two point two what you get move the decimal place two 
,,places to the right one two so 220 meters then third one how many rotation does the wheel undergo when traveling a distance of 1.1 kilometers so the total distance is 1.1 kilometers this is in meter so convert this one to meters so number of rotations so the total distance 1.1 kilometer divided by 220 meters so convert to meters you multiply by thousand so 1100 meters divided by 220 meters so what you get 1 0 get cancel out divide by 11 this is 2 and 10 10 divided by 2 you get 5 rotations example number two a circular frame is made by joining the two ends of a wire of length 66 centimeters find its radius let us assume that the radius is r a circular frame is made by joining the two ends together the wire is 66 so circumference is given 66 centimeters and you are asked to find out the radius so what's the formula 
,,c equals 2 pi r it's easy to take 2 pi r to the side so c equals so r equals c divided by 2 pi now substitute the values 66 divide by 2 times pi pi is 22 over 7 so how you do that 66 2 times 22 so divide by 44 over 7 division you can convert to multiplication so 66 multiplied by 7 over 44 that's the reciprocal of that so you get 66 into 7 over 44 11 times 4 11 times 6 2 times 2 2 times 3 21 over 2 so what's the radius 21 over 2 or you can write 10.5 centimeters is the radius of the circle exercise 18.3 use 22 over 7 for the value of pi a lamina composed of two semicircles is shown in the figure this is pasted on an ornamental box a gold thread is to be pasted around the lamina find the minimum length of thread required to paste around this lamina so that means perimeter first we'll find out the smaller one and then the bigger one and 1.4 and here also 1.4 so we'll find out perimeter at once smaller one smaller one diameter is 4.2 so half of pi d we can use bigger one the the 
,,total length is what diameter is 1.4 plus 1.4 plus four point two seven seven just check four plus four eight two ten one remaining two three seven so seven centimeters for the diameter for the bigger one so again half of pi d this is the bigger one and then you have to add 1.4 times 2. now we substitute the values half pi is 22 over 7. what's the smaller diameter smaller diameter is 4.2 bigger one bigger one the diameter we found that's seven and one point four times two you get two point 
,,eight now add it 22 times 4.2 divided by 2 times 7 so 2 times 11 there when you divide this by 7 you get 0.6 here 22 times 7 over 2 times 7 so 7 get cancel out you get 11 there plus 2.8 now what's the final answer 11 times 0.6 6.6 and 11 there and 2.8 when you add it together 8 6 14 1 remaining so 7 8 9 10 1 remaining so you get 2 so 20.4 so keep one decimal place 20.4 centimeters is the perimeter of this figure find the total length in meters of the thread required to paste around 500 such laminar so that means now this is one lamina this is in centimeters 20.4 you need that length in meters for 500 so total length you can find out one is 20.4 multiplied by 500 so this is in centimeters but how you convert to meters divide by 100 so when you divide this by 100 so 20.4 into 500 divided by hundred you can convert to meters so here hundred times one here five twenty point four into five five times four twenty two remaining so here 2 5 times 2 10 so one decimal place you keep so what's the final answer 102 meters this is for 500 such laminars the circumference of a circular plot of land is 440 meters find its radius so circumference is given 440 meters and you are asked to find out the radius so what's the formula circumference is 2 pi r you need radius so i can write 2 pi r equals circumference so what is our circumference divided by 2 pi circumference is 440 divided by 2 times pi pi is 22 over 7. so 440 divided by 44 over 7 how you convert to multiplication take the reciprocal 7 goes there 44 below so 7 times 440 divided by 44 you get 10 times 7 70 meters is the radius the perimeter of semicircular lamina is 39.6 centimeters find its diameter so semicircular part perimeter is 39.6 you need diameter now how can you find out the formula for perimeter perimeter is the diameter plus half of the circumference half pi t now substitute p equals 39.6 now we can take d out from this so here you get 1 plus half pi so what's d you can take this one so first 
,,we'll find out this value half of 22 over seven here 2 times 1 11. so 1 plus 11 over 7. so what's d d equals 39.6 divided by this value so 1 plus 11 over 7 i can write as 7 over 7 for 1 i need to add these two fractions so 39.6 divided by you get 18 over 7. now division you can convert to multiplication and write 39.6 multiplied by 7 divided by 18. so divide so i can see divisible by 6 this is 3 6 times 6 36 again 6. again divide by 3 you get 2.2 so 2.2 multiplied by 7 7 times 2 14 1 remaining 14 plus 1 50. so the answer is 15.4 what's the unit centimeters question number four a sketch of a playground is shown in the figure it consists of a rectangular part and two semicircular parts find the parameter of the playground now can you see this semi-circle and this semi-circle when you connect you get one full circle 
,,so what's the perimeter of this ground one full circle so diameter is given so pi d plus 110 and another 100 multiplied by 2. so pi is 22 over 7 d is 70. 220 now you can cross out this is 10 so 220 plus 220 what's the answer 440 what's the unit this is meters so the perimeter is 440 meters second part it says show that the distance covered by a runner incomplete in two and a half rounds of the playground is more than one kilometer so this is for one round so what's the distance for two and 
,,a half rounds two and a half multiplied by 440. convert to an improper fraction you get 5 over 2 multiplied by 440 so 5 times 440 divided by 2 you get 220 multiplied by 5 0 10 11 so 1100 meters when you divide by 1000 you get 1.1 kilometer so this value is greater than one kilometer so when you go around two and a half rounds it's more than one kilometer question number five a cyclist rides a bicycle along a straight road the radius of each wheel of the bicycle is 28 centimeters only the radius given find the distance the bicycle moves during the period that wheels complete one full rotation so that means circumference of the wheel so how you find out 
,,the circumference c equals 2 pi r we take 22 over 7 for pi radius is 28. so 2 times 22 times 28 over 7 7 times 4 so you get 4 times 2 8 8 times 22 so 16 and 16 plus 
,,1 170 176 centimeters is the circumference that's the distance one full circle second part what is the distance the bicycle moves in meters during the period that the wheel complete 50 rotations so one full circle is 176. so what's the total distance for 50 rotations total distance is equal to 50 times 176 but this is in centimeters you need to find out the distance in meters so divide this by 100 1 0 get cancel out 5 times 2 so 176 divided by 2 2 times 8 16 2 times 8 16. so 88 meters is the total distance traveled for 50 rotations part 3 the cyclist says that the wheels rotate at least 800 times when it travels a distance of 1500 meters do you agree with this statement give reasons for your answer so what's one full circle that's the circumference 176 centimeters so circumference is 176 centimeters now this distance is for 800 so we'll divide and see whether the value is more than 800 so 1000 500 in centimeters 1500 into 100 that's a distance traveled so number of rotations 
,,you can find by dividing the total distance by the circumference and we'll see how many rotations are there so you get divide by 2 shall we divide by this by 2 or just long division we'll do long division so 1 5 with four zeros divide by 176 this is nothing how many 1676 are there for this one for this value so we'll take 9 or 8. that should be 8. so we'll take 8 here 8 times 6 48 4 remaining 8 times 7 56 plus 4 60 6 remaining 8 times 1 8 8 plus 6 14. when you subtract you get 2 9 so 92 for 920 what's the value so you get 6 6 times 6 36 3 remaining 6 times 7 42 42 plus 3 45 4 remaining 6 times 1 6 6 4 10 so that means less than that so we'll take five 
,,five times six thirty three remaining five times seven thirty five plus three thirty eight three remaining five times one 5 plus 3 8. so when you subtract you get 40 then another 0 is there for 400 how many 176 so that should be 2 2 times 6 42 2 times 7 14 plus 4 18 1 remaining two times one two plus one three eight one so you get eighteen so this is 852 kilometers are there that means more than 800 not kilometers here this is number of rotations so 852 are there so this is more than 800 so we can agree the statement so it's true and we can agree to the statement miscellaneous exercise find the perimeter of the shaded part of each figure so you need this semi-circle and this semi-circle becomes one circle and 40 each so what's the perimeter perimeter is here diameter is given so you can use pi d plus 40 twice now 
,,what's the diameter 10.5 you can write as 10 and a half or convert to improper fractions 21 over 2. so pi 22 over 7 t is 21 over 2 plus 80. so when you simplify you 
,,get 22 times 21 over 7 times 2 plus 80 7 times 3 2 times 11 33 plus 80 you get 113 centimeters for the perimeter of this figure this one so perimeter means this one 
,,plus this one so again you get one full circle and here you have to add these two lengths as well as these four lengths so we'll calculate the perimeter at once diameter is given so pi t semicircle and semicircle becomes one full circle plus 25 twice and then what's the small distance 10.5 and 15 when you subtract you get these 
,,two parts so 15 minus 10.5 4.5 so 4.5 means these two so multiply by 2 to get both sides length now we'll substitute what's d here 10.5 you can write as 10 and a half or as an improper fraction 21 over 2. that's easier to apply so 21 so pi 22 over 7 d is 21 over 2. so 25 times 2 here 2 times 4.5 you get 9. simplify here 22 into 
,,21 over 7 times 2 25 times 2 here and 9 7 times 3 2 times 11 so you get 33 25 times 2 50 and 9. what's the distance 3 9 12 1 remaining so 9 92 centimeters is the perimeter of this figure showed that the length of metal wire needed to make the frame shown in the figure which consists of four semicircular parts is 135 a over 28. so different diameter value so we have to take separately so what's the total length total length is the perimeter not the perimeter the circumference so here this is the circumference half of a full circle so likewise you have to add all these so we'll take the biggest one diameter is a so what's that half pi and d d is a what's this one half pi now d is a over 2 this one half pi now the diameter is a over 4. and the last one smaller one this a over 8 now half pi a over 8 now we'll take this one half pi a okay this one one fourth pi a here this one one eighth pi a and here 1 16 pi a so what's the common denominator 16 so you can convert to 16 and pi a 
,,is common you can take it like this so this is multiplied by 8 this is 4 this is 2 and this is 1 8 plus 4 12. 12 plus 2 14 14 plus 1 50. so you get 15 over 16 pi pi 
,,is 22 over 7 e now simplify you can divide by 2 8 and 11. when you multiply you get 11 times 555 and 11 times 1 11 plus 5 60. so 165 over 56 a now when you take the 
,,whole diagram frame you have to add these values as well so what's the total length of wire needed total length of wire needed we got 165 over 56 a for circular and 
,,now we have to add a plus a over 2 plus a over 4 and a over 8 to create the whole frame now what's the value when you add it you get 165 over 56 a here what's the denominator you get 8 so 8 plus 4 plus 2 plus 1. so what's the value 165 over 56 a 12 14 15 a over eight now convert to the same denominator you that's 56 so 165 plus 
,,multiplied by 7 7 times 5 35 7 times 1 7 plus 3 10 and this is a now add it together you get 5 5 10 1 remaining so 7 270 over 56 a so you can divide by 2 divide by 2 you get 1 and 35 in the numerator divided by 2 here you get 28 and 8. so the answer is 135 a over 28 that's the total wire needed to construct the whole frame question number three a paperclip with semicircular parts is to be made according to the given measurements find the length of the wire needed to make the clip in the figure so this is we need to find three semicircular parts are there and we need to add these let's so we'll find out the total length of wire needed this semicircle the diameter is 1.4 so pi d d is 1.4 and this is not a full circle so multiplied by half this semicircle the diameter is 0.7 so half pi 22 over 7 d is 0.7 and the big 
,,one what's the diameter for that semicircle 2.1 so half pi into 2.1 so those are the three semicircular parts and then you need to add 3.5 how many times 3 and add this 22 centimeter length so that's the total length of wire needed now we'll do the calculation 22 times 1.4 over 7 times 2. other one 22 times 0.7 over 2 times 7 third one 22 times 2.1 over 2 times seven and here you get three point five times three three times five fifteen two times three nine plus one ten ten point five and another 2. now we'll simplify 2 times 11 7 times 0.2 2 times 11 here 7 times 0.1 2 times 11 7 times .3 so what's the value 11 times 0.2 2.2 11 times 0.1 1.1 11 times 
,,0.3 that's 3.3 and 10.5 and 2 12.5 so what's the total distance we'll write in a column and add when you add it together you get 8 plus one nine nine plus two eleven one remaining so three plus one four four plus three seven seven plus two nine so 19.1 centi meters so we covered all theory related to circumference of a circle so what's the formula we used when we know the diameter that's c equals pi d and when we know the radius what's the circumference that's 2 pi r so what's the perimeter of semicircle pi r plus 2r or if it's diameter this is d plus what's this one half pi d so practice with all these examples and exercise and thorough with the formula and you can find out the circumference of any circle

Circle,hqpXURL5i3A,hello children so after a long time i came to you with a new lesson from grade six that is circles lesson so we will go to the lesson now when it is circus lesson you may have observed circles in our day-to-day life no children so here i have drawn few circles but sometimes they may not look circus but for a completely curved line we call what a circle okay what do we call cell for what for a completely curved line we call for a completely curved figures we call circles so as i mentioned you earlier in our day-to-day life we can observe circular shapes there are so many objects and items with circular shapes right for an example here i have taken a lid of a bottle so this lid has a circular shape actually by keeping this on a surface on a flat surface we can draw a circle right and when we consider a coin a 5 rupee coin i have taken so it has a circular shape see and i can draw a circle by keeping this on a paper and a cd see it has a circular shape and we can draw a circular circle with the help of this cd and here i have taken a tape it also has a circular shape and when we consider so many objects right so many objects see at the bottom even we can observe a circular shape right but children sometimes there are objects we think that those objects have circular shapes actually those dots have we think that they have for example sun moon earth then arrange a range like this we think that all it has a circular shape we can draw a circle with the help of that but it's wrong okay it's wrong because it has a spherical shape it is like a sphere right it doesn't have a circular shape by keeping this on the surface we cannot draw a circle also so remember these objects that means this orange and here i have taken the line so these don't have a circular shape by keeping this on a paper we cannot draw a circle so earlier i showed you some objects those cds coins and some bottle leads so with the help of those we can draw circles so these have circular objects so i hope you understood what is the difference between the circular objects and the others right so here children you can see the definition of circle here a 
,,figure with a completely curved line is called what a circle as i mentioned you earlier right so for a completely curved line we call circle right then below that i 
,,have given you some items and the objects that we can observe circular shapes see coin ring bangle clock wheel bottle lid button drum look when you see these examples easily you can remember this button clock drum bangle look ring a seal a wheel a coin bottle lead so all these objects can be used to draw circles right and we can observe circular shapes in these okay and here i explained this earlier also can we use following items or objects to draw circles actually can be observed circular shapes sometimes you may think that oh it has a circular shape but it has a spherical shape not a circle right so this is the earth a ball can be seen so these objects don't have a circular shape they have spherical shape so these are not the examples that we can observe circles right right here i have given you a small poem we will sing this once right a circle is a shape that goes around and around a circle is a shape that goes around and around it's like a pizza and a cookie a ring and 
,,a coin a circle is a shape that goes around and around so i hope that you can practice this at home next you can do this at home this exercise can be done at home right now i will explain some special points under this lesson what is this question what do we call for the middle of the circle right you can see a circle is drawn here right for the middle point what do we call there is a middle point for any circle for this midpoint we call center of the circle remember this center of the circle for the middle of the circle we call center of the circle right and to find this center at least how many times do we need to fold the circular lamina so children what is this circular lamina that means in a paper if you can draw a circle and cut it that is called a circular lamina right so when you fold this circular lamina 
,,at least two times you will be able to find the center it happens like this if this is the circle once you fold it accurately as if to get two equal pieces then when you unfold it you may get one line right again from a different place you can fold and unfold i will do this activity and show you right uh when you fold and unfold it you can see when these two straight lines are meeting at one place that is called the center more than two times even you can fall then all the lines are passing through the center only more than two lines you can draw no problem but at least how many times do we need to follow this circular lamina to find the center it is two times okay right then our next point what do we call for the distance from the center to the circle right here i have drawn a circle actually this is not in your 
,,syllabus but it's better if you can know this so here after finding the center of the circle from the center to the circle this is the second one to the circle look 
,,at the distance and the distance is every time same right from the center to the circle when we draw few lines with the help of a ruler those distances are equal in 
,,the same circle that distance is called virtual it is called radius right and then if i have drawn here a small circle uh in this small circle from the center to the circle look at the distance is it equal to this radius yes of course this is also a radius but we can see these two circles are different with size so this has a greater radius than this we know that the radius of different circles are different that distance is different but in the same circle only it becomes equal when we consider this circle the radius is equal radius is equal but in two different circles the two really are different right if their size us if their sizes are different then how many axes of symmetry are there for a circle when we take a circle here just think i have taken here is a circular lamina and now i am unfolding it as if to 
,,get two equal pieces like this just think i have folded right i can't get two equal pieces no which are coinciding that means this piece lies on the other one completely ah this line is called an axis of symmetry so children for a circle such how many lines will be there as you think you can fold from anywhere that you want and 
,,get so many axes of symmetry so many are there so in mathematics for so many what do we call infinity infinity we cannot count there are so many axes of symmetry unlisted so for a circle such harmony lines can be drawn infinity we call them as access of symmetry next year you will learn this properly so there are infinity number of axis of symmetry for a circle right and the next point you learned that earlier using the cd coin bangle using such type of objects you can draw circles right and you know what there is an instrument also that we can use to draw circles what do we call power of compasses that is the instrument children okay that is not an object actually so you must know the difference between the instrument and the objects and items that we can use to draw circles what were the objects and items we discussed earlier cd coin ring bangle plate those are the objects or items that we can use to draw surface but what is the instrument in mathematics that we use to draw circles that is the pair of compasses they are of compasses by fixing the pencil a short pencil we can draw this so next year you learn this properly for your general knowledge only i have given you this one you may have seen sometimes right sinhala and english medium online classes for 2021 from 800.00k if you are willing to join our new online classes from grade 6 to 11 you can register through www dot edu hunter dot lk limited seats are available for more details please contact zero seven one zero triple seven six five six you

Circle,Fzaof9cX-PM&t=32s,so this video is an introduction into circles the radius of a circle is a segment that connects the center of the circle which we'll call a to any point on a circle 
,,so segment a B represents the radius of a circle the diameter passes through the center of the circle and it's twice the length of the radius so this is the diameter and let's call this a B C so segment ABC is the diameter of a circle now on the left the center of the circle is Point a so you could describe a circle like this on the right you can describe the circle based on the center point B now the area of a circle is PI R squared and the circumference of a circle is 2 pi R the circumference of a circle is basically the perimeter of a circle is the distance around the circle now the diameter is twice the radius so we can replace 2r with the diameter so you can also calculate the circumference using this equation it's pi times the diameter now sometimes you may need to calculate only a section of the circle for 
,,example let's say this is point a B and C and let's say B is the center of the circle and we wish to calculate the area of this sector how can we do so and also how 
,,can we calculate the length of this arc which I'm gonna call vests so if B is the Sun of the circle that means segment a B and segment BC represents the radius of the circle now to calculate the shaded region the area of the shaded region rather it's very similar to the area of a circle but with some adjustments notice that we have a fraction of a circle so whatever this angle is theta in degrees it's going to be theta divided by 360 because the entire circle has an angle of 360 so theta over 360 represents the fraction of the circle multiplied by the area of a circle so this equation will give you the area of a sector or the shaded region that we have there now to calculate the arc length of that sector it's basically a fraction of the circumference so it's theta divided by 360 times the circumference of the circle so that's how you can calculate the arc length so s the arc between a and B you can describe it this way so this represents the arc between points a and Point C and the measure of Arc A to C that's an angle so in this example it's theta so theta represents the measure of Arc AC to calculate the left of arc AC you can use this formula now let's talk about chords let me draw a better circle it's not really that much better now what exactly is a chord a chord is a line segment that connects two points that are on the edge of the circle so a B is a chord see D is also a cord now let's say that this point is the center let's call this D EF so we have circle E or with Center E and D F is a chord now a chord that passes through the center of a circle is also known as the diameter of the circle so DF is basically a chord and it's the diameter of the circle which means EF represents the radius of the circle and de is also the radius of a circle so a chord is simply a line segment that starts at one end of the circle and touches another point on a circle now what happens if we form an angle using two chords so the two chords are chord a B and chord BC and notice that this angle angle ABC which is known as an inscribed angle it has an intercepted arc AC which we can write it like this now let's say if the inscribed angle is 50 degrees so if angle ABC is equal to 50 degrees what do you think the measure of Arc AC is it turns out that the intercepted arc has an angle that's twice the value of the inscribed angle so this is going to be a hundred degrees so make sure you understand that now let's say if you have an angle that touches 
,,the center of a circle as opposed to a point on a circle so let's say C is the center and this is 40 degrees let's call this point a and point B what is the measure 
,,of art a be the measure of our KB is the same as the angle that touches the center of the circle so it's gonna be 40 degrees but if you have an inscribed angle now let's say this is 80 the inscribed angle is half of the intercepted art so this is gonna be 40 now let's work on some problems so we're given the diameter of a circle and it's 8 centimeters our goal is to calculate the circumference and the area of a circle so let's draw a picture so this is the diameter this is 8 centimeters the circumference is simply pi times the diameter so it's pi times 8 or you can write it as a PI so that's the exact answer of this cumference now if you want to get the decimal value for that just type in a PI in your calculator and so you should get 25 point one centimeters as it's cumference so that's a rounded answer now the area is PI R squared so first we need to calculate the radius the radius is one half of the diameter so it's 1/2 of 8 which is 4 centimeters so the area is going to be pi times 4 squared or 16 pi so 16 pi is the exact answer and the units for that are square centimeters this is in centimeters and 16 pi is 50 point 27 square centimeters as a decimal approximately number 2 the area of a circle is 81 pi what is the circumference of the circle so we know the area is PI R squared and the area is 81 pi so let's calculate the value of R so first we could divide both sides by PI if we do so these will cancel so 81 is equal to r-squared and now we just got to take the square root of both sides the square root of 81 is 9 and so that's the radius it's 9 units long the circumference is 2 pi R so it's 2 pi times 9 which is 18 pi units so as a decimal that's 56 point 55 units long now the diameter is twice the value of the radius so it's 2 times 9 or 18 and so that's the left of the diameter of a circle number 3 the radius of the circle below is 7 inches what is the angle measure of Arc AC so this is arc AC so the angle measure of Arc AC is equal to this angle where B is the center of the circle so BC is 7 inches long and a B is 7 inches long so the measure of the arc is 150 now what is the length of Arc AC so to calculate the arc length which you can denote SS it's equal to theta divided by 360 times the circumference of a circle which is 2 pi R so this angle is 150 we need to divide that by 360 and then multiply that by 2 pi times the radius which is 7 so 150 divided by 360 times 2 times 7 this turns out to be 35 PI over 6 now if you want to see how to get that answer without a specialized calculator first we can cancel the zero and 15 we can reduce that to 5 times 3 thirty-six that's three times 12 and 12 I'm gonna break that into six times two and we have two and seven on the outside so notice I can cancel a three and I can cancel a two so I'm left over way 
,,5 times 7 which gives me 35 and I have a 6 on the bottom so that's where the six come from and plus we have pi so the arc length so arc AC has the length of 35 PI over 6 now as a decimal this is 18.3 now let's calculate the area of the shaded region so the area of the blue shaded region is going to be the angle divided by three-sixty times the area of the entire circle so the angle is 150 we're going to divide that by 360 and the radius is seven so we're gonna multiply it by seven squared so once again we could cancel zero 15 is five times three 36 is 12 times 3 and 7 squared is 49 so 49 times five is 245 so this is going to be 245 pi divided by 12 so 
,,that's the exact answer and as a decimal this is about 64 point 1 square units so this represents the area of the sector calculate the value of x and y in each figure shown below so for the circle on the top left we can see that B is the Sun of the circle therefore X and the measure of Arc AC has to be the same so for the first 
,,problem X is equal to 80 degrees now for the second problem on the top right the inscribed angle is going to be half of the intercepted arc so Y is one-half of 60 it's in this case it's 30 degrees now for this one the intercepted arc is twice the value of the inscribed angle so X is going to be twice the value of 80 so it's 2 times 80 or 160 degrees now what about the third problem on the bottom left one thing I forgot to do is tell you what we're trying to calculate so let me do that now what is the value of x in this figure where X represents this angle right here so notice that it intercepts these two points which we can call BC and notice that a is the center of the circle so therefore chord BC is the diameter which bisects the circle into two parts therefore half of 360 is 180 so the intercepted arc is 180 which means that the inscribed angle is half of the intercepted arc so X is going to be half of 180 which means that it's 90 so this triangle is a right triangle number five if a B is 48 and BC is 14 what is the area of the shaded region so the area of the shaded region is the difference a s would represent the area of the shaded 
,,region it's the difference between the area of the circle AC minus the area of the triangle 80 now the area of a circle is PI R squared the area of a triangle particularly a right triangle it's 1/2 base times height so triangle ABC which looks like this I'm going to draw it this way so this is the hypotenuse so this is vertex B 
,,"this is a and this is C now a B is 48 and BC is 14 now notice that AC is the equivalent of the diameter of the circle if we can calculate the diameter we can calculate the radius now BC is the base of the triangle so BC is 14 so a lowercase B in this equation is 14 the height of the triangle is 48 that's a B so now we just got to calculate the radius so let's focus on calculating the diameter first so for right triangle we can use the Pythagorean theorem C squared is equal to a squared plus B squared C is the hypotenuse which is across the box so that's the same as the diameter a it's going to be 14 you can make a or B 14 so if a is 14 B has to be 40 8.now 14 squared is 196 48 times 48 is 2,304 so if we add up 23:04 plus 196 that will give us 2500 and that's equal to d squared so to calculate D we got to take the "
,,square root of both sides 2500 is the same as 25 times 100 the square root of 25 is 5 and the square root of 100 is 10 so 5 times 10 is 50 so the diameter is 50 the 
,,radius is one half of the diameter so it's half of 50 which is 25 so now we have everything that we need to calculate the area of the shaded region so it's going to 
,,be pi times 25 squared so 25 squared is 625 half of 14 is 7 and 7 times 48 is 336 so this is the exact answer it's 625 pi minus 336 now let's get the answer as a decimal 625 pi is 1960 3.5 if we subtracted by 336 this is equal to 6 27:25 and so this is the area of the shaded region

Circle,_0k5U7SrDg8,hello this is mr. Buffington and today we're going to talk about circles just a brief introduction to circles and then some things that we can do with circles first 
,,off we need to say what is a circle and this is an example of what a circle is right here a circle is a set of points that are all in equal distance from the center 
,,so the center you draw that point and then each other point is exactly the same distance from that Center all right you may have constructed a circle using a compass that's a tool that basically holds I sent the same distance and then you rotate it around and it will draw a perfect circle all right so a circle again set of points that are all an equal distance from the center those points are joined together it looks like this a solid line all right it doesn't look like a dotted line link in the previous slide now what we're going to do next is to talk about the parts of a circle the first part I want to talk about is a chord a chord is any point that 
,,goes from the edge of the circle to the edge of the circle all right you see this example of a chord does not go through the center all right it can be on any side it can be all the way around it can be short it can be long as long as it's touching two points of the circle it's called a chord all right the longest possible chord would go straight through the center and that would be the maximum distance but any chord is basically a line that touches from one edge of the circle to the other 
,,here's an example of like I said the longest chord the chord that goes straight through the center of the circle has a special name we call that the diameter the diameter of the circle is the longest distance that you can draw inside the circle you also can draw a diameter in any different direction any point of the circle can go through the center and touch another point of the circle so there's an infinite number of diameters that you could draw through a circle we draw them in all different angles but there's one example of the diameter again the diameter does not need to be going up and down it to be in any direction as long as it goes from one point of the circle to another point in the circle and passes through the center all right a radius as you can see here this green line goes from the center of the circle to the outside all right to any point on the circle that's that consistent distance that again you can take a radius hold it completely steady spin it all the way around and you would draw the circle all right that's what a radius is it is that distance from the center of the circle to any given point on the circle and the circumference of the circle is the distance all the way around the outside all right that's a vocabulary word we might not use quite yet but we'll definitely come to the circumference is the distance around the outside of the circle all right so here's just a quick list of all the different parts of a circle that we've talked about radius chord Center diameter circumference all kind of put into one picture so you can kind of see all the different parts and how they would relate to each other 
,,all right now on to doing a little bit of math what is the relationship between a radius from the center to the outside or this blue radius from the center to the outside by the way a plural of radius is rady radii are Adi I again so if you're talking about Reina you're talking about multiple radiuses or one or two radius you've got many of them so you've got a great eye all right anyway the relationship between a radius one radius and the diameter and I think this picture helps us to illustrate we'll go from this the diameter to the radius diameter radius diameter phryges pan radius Ambler radius all right and I think it becomes pretty clear that one 
,,radius is half of the diameter and to raid I would be equal to the diameter the way that we write this in math terms is like this two times the radius is equal to the diameter or you can say the diameter is two times the radius means the same thing all right so two times the radius is equal to the diameter or the diameter is equal to two times the radius you could also write this if you want to write it in terms of radius you could say the radius is equal to the diameter divided by two that would be another way to write the same basic idea is that one radius is half of the diameter or the diameter is two times the radius we're going to use that to answer the next couple of questions first off what is the length of this diameter so we're given that a radius is equal to five point three inches so what we would need 
,,to do then is to use our equation our equation says that the diameter is equal to our radius x - 2 times the radius so our diameter is equal to two times five point 
,,three in other words our diameter then is equal to ten point six inches and that's how we would solve for the diameter and if we wanted to write it out and cents we 
,,say the diameter is ten point six inches we could also just label it in here ten point six inches show that the diameter is equal to that distance all right I have a circular garden with a radius of five meters what is the longest row of flowers I can plant you know when I was writing this I thought to myself man that's kind of 
,,girly to be talking about planting flowers I mean we plant flowers and they look nice but um let's make this just a little bit more manly and make it a row of potatoes all right so I have a circular garden with the rain five meters what is the longest rope potatoes I can plant if it helps you can draw sore draw a picture and oftentimes it does help to do this sometimes you don't need it your pictures can be pretty approximate there's an example of my garden centimeters it would be meters okay so there's my radius of five meters what is the longest row of potatoes I could plant let's say I want my potatoes grow to be kind of like a brown color not really going to show up very long here but there we go so that would be the longest possible row I could could make now I could make it in any direction but I'm going to 
,,make it basically look like that so by drawing this picture I can see well the longest it would be would be ten meters if I wanted to write that in math terms I would say my diameter is equal to two times my radius in other words two times five my diameter is equal to ten meters so the longest row of flowers or potatoes I could 
,,plant would be ten meters long one row all the way across from some from the sides of the side straight through the center all right the other type of question that 
,,we can get with this is if we're given the diameter and we're asked to find the radius so what is the radius of a circle with the diameter 25 feet I can use my equation radius is equal to a diameter divided by two my radius is equal to 25 divided by 2 therefore my radius is equal to 12 and 1/2 or I could also in this case if I feel really inclined I could draw a picture and label the parts and it's not wrong to do that it just takes longer and that's fine 25 feet and I should label this as 
,,feet this one and then I would take a radius any radius at all and then be half of that 12.5 feet so again you can draw a picture you could use the equations either 
,,way the relationship between the radius and my diameter is that the radius is half the length of the diameter you

Circle,EEhA7T8pfzk,hi everyone this is Eileen here from Singapore 11 XCOM in today's video I'd like to share with you how I go about working on the angle properties of circle question 
,,so after I read the question I will usually suggest to my students to map out two things first thing all the 90 degrees so in this question there are a few 90 degrees that we can mark up since there is tangent and there is radius as well so we can map out one of the 90 degrees here okay tangent and reduce from 90 degrees similarly another 90 degrees over here now there is another 90 degrees in this question if you notice that there is a diameter which means to say making use of the property call angle and semi circle this is our 90 degrees as well the second thing that I will suggest my student to month out is the radius why would we want to mark out the radius you asked it's actually for us to find isosceles triangle that might come in useful later so this is my radius my radius radius so with that we can start a question proper now the first part of the question asks is to find angle X so to find angle X if you observe this shape over here 80 Co it is made up of two ninety 
,,degrees to right angle triangle so the sum of angles in this 2 right angle triangle will be a total of 360 - away 90 - away 90 and - or 40 that will give us a dread 
,,40 all right and the reason I'll give is sum of angles in two right angle triangles this is one way of looking at this question update this angle here and other way 
,,of looking at it as some of you might do this alright you might tell me that angle a Hyo is equal to angle CTO which is equals to 20 degrees and the reason is because tangents from external point that will as well so if you know this angle here is 20 you know this is 90 so therefore you can find out what is angle a whole T which is 180 minus 20 minus 90 that will give us 70 and you can conclude therefore angle a OC which is our X in C goes to 70 times 2 which is 1 for all so this is another way that you can find angle X now let us now go ahead and file and go why let me just erase the part here okay to make your diagram really clear so now to find angle Y which is over here this seems to me to be like an angle at the circumference if only I can find the angle at the centre now to find angle Y this will be the angle that you want to consider okay so puppy and go Y before we can find and go why I need to find out what is the reflex and go eh Oh C equals to you can find easily since you have found the value of x just now so it's 360 minus 140 we should give you 220 so therefore angle Y is just 220 divided by 2 equals to 1 1 OH and the reason angle at centre is equals to 2 times angle at circumference alright so that is how we go about finding and go why now one of the common mistake that I like to point out to all of you instead some students identify the wrong pair this is the angle at the circumference and the identify angle X at the angle as the angle at the center so they conclude all and go Y therefore will be 140 divided by two which is 70 and this is in all right all right please do take note of this common mistake who is the correct angle at a circumference and anger at the center you must be able to identify the correct pair so for the last part whereby they asked you to find Z 
,,or leave it as a bonus question for all of you to attempt if you know the answer put it down in a comment section as well as the reason to your answer for those of you who do not know how to get started I'll give you a little clue joint point a and E if we can find out the value of this angle it has some relationship to your angle Z thank you very much for your attention I look forward to seeing you in the next video

Circle,BDqELk2xCPU&t=7s,hi there and welcome to video 13 which is a tutorial on circle theorems remember these videos are mainly for higher AQA unit 3 and therefore students who previously 
,,sat the foundation who are now trying the higher so they're an introduction to the topics that I'd like you to get right in the exam that would be easier for you to 
,,get right now in this video I'm going to introduce you to the several seventh circle theorems make a card or make several revision cards so you've got one on each one that you can revise form and then move straight onto video 14 which will be all the past exam questions on circle theorems using the knowledge we have just gone through in this video so let's start straight away before we launch into the circle theorems let's just talk about the parts of a circle so on the start and draw ourselves out a circle here now key part of the circle is the center so you should know that there is a center of a circle a line from the center to the what's the circumference of a circle I'll deal with that in a second is called radius okay this is called a radius and you can think of it like sunrays okay coming out from the center of the Sun so radius now a line that goes through the center from one edge of the circle to the other but it must go through the center is called a diameter so this one here is called a diameter okay and you should see from that that that that the diameter is obviously to lots of the radius so it's two times the radius because the radius just goes from the outside to the center the diameter goes from the outside to the center and back to the outside so there are three important things of 
,,a circle the distance around a circle well the distance around any shapes usually the perimeter but a circles got its special name for its perimeter and it's called 
,,the circumference okay there's a conference so that's the whole distance around the outside of a circle we need to know a couple of new definitions okay so I'm going to try and use a different colored line for these runs we probably know this from my circles video now a part of a lesser a line that cuts a circle like that but does not go through the center so the key thing here is it does not go through the center and leave that blue is what we call a cord this is called a cord okay now the piece of the circle it leaves here like this whole piece here is then called a segment it's a segment of the circle there's a small segment this whole bit left over here is a big segment or a major segment okay so there's one thing we need to know that's a call the other thing we need to know is if we take a slice of the circle like we have the slice of cake let's say so we cut a circle with two radii to the center then that part of a circle would be called a sector okay so sector is like 
,,a piece of cake and a segment is when you cut the cake it in in sort of an unusual direction but you don't go through the center okay and two last things we should we should say and say I take any point in space outside the circle like here this is just a point and I draw a line from that point to the circle so that it only touches the circle it doesn't cut through the circle and I'll always be able to find two of those ones that one there one there these lines here are called tangents t4 touch they touch the circle okay so any other line would cut through a circle at two places but here it just touches here and touches here they are called tangents okay so they're all the parts of the circle that I may refer to when I'm going through the following circle theorems you should be aware of all of these different pieces of terminology okay let's get straight on with some circle theorems his one here's a picture that describes rule 1 and rule 1 says that the angle at the center of a circle is twice that of the circumference that is again if they're coming from the same arc okay so the angle coming from an arc at the center is twice the angle 
,,coming from the same arc at the circumference okay so um so in this case here B is two lots of a if you struggle and remembering that I sometimes think the population at the center of a city is bigger than the outskirts of a city so there's one way of remembering it let's just do a quick example here here's a typical question for us it tells us that a OC a OC the anklet oh here is 96 degrees it asks us ABC aid to be to see that one we know Anglet Center is twice the angle at the edge so this is 96 this must be 48 okay and let's just have another look at this rule here's the rule again remember angle at Center twice angle at circumference if they told us that ABC was 44 a 2 B 2 C this one was 44 what would a OC a OC what would that not be well is doubled that one there should be 88 degrees okay and that's wrong one cup of nice easy rule okay let's move on to rule two here's a picture for rule 2 what rule 2 says is it says that angles in a triangle that's in a semicircle inside the inside the circle must have a 90-degree at this conference so a way to write it in exam angles in this semicircle contain a 90-degree now this actually is just 
,,rule 1 again because look remember we said in rule 1 if you take a nap and you look at the angle at the center the angle at Center here it's a straight line so it's 
,,180 degrees and let's enter double angular edge therefore this angle here must be 90 which is half of that so really this is just a special case of rule one but it's one you've got to quote in the exam easy way of writing it anger angles in the semicircle contain a 90-degree at this conference so in this example find angle ABC a - B - C assuming this is the center and these this is therefore the diameter a Caesar diameter this is a case of angles in a semicircle contained a ninety degree so this angle must be 90 okay let's take a look at one more example here and again here's the rule angles in this semicircle container 90 it says if C a B is 44 C - a 
,,- B is 44 degrees find BCA find B - C - a find this one okay well if this is a diameter this is a triangle in a semicircle this angle here must be 90 so to get this 
,,one you add 44 at 90 you get 134 degrees and then you take that away from 180 C to 180 subtract 134 and you get 46 degrees so BCA is 46 degrees okay let's move on with a new rule rule three here here's a picture for rule three and what rule three says is that if you have an arc like this then any angle you draw coming out of that arc at the circumference will be the same so these two red ones are the same and the way we phrase it and laws from the same arc ax Conference are equal now it's not just two angles I could you know as long as I start from the arc and I finish back at that arc that angle there would also equal the other two red ones so that would be the same there and I could do that indefinitely I can go from here to here and that would be the same so angles from the same arc are equal now don't confuse 
,,this with rule one all the angles that I'm talking about here are the circumference okay in rule one we said angler center double angle edge here angular edges are all the same as long as they're from the same arc okay quick example if ABC's 44 A to B to C this one's 44 they're asking what a DC is always label it a DC call that 
,,one X what's that one well let's define our arc now our art could be here or here it because we've got an A in a C and then ans see our arc is AC so drawing outlines from here just to show you that is coming from that harp and also the 44 is coming from that art so X must equal 44 so the angle we're trying to find must also equal 44 because angles from the same arc at the circumference are equal okay another example this one is just getting everything together so we can see all the different cases if da B is 44 D 2 a 2 B is 44 okay and a 2 B 2 C is 68 sorry let's just do that again D 2 a 2 B is 44 and A to B to C is 60 it asks us to find DC be DC be that one and it asks us to find a DC that one okay so we've got to find these now obviously x and y are either 44 and 60 it's about getting it right define your art let's just define our arc and get this one sort of files DB there's our arc okay and the angle coming out from this is 44 and it must be the same as the X so X must be 44 and X was DC B so this is 44 degrees okay take those away for now that's 44 and then find the other arc here AC what angles are coming out of this well the 60 is coming out of it there and also the Y is coming out of there so angle ADC must be equal to 60 so this one is 60 here okay let's move on to rule 4 rule 4 there's a picture for rule 4 and what rule 4 says is opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral adds 180 so opposite angles the a in the scene add to 180 and the D in the B add 
,,to 180 and that's written there now what does a cyclic quadrilateral mean a quadrilateral has four sides and a cyclic quadrilateral is one whose edge corners are on 
,,the circumference of a circle so whenever you see a four-sided shape whose edges are on the circumference of a circle you know that the opposite angles must add to 180 okay so let's try and use this example here it tells us that ABC eight to B to C is 84 and it tells us to beat C to D is 102 B to C to D is 102 and it asks us CD 
,,a CD a and then call that X and it asks us D a B I'm going to call that Y how would I work those out well we have a quadrilateral whose edges lie on the circumference of a circle so we know that this rule about opposite angles must add to 180 so y must be whatever number it takes to get that to 180 so y must be 78 degrees and similarly X must be whatever it takes for these two to add to 180 and it would be 96 degrees and let's just take a look at another type of question with this rule this angles opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral add to 180 here's a question shows us a quadrilateral it our sauce is this a cyclic one ie could I draw a circle around it so that it perfectly each corner was on the edge of a circle could I do that well I'm trying to do it here with a circle I'm not getting much success but that's not approve that doesn't tell us anything what we do know is if if it was a cyclic the opposite angles have to add 280 now that one and that one add up when you 
,,add them up they add to 179° they don't add to 180 so they can't be sick up so the answer to this is no okay right we've got three more rules to go let's just get through these as quick as we can his rule five it's called the alternate segment theorem it's a fairly complicated rule to remember but if you just try and visualize this picture it says whenever you have a tangent remember a tangent is a line that touches a circle at one place here when the tangent meets a chord and this is a chord remember a chord is a line that cuts a circle not going through the center then the angle the tangent makes with the chord is equal to the opposite angle in the resulting shape is equal to this angle here and similarly it works off from the other side of it the tangents meet in the chord this side so this angle must equal the opposite angle in the resulting shape over there and mathematically the way we say is the angle between a chord and the tangent is equal to the angle in the alternate segment this one is equal to this angle in the alternate segment this one is equal to this angle in the alternate segment in the exam you can just quote alternate segment theorem so here's an example if BA D is 19 B 2 a 2 D is 19 they want to know what AC B is a 2 C to be this one here what we've got a tangent meeting a chord and they meet at 90 degrees therefore the angle in the alternate set when that one must also mean 19 degrees and it's as simple as that now they didn't tell us this but imagine they told us that one there was a hundred and four degrees this is a tangent meeting a chord at 104 so the angle in the alternate segment opposite here 
,,must also be 104 okay and that's well 5 finally we've got rule 6 and 7 I'm going to do this all in one and do a couple of examples and then we'll finish with these circle theorems so here's a picture for each of the rules and rule 6 tells us that when a tangent a line that just touches a circle meets a radius they always meet at 90 degrees always make a 90 degree angle okay so a tangent and radius meeting at a 90 degree here's a lateral rule 7 it tells us that two tangents to a circle from 
,,the same point in space so here's a point in space I've drawn a tangent to that circle okay so it's touching here it would keep going on you wouldn't cross the circle and touching here they are the same length they will always be the same length okay let these rules tend to come up in in sort of mixed questions so let's just have got a couple of questions and finish there these are our last two rules let's take a look here PT is a tangent to a circle Center o tu is a chord there's a chord and and angle P tup to T to use 54 find the size of angle T oh you so this angle hit now tio is obviously a radius because it's a line from the center oh it tells us 
,,the Centers Oh to the edge of the circle when the tangent meets a radius the whole angle is 90 degrees okay now if that whole angle is 90 and just this part of it is 54 this must mean that this angle here is equal to 26 degrees okay now this is a triangle made of two radiuses so it's not saw sleaze triangle so this one also must be 26 degrees and then to get the angle oh you do 180 minus 26 minus 26 and you get 128 128 degrees so this one here is 128 degrees the reasons I would say tangent 
,,meet in a radius meet at 90 therefore angle o T the uto is 26 but this triangle here is our sauce Lisa the angler use 26 therefore the angle o is 180 minus 26 minus 
,,26 and last question PA and PB are tangents to a circle we know that two tangents come from the same point where they meet a circle they must be the same length so that length is equal to that Ling so we've got an isosceles triangle it tells us this angle is 68 workout P a B P 2 a 2 B work out that angle well you know that if this and this are the same length length and this angle and this angle are the same so this must be X this must be X we're trying to find out that so we know that 2x plus 68 must equal 180 and solving that 2x must be 180 minus 68 which is 112 and so we know that X must be half that which is equal to 56 degrees and the angle PA B is therefore 56 degrees ok so those are all the seven circle theorems that you need to learn have a revision card or a cup of you know drank it to circle theorems on 
,,each revision card and learn all those move straight on to the next video now which is going to be all the passed paper questions on circle theorems and you should be able to answer them all using the knowledge you've learned in this video thank you for watching and good luck in your revision

Circle,L_IcPo-JVmY,hey friends you can see various pictures and figures on the screen did you notice anything common between them all the above things look similar to a particular shape that is a circle for example the shape of a bangle shape of a pizza bicycle wheel coins etc circle is one of the most common shapes in this universe in this session we will learn all the basic terminologies in context to a circle let me take you to a park which is nearby my house which is also round and this park has some special features which we learn throughout this session firstly there is a fountain exactly in the center of the park and benches are put around the boundary of the park here you can see that the park is a circle and the fountain is in the center of the circle and the benches are on the boundary of the park which is equidistant from the fountain mathematical definition of circle is also on the same lines a circle can be defined as the collection of all the points in a plane which are at a fixed distance from a fixed point in the plane the fixed point is called the origin of the circle and the fixed distance is called as the radius if you see there is a path which connects the fountain and the entrance gate this path can be called as the radius the radius is the distance from the center of the circle to the boundary of the circle radius is a Latin word which means the way or the spoke of a wheel radius is denoted by a small letter R now if we extend that path to meet the other side of the boundary of the park passing through the fountain then it will be called as a diameter the diameter of the circle is a straight line passing through the center connecting two points on the boundary of the circle diameter comes from a Greek word diameter oz where dye means across or through and metrons means to measure diameter is denoted by the small letter D as you can see that diameter touches the circle at two different points well then any line segment which touches the circle 
,,at two different points it is known as a chord of the circle god of a circle is a straight line connecting two points on the circle where it is visible in the path that diameter is the longest chord in the park now if the same road extends on both the sides outside the park then that road can be called as a secant of the park c-care in Latin means to cut and hence any line which cuts the circle is called as a secant kindly note the difference between diameter cord and a secant donítö is a cord which passes through the center whereas cord touches at any two points on the circle and secant is a line stretching to infinity at both the directions now once 
,,we have drawn a chord or a segment we can see that the park gets divided into two regions now these regions are known as segments the segment of the circle is the region bounded by a chord and the arc subtended by the chord the larger area is known as major segment and the smaller one is known as a minor segment if the chord or 
,,a secant is a diameter then the circle gets divided into two equal regions and in our case it gets divided into two equal semi circles now just imagine if you're jogging around the boundary of the park and when you complete one round of this boundary it is known as the circumference of this circular Park in which you're jogging 
,,circumference is the distance around the boundary of a circle if you noticed the road in front of the park touches the park only at the entrance gate of the park so 
,,if there is a line which touches the circle at one and only one point then it will be called as a tangent to the circle however they can be infinite lines that can be drawn to a point on the circle but there is only one line that touches the circle through that point on the boundary of the park there is a part which contains all type of flowers this area is just a small part of the boundary and you can see that it looks like an arc and so friends is called as an arc itself an arc is the portion of the boundary or the circumference in the circle now we saw the area which is flowers there are two ways to go to that area but both the paths start from the 
,,fountain if we concentrate only on that particular area it will be called as a sector of a circle sector of a circle is the area bounded by two radii and an arc subtended between them now actually have understood what a sector is so can you give me some another example for sector I'll give you a hint we all love pizza one particular slice of pizza can be called as a sector the smaller region is known as - sector and the bigger region is known as a major sector kindly note the difference between sectors and segments sectors and segments both are bounded by an arc but the difference is that sectors are enclosed by two radii and segments are enclosed by a code and when that code is a diameter sectors are equal to segments let us quickly recall what all we have learnt in this session so friends before we end this session let me just ask you one last question do you think earth is also a circle the answer is no Earth is not a circle do not confuse the shape of Earth with a circle 
,,or a spherical in shape and three dimensional in nature whereas a circle is a two dimensional shape in a single plane that's all for this session in the next session we will learn something more on a tangent to a circle if you like this video hit the like button and leave your valuable comments below and do subscribe to our Channel till then stay tuned to let students learning

Circle,EOX6FVz03sc,hi my dear student welcome you all to the mass college today we are going to learn about new lesson circum perils of the circle before identify circle balance of the circle I remember for you don't forget subscribe our YouTube channel of mass college ok now I'm going to explain to you your previous knowledge of the part of circle look at the board very carefully you can see but circle but in this part this element called center that means midpoint of the circle be called center and also rename these  Y as so I mean origin or if you mean midpoint on anyway because here we mention as st. that Oh next circle you can see two part here one part is radius what is being radius radius means the line the straight line joining the center and any point of the circle we hold as Center sorry we called as radius we can name simple part o capital R because we're here first let of the radius R okay then we can name this line that means failure as oh see oh see oh see will occur in me this Peter next on diameter what is the diameter diameter mean the line the straight line joining any to point any to point of the circle the whole diameter we can symbol simple D or capital D and also here can you this figure we can name a be e be okay you know this diameter equal to how many are to what we can find diameter equal to 
,,time I to time wats they missed one you can see here to name first one is horn what is the fourth for me the line joining any two point of the circle we hold as old 
,,but showing the line the straight line joining any two point of the circle we called cord you can see here three courts first chord is d e another one here me and also have G okay you can see a special one very special a B this code has a diameter yes the longest part of the circle we can identify as a but if I said I needed as 
,,a porn okay and another one ah what do you mean uh I mean the curved line the curve right called the arc of the circle d e and also the B D minor and D he made up the e minor arc de meter central ideas this is aa okay you now remember about our previous knowledge of this element of circle okay now you are going to find the parameters of these figures what is the parameter parameter mean the summer plane of the plane pickle some problems around the plant occur you know accordingly you are knowledge how to find the perimeter of this square all side-eye curve we can write people a multiply for because no problem P equal foil this is strangled it's time to cite and your wife we can write to my ex Addison why no problem here of this speaker also we can write parameter how many time like P P times lie beside one time two time three times P is three time we can multiply by the denison length of Q you can see two times to multiply Q and also this one so this is heat and here remain else that means people the P Addison to Hugh Addison is okay no problem we found PI Square triangle and these figures so what is the parameter but here you have a circle for finds the perimeter of the circle that means length of some more length around a speaker not males only lightly parinita means somehow bloom of these people 
,,we have a problem how to find today we are going to find what is how to find the perimeter of circle yes perimeter of the circle we have given very special name for 
,,the perimeter of the circle what is circumference why circumference with all parameter because this second half howling boundary we called as especially circumference we have given to find the circumference of the circle formula what the formula we can do both very capital C equal Phi D what is Phi Phi is a constant posted me not changing value the value not change constantly not change okay five house the wedding what is value Phi is my dear students I write here five years 22 upon 7 o we 
,,can find another value this is me respond to 3.14 22 0.70 3.14 I regularly use 22 upon seven okay here now we know what is the formula C equal Phi D we can apply o5e fun these 418 D is to time-lapse we call can we apply for D 2 y 2 times I know we have to write 2 Phi R this is the another formula if you have only radius we can apply radius value if you have diny the value we can apply diameter value okay now we are going to solve in some problem with formula now I am going to do two example by using our formula here already seven centimeter we have now to find circumference okay we can apply our theorem sorry formula C equal to Phi a Boyar to fire now 
,,given our people we can apply to Phi R we know now Phi is 20 2 upon 7 C equal what is C see me circumference first lack of circumferences C because we symbol as the 
,,circumference capital of simple C 2 multiplied 22 upon 7 R is some 1 centimeter should be mentioned you need seven to seven cancel remain to multiply 22 body for his final arms of the circumference of circle now we can go to second example we have a diameter 21 centimeter he learned another formula also what is circumference is 
,,5e because we can apply this formula see well five is twenty two point seven D is 21 centimeter council by seven one here for 21 322 multiplied three in 66 66 centimeter circumference of this circle is 66 centimeter okay now we are going to how to find the parameter of semicircle and compound circular Peter what is look at the ball is how find the parameter of following figure by apply our formula you can see first one what is this semi circular lamina lesson parameter Y parameter circumference apply only for circle but here we call this parameter here a half of circle because half of the formula value that means P equal here D because Phi D ah but Phi T for a whole circle but here semicircle because we have to divide by two Addison this straight line segment one is the system and segment diameter 21 centimeter now we can write Phi is 22 upon 7 D is 21 centimeter and also you can see here two we can write like this one second Edison 21 20 meter helps y71 cancel by seven here 
,,pre canceled by - Bonnie canceled by to 1111 multiply 3 is 33 centimeter Allison 21 centimeter 1 Harrison 3 4 - Edison 3 fire you telling it of this circular lamina 
,,Cindy circular lamina is 54 centimeter now let's go for the second example here you can see semicircle part and also to state line we can write by this P equal for the semicircle here several mean die needle Phi D upon to Edison 2 times 6 2 times 6 centimeter five years 22 before 7b is 7 centimeter and also this - half a descent 2 times 6 is 12 centimeter now cancel by 7 1 by 7 1 by 2 1 by 2 xi xi multiplied 1 multiply 1 is 11 centimeter and sell 12 centimeter to medicine 1 is 3 1 person 1 
,,is 2 23 centimeters the family top disfigure now third example you can see here two semicircular parts and also we have to add this suspect line part also ok we can 
,,apply the formula find the same circular part but whatever you this yes we can find how 10.5 mu this length 7 centimeter this length sorry this length is 7 centimeter because 10.5 softmax and 7 we can find this link for you in subtract 3 is 3 3 point 5 is this value okay now you can find by G's parameter if we mentioned simple hard we can mention this one capital law we have here variance because he can apply C equal to PI R but half of 2 pi R because in a semicircular part okay p v r / - Edison to PI capital R / - Edison - time this line segment - time 3.5 no - to cancel to cancel 5 is 20 2 upon 7 simple hobbies 7:30 what is 7 sending in this for the 
,,small circular path 7 centimeter Addison 22 opponent 7 capital R s 10.5 10.5 we can try it my dear student 10.5 house 21 / - why like apply this we can simplify easy 21 / - Addison to multiply three point five years here seven centimeters now cancel by 720 to remain Addison cancel by 7 1 here 3 by 2 1 by 2 xi xi multiplied 3 years the decree that it please sing to meet Addison 7 now 7 3 10 10 to 12 1 left three addition to 5 fine with 1 6 centimeters 62 centimeters now you are learn how to 
,,solving some problem by using our new formula circumference of the circle C equal to Phi R or C equal Phi D and also you know now what is Phi Phi is called and corollaries 22.7 okay my dear student you can now do more exercises for example by using this formula okay I say goodbye all of you how a good future

Circle,p5YDfcSaTx8,welcome back again in a previous video we did five theorems which were based on circles I strongly recommend you to watch the first video if you haven't seen it because I have explained some basic concepts which are required for all the 12 theorems let's have a look at the statement of theorem number 6 equal chords of a circle or of congruent circles are equidistant from the center so I believe that just by looking at the statement you must have recognized that this theorem also we will prove using properties of triangles because usually when you have to prove some angle or some segment congruent try to put them in a triangle and prove that the triangles are congruent so let's consider the circle with centre o and two equal chords a B and C D we have to prove that the distance from the center to the chord is equal let's call the distance as Oh II and Oh f so if we can prove triangle a e O is equal to triangle C F o then we can say that distance Oh II is equal to o F a o is equal to Co because they are the radii of the same circle we know a B is equal to C D because it's given and according to the perpendicular bisector theorem d NF are the midpoint and hence from this we can say that a e is equal to C F angle AE o is equal to angle CF o because both are 90 degrees so from this we can say that both the triangles are now congruent by RHS criteria of congruence so from this we can say that Oh a is equal to o F here we are done within another theorem hope you are understanding everything and trying to be with me I hope you like our video you can also buy our courses in the form of DVDs pen drives and online courses which are available on different platforms all links are given in the description box below press that Bell icon and turn your notifications on and also please do not forget to Like comment share and subscribe

Circle,Y5Z69g7A0eI,let's talk circles all points on this circle are equidistant from this point which is called the center of the circle this session covers just the basics of circles 
,,something many of you would already know the distance from the center to any point in the circle is always constant and is called the radius of the circle no matter 
,,where you draw the line from the center to the boundary the distance will always be the same a line segment like this which passes through the center is called the diameter it passes through the center and its end rest on the boundary of the circle and as it can be seen from the figure its length will be twice the radius of the 
,,circle moving on another concept we need to know is that of chords in circles they are line segments which have the end points lying on the boundary of the circle like this one or this one both are called chords as the end points lie on the boundary of the circle let's go back to the diameter the endpoints of the diameter also lie on the boundary of the circle so is it a chord - yes it is but a special one it's the longest chord of the circle the length of the chord as it keeps coming towards the center increases and is maximum when it passes through the center the next concept is pretty interesting when we draw two radii in a circle what we get is a sector this region in sight is called the sector of this circle look at the sector carefully it is bounded by two radii and this green curve and this green curve also has a name it's called an arc it is simply a part of the boundary of the circle we can call it arc AC B so this sector is bounded by two radii and an arc ACB and the last concept in this session is that of segments no we are not talking about line segments here a cord divides the circle into two segments let's call this cord a 
,,B we mark C on this side and D on the other as this region formed by the cord is smaller it's called the - segment and you would have guessed already that the other 
,,region is called the major segment segment ACB is minor and segment ADB is major and similarly in the previous figure this one is a minor sector and this one a major the green arc ACB is a minor arc and the remaining portion of the boundary is the major arc now that the basic concepts are clear let's try building on it in the next few sessions you

Circle,m9dpeG2rKdY,and finally it's time to close the loop from bubbles bangles donuts feeds us car wheels with giant wheels so many things no wonder circles rule our world and command so much attention so come with me let's get started on these amazing shape a circle yeah so this circle for example it's got parts to it so I can either draw it like this to the freehand or I can do is fix the center and draw a neat circle around it that would definitely be better but I use the help of a compass now once that's done I've got the center right right over here and this length it's called the radius and look if I rotate this radius around the circle the length stays the same no matter where it goes and if I flip this radius over to the other side what I get this length is called the diameter and the diameter happens to run central so now 
,,you may have a doubt what happens if I do this well nothing much the line gets shorter and gets a unique of course very ways and now you're struck with a question define a card well it's really easy you learn let's do it together a chord is nothing but a line that connects two points answer it so an important question this is the diameter right is this also a call to answer that let me ask you another question does this connect two points on a circle of course it does but this is a diameter what's the difference there is a difference along this car that you can draw on a circle it's the diameter so let's prove this okay let's prove this together so take a circle I have a chord over here and what I'm going to do is I'm going to keep pushing it up notice as the length gets bigger bigger and bigger that right over here I have the diameter let's note down the length and move on and look getting smaller smaller smaller which means that the chord over there at the center was longest one the diameter so can I say that a diameter is a type of card but every card is not a diameter great moving on if I have my circle oh here and I have two points 
,,mark polish this region called enough and if you extend two arms like this to the center this region is called the sector not easy to imagine ah much better like this better much much better right now you know how important sectors are it helps you decide how much of a cake you need to give your neighbor come on guys let's get over features and cakes you're gonna follow us anyways over the coming years and all our chapters on circles my promise so my plain-jane circle again and here I have 
,,a chord if you fancy a little bit of color and shade this region here voila I get a segment and finally when I do a lap around circle let's start and go go go go go 
,,go go go yeah and that's one complete round that distance I ran it's called the compass not a word right but it's pretty simple let's revise it once so let's summarize everything so it becomes really the only simple for you if I have a circle over here okay now let's look at the first part this is the center okay this is the radius this length is the diameter this is a chord this region is the segment right this is a sector whatever is outside the circle is the exterior of the circle because it's outside and this is the interior because it's and finally this is the circumference take a look over here all the parts are named pause the frame take your time to digest all the different parts of a circle it's really simple no hard words think about very logically words right and these words are important because you're going to see them again again again so you need to understand how they have come about how did we draw them what is the difference between them very very clearly so then the coming years is absolutely no confusion your crystal clear on the concepts

Circle,O-cawByg2aA&t=11s,"Hi!  Welcome to Math Antics. In our last video, we learned about circles and we learned about a special ratio called Pi. In this video, were going to learn how we can use that ratio to calculate the circumference and the area of any circle. The formulas that we use to calculate circumference and area are so important that you should really memorize them. To help you do that, we're going to look at them side-by-side. That will help you see their similarities and their differences so you don't get them mixed up. The formula for finding the circumference is: Circumference equals Pi times diameter. And just like most formulas, we use abbreviation: 'C' for circumference and 'd' for diameter. That's a pretty simple formula. It tells us that if we know the diameter of a circle,"
,,"all we have to do is multiply that diameter times the number Pi and we'll get the circumference. We'll try that formula out in a few minutes. But first, let's see the formula for area. The formula for finding the area of a circle is: Area equals Pi times radius squared. Again, we can use abbreviations to make it shorter: 'A' for area and 'r' for radius. Now this is a pretty simple formula too. It tells us that if we know the radius, we just have to 'square' it and then multiply that times Pi to get the area. Okay, but what does it mean to 'square' the radius? Well, squaring a number just means multiplying it by itself. For example, 3 squared just means 3 times 3, and 5 squared just means 5 times 5 and r squared just means r times r. So our formula is really just: Area equals Pi times r times r, but we write it in "
,,the
,," 'r squared' form because it's more compact. Oh, and one really important thing to keep in mind is that r squared is NOT the same thing as 2 times r. That's a common mistake that students make when first learning how to find the area of a circle. And if we look carefully at both of our formulas, you'll see why. These two formulas have a lot in common. In each of them, you are multiplying Pi by part of a circle to find either the circumference or the area. In the case of the circumference, you are multiplying Pi times the diameter, and in the case of area, you are multiplying Pi times the radius squared. But do you remember the relationship between the "
,,"radius and the diameter? Diameter is just 2 times the radius. So we could re-write our formula for circumference like this: Circumference = Pi × 2 × r. Ha! Now you see why it's so easy to get confused. To find the circumference, you take the radius and double it. Then you multiply by Pi to get the final answer. But for area, you don't double the radius you square it. That's a very important difference. To help you see that difference in action, let's find both the circumference and the area of this circle using our two formulas. The only thing we know about this circle is that the radius is 8 meters. Luckily, that's all we need to know. First, we use "
,,"our formula for circumference: C = Pi × d. To get the diameter, we take the radius and we double it. that is, we multiply it by 2. 2 × 8 = 16, so the diameter is 16 meters. Then, we multiply that by Pi to get the circumference. Since this is decimal multiplication,"
,,"I'm going to use a calculator. 16 × 3.14 = 50.24 So that means that the circumference of this circle is 50.24 meters. Alright, now let's find the area using our formula:"
,,"A = Pi times r squared. Again, we start with the radius, but instead of doubling it, we 'square' it. That means we multiply it by itself. 8 m × 8 m = 64 meters squared. Then we multiply that by Pi. 64 × 3.14 = 200.96 meters squared. That's the area of this circle. As you can see,"
,,"the result we get when we square the radius is very different from the result we get when we we double it. And one of the most important differences is with the units of our answer. Doubling the radius just gives us the diameter, which is a 1-dimensional quantity. So, the answer we get from our formula for circumference is also "
,,"a 1-dimensional quantity. But, when we square the radius, that gives us 'square units', which are 2-dimensional. That makes sense because"
,,area is always a 2-dimensional quantity. Remembering that will help you avoid getting these two formulas mixed up. The one that has the radius squared is always for 
,,"area. Alright, let's try a couple real-world examples to make sure you've got it. Here's the real world, which as you probably know is a sphere. But, if we take a slice of the world, right at the equator, that slice is a circle. Let's find the circumference of that circle. To do that, we need to know the diameter of the earth. That turns out to be about 12,750 km. Great, then to find the circumference we just need to multiply that diameter times Pi. Now I'm definitely going to use a calculator for this. And, I'm going to use a more accurate version of Pi since this is such a big distance. 12,750 × 3.14159 = 40,055 km (to the nearest kilometer). Wow, that's a pretty big circumference! No wonder it takes so long to go all the way around the earth! On your mark Get set Go! Whooo - Yes!  3.14 seconds quicker than last time.  Yes! Here's another real-world example with a circle. If this pizza has a diameter of 24 inches, what's its total area? Well, using our formula, we start by squaring the radius. But, the problem didnt give us the radius it gave us the diameter, so we have to calculate the radius from the diameter. Fortunately, that's really easy. The radius is just half of the diameter, so we just need to divide the diameter by 2. 24 inches divided by 2 gives us 12 inches for the radius. And now that we know the radius, we need to square it. 12 in × 12 in = 144 inches squared. Next, we just multiply that by Pi. 144 × 3.14 is 452.16. So, the total area of the pizza is 452.16 square inches. Alright, so know you know how to find the circumference and the area of any circle. All you need to do is remember the formulas: Circumference equals Pi times diameter, and Area equals Pi times radius squared. But, it's really important to practice using these formulas for yourself, so be sure to try some of the exercises problems. That's the way to really learn math. Thanks for watching Math Antics"
,,and I'll see ya next time.

Circle,3GjAFCmR4ng,Welcome back again.
,,"In our previous video, we did 5 theorems which were based on circles,"
,,I strongly recommend you to watch the first video if you havent seen it because I have
,,explained some basic concepts which are required for all the 12 theorems.
,,Lets have a look at the statement of theorem number 6.
,,Theorem 6: Equal chords of a circle (or of congruent circles) are equidistant from the
,,"center So, I believe that just by looking at the"
,,statement you must have recognized that this theorem also we will prove using properties
,,"of triangles because, usually when you have to prove some angle or some segment congruent,"
,,try to fit them in a triangle and prove that the triangles are congruent.
,,"Lets consider a circle with center O and two equal chords, AB and CD."
,,We have to prove that the distance from the center to the chord is equal.
,,"Lets call that distance as OE and OF. So, if we can prove ? AEO and ? CFO are congruent,"
,,then we can say that distance OE and OF are equal.
,,AO = CO because they are the radii of the same circle.
,,"AE = CF perpendicular drawn from the center of the circle, bisects the chord. This is"
,,the theorem that we just studied. ? AEO = ? CFO because both are 90o.
,,So both the triangles are now congruent by RHS criteria of congruency.
,,"So, from this we can say that OE = OF. Here we are done with another theorem. Hope"
,,you all are understanding everything and trying to be with me.
,,"Lets have a look at the converse of the same theorem, which states that"
,,Theorem 7: Chords equidistant from the center of a circle are equal in length
,,Now we have to prove that the chords are equal. So if we can prove
,,? AEO and ? CFO are congruent We know that EO and FO are perpendicular bisectors
,,of the chords AB and CD respectively which means AB = AE and CD = CF
,,"So, if we prove that AE = CF, we will be directly able to say that AB = CD."
,,"So, in ? AEO and ? CFO AO = CO radii of same circle"
,,EO = FO given And ? AEO = ? CFO because both are 90o.
,,Here again both the triangles are congruent by RHS criteria of congruency.
,,"So, from this we can say that AE = CF and from this we can say that chord AB = CD."
,,"I believe now, even before I can start the theorems, you must be already having an idea"
,,that how we are going to prove it. Thats just a sign of healthy and a smart brain.
,,Lets have a look at the next theorem. Theorem 8: The angle subtended by an arc at
,,the center is double the angle subtended by it at any point on the remaining part of circle
,,I am going to take this one a little slow and I want you to concentrate a little extra
,,on this one. We have to prove that ? BAC = ? BOC
,,This is little tricky one but its not difficult. Here again we can see two triangles.
,,But in here we are not going to prove them congruent.
,,"Lets have a look at the first triangle, In ? AOB,"
,,We can see that AO = OB because both are radii of the same circle.
,,"Now since two sides of a triangle are equal, we know that there angles will also be equal."
,,"Hence, ? BAO =? ABO Lets consider, ? BAO =? ABO = x"
,,? BOD is nothing bit the exterior angle of ? AOB
,,"And as I said in my introduction, Using the exterior angle theorem or also called"
,,"as remote interior angle theorem, ? BOD = ? BAO +? ABO = x + x = 2 x . (1)"
,,"Similarly, in ? AOC, we can say that, ? CAO =? ACO = y"
,,"Therefore, Here we are going to use remote interior angle"
,,theorem again ? COD = ? CAO +? ACO = y + y = 2 y .. (2)
,,? BAC = x + y (3) ?BOC = ? BOD +?COD
,,= 2x + 2y = 2 (x + y)
,,"So, from equation 3, ?BOC = 2 (? BAC)"
,,"Therefore, ? BAC = ?BOC. Hence proved."
,,"If you found this one little difficult, do not worry, you can pause the video any time"
,,and see it again till you understand and prove it on your own.
,,Lets move to theorem number 9. Theorem 9: Angles in the same segment of a
,,circle are equal. This will be a lot easier because of the previous
,,theorem that we just studied If we take the diagram of the previous theorem
,,"again If we join BC, the BAC is the major arc because"
,,of which BAC is the major segment and BC is the minor arc and minor segment.
,,"We know now that, ? BAC = ?BOC"
,,"Now, if you take point A anywhere else on the arc BAC, you will still find the same"
,,"answer. Suppose we take a point F,"
,,"Again using our previous theorem, We can say that, ? BFC = ?BOC"
,,"So, from this we can say that any numbers of angles which are in the same segment, are"
,,"equal. Theres just one special case in here,"
,,"Suppose that, BC is passing through center of the circle and point D and point O are"
,,"same now. In this case, the segment we have is a semicircle."
,,"We know, ? BAC = ?BOC"
,,"? BAC = 90o. Since ?BOC is nothing but a straight line here and we know, line is of 180o."
,,"So from this we can conclude that, angle subtended in a semicircle is a right angle."
,,Here we are done in total 9 theorems out of 12 including our previous session.
,,In out next session we will complete the next three theorems and summarize all the 12 theorems
,,"in such a way that you will never forget them. Till then if you liked this video , do like"
,,it and if you have any query do comment.and do not forget to subscribe. Till then keep
,,"watching, keep learning."

Circle,cC0fZ_lkFpQ,"Hi! Welcome to Math Antics. We've learned a lot about Geometry so far, but there's one really important geometric shape that we still need to cover, and that shape is a circle. Since the invention of the wheel, circles have been extremely important to all humanity. Grog make wheel. Thanks Grog! In fact, you probably see circles "
,,
,,"almost everywhere you turn But mathematically, what is a circle? Well in Geometry, a circle is defined as: the set of all points that are equidistant (or the same distance) from another single point. And the best way to understand what that means is to see it in action. So here's a single point to start with. Now let's start drawing points"
,,"that are equidistant from it. This point is a foot away to the right. Now let's make another point a foot away but in another direction. Let's say up here. Now let's make another one, also a foot away, but in another direction. Right here. Now let's make another, right here and another, and another, and another, and another... Wheew I'm getting tired! But do you see what's happening? The more equidistant points we add, the more the pattern looks like a circle. That's why a circle is defined as the set of points that are equidistant from a center point. But of course, we usually don't see it as a set of points because there are infinitely many of them, so they form a continuous circle. Okay, now let's learn about the"
,,parts that make up a circle. First of all we have
,,"the original point that we started with. That's called the center, or the origin of the circle. Next, we have the distance that we used to draw all of the equidistant point that form the circle. That distance is called the radius. The radius is important because it's the distance from the center of a circle to ANY other point on the perimeter of that circle. And even though a circle only has one radius dimension, you can draw as many radius lines as you want to. Usually you'll only see one "
,,"radius line drawn since it's the same length no matter where you draw it. Another important circle dimension is called the diameter. The diameter is the distance across a circle. If you start at one point on the circle and then draw a line straight through the center to the other side, that distance is the diameter. As you can see, the diameter is really just the same as two radius lines drawn in exactly opposite directions. So, for any circle, the diameter is always exactly"
,,twice as long as the radius. All of the equidistant points we drew combine to form the perimeter of the circle. Remember that perimeter is just
,,"the distance all the way around a shape. But because a circle is a special shape,"
,,the perimeter of a circle gets a special name. It's called the circumference. The circumference is the distance
,,"all the way around a circle. We're going to learn how to calculate the circumference of any circle in the next video. We'll also learn how to calculate the area of any circle. But before we can learn those things,"
,,"we first need to learn about Pi. Grog make Pie! Sorry Grog, not that kind of pie. In math, the word Pi (which is spelled 'P' 'i')"
,,"refers to a very special number. In fact, it's so special that it gets its own symbol. This greek letter here is the symbol for the number Pi. But..."
,,"if Pi is just a number, why don't we write it like that? Why do we use a special symbol for it? That's a good question. And I'll get to that in just a minute. But first, let's learn what Pi really is by seeing how it relates to a circle. It turns out that Pi is a really a Ratio! Now if you're not sure what a ratio is, you can watch our video about them. But basically, a ratio is just a relationship between two numbers that is written like a fraction. Pi is the ratio of two different distances on a circle. It's the ratio of the distance around a circle to the distance across a circle. And what do we call those two distances? Yep, the circumference and the diameter. So Pi is the relationship of the circumference to the diameter. And as you'll see in a minute, because Pi is a ratio, it's the same number for any circle,"
,,"no matter how big or small. Okay, but what number is it? What's the value of Pi? Well, to figure that out, have a look at these two circles, one big and one small. We're going to imagine that our circles' diameters are flexible, like a piece of string, and that we can wrap them around the outside edges (circumferences) of the circles. So for each circle, if we start at the top and wrap the diameter around the circumference, we see that 1 diameter is not enough to go all the way around. So, "
,,"let's get another diameter and keep going where the first diameter stopped. Hmmm two diameters still isn't enough to go all the way around. It looks like we're going to need to get a third diameter and keep going. Awwww!  So close!! Three diameters is almost enough but it looks like we're going to need just a little bit more to form a full circumference. That little bit more turns out to be about 0.14 diameters. That means that it takes 3.14 diameters to equal one circumference for any circle, big or small. So the value of Pi is always 3.14. Well okay Pi is a little more complicated than that. 3.14 is really just Pi rounded off to two decimal places. And we actually have to round Pi off because it's a type of number that's called 'irrational'. An irrational number has decimal digits"
,,"that never end and never repeat. Grog confused. Yes, 'irrational' numbers are confusing, but seeing some more of Pi's decimal digits"
,,"will help you understand what I mean. To be more precise, Pi is 3.141592653589793238 and the decimal digits keep on going forever"
,,"without repeating!! Pretty amazing, huh? But the good news is that saying Pi is 3.14 is usually close enough for most math problems, so that's all you really need to memorize. And that's why we use a symbol for Pi in equations. We could write Pi with just two decimal places. Or we could write it with 5 decimal places"
,,"to be more accurate. Or, we could write it with hundreds of decimal places"
,,"to be super accurate. Or, we could just use the symbol to represent the true value, which is infinitely accurate. Okay, so in this video, we've learned what a circle is, and we've learned about the important parts of a circle: the center, the radius,"
,,the diameter and the circumference. We've also learned about
,,"a very special number called Pi. Pi is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, and its value is about 3.14"
,,"no matter what size the circle is. In our next video about circles, we're going to learn how we can use the number PI to find"
,,"the circumference and the area of any circle. And even though there is not much math you can actually practice in this section, don't worry there will be lots of practice problems in the next section to make up for it! Thanks for watching Math Antics"

Circle,CTDtiXHorgc,so I have a circle here now if I take two random points on the circle and join it using the line it's a special line because it's inside the circle and then something special give it the name we call it the chord of the circle and the chord can be of so many lengths this is the chord this is a chord this is a chord all of these 
,,are parts now they'll be talking about chord length since this circle is a closed space you agree with me there has to be some limitation to the longest length of the chord possible so let's try to find that longest cord okay so let's start by making this card over here now let me keep pushing this card up and up and out it's getting longer and longer oh my at a point it starts getting shorter shorter shorter so the longest line in a circle is the one that divides it into two equal halves the chords length again begins to reduce as we move towards the outside of the circle now if this was a piece of paper with a circle on it folding the page is one way of finding out the longest cord circle holding it exactly in half that is there is another way to locate this longest cord all you need to do is to draw a radius from the center and extend it to the other side and this line will be your longest cord and the circle and that's really really special being the longest cord in the circle so we give it another name we call it the diameter how about we summarize everything about the diameter so that it becomes crystal clear to you once again so let's start first we draw a circle then you need the diameter how did we make the diameter first we drew the radius then we extended the radius to the other side and 
,,made a diameter so this means that if we had put two radius at 180 degrees we get the diameter and this means that the diameter length is double the radius lens and 
,,it passes through the center this is pretty easy a diameter one is the longest cord a two has double the length of the radius three passes to the center of the circle now that you understood this really well if we were just given this circle how you find the center point let me give you a clue we just learned that the diameter is the only cord that passes through the center can you make use of that yes yes yes so if I drag the cord up and get the longest cord this is my circles diameter then the midpoint of this diameter is the center trilliant now let's do it up a task I want to somehow it break three cords of equal length in this peg at a common point so let's try it out this is a circle of radius 4 centimeters this is one cord say of two centimeters I can make another part of two centimeters and make them intersect at a particular point that's pretty simple now here comes the tricky part let's bring one more two centimeter God but where do I place it maybe like this hmm but I don't get a common point of intersection like this maybe oh maybe like this you want to try out like this maybe like this hey I have a common point of intersection but oh wait that's not even a card yeah you're right if I would like this one of my core just disappears seems like a third core just overlap another one so actually mean that if I have three cords of equal lengths I can never make them intersect at a common point without any overlaps okay wait wait don't jump to conclusions 
,,let's give it one more try so let's try that here's my circle here are three cords now I'm just going to keep moving them and look look they're intersecting what is 
,,this point it's the center of the circle and the line is a diameter yes so this is a very very special feature of the diameter if you want to make three cords of equal length intersect at a common point then the only three which would work are the diameters and you know what the point at which they intersect is the center of the circle so here you have another way to find the center of the circle do you know what it is yes you just have to make two diameters in the set and the point of the 
,,intersection is the center no genius

,,decimal places is pi equals 3.14159265358979 we usually say pi is approximately equal to 3.14 the area of a circle is found to be pi r square where r is the radius of the circle example one a circular flower bed has a radius of nine meter find the perimeter or circumference of the flower bed solution we know that perimeter p is 
,,equal to 2 into pi into r substituting the value we get p is equal to 2 into 3.1416 into 9 which is equal to 56.5487 meter so the perimeter or circumference of the flower bed is equal to 56.5487 meter example 2 find the perimeter and area of the circle if the radius of the circle is 8 centimeter solution we have given the radius which is eight centimeter so by using the formula of the perimeter of the circle we have p is equal to two pi r p equals two into three point one four into a p equals 50.24 centimeter and for the area of the circle a is equal to pi r square a equals 3.14 into 8 square a equals two hundred point nine six centimeters square example three the wheel of a bulla cart has a radius of 60 centimeter if the wheel rotates once how much distance does the cart move solution if the wheel rotates once the cart will move by distance equal to the perimeter of the wheel we know that p is equal to 2 pi r now by substituting the values we get p is equal to 376.8 centimeter thus the bulacart moves 376.8 centimeter in one revolution of the wheel areas of sector of a circle there are two main slices of a circle the pizza slice is called a sector and the slice made by a chord is called a segment we can work out the area of a sector by comparing its angle to the angle of a full circle a circle has an angle of 2 pi and an area of pi r square so a sector with an angle of theta instead of 2 pi must have an area of theta upon 2 pi whole into pi r square which can be simplified to theta upon 2 into r square area of sector is equal to 1 upon 2 into theta into r square when theta is in radians area of sector is equal to 1 upon 2

Circle,C3sr_R6HJmw,you well I'm sure you're all familiar with the circle you can definitely identify a circle if you see one right and in lower classes you have also learned how to draw the circle do you recall it of course the easiest way to do it is by taking a circular ring like a bangle and tracing it on a paper but we can't always get a circle with the desired radius with this method correct so in order to draw a circle of a desired radius we take a compass with a pencil attached to it then we fix a point on the paper which will be the center of the circle now let's say we want to draw a circle with radius as five centimeters so we'll take a ruler and keep one leg of the compass near the zero mark while we extend the other leg till the tip of the pencil touches the five centimeter mark on the ruler while maintaining this distance between the two legs of the compass will keep the pointed end on the fixed point that will be the center of the circle and we rotate the pencil end of the compass around this point and that way the figure we get is what we call a circle and the radius of the circle is five centimeters so we know what the center is and what the radius is but before we move ahead let's revise these stones once if you notice every point on the circle is at a fixed distance from the fixed point where we keep the pointed end of our compass and this observation gives us the definition of the circle that is we define circle as a collection of all the points that are at a fixed distance from a fixed point in the plane this fixed point is called the centre while the fixed distance of every point on the circle from the centre is called the radius so if we mark a as a center here we get the distance a P as the radius also we know that if we have a line passing through the center of the circle such that it meets the circle at two distinct points a and B then a B is called the diameter of the circle and length of the diameter is twice of that of the radius now whenever we draw a circle on a sheet of paper we can say that this sheet of paper is the plane on which the circle exists right and so the circle divides this plane in 
,,three parts the first part is the area inside the circle which is called the interior of the circle the second is the circle itself which consists of all the points 
,,that are on the circle and the third is the region that is outside the circle which is called the exterior of the circle so let's say we have a circle here whose centre is at P and the radius is equal to R then we'll take B as any point on the plane where the circle lies now if the distance PB is less than the length of the radius that is R then B will lie inside the circle that is B will be a point in the interior of the circle next if the distance PB is equal to the radius R then B will be a point on the circle and finally if the distance PB is greater than the radius R then B will lie outside the circle that is in the exterior of the circle so now you know the three positions a point can have with respect to a circle in a plane now let's take any two points a and B on the circle and join a B in a straight line 
,,the line segment a B that we get here is called the chord of the circle basically the line segment we get by joining any two points on the circle is known as a chord do you know any special chord in the circle as in a line segment joining two points on the circle that also passes through the center of the circle that's right it's the diameter which is also the chord of the circle in fact it is the longest cord of the circle and since the circle has infinite points on it it can have infinite chords and infinite diameters as well have you ever seen a broken bangle well it's not a very pleasant sight but well glass bangles break a lot and you really can't help it the point is if you have noticed the broken piece of a bangle it looks like these curved parts of different lengths and if you put these pieces back together you will get back the complete circle did you know that there is an actual term for these pieces in the world of geometry let's look at this closely by considering a circle now we'll take two points on the circle P and Q but we won't join them in a straight line instead we'll just take a part of the circle from the point P to 
,,the point Q and this curved part of the circle is called the arc of the circle chuta mate for more amazing video lectures download the free app on the Apple App Store or Google Play Store

Circle,q-3w7o4zbWQ,how do we define a circle previously we had seen what a center is we are also seen that a circle is made up of points which are all equidistant from the center so let's try to form the definition of a circle the first thing we should notice is that it is a set of all points second how are the points on the circle related to this point in the center yes they are equidistant from that point so we can say that a circle is a set of all points equidistant from a point remember it says all points equidistant from a point let's look at another definition and trust me this one's more interesting to know the other definition we need to understand the term locus this word sounds familiar to the word locust which looks something like this and that's precisely why I never even try to understand what it means until I started teaching anyway the concept is really simple a locust is a word used to represent a set of all points that's it we use the phrase set of all points many times in mathematics and to avoid using this long phrase again and again a single word locust is used but that's not the complete definition of a locust all the points should share some common property so if this is the center of the circle the circle is the locus of points equidistant from the center that's the common property all these points share they are all equidistant from one point if I draw a thousand random points which are not related to each other in any way they cannot be called a locus let's understand another example of a locus did you know that even a line can be defined as a locus of points consider two points a and B we need to mark points which are equidistant from the points a and B and lie on the same plane let this be our first point this point is equidistant from points a and B this is another point like that and we continue to mark all such points and guess what all these points together will form a straight line so how can we define a line it can be defined as a locus of points on a plane equidistant from two points so a locus is the set of all points that share a common property you

Circle,BEL9vg74iw8,hi everyone welcome to smart math online tutor through this video we are going to look into angles in a circle so let's get started the first section we are going to look into is the angle subtended by an arc on the center and on the circle so let's see a circle with center o now here i draw an arc angle on the center as aoc and by the same arc ac i'm going to subtend another angle like this on the circle now you have to clearly understand aoc angle is on the center of the circle whereas abc angle is on the circumference of the circle so what is the theorem relating these two angles so this is the first theorem that is the angle subtended by an arc at 
,,the center of a circle is twice the angle subtended by the same arc on the remaining part of the circle so here ac is the arc considered it is subtending an angle a 
,,let it be a on the circle if so the angle subtended by the same arc ac at the center will be 2a so this is the relationship between angle subtended by an arc on the 
,,center and on the circle let's look into the next section that is the angle subtended by a major arc at the center of a circle will always be a reflex angle let's look at this using a diagram now there is a circle with center o where abc is an angle subtended by the arc ac and here you have to understand this arc ac is a major arc you can understand that because ac arc is a larger part so it becomes the major arc and what is the angle subtended by this arc at the center of the circle i can 
,,mark it like this now you have to remember this angle which is subtended by the major arc will always be a reflex angle and still the theorem is applicable here too 
,,now if this angle is x definitely the angle at the center will be 2x so all what you have to remember here is about the major arc produces or subtends a reflex angle at the center now let's move on to some examples now here we are going to find out the missing angles now 100 degrees is given at the center with the same arc ac angle abc is subtended at the circumference of the circle so then you can write down 2 a is equal to 100 because we know the angle at the center is twice the angle at 
,,the circumference which if they are subtended by the same arc so these two angles are subtended by the same arc ac therefore these two uh can be related like that and therefore a will be 50 degrees now look into this example here 60 is the angle subtended at the circumference of the circle therefore x must be twice 60 that is 120 degrees and look at this example now in this case y is a reflex angle the arc subtending the angles are angles is the major arc ac therefore we can write y is equal to 2 times 120 that is 240 degrees so this is how we apply this theorem in finding angles now let's see a way of proving using this theorem in geometry the points 
,,a b and c lie on a circle of center o show that aoc angle is equal to twice the sum of b a c and b c a so this is the respective diagram now first of all look at the diagram carefully and look into what you have to equate so by looking at these things carefully i take this angle to be 2a so let aoc be 2a then what can i tell the reflex of that aoc reflex angle will be 360 minus 2a i write it because you know the angle around a point is equal to 360. so if one part is 2a the remaining part must be 360 minus 2a now from the previous theorem you learned this reflex angle is twice the angle subtended by the arc ac on the circumference that is this 360 minus 2 a is equal to 2 times this angle abc so if i if i divide 360 degrees minus 2 a by 2 you will get 180 minus a so i can name that angle as 180 minus a if you multiply that by 2 again you will get 360 minus 2a because i have to divide it by 2 i have taken that angle as 2a so that our simplification will be easy otherwise you will get confused when fractions come in the question right now what is our next part now i take let b a c b b and b c a angle b c now i i name these two angles as b and c now i consider the triangle abc that small triangle over here you can see there's a small triangle over here this one right so i consider that triangle and then i can write down 180 minus a that is the abc angle plus b plus c is equal to 180 degrees because this is a triangle and we have already learned some of the interior angles of a triangle is equal to 180 degrees so once when i write this you know i can cancel this 180 with this 180 because on both the sides you have the same number then i get b plus c minus a right i write at the end is equal to 0 so now i can take a to the other side then it becomes b plus c is equal to a i write it in this order a is equal to b plus c now instead of a b and c i substitute the angles uh before that we have to look into that 2 there therefore first of all i had to multiply this side by 2 both the sides by 2 then it becomes 2 like this now i substitute the values of each a b and c now you know 2 a is the angle this here we have taken two way here that is aoc angle then b is this angle that is b a c angle and c is the angle bca so here we have proved what we need to prove so this is the final answer let's move on to the next theorem that is angle subtended by an arc on the same segment of the circle so here now look at this circle with center o and then a b c angle and a b c angle are subtended by the arc ac on the same segment if so these two angles can be considered as equal angle so the second theorem of this section tells us the angle subtended by an arc on the same segment of the circle are equal it is a very simple theorem all what you should remember is if there is an arc subtending angles on the same segment then these angles are equal so if this angle is a the other angle also will be a like this now let's move on to an example here 
,,find the missing angle that missing angle means the angle x if ao is equal to oc is equal to o b so let me mark this details ob is equal to a o and it is also equal 
,,to oc so these three line segments are equal now you can see this x and this angle are subtended by the same arc ac on the same segment therefore i can consider that angle also to be x so i can write down abc angle is equal to x because they are angles in the same segment then if you say carefully the triangle a b o look at the 
,,triangle ob is equal to ao therefore this angle x and this angle will be equal what is the reason they are angles opposite to equal sides so here another exhale is available and then i consider the triangle aoc aoc triangle now in that case again ao is equal to oc then once again this angle will be equal to this angle so i can write it like that because they are also angles opposite to equal sides we can find out these two angles because we know already one angle in the triangle so i can write down c a o angle is equal to oc a angle and that is equal to 180 minus 110 divided by 2 that is 35 each now we know the two angles in the triangle aoc fine now we are going to consider the triangle abc if you consider the triangle abc i can write the sum of interior angles like this x plus x plus 35 degrees plus 35 degrees is equal to 180 and once when you simplify you can very easily find x to be 35 degrees so this is the answer for the missing angle now we are going to move into the next theorem that is angles in the semicircle semicircle is half a circle now look at this circle with center o let me mark the diameter ac like this and if an angle 
,,is subtended from the diameter like this or if an angle is considered in the semicircle of a circle like this it will always be a right angle that is the third theorem so the third theorem tells us an angle in a semicircle is a right angle let's see how to use this in questions psq is a diameter of a larger circle and sq is the 
,,diameter of the smaller circle so everything i have marked in this diagram if r q intersects the smaller circle at x show that p r s angle is equal to rsq angle so we are going to show two angles in this case are equal what should be consider first now if you see carefully they tell us psq is the diameter of the larger circle and sq is the diameter of the smaller circle so here according to the knowledge of angles in the semicircle we can you understand this angle must be 90 degrees because psq is a diameter similarly this angle also will be 90 degrees again sq is the diameter of the smaller circle so i can write down these two details like this now if you say carefully these two angles once when you look it in look into it carefully you can see there is a f shape i hope you can see that f shape over there and therefore i can tell p r is parallel to sq because corresponding angles are equal since corresponding angles are equal these two lines p r and sq sx must be parallel then look at these two angles what are these it is showing us an izzed shape so you know the angles of z shape in parallel lines are also equal the reason is they are 
,,alternate angles so here we have proved prs angle is equal to rsq angle so hope i made myself clear regarding angers in a circle see you with another smart math tip

Circle,j1fTgckgUT0,grade seven math number 9.1 a parts of a circle what is a circle well it's more than just a round thing a circle is a set of points in a plane that are a fixed distance from a point the center of the circle in the plane so it's a set of points that are a fixed distance from the center like this there could be many many points making the circle depending on how big we draw each point and how big we draw the circle I could have used a very fine tipped pencil and I could have put a lot more points in here they used a fat marker so it doesn't look like I had as many and I could have made the circle much bigger that would have made a lot more points but each one of these points is the same distance from the center as the next one so think of a circle as millions of tiny little points that are the same distance from this center point and there's so many millions of points that they're crowded together and they sort of look like they're making a line up that makes the circle but a circle is actually an infinite number of points that are the same distance from the center okay they're exactly the same distance that point is the same distance as that point okay all right so there's four main parts to the circle that we're going to talk about there's the circumference the radius the diameter and the center point you can see that the center points right here in the center that makes sense doesn't it it's the center point all right well the radius this orange guy right here is a line segment right here and it's endpoint is at the center and the other endpoint is on the line it's on the circle and it equals half the diameter see it's length is called the radius of a circle now the diameter this lime green guy is a line segment that passes through the center point and as endpoints on the edges of the circle the circumference see it's twice the length of the radius and it's length is called the diameter of the circle so a radius is half of a diameter see that and a diameter is two radii see the circumference of a circle is the distance around this outside edge that's the circumference if we double the radius the circumference will double if we have a two inch radius and we double it to a four inch one the circumference will just become double its measure it's the same thing as if we double the diameter because the diameter goes all the way across right so if we have a four inch diameter and we double it to an eight inch diameter well that's the same thing as we just did the two inch in the 4 inch radii see same thing the circumference will double but when we start talking about the area the space inside the circle well that's a whole different story if we double the radius or diameter the area is going to quadruple and we'll talk about that in number nine point two so those are the four main parts that we're going to talk about the circumference the radius the diameter and that center point as we get farther into geometry we're going to discover a lot more about circles there's so many parts to a circle the tangent is an outside line that touches it at one point a second is a line that goes through it and touches it at two points a chord is sort of like the diameter except he's on the edge and he doesn't go through the center circle see a central angle has its vertex on the center point and an inscribed angle has its vertex on the edge of the outside and then there's arcs there's a bunch of arcs here see you can have 
,,a major arc in an art so there's so many different parts to a circle you just need to worry about for circumference radius diameter and center point okay I'm gonna talk about this cumference in our next video I'm going to talk about how to find it and how to use it to help us okay I'll see you next video bye

Circle,Avu9KXJeyFA,good morning children today we shall learn more about circle we already know a circle is a two-dimensional shape which can be drawn on a plane surface like paper etc a circle is made up of points on a given plane or surface that are at equal distance from the fixed point and the fixed point is called the center of the circle you know the circle is made of curves let's take few points on the boundary of circle say a b c and another set say d e f look the surface of the circle can be divided 
,,into many curves a curve which is a part of a circle is called an arc an arc is generally represented by three points like ABC is an arc and we represented it by the letters ABC with a small curve or an arc drawn above and here a and c are the endpoints of the arc same way d EF is another arc represented by the letter d EF with 
,,a small arc drawn above now here we have an arc ABC and p is another point on the circle so a pc is also an arc if we observe carefully arc ap C is bigger arc and it is called the major arc and arc ABC is the smaller arc and it is called the minor arc now how to draw an arc while using compass to draw a circle we do not need to 
,,draw a complete circle then it remains an arc this is an arc it is a curve which is a part of a circle here we can see how a curve is drawn using a compass we already know what is a chord a line segment with its end points on the circle is called the chord of the circle so here the line segment MN is a God you know every chord divides the circle into two parts shown here by two different colors one blue colored part and one yellow colored part each of these region is called a segment look the region above cot MN is smaller and it is called the minor segment the region below the god MN is larger and it is called the major segment the diameter is the longest chord of the circle which passes through the center it divides the circle into two equal parts and each part is called a semicircle so there are two semicircles in a circle we can also say when the chord is the diameter both the segments are equal and each segment or the part is called semicircle if you remember the D or the protractor which we use to measure angle is also a semicircle here we have a circle with the center as point O now we name the two endpoints of an arc M n now let 
,,us join the endpoints of the arc with the center of the circle which is point O here the line segment om and o n are the radii of the circle thus and are bounded by 
,,the two radii divides the circle into two parts and each part is called a sector here the blue colored part is a sector and the yellow colored part is another sector so the sector of the circle is bounded by two radii the smaller sector which is the minor sector of the circle is bounded by arc mqn the rest of the circle is also 
,,a sector it is the larger sector of the circle which is called the major sector so to sum up what we learn today what is an arc it is the part of a circle between any two points on this circle what is the segment a court divides the circle into two parts called the segments the smaller segment is called the minor segment and the larger one is called the major segment and what is the sector the region enclosed by two radii and the arc is called the sector the smaller sector is called the minor sector and the larger one is called the major sector what is the semicircle the diameter of a circle divides the circle into two semi circles so that was all about circle bye bye children

Circle,CwtGrC0H_l0,good morning children today we shall learn about circle what is a circle it may be a little difficult to define it exactly but we already know what a circle is the coin or the CD are round or circular in shape so is the ball circular in shape we do represent it as a round or circular in shape when we draw it on a paper but a ball is not circular in shape instead it is a sphere it is a three-dimensional shape and occupies space so a circle is a two-dimensional shape it can be drawn on a plain surface like paper etc let us understand more about circle and then define it precisely what is the difference between the wheel of this bicycle and wheel of this 
,,tricycle yes the release of bicycle are bigger and in this case the wheels of this tractor are bigger than the wheels of the bicycle right children all the wheels are circular in shape if someone asks you what makes the difference between a smaller wheel and a bigger wheel let us understand it as we saw in the story one student 
,,was standing at one place holding one end of the fully stretched rope and the second student was moving around the first student holding the other end of the fully stretched rope this way the distance between the two children remained the same which was the length of the stretched rope and as we saw the second student was moving in a circle and they drew a circle using this rope interesting way to draw a circle isn't it next we saw the other two children using a longer rope and what was the difference it made look the second child is now moving in a bigger circular part picker the rope bigger was the circular path covered or the circle drawn by the second child understood so this is how they got a bigger circle you know the second child was moving around the first child we say the first child was standing at the center of the circle they were making let's call the center of the circle as point O if we take any point say X on the circle the distance from the circle to any point on the circle is always same which is the length of the Rope used for making the circle this distance between this point X on the circle and the center which is the point O is same as the distance between this point Y and the center point O and if we see the distance between point Z and the center point O is also the same this distance is called the radius of the circle we can say any line segment with one endpoint at the center of the circle and the other endpoint on the circle is called the radius of the circle now look at the center of this wheel see all the spokes of the wheel are in it from the center of the wheel and end at the rim of the wheel take any point on the rim of the wheel it's distance from the center is always the same this distance between point A and the center is same as the distance between point B which is also on the rim of the wheel and the center this distance is called the radius of the circular wheel hence the length of all the spokes are same so now you must have understood the radius of tractors wheel is greater than the radius of the bicycle wheel and bigger the radius bigger is the circle we get you know a straight line which connects two points lying on the circle is called the chord look point M and point n are situated on this circle if we connect two point M and end with straight line then it would be a chord its radius a chord no one endpoint of the radius is the center of the circle which is point O and it is not situated on this circle hence the radius not a chord if we extend the radius it will meet at a point on the circle now it is a chord which is God XY in fact it is the longest cord of this circle so the cord which passes through the center of the circle is called the diameter a diameter of the circle is the longest distance across the circle hence it is called the longest cord of the circle here point o is the center and x and y are the two points on the circle as the distance between the point O and X and the distance between point O and Y are same which is equal to the radius of the circle we can say the line segment XY is twice the line segment o X thus the 
,,length of diameter is twice the length of the radius of this circle we can say D equal to 2r where D is the diameter and R is the radius of the circle the boundary or the edge of the circle is called a circumference if you walk around a circle like a circular path you cover a distance which is equal to the length of the boundary of the circle its circumference see in the picture the red dotted line shows the circumference of the circle to sum up what we learned today what is a circle a circle is made up of points on a given plane or surface that are at equal distance from a fixed point and the fixed point is called the center of the circle and what is 
,,radius any line segment with one endpoint at the center of the circle and the other on the circle is called the radius of the circle what is the cord a line segment 
,,with its end points on the circle is called a chord of the circle what is the circumference the length of the curved line forming the boundary of the circle is called the circumference of the circle here it is shown by the red dotted lines and lastly what is the diameter the cord that passes through the center is called the diameter of the circle its length is twice that of the radius so that was all about the circle bye bye children

Circle,eqs0VaBvg3Y,hello friends this video on circles part 1 is brought to you by exam fear calm no more fear from exam what we will study we will study second and tangent before we study let us know why should we study circles if you see all around us we use tabs and most of the structure in the tabs a cell for example this is circular this tab 
,,by a circular everything circular in x also if it is the camera we use the lens are circular most of the buttons you see most of them are circulars not mandatory but most of them you see circular figures nor circular figures you see in a digital camera also if you go to the well generally wells are circular the buckets if you see they are circular this thing which is the pulley which is used to pull the bucket is also circular correct if you see the CD compact disc CD player CD we used to listen to music this is also circular if you see the ball if you see a ball this is also circling the tire using the car is also circular so if you see around us so many things we see the tires of the car the ball we play the CD the camera the tab the well most of the thing you will find circular objects and that is why it is very much necessary for us to understand circle let's try to see how circle behaves with the line so there can be a scenario where the line is outside the circle this case you have one circle you draw one circle you have this line the lines outside the circle you can have a case where the line touches the circle at one point this is the point P where this line touches the circle you can also have the circle which is underlined which touches the circle at two distinct points so we can have only three scenarios one scenario the line is not touching the circle the line touches the circle at one point and the line touches the circle at two different points this scenario where the line touches a circle at a one point is called tangent that is the line there's a first line a B this is the line a B so line a B is called tangent this narrow also let's suppose this is a PQ it that's the circle at two distinct point P and Q so line PQ is called C Ken please note if the line touches a circle at one point it is called tangent and the line is gone tangent if the line touches at dew point the line is called secant correct so there are three possibility in one case the line is non touching the Circle Line is touching second case the line is touching the circle at one point in third gear the line is touching the circle at two distinct points so this case is got tangent we'll learn more about tangent and secant as you have told that will learn about tangent and secant so we'll learn about these two things not charged so tangent is clear tangent is nothing but a line that touches the circle at one point secant is nothing but a line that touches the circle at two distinct example in this case if you draw a line like this this two points also called secant let's abysus C and D so line CD also secant sorry let's do some activity on the tangental circle before we start the activity let me repeat the definition tangent to a circle is nothing but a line that intersects the circle at only one point please please focus on this point one because if a line touches the circle at only one point then it is got tension if it touches a two point it is called seeking free point not possible you can't draw a figure a line that is circle at three point in this activity what we'll do we'll draw a circle and then we'll draw a line I will type rotate the line and you'll see how it touches the sir draw a circle this is a circle and it's drawn line this is my line and I will now try to rotate this line this line I rotate and I see how this line touches this circle let's rotate this line so if you see its line is touching the circle at two points right here it once again if you see this line is touching the circle at two points most of the case I'll show you touching the circle at two distinct points you see all the two points these points we see when they don't read it this this line because something like this attach this circle at two points when this line was further rotated about this point you are something like this this with all the touching this point at two point four the rotation you get this so all these points you see are touching the circle at two points all right let me repeat see all these points are touching the satellite two points one point is here and one point is 
,,there if you see this is the point that it touches everywhere it does that two point only in case of tangent it has one point the move ad rotate this line the more you read this line this point of content will be there anyway this line this line may rotate this side it will touch at various points two points in the amp at this point will - just look point now further it is this point at this point further rotate this at this point further rotate this at this point so everywhere it will do touch here or see if you see this line would touched at this point it also if you see this line will touch at this point if you can see here it was at this point here also to touch at this point only in this case one case it touches the line and one point correct set a given point of time you can have only one tangent it a given 
,,point example this point P you can have only one time chain correct this is only one tangent at a given point so what we have done in this case we have taken this line we have linked in this circle we have rotated this line about this point P and we found that the moment we rotate this line becomes this this line example this also and it touches the circle at two points all the cases this touches the circle right to point with number P it will become P Q - Q Double Dash cutable trash so P Q - P Q Double Dash P Q table - all the points of this line when you rotate thus we have seen that at a given point of time or at a given point P what are possible lies we could have got by rotating this line we saw it only one case where this was tangent it touches exactly in one point at any other point it touches at two points thus we can say that a tangent there is only one tangent for a given point so if I am talking about let's suppose point here let's suppose this point is M at this point you can have only one tangent this is my engine and point M only one tangent is possible at a given point in a circle only one tangent at a given one do some wearing activity here we are doing some activity based on seeking the coil now let's define the tangent in terms of second the tangent to a circle is a special case of secant actually when that two endpoints of its corresponding coordinates I'm trying to say and this is the circle and if you draw a secant like this this is a secant where I'll say a B the seek XY the secant that needs the line in point a V if you see a B X Y and this line also exists by - both are same the only difference is the two endpoints which we have a and B are points heading here both are same a and B are same here you can draw more like this this is also seeking this is also EB point we also once again with a B point correct one more second with a V point to point because we know that C can went to circle at two point this is a one more secant with two points a and B here also one more second now if you make sure that a and B are coinciding a and we are going sending at this point one point both a and B are same then this becomes tangent correct so the new definition says tangent is nothing but a secant where the two end points are saying exactly same where a and B coincides this is nothing but a definition of tangent in terms of secant correct so tangent is nothing but a secant where the two end points coincide so what we have told we have told that any line which is intersecting the circle at only one point is called ancient at two points for secant now also we are saying the tangent is nothing but a secant where both the endpoints are coinciding instead of a and B it is one point okay so these these are all seeking from here to here and the last two is called and yet this is tangent and this is also tangent why because in the last two the points are coinciding endpoints are o in ID correct also they cannot be more than two tangent parallel to a given secant why because if you see they are all parallel lines now we can see it can have only two pendant example we have this line later but this line is PQ right this line is PQ so parallel to this line they can be only two tangents logically also if you see parallel to this line you will have only two points and from these two points you can get only two tangents all right so forgiven if a line is there and we are told to draw parallel tangents we can draw only two parallel line gents now let's look at this time this time is going towards right and now we are told to find the tangent this is the road this is the road Ashlee this is my road the ground the road on this road this tire is going and we are told to find a painting where is the tangent so if you observe carefully this is the time this is the center oh and this is my radius and this is the point P for example this road is the tangent so when it tired when a car is running on 
,,the road so if you find the tangent engine is nothing but the road itself why because at any given point if you see this is the radius and this is a single point of 
,,one time from this single point this becomes a tangent so nothing but what is the tangent they say road is the tangent correct so in our case when a tire is rotating the road itself is the danger why because this is 90 degree this knife is the radius and this is my danger this is a point of contact from this point if we draw a line and that line becomes R or itself so Road is my danger thank you visit exam viacom to watch free education videos try free online tests get the best quality study materials study from the best tutors and mentors and much more thanks and serene

Circle,jyLRpr2P0MQ,The circle is arguably the most
,,"fundamental shape in our universe, whether you look at"
,,"the shapes of orbits of planets, whether you look at"
,,"wheels, whether you look at things on kind of a"
,,molecular level. The circle just keeps
,,showing up over and over and over again. So it's probably worthwhile for
,,us to understand some of the properties of the circle. So the first thing when people
,,"kind of discovered the circle, and you just have a look at the"
,,"moon to see a circle, but the first time they said well, what"
,,are the properties of any circle? So the first one they might
,,"want to say is well, a circle is all of the points that are"
,,equal distant from the center of the circle. All of these points along the
,,edge are equal distant from that center right there. So one of the first things
,,"someone might want to ask is what is that distance, that"
,,equal distance that everything is from the center? Right there. We call that the
,,radius of the circle. It's just the distance from
,,the center out to the edge. If that radius is 3
,,"centimeters, then this radius is going to be 3 centimeters. And this radius is going"
,,"to be 3 centimeters. It's never going to change. By definition, a circle is all"
,,of the points that are equal distant from the center point. And that distance
,,is the radius. Now the next most interesting
,,"thing about that, people might say well, how fat"
,,is the circle? How wide is it along
,,its widest point? Or if you just want to cut it
,,"along its widest point, what is that distance right there? And it doesn't have to be just"
,,"right there, I could have just as easily cut it along its"
,,widest point right there. I just wouldn't be cutting it
,,like some place like that because that wouldn't be
,,along its widest point. There's multiple places
,,"where I could cut it along its widest point. Well, we just saw the radius"
,,and we see that widest point goes through the center
,,and just keeps going. So it's essentially two radii. You got one radius there
,,and then you have another radius over there. We call this distance along
,,"the widest point of the circle, the diameter. So that is the diameter"
,,of the circle. It has a very easy
,,relationship with the radius. The diameter is equal to
,,"two times the radius. Now, the next most interesting"
,,thing that you might be wondering about a circle is how
,,far is it around the circle? So if you were to get your tape
,,measure out and you were to measure around the circle like
,,"that, what's that distance? We call that word the"
,,"circumference of the circle. Now, we know how the diameter"
,,"and the radius relates, but how does the circumference relate"
,,"to, say, the diameter. And if you're not really used"
,,"to the diameter, it's very easy to figure out how it"
,,"relates to the radius. Well, many thousands of years"
,,"ago, people took their tape measures out and they keep"
,,measuring circumferences and radiuses. And let's say when their tape
,,"measures weren't so good, let's say they measured the"
,,"circumference of the circle and they would get well, it"
,,looks like it's about 3. And then they measure the
,,"radius of the circle right here or the diameter of that circle,"
,,"and they'd say oh, the diameter looks like it's about 1. So they would say -- let"
,,me write this down. So we're worried about
,,the ratio -- let me write it like this. The ratio of the circumference
,,to the diameter. So let's say that somebody had
,,"some circle over here -- let's say they had this circle, and"
,,"the first time with not that good of a tape measure, they"
,,"measured around the circle and they said hey, it's"
,,roughly equal to 3 meters when I go around it. And when I measure the
,,"diameter of the circle, it's roughly equal to 1. OK, that's interesting. Maybe the ratio of"
,,the circumference of the diameter's 3. So maybe the circumference
,,is always three times the diameter. Well that was just for this
,,"circle, but let's say they measured some other"
,,circle here. It's like this -- I
,,drew it smaller. Let's say that on this circle
,,they measured around it and they found out that the
,,"circumference is 6 centimeters, roughly -- we have a bad"
,,tape measure right then. Then they find out
,,"that the diameter is roughly 2 centimeters. And once again, the ratio of"
,,"the circumference of the diameter was roughly 3. OK, this is a neat"
,,property of circles. Maybe the ratio of the
,,circumference to the diameters always fixed for any circle. So they said let me
,,study this further. So they got better
,,tape measures. When they got better tape
,,"measures, they measured hey, my diameter's definitely 1. They say my diameter's"
,,"definitely 1, but when I measure my circumference"
,,"a little bit, I realize it's closer to 3.1. And the same thing"
,,with this over here. They notice that this
,,ratio is closer to 3.1. Then they kept measuring it
,,"better and better and better, and then they realized that"
,,"they were getting this number, they just kept measuring it"
,,better and better and they were getting this number 3.14159. And they just kept adding
,,digits and it would never repeat. It was a strange fascinating
,,metaphysical number that kept showing up. So since this number was so
,,"fundamental to our universe, because the circle is so"
,,"fundamental to our universe, and it just showed up"
,,for every circle. The ratio of the circumference
,,"of the diameter was this kind of magical number,"
,,"they gave it a name. They called it pi, or you could"
,,just give it the Latin or the Greek letter pi --
,,just like that. That represents this number
,,which is arguably the most fascinating number
,,in our universe. It first shows up as the ratio
,,"of the circumference to the diameter, but you're going to"
,,"learn as you go through your mathematical journey, that"
,,it shows up everywhere. It's one of these fundamental
,,things about the universe that just makes you think that
,,"there's some order to it. But anyway, how can we"
,,"use this in I guess our basic mathematics? So we know, or I'm telling you,"
,,that the ratio of the circumference to the diameter
,,"-- when I say the ratio, literally I'm just saying if"
,,"you divide the circumference by the diameter, you're"
,,going to get pi. Pi is just this number. I could write 3.14159 and just
,,"keep going on and on and on, but that would be a waste of"
,,"space and it would just be hard to deal with, so people just"
,,"write this Greek letter pi there. So, how can we relate this? We can multiply both sides of"
,,this by the diameter and we could say that the
,,circumference is equal to pi times the diameter. Or since the diameter is equal
,,"to 2 times the radius, we could say that the circumference is"
,,equal to pi times 2 times the radius. Or the form that you're
,,"most likely to see it, it's equal to 2 pi r. So let's see if we can apply"
,,that to some problems. So let's say I have a circle
,,"just like that, and I were to tell you it has a radius --"
,,"it's radius right there is 3. So, 3 -- let me write this down"
,,-- so the radius is equal to 3. Maybe it's 3 meters --
,,put some units in there. What is the circumference
,,of the circle? The circumference is equal to
,,2 times 5 times the radius. So it's going to be equal to 2
,,"times pi times the radius, times 3 meters, which is"
,,equal to 6 meters times pi or 6 pi meters. 6 pi meters. Now I could multiply this out. Remember pi is just a number. Pi is 3.14159 going
,,"on and on and on. So if I multiply 6 times that,"
,,maybe I'll get 18 point something something something. If you have your calculator you
,,"might want to do it, but for simplicity people just tend to"
,,leave our numbers in terms of pi. Now I don't know what this is
,,"if you multiply 6 times 3.14159, I don't know if you"
,,"get something close to 19 or 18, maybe it's approximately"
,,18 point something something something. I don't have my calculator
,,in front of me. But instead of writing
,,"that number, you just write 6 pi there. Actually, I think it"
,,"wouldn't quite cross the threshold to 19 yet. Now, let's ask"
,,another question. What is the diameter
,,"of the circle? Well if this radius is 3, the"
,,diameter is just twice that. So it's just going to be 3
,,"times 2 or 3 plus 3, which is equal to 6 meters. So the circumference is 6 pi"
,,"meters, the diameter is 6 meters, the radius is 3 meters. Now let's go the other way. Let's say I have"
,,another circle. Let's say I have
,,another circle here. And I were to tell you that
,,its circumference is equal to 10 meters -- that's the
,,circumference of the circle. If you were to put a tape
,,measure to go around it and someone were to ask you what is
,,"the diameter of the circle? Well, we know that the diameter"
,,"times pi, we know that pi times the diameter is equal to"
,,the circumference; is equal to 10 meters. So to solve for this we would
,,just divide both sides of this equation by pi. The diameter would equal
,,"10 meters over pi or 10 over pi meters. And that is just a number. If you have your calculator,"
,,"you could actually divide 10 divided by 3.14159, you're"
,,going to get 3 point something something something meters. I can't do it in my head. But this is just a number. But for simplicity we often
,,"just leave it that way. Now what is the radius? Well, the radius is equal"
,,to 1/2 the diameter. So this whole distance right
,,"here is 10 over pi meters. If we just 1/2 of that, if"
,,"we just want the radius, we just multiply it times 1/2. So you have 1/2 times 10 over"
,,"pi, which is equal to 1/2 times 10, or you just divide the"
,,"numerator and the denominator by 2. You get 5 there, so"
,,you get 5 over pi. So the radius over
,,here is 5 over pi. Nothing super fancy about this. I think the thing that confuses
,,people the most is to just realize that pi is a number. Pi is just 3.14159 and it just
,,keeps going on and on and on. There's actually thousands of
,,"books written about pi, so it's not like -- I don't know"
,,"if there's thousands, I'm exaggerating, but you could"
,,"write books about this number. But it's just a number. It's a very special number, and"
,,if you wanted to write it in a way that you're used to writing
,,"numbers, you could literally just multiply this out. But most the time people just"
,,"realize they like leaving things in terms of pi. Anyway, I'll leave you there. In the next video we'll figure"
,,out the area of a circle.

Circle,u-mLjN7g4lw,hello and welcome guys to a reception today we begin with these up there circles now the complete chapter of circles will be divided into four or five videos over those videos we are going to discuss the theorems and understand them and we will also solve a lot of sums on circles so watch all these videos and I hope you understand the chapter easily this video is the first part and over here we are going to discuss three theorems based on the angle properties of circles was this video to the end and if you liked it do it thumbs up button share this video with your friends and subscribe to our deception if you haven't also press the bell icon to get notified of all our videos without further ado let's begin circles before beginning with the theorems let's brush up on a few basic things about circles we all know that this is a circle and this point over here is the centre of the circle we call it Oh then comes radius what is the radius the length from the center of the circle to the circumference is called the radius the radius of a circle is fixed and constant okay then comes quad what is a cord a straight line joining any two points on a circle is called a cord say we have the point a and the point be a straight line joining a B is called a cord say we have a point X over here and the point Y over here the straight line joining point X Y is also a cord okay now a cord which passes through the center of the circle is the diameter say we have a cord which passes 
,,through the center of a circle say P Q so B Q is the diameter so remember this a call which passes through the center of a circle is the diameter I write it down PQ 
,,is the diameter and we all know that diameter is twice the radius okay so keep it in mind then comes arc what is an arc the length from A to B on the circumference is called an arc so basically this length from A to B is called an arc okay now you can also take the length like this so basically the smaller one becomes the minor 
,,arc and the longer one becomes the major arc and an arc is represented like this so arc a be okay then come segment what is segment the region enclosed by a cord and an arc is a segment so basically this region enclosed by the cord and the arc is a segment okay now that we are done with all this we will move on to the theorems let's begin with the first theorem the angle subtended by an arc of a circle at center is double the angle subtended by it at any point on the remaining part of the circle what does this mean say we have a circle over here and an arc a B now the arc a B subtends an angle at the center Pole and the arc a B subtends an angle on the circumference at C this theorem says that the angle subtended at the center will be double the angle subtended at the circumference that basically means that angle 
,,a or b will be twice angle a C B and this point C can be anywhere in the circle except this arc a B say it can be here also so for this also angle a be the angle subtended at the center will be equal to price the angle subtended at the circumference which is angle a D be okay now that means if this is X degree and this is y degree then X degree will be twice Y degree let me give you an example now say this angle over here is 30 degree then the angle subtended on the Center will be twice of 
,,30 which is 60 degree okay easy to understand now we want to direct theorem moving on to the second theorem angles in the same segment of a circle are equal what does this mean say we have a circle and an arc a B now this arc a be subtend some angle on the circumference at C over here and add D over here this theorem says that angle a C B will be equal to angle a D B let me write it down so angle a C B will be equal to angle a D B let me clarify it a bit more we have the arc a B let me join it with a chord so we get D chord now we get two segments of the circle a smaller one and a bigger one the smaller one is called the minor segment and the one is called the major segment we can see that angle a C B and angle a D B are in the same segment and the theorem says the angles in the same segment of a circle are equal 
,,that means angle T CB will be equal to angle a D B okay now as a matter of fact if you take any angle in this segment that will be equal to angle ACB and angle ADB say I take this angle and I take this angle we call it m and I will call it m so both these angles will be equal to angle a M B and angle a and B okay easy to understand now we want to the next theorem moving on to the next theorem angle in a semicircle is right angle it is very simple we have a circle over here and a B is the diameter of the circle that this a B divides the circle into two semicircles one here and one here and any angle in a semicircle is 90 degree that means over here angle a C B will be 90 degree as simple as that so angle a CB is equal to 90 degree now in a semicircle if we take any angle the angle will be 90 degree say if we take an angle like this this will be 90 degree even if we take an angle like this this will also be 90 degree okay so remember this angle in a semicircle is right angle okay now that we have covered all the three theorems based on the angle properties of circles we'll move on to the sons before beginning with the sounds let me tell you a couple of things firstly whenever you face a question on circles look at the figure properly and try to determine all the theorems that you can apply on the figure if you determine these theorems properly and apply them properly you will definitely get your answer secondly whenever you use a theorem right the theorem there if you miss to write the theorem you will definitely lose marks so keep this thing in mind now we have the first question let's solve it question number one in the adjoining figure o is the center of the circle and angle PBA is equal to 45 degree you have to calculate the value of angle p QB this is the given figure o is the center of the circle angle P B is given 45 degree we have to calculate angle P Q B okay now as a B is passing through the center of the circle a B is the diameter that means it divides the circle into two semicircles this one and this one and the third theorem that we studied today was angles in a semicircle our light angle that means we have an angle over here in a semicircle which is angle a P B so angle a P P will be 90 degree 90 degree let me write it down that angle a PB is equal to 90 degree and decided I will write the theorem that I have used that is angle in a semicircle is right angle okay now in the triangle a B P we know two angles 90 degree and 45 so we can easily calculate the third angle as we know that the sum of three angles of a triangle is 180 degree so we can easily calculate angle P a/b let's do that so in triangle a B P angle P a B plus angle a P B plus angle P B a is equal to 180 degree and decided I will write that sum of angles of a triangle is 180 degree okay so therefore angle P a B plus 90 degree plus 45 degree is equal to 180 degree therefore angle P a B is equal to 180 degree minus 90 degree minus 45 degree therefore angle P a B is equal to 45 degree so we calculated angle PA B as 45 degree so P a B is equal to 45 degree now we have to ultimately calculate angle P Q B we can see that PB is an arc of the circle and PB subtends two angles on the circumference one at a and one at Q so we have angle P a B and angle P Q B the second theorem that we studied today was angles in the same segment are equal so we have the same segment over here so angles in the same segment will be equal so P a B will be equal to angle P Q B so we get the answer let me write it down that angle P Q B is equal to angle P a B therefore angle P Q B is equal to 45 degree we get the answer and beside it I will write the theorem that I have used which is angles in the same segment of a circle are equal so done so basically when you face a question of circle try to determine the theorems and apply them properly you will definitely get the answer okay now we will move on to the next some moving on to some number two in the adjoining figure a B is the diameter of the circle with centre o if angle B or C is equal to 120 degree we have to find the measure of angle a DC this is the given figure a B is the diameter and angle B C is given 120 degree we have to find angle a D C so let's begin we can see that a B is the diameter of the circle that means it is a straight line and the angles on a straight line add up to be 180 degree so this angle over here that means angle B or C Plus this angle over here that means angle a OC will be 180 degree let me write it down so angle a OC plus angle B for C will be 180 degree like the reason that a B is a straight line okay therefore angle a or C plus 120 degree is equal to 180 degree therefore angle a over C is equal to 180 degree minus 120 degree therefore angle a over C is equal to 60 degree so we get angle AOC is equal to 60 degree so this over here is 60 degree now we can see that AC is an art it subtends an angle on the center pole and it subtends an angle on the circumference at D the first theorem that we studied today was the angle subtended by an arc at the center is double the angle subtended by it on the circumference that means this angle over here will be double the angle subtended on the circumference so basically angle a over C will be double the angle a D see let's write it down angle a OC will be double angle a D see we have to find angle ADC we already know angle AOC so we can calculate it so therefore angle a DC it will be half of angle a or C therefore angle a DC is equal to half into 60 degree so angle ADC will be 30 degree the answer so angle ADC is equal to 30 degree and beside this I will have to write the theorem that I apply that the angle subtended by an arc at the center will be double the angle subtended by it on the circumference okay now we will move on to the next some moving on to some number three in the adjoining figure a D is the diameter of a circle with center PO if ad is parallel to BC and angle CBD is equal to 32 degree you have to find number one angle OPD number two angle AOB and number three angle B II D this is the given figure a D is the diameter of the circle and ad is parallel to B see angle C is given which is 32 degree so let's begin first of all we have to calculate angle obd we know that BC is parallel to ad and angle CBD is 32 degree we know the alternate angle of a line joining two parallel lines are equal so we can see over here that we have two parallel lines ad and BC and a straight line joining them so the alternate angle will be equal so if this is 32 degree this will also be 32 degree so we get angle a DB is equal 
,,to angle CB d is equal to 32 degree and I will write over here that the Polytechnic angles of a straight line joining two parallel lines are equal now that we get that angle a B B is 32 degree we can see that OB is the radius of the circle and OD is also the radius of the circle so triangle B or D is an isosceles triangle and for an isosceles triangle the angle of the same side will be equal so if this is 32 degree this angle will also be 32 degree so we get angle BD is equal to angle o DB 
,,is equal to 32 degree and for this I'll write the angle on the same side of an isosceles triangle are equal so I get the first answer that angle o BD is equal to 32 
,,degree the second one we have to calculate angle AOB let's check it out angle a o B is this angle so we can see that a B is an art and a B subtends an angle at the centre toe and a B subtends an angle at the circumference at D the first theorem that we showed it to the angle subtended by an arc at the center is double the angle 
,,subtended right on the circumference so angle a o B will be double angle a D B let's do that so angle a or b is double angle a B be there for angle a or b is equal to 2 into 32 degree so angle a or b is equal to 64 degree so we get our second answer in the third one we have to calculate angle b e d let's check it out the b e b now a B is the diameter of the circle that means it is dividing the circle into two semicircles and we studied that angle in a semicircle is right angle we can see that angle a B D is an angle in the semicircle so it will be 90 degree so angle abd is equal to 90 degree let me write it down angle a B D is equal to 90 degree and beside it I will write that the angle in a semicircle is right angle okay now that we have got angle a B D and we know angle a D B we can calculate angle D a B because in the triangle a B D the sum of all three angles is equal to 180 degree so in triangle ADB angle D a B plus angle a B b-plus angle a DB is equal to 180 degree beside it I'll write the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degree so I get angle D the plus angle abd abd that's 90 degree plus angle a DB that's 32 degree is equal to 
,,180 degree so I get angle D a B plus 90 plus 32 that's 122 degree is equal to 180 degree so angle B a B is equal to 180 degree minus 122 degree and this will come out to be 58 degree so I get angle D ay B is 58 degrees that is B a B is equal to 58 degree now BD is an art and BD subtext to angle on the circumference one itay and 
,,1 at T now the second theorem that we studied was the angle in the same segment are equal so angle B a B will be equal to angle B e B so if this is 58 degree this will also be 58 degree so I'll write and the b e d is equal to angle b a b is equal to 58 degree and beside it i will right angle in the same segment are equal so we got our third answer also that angle b UD is equal to 58 degree so this sum at last comes to an end now after ending this sum I will end this video over here in the next video we will begin with these cyclic properties of circles so do watch that video until then this is Rishi on behalf of Deception signing off

Circle,nQn0xIF7GPI,hello in this video i'm going to talk about the circle and how to know what is the relative position between two circles first let us refresh our memories what do we know about the circles so of course a circle has a center and a radius and it's not notation is c or what does that mean it means c is the name of the circle circle its name is c the first one to write here it is the center so this circle is of center or and the second one to write its r the radius or we can write the measure of the radius if we have it so we can write co3 means the circle c of center o and reduces three centimeter so the second one represents the radius so we know that the circle measures 360 degree and the diameter of a circle is two times its radius so circles what are the relative positions here are all the possible cases of how can we draw two circles they are five cases one two three four and five so we have five different relative positions of two circles we will study each one alone but first let us see in this in these figures uh and how many points do these circles intersect so the first one these two circles intersect in two points and this figure and this figure they intersect in one point and in the last two figures they as you can see they do not intersect at all so they have no common points the first relative position i want to study it is the externally disjoint circles where there is no common points between the two circles the rule says o p is greater than a plus b where o p is the distance between the two centers and a is the radius of the first circle and b is the radius of the second circle so whenever op is greater than 
,,a plus b whenever this is true then the two circles are externally disjoint let us see in this example so a plus b is two plus three which is five and op is seven so can we notice that of b is greater than a plus b yes seven is greater than five then op is greater than a plus b so that two circles are externally disjoint this is a stimulation representing the disjoint external circles where we can see that the distance between the two centers is always greater than the sum of the radii so how no matter how i move the circle and they are still externally circles disjoint external circles this distance is greater than 5. the second case we want to study 
,,about is the internally disjoint circles where the rule says if op is less than a minus b then they are internally disjoint circles so op is the distance between the two centers a is the radius of the first circle and b is the radius of the second circle let's study uh this case here so if we want to know the relative position of the circles we write a minus b and calculate it and we know that of b it's given that it's a three centimeter we check is of p less than a minus b 3 is less than 4 then o p is less than a minus b then the two circles are internally disjoint circles it is a stimulation about the internally disjoint circles you can see the distance between the two centers is uh here in this case is o a and the difference between the two the two radii in this case is one so wherever i move the circle and it 
,,is still internal disjoint circles this distance as you can see it's less than one which is the difference between the two radii next tangent circles external tangent circles they have one point in common the rule says if op which is the distance between the two centers of the circle is equal to the sum of the two ray joy then these two circles are tangent externally okay so i want to say an important note it's not always that o p and a and b they are these uh names are according to the figures so maybe the distance between the two the two centers is o prime or s r i don't know it refers to how do it how do we name them on the figure so let's study this case if op is eight a is five and b is a three then if we if we added them and the distance between the two centers is a they are equal then if they are equal we can conclude that these two sun circles are externally tangent circles next the internal tangent circles if this is true then they are internally tangent circles if the distance between the two centers is equals to a minus b let's see this case here so we try a minus b it's a three and op is 3 then they are equal then we say that the two circles are internally tangent circles the last case or the intersecting circles the rule says that if the distance between the two centers or p is between 
,,these two values a minus b and a plus b then the two circles are intersecting circles so if we apply on this example here a plus b it's seven and a minus b it's one 
,,and o p is five you can notice that five this distance between the two centers is between these two values one and seven then this rule applies and then these two circles are intersecting circles this circles are intersecting circles and we know that the distance between the centers is between the difference of the two radii and the sum of the two ray joy so this value here is always between one and five in this case so you can notice that no matter how we move the circle this value here is always between 1 and 5. as a summary uh these are all relative positions of two circles there are five cases a tangent internally and externally disjoint internally and externally and intersecting circles now how do i memorize them i will give you an easy way so whenever we have equal the equal signs tells me that these two circles are tangent and whenever we have a less than sign or a greater than sign then we are talking about disjoint circles now how do we know if they are internally or externally the negative sign you can notice that internally so we have equal and negative tangent internally less than and negative this joint internally so whenever we have minus it's internally and whenever we have the positive sign the plus tangent externals or equal and the plus tangent externally and greater than and plus 
,,disjoint externally the final one it's not a belief it's easy so op the distance between the two radii is between a minus b and a plus b the final one is the avs it's between a minus b and a plus b so in this example we will learn how to determine the relative position of two circles knowing the radii and the distance between their centers given these two circles circle c center o and radius s circle c prime center e and radius r so are given the measure of the radius of the first circle and the second radius and the distance between the two centers in order to determine the relative position i should add the r and s and i should subtract and then compare it with o e and see what happens so r plus s is eight and r minus s is two and the distance between the centers is eleven so we notice that 8 11 is greater than 
,,8. so oe is greater than or s therefore s and s prime are externally disjoint so one case will be true only one case from the five cases of the relative positions in this case it's oe greater than rs then they are externally disjoint our final example so we are given r and s and the distance between the centers so we should to do two steps add r plus s and subtract and then compare it with o e so we notice that uh r plus s is 10 and r minus s minus r is 2 and o is 8. so 8 is between 2 and 10 thus this is a true for what relative position of circles if they are intersecting then we conclude that s and c and t prime are intersecting so as i have said before only one case will be true and that will be the relative position of c and c prime

Circle,HE12r4vCwII,in this session we'll discuss about circles and areas related to circles so let's start this in an interesting way now what is the area of a circle all of you know it's it's PI R square but have you ever wondered why it's Phi R square let me help you visualize this in a very colorful way so for that let's take a circle keep on filling the circle with concentric circles like this one inside the other so now it's completely filled up now let's consider the other extreme if I take a single circle here and if I cut the circle if I straighten this out I will get a straight line so what is the line line can be taken as a circle with infinite radius if I use 
,,the same method here this the set of concentric circles you can see the colorful circles if I just cut here and if I just open it up if I keep it here what's going to happen the outermost circle here will become the bottom line as you can see and all the other inner circles will come whenever they're as lines here with decreasing lengths the outermost circle perimeter if it is 2 pi are the bottom line length will be 2 PI R and the height here will be nothing but the radius of the outermost 
,,circle so area of the circle this is very easy for all of you to understand is nothing but area of this particular triangle so I am going to show you or I am helping you visualize area of a circle using area of a triangle and an interesting connect right what is the area of the triangle here length here the base here is 2 pyar hai phir is R so we can directly write down half into 2 pi R into R which is nothing but PI R square very easy and interesting right so this way we can visualize area of a circle using a triangle and I'm sure you have not seen now area of a circle explain this way before now one more thing which we can do is area of a circle can 
,,be visualized in a rectangle also like some of you must have seen in some of the books so how we can do that just to recap you take a circle cut the circle into multiple law sectors using diameters let's take 16 sectors like this and if I number them as 1 2 3 4 up to 16 now take each sector one by one like take the first sector 
,,keep it upright upright take the second sector and make it upside down and keep it next to each other third one keep it upright fourth one keep it upside down and if you bring all of them one by one like this and keep it here what we will get here is nothing but a rectangle where you can see on top you can see numbers 1 3 5 7 up to 15 which is basically half of the sector's whatever so we'll see 1/2 which is 2 4 up to 16 so what you can easily understand this this complete which is length of this is nothing but the perimeter which is 2 PI R here one side will be half of it because only half of the sectors are coming on top so length here will become half of 2 pi R breadth of this rectangle as you can easily visualize is nothing but R so area of this rectangle will be product of length and breadth which is half of 
,,2 pi R into R so we will get PI R square so what we did here is nothing but area of a circle visualized using a rectangle if you liked this video and if you want to

Circle,jyLRpr2P0MQ&t=3s,The circle is arguably the most
,,"fundamental shape in our universe, whether you look at"
,,"the shapes of orbits of planets, whether you look at"
,,"wheels, whether you look at things on kind of a"
,,molecular level. The circle just keeps
,,showing up over and over and over again. So it's probably worthwhile for
,,us to understand some of the properties of the circle. So the first thing when people
,,"kind of discovered the circle, and you just have a look at the"
,,"moon to see a circle, but the first time they said well, what"
,,are the properties of any circle? So the first one they might
,,"want to say is well, a circle is all of the points that are"
,,equal distant from the center of the circle. All of these points along the
,,edge are equal distant from that center right there. So one of the first things
,,"someone might want to ask is what is that distance, that"
,,equal distance that everything is from the center? Right there. We call that the
,,radius of the circle. It's just the distance from
,,the center out to the edge. If that radius is 3
,,"centimeters, then this radius is going to be 3 centimeters. And this radius is going"
,,"to be 3 centimeters. It's never going to change. By definition, a circle is all"
,,of the points that are equal distant from the center point. And that distance
,,is the radius. Now the next most interesting
,,"thing about that, people might say well, how fat"
,,is the circle? How wide is it along
,,its widest point? Or if you just want to cut it
,,"along its widest point, what is that distance right there? And it doesn't have to be just"
,,"right there, I could have just as easily cut it along its"
,,widest point right there. I just wouldn't be cutting it
,,like some place like that because that wouldn't be
,,along its widest point. There's multiple places
,,"where I could cut it along its widest point. Well, we just saw the radius"
,,and we see that widest point goes through the center
,,and just keeps going. So it's essentially two radii. You got one radius there
,,and then you have another radius over there. We call this distance along
,,"the widest point of the circle, the diameter. So that is the diameter"
,,of the circle. It has a very easy
,,relationship with the radius. The diameter is equal to
,,"two times the radius. Now, the next most interesting"
,,thing that you might be wondering about a circle is how
,,far is it around the circle? So if you were to get your tape
,,measure out and you were to measure around the circle like
,,"that, what's that distance? We call that word the"
,,"circumference of the circle. Now, we know how the diameter"
,,"and the radius relates, but how does the circumference relate"
,,"to, say, the diameter. And if you're not really used"
,,"to the diameter, it's very easy to figure out how it"
,,"relates to the radius. Well, many thousands of years"
,,"ago, people took their tape measures out and they keep"
,,measuring circumferences and radiuses. And let's say when their tape
,,"measures weren't so good, let's say they measured the"
,,"circumference of the circle and they would get well, it"
,,looks like it's about 3. And then they measure the
,,"radius of the circle right here or the diameter of that circle,"
,,"and they'd say oh, the diameter looks like it's about 1. So they would say -- let"
,,me write this down. So we're worried about
,,the ratio -- let me write it like this. The ratio of the circumference
,,to the diameter. So let's say that somebody had
,,"some circle over here -- let's say they had this circle, and"
,,"the first time with not that good of a tape measure, they"
,,"measured around the circle and they said hey, it's"
,,roughly equal to 3 meters when I go around it. And when I measure the
,,"diameter of the circle, it's roughly equal to 1. OK, that's interesting. Maybe the ratio of"
,,the circumference of the diameter's 3. So maybe the circumference
,,is always three times the diameter. Well that was just for this
,,"circle, but let's say they measured some other"
,,circle here. It's like this -- I
,,drew it smaller. Let's say that on this circle
,,they measured around it and they found out that the
,,"circumference is 6 centimeters, roughly -- we have a bad"
,,tape measure right then. Then they find out
,,"that the diameter is roughly 2 centimeters. And once again, the ratio of"
,,"the circumference of the diameter was roughly 3. OK, this is a neat"
,,property of circles. Maybe the ratio of the
,,circumference to the diameters always fixed for any circle. So they said let me
,,study this further. So they got better
,,tape measures. When they got better tape
,,"measures, they measured hey, my diameter's definitely 1. They say my diameter's"
,,"definitely 1, but when I measure my circumference"
,,"a little bit, I realize it's closer to 3.1. And the same thing"
,,with this over here. They notice that this
,,ratio is closer to 3.1. Then they kept measuring it
,,"better and better and better, and then they realized that"
,,"they were getting this number, they just kept measuring it"
,,better and better and they were getting this number 3.14159. And they just kept adding
,,digits and it would never repeat. It was a strange fascinating
,,metaphysical number that kept showing up. So since this number was so
,,"fundamental to our universe, because the circle is so"
,,"fundamental to our universe, and it just showed up"
,,for every circle. The ratio of the circumference
,,"of the diameter was this kind of magical number,"
,,"they gave it a name. They called it pi, or you could"
,,just give it the Latin or the Greek letter pi --
,,just like that. That represents this number
,,which is arguably the most fascinating number
,,in our universe. It first shows up as the ratio
,,"of the circumference to the diameter, but you're going to"
,,"learn as you go through your mathematical journey, that"
,,it shows up everywhere. It's one of these fundamental
,,things about the universe that just makes you think that
,,"there's some order to it. But anyway, how can we"
,,"use this in I guess our basic mathematics? So we know, or I'm telling you,"
,,that the ratio of the circumference to the diameter
,,"-- when I say the ratio, literally I'm just saying if"
,,"you divide the circumference by the diameter, you're"
,,going to get pi. Pi is just this number. I could write 3.14159 and just
,,"keep going on and on and on, but that would be a waste of"
,,"space and it would just be hard to deal with, so people just"
,,"write this Greek letter pi there. So, how can we relate this? We can multiply both sides of"
,,this by the diameter and we could say that the
,,circumference is equal to pi times the diameter. Or since the diameter is equal
,,"to 2 times the radius, we could say that the circumference is"
,,equal to pi times 2 times the radius. Or the form that you're
,,"most likely to see it, it's equal to 2 pi r. So let's see if we can apply"
,,that to some problems. So let's say I have a circle
,,"just like that, and I were to tell you it has a radius --"
,,"it's radius right there is 3. So, 3 -- let me write this down"
,,-- so the radius is equal to 3. Maybe it's 3 meters --
,,put some units in there. What is the circumference
,,of the circle? The circumference is equal to
,,2 times 5 times the radius. So it's going to be equal to 2
,,"times pi times the radius, times 3 meters, which is"
,,equal to 6 meters times pi or 6 pi meters. 6 pi meters. Now I could multiply this out. Remember pi is just a number. Pi is 3.14159 going
,,"on and on and on. So if I multiply 6 times that,"
,,maybe I'll get 18 point something something something. If you have your calculator you
,,"might want to do it, but for simplicity people just tend to"
,,leave our numbers in terms of pi. Now I don't know what this is
,,"if you multiply 6 times 3.14159, I don't know if you"
,,"get something close to 19 or 18, maybe it's approximately"
,,18 point something something something. I don't have my calculator
,,in front of me. But instead of writing
,,"that number, you just write 6 pi there. Actually, I think it"
,,"wouldn't quite cross the threshold to 19 yet. Now, let's ask"
,,another question. What is the diameter
,,"of the circle? Well if this radius is 3, the"
,,diameter is just twice that. So it's just going to be 3
,,"times 2 or 3 plus 3, which is equal to 6 meters. So the circumference is 6 pi"
,,"meters, the diameter is 6 meters, the radius is 3 meters. Now let's go the other way. Let's say I have"
,,another circle. Let's say I have
,,another circle here. And I were to tell you that
,,its circumference is equal to 10 meters -- that's the
,,circumference of the circle. If you were to put a tape
,,measure to go around it and someone were to ask you what is
,,"the diameter of the circle? Well, we know that the diameter"
,,"times pi, we know that pi times the diameter is equal to"
,,the circumference; is equal to 10 meters. So to solve for this we would
,,just divide both sides of this equation by pi. The diameter would equal
,,"10 meters over pi or 10 over pi meters. And that is just a number. If you have your calculator,"
,,"you could actually divide 10 divided by 3.14159, you're"
,,going to get 3 point something something something meters. I can't do it in my head. But this is just a number. But for simplicity we often
,,"just leave it that way. Now what is the radius? Well, the radius is equal"
,,to 1/2 the diameter. So this whole distance right
,,"here is 10 over pi meters. If we just 1/2 of that, if"
,,"we just want the radius, we just multiply it times 1/2. So you have 1/2 times 10 over"
,,"pi, which is equal to 1/2 times 10, or you just divide the"
,,"numerator and the denominator by 2. You get 5 there, so"
,,you get 5 over pi. So the radius over
,,here is 5 over pi. Nothing super fancy about this. I think the thing that confuses
,,people the most is to just realize that pi is a number. Pi is just 3.14159 and it just
,,keeps going on and on and on. There's actually thousands of
,,"books written about pi, so it's not like -- I don't know"
,,"if there's thousands, I'm exaggerating, but you could"
,,"write books about this number. But it's just a number. It's a very special number, and"
,,if you wanted to write it in a way that you're used to writing
,,"numbers, you could literally just multiply this out. But most the time people just"
,,"realize they like leaving things in terms of pi. Anyway, I'll leave you there. In the next video we'll figure"
,,out the area of a circle.
,,
Circle,ZyOhRgnFmIY,A candy machine
,,"creates small chocolate wafers in the shape of circular discs. The diameter, the diameter of"
,,"each wafer is 16 millimeters. What is the area of each candy? So, the candy, they say it's"
,,"the shape of circular discs. And they tell us that the diameter of each wafer is 16 millimeters. So if I draw a line across the circle that goes through the center, "
,,"the length of that line all the way across the circle through the center is 16 millimeters. So let me write that, so"
,,"diameter, the diameter here is 16 millimeters and"
,,"they want us to figure out the area, the area of the"
,,"surface of this candy. Or essentially the area of this circle. And so when we think about area, we know that the area of a"
,,"circle, the area of a circle is equal to pi times the"
,,"radius of the circle squared. Times the radius of the circle squared, and you say, well they"
,,"gave us the diameter, what is the radius? Well, you might remember the radius is half of diameter, so"
,,"distance from the center of the circle to the outside,"
,,to the boundary of the circle. So it would be this
,,"distance right over here, which is exactly half of the diameter. So, it would be eight millimeters. So, where we see the radius,"
,,"we could put eight millimeters. So the area is going to be equal to pi times eight millimeters squared, which would be 64, 64 square,"
,,"64 square millimeters. And typically, this is"
,,"written with pi after the 64, so you might often see it as this is equal to 64 pi, 64 pi millimeters squared, millimeters squared, millimeters squared. Now, this is "
,,"the answer,"
,,"64 pi millimeters squared, but sometimes it's not so satisfying to just leave this pi, you might say, ""Well, I wanna get a"
,,"estimate of what number ""this is close to, I wanna"
,,"decimal representation of this."" And so we can start to use"
,,"approximate values of pi. So, the most rough"
,,"approximate value that tends to be used is saying that pi, a very rough approximation"
,,"is equal to 3.14. So in that case, we could"
,,"say that this is going to be equal to 64, 64"
,,"times 3.14 millimeters, millimeters squared and"
,,we can get our calculator to figure out what this
,,will be in decimal form. So we have 64 times 3.14 gives us 200.96. So we could say that the area
,,"is approximately equal to, approximately equal to"
,,"200.96 square millimeters. Now, if we wanna get a more"
,,"accurate representation of this, pi actually just keeps going on and on and on forever, we"
,,could use the calculator's internal representation of pi. In which case we'll say 64 times and then we have to look for
,,"the pi in the calculator, it's up here in this yellow so I'll do this little second"
,,"function, get the pi there, every calculator will"
,,"be a little different. But 64 times pi, now we're going to use the calculator's internal"
,,"approximation of pi, which is going to be"
,,"more precise than what I had in the last one and you get 201, so let me put it over"
,,"here so I can write it down, so a more precise is 201,"
,,"and I'll round, I'll round to the nearest, I'll round"
,,"to the nearest hundredth so you get 201.06, so 201, so more precise is 201.06 square millimeters. So this is closer to the actual answer 'cause a calculator's       "
,,representation is more precise than this very rough
,,approximation of what pi is.
,,
Circle,04N79tItPEA,Draw a circle and label the
,,"radius, diameter, center, and the circumference. Let me draw a circle. And it won't be that"
,,"well drawn of a circle, but I think you get the idea. So that is my circle. I'm going to label"
,,the center over here. I'll do the center. I'll call it c. So that is my center. And I'll draw an arrow there. That is the center
,,"of the circle. And actually, the"
,,circle itself is the set of all points that are a fixed
,,distance away from that center. And that fixed distance
,,"away that they're all from that center,"
,,that is the radius. So let me draw the radius. So this distance right
,,over here is the radius. That is the radius. And that's going to be the
,,"same as this distance, which is the same as that distance. I can draw multiple radii. All of these are radii, the"
,,"distance between the center and any point on the circle. Now, a diameter just goes"
,,"straight across the circle, going through the center. From one side of the"
,,"circle to the other side, I'm going through the center. It's essentially two"
,,"radii put together. So for example, this"
,,"would be a diameter. You have one radii, than"
,,"another radii, all one line, going from one side of"
,,"the circle to the other, going through the center. So that is a diameter. And I could have"
,,drawn it other ways. I could've drawn it like this. That would be another diameter. But they're going to have
,,"the exact same length. And finally, we have to think"
,,about the circumference. And the circumference
,,is really just how far you have to go to go
,,around the circle. Or if you put a
,,"string on this circle, how long will that"
,,string have to be? So what I'm tracing
,,"out in blue right now, the length of what I'm tracing"
,,"out, is the circumference. So right over here, that"
,,is the circumference. And we're done.
,,
Circle,D-EIh7NJvtQ,We already know that
,,an angle is formed when two rays share
,,"a common endpoint. So, for example, let's say"
,,"that this is one ray right over here, and then this is one"
,,"another ray right over here, and then they would"
,,form an angle. And at this point
,,"right over here, their common endpoint is called"
,,"the vertex of that angle. Now, we also know that not"
,,"all angles seem the same. For example, this"
,,"is one angle here, and then we could"
,,"have another angle that looks something like this. And viewed this way,"
,,it looks like this one is much more open. So I'll say more open. And this one right over
,,"here seems less open. So to avoid having to just say,"
,,"oh, more open and less open and actually becoming a little"
,,"bit more exact about it, we'd actually want to"
,,"measure how open an angle is, or we'd want to have a"
,,"measure of the angle. Now, the most typical way"
,,"that angles are measured, there's actually two major"
,,ways of that they're measured. The most typical
,,"unit is in degrees, but later on in"
,,"high school, you'll also see the unit of radians"
,,"being used, especially when you learn trigonometry. But the degrees convention"
,,really comes from a circle. So let's draw ourselves
,,"a circle right over here, so that's a circle. And the convention is that--"
,,"when I say convention, it's just kind of what"
,,everyone has been doing. The convention is that you
,,have 360 degrees in a circle. So let me explain that. So if that's the
,,"center of the circle, and if we make this ray our"
,,"starting point or one side of our angle, if you go all"
,,"the way around the circle, that represents 360 degrees. And the notation is 360, and"
,,then this little superscript circle represents degrees. This could be read
,,"as 360 degrees. Now, you might be saying, where"
,,"did this 360 number come from? And no one knows for sure,"
,,"but there's hints in history, and there's hints in just the"
,,"way that the universe works, or at least the Earth's"
,,rotation around the sun. You might recognize
,,or you might already realize that there are 365
,,"days in a non-leap year, 366 in a leap year. And so you can imagine ancient"
,,"astronomers might have said, well, you know, that's"
,,"pretty close to 360. And in fact, several"
,,"ancient calendars, including the Persians"
,,"and the Mayans, had 360 days in their year. And 360 is also a much"
,,"neater number than 365. It has many, many more factors. It's another way of saying it's"
,,"divisible by a bunch of things. But anyway, this has just been"
,,"the convention, once again, what history has handed"
,,"us, that a circle is viewed to have 360 degrees. And so one way we"
,,could measure an angle is you could put one of the
,,"rays of an angle right over here at this part of the circle, and"
,,then the other ray of the angle will look something like this. And then the fraction of
,,the circle circumference that is intersected by these two
,,"rays, the measure of this angle would be that"
,,"fraction of degrees. So, for example, let's say that"
,,this length right over here is 1/6 of the circle's
,,circumference. So it's 1/6 of the
,,way around the circle. Then this angle
,,"right over here is going to be 1/6 of 360 degrees. So in this case, this"
,,would be 60 degrees. I could do another example. So let's say I had a circle like
,,"this, and I'll draw an angle. I'll put the vertex at"
,,the center of the angle. I'll put one of the
,,rays right over here. You could consider
,,that to be 0 degrees. Or if the other ray was also
,,"here, it would be 0 degrees. And then I'll make the"
,,"other ray of this angle, let's say it went straight up. Let's say it went"
,,"straight up like this. Well, in this"
,,"situation, the arc that connects these two"
,,"endpoints just like this, this represents 1/4 of the"
,,"circumference of the circle. This is, right over here,"
,,1/4 of the circumference. So this angle right over here is
,,going to be 1/4 of 360 degrees. 360 degrees divided by 4
,,"is going to be 90 degrees. At an angle like this, one where"
,,one ray is straight up and down and the other one goes to
,,"the right/left direction, we would say these two"
,,"rays are perpendicular, or we would call"
,,this a right angle. And the way that we
,,oftentimes will denote that is by a symbol like this. But this literally
,,means a 90-degree angle. Let's do one more example. Let's do one more
,,"example of this, just to make sure that we"
,,"understand what's going on. Actually, at least"
,,one more example. Maybe one more if we have time. So let's say that we have an
,,"angle that looks like this. Once more, I'm going"
,,to put its vertex at the center of the circle. That's one ray of the angle. And let's say that
,,this is the other ray. This right over here is
,,the other ray of the angle. I encourage you to
,,pause this video and try to figure out what
,,"the measure of this angle right over here is. Well, let's think about where"
,,the rays intersect the circle. They intersect there and there. The arc that connects
,,them on the circle is that arc right over there. That is literally half of the
,,circumference of the circle. That is half of the
,,"circumference, half of the way around of the circle,"
,,circumference of the circle. So this angle is going to
,,be half of 360 degrees. And half of 360 is 180 degrees. And when you view it
,,"this way, these two rays share a common endpoint. And together, they're"
,,really forming a line here. And let's just do
,,"one more example, because I said I would. Let me paste another circle. Let me draw another angle. Let me draw another angle. So let's say that's"
,,"one ray of the angle, and this is the other ray. This is the other ray of"
,,the angle right over here. And we care. There's actually two
,,angles that are formed. There's actually two angles
,,formed in all of these. There's one angle that's
,,"formed right over here, and you might recognize that"
,,to be a 90-degree angle. But what we really care
,,"about in this example is this angle right over here. So once again, where does"
,,it intersect the circle? We care about this
,,"arc right over here, because that's the"
,,arc that corresponds to this angle right over here. And it looks like we've
,,gone 3/4 around the circle. So this angle is going
,,to be 3/4 of 360 degrees. 1/4 of 360 degrees is
,,"90, so three of those is going to be 270 degrees."

Circle,lDKjX5ouoic,a candy machine creates small chocolate wafers in the shape of circular disks the diameter of each wafer is 16 millimeters what is the area of each candy of each wafer I'm guessing so that's a wafer the diameter is 16 so this is the center the diameter is 16 millimeters and they want us to figure out the area so that's so that's equal to the diameter so the area and so the the formula that one of the famous formulas of geometry for the area of a circle is PI R squared where pi is 3.14159 on and on and on the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle R is the radius of the circle so they told us the diameter of a circle and the radius is just half of that because the radius is half of a diameter so the radius for this circle for each of these wafers is going to be 8 millimeters so the radius that part 
,,right there is going to be 8 millimeters so the area of our circle is going to be equal to pi times 8 millimeters squared and I'll keep the unit's there just so that we get the right units for area at the end so area is going to be equal to PI times 64 meters squared or I guess you could call them square meters or just to write 
,,this the way it's typically written area is equal to 64 pi meters squared now it's important to realize pi is not a variable it literally is representing just a very famous number in mathematics pi is equal to 3.14159 keeps going on and on without repeating so we literally could take 3.14159 and put it in the place of pi right over here and I'll use a and sometimes people will approximate it with 3.14 but I'll just go we'll use the calculator to get the exact value so we could say 64 you could just say 64 if you wanted a very rough one you could say 64 times 3.14 which would give you 200 point nine six millimeter squared but if you wanted a more exact 
,,answer you could literally go off and multiply 64 times pi and I'm sure this calculator has PI stored and ended up to some pretty pretty accurate precision so 64 some pretty precise precision I should say so 64 times pi exactly is 201 point zero six so I'm gonna go with this because this is the more precise answer 201 points nm 
,,and - the more accurate answer 201 point zero six so this is 200 one point zero six square square millimeters

Circle,tCrDyJsSFok,So we've got a circle here--
,,"doesn't look like a perfect circle, but we can use our"
,,"imaginations --and let's say it's got a radius of 3 meters. My question, or the question"
,,we're going to answer in this video is what is the
,,"area of this circle? And remember, the area is just"
,,"how much space this circle takes up on a surface, or on"
,,"this computer screen that you're watching, or on"
,,"this piece of paper. If this was a room, it's how"
,,"much carpeting you would need to fill out this circular room. That's what the area is. Now, I'm not going to prove it"
,,"to you, and we'll do that later, but the area for circle"
,,just takes on a fairly straightforward formula and I
,,want to just get you used to applying that formula. So the area of a circle
,,"is equal to pi. Remember, pi was that number"
,,that people figured out was the ratio between the circumference
,,"and the diameter of the circle. It's 3.14159, keeps"
,,"going on and on and on. It's just the number, but"
,,it's a very magical number. Pi times the radius squared. In fact another way of defining
,,pi:-- you could even rewrite this right here --the area over
,,your radius squared- so this is your radius. If you multiply the radius
,,times itself you could imagine that would be the area of a
,,cube that's like that --that the ratio between the area of
,,this entire circle and the ratio of this cube right
,,here-- or this square. I shouldn't say a cube. Cube would be if we went into
,,3D --but the ratio of the area of the circle to this square
,,right here is also equal to pie. That could be actually
,,an alternate way of defining what pi is. And if you were to measure it
,,very carefully using-- there's thousands of methods you could
,,do it --you would get 3.14159 and keep going on
,,and on and on. But we're not going to delve
,,too deeply into that. Maybe one day I'll make a
,,whole play list on pi. But we just need to know that
,,"the area is equal to pi times r squared, so let's just"
,,"apply the numbers here. So in our example, the area is"
,,"equal to pi times 3 meters squared, which is equal to pi"
,,"times 9 meters squared, or the conventional way to write this"
,,"is, equal to 9pi meters squared. And remembered 9pi, the"
,,"convention is just to leave it that way, but this is the same"
,,"thing as 9 times 3.14159, which is probably going to be, like,"
,,"28 point something meters squared. Just remember, this is just"
,,some number and it's not 9. It's actually closer to 28
,,"because it's going to be 9 times 3.14159, but we"
,,just leave it like that. And that normally will be
,,"good enough for you to say, hey that is my area. That's my area: 9pi. Now let's go the other way:"
,,let's say I have a circle and let's say that someone would
,,say that the area is equal to 16pi. What is the diameter of
,,"that circle going to be? Well, we know that area"
,,is equal to pi times the radius squared. So at least let's
,,"figure out the radius. So the area, 16pi, is equal to"
,,pi times our radius squared. I'm just applying this formula. We're just going to keep
,,applying this formula over and over again when
,,"we're dealing with area. So area, which we've been"
,,"told is 16pi, is equal to pi times radius squared. Now, if we divide both sides of"
,,"this equation by pi, we get 16 is equal to r squared. And then you take the square"
,,root of both sides and you get 4 is equal to r. I guess r could also be equal
,,"to negative 4, but we're dealing with distances here;"
,,you can't have a negative radius. Or at least in the world
,,we're living in right now. Just keep things simple;
,,we just want to keep our distances positives. So let's say that this
,,"has a radius of 4. Now if the radius is 4,"
,,"what is its diameter? Well, the diameter is always"
,,"going to be 2 times the radius. So this 4, we're going to"
,,have another 4 there. The diameter is equal to 8. Now let's do a slightly harder
,,one that will kind of compound some of the other things that
,,we've learned in the past. So let's say that I
,,have a circle here. Let's say that its
,,"circumference is equal to 20pi, and I want to know its area. So way you do all these"
,,"problems is just figure out everything you can, given what"
,,"they've given you, and then maybe you can work out the"
,,thing they're asking for. So if I know that the
,,"circumference is 25, what do I know about its radius? Well, we saw in the last video"
,,that the circumference is equal to 2pi times the radius. So if the circumference is
,,"equal to 20pi, we could write that 20pi is the circumference"
,,is equal to 2pi times the radius. Now if you divide both sides of
,,"this by pi, those cancel out. Then if you divide both sides"
,,"by 2, this becomes a 1, this becomes a 10, or you get"
,,"the radius is equal to 10. Which makes sense, right? 2pi times 10 is going"
,,to be equal to 20pi. So we've figured
,,"out our radius. Now, we know that the area is"
,,"equal to pi times r squared. And lucky for us, using the"
,,"circumference, we were able to figure out the radius. Now using the radius, we"
,,can figure out the area. So the area is going to be
,,"equal to pi times r squared,-- r is 10 --times 10 squared,"
,,"which is equal to pi times 100. Or it's equal to 100pi. Just like that. so your circumference was 20pi,"
,,"when you went around the circle, but your area of"
,,your circle is 100pi. And if I gave you units it
,,would be 100pi units squared. That is your area
,,"right there: 100pi. Anyway, I think that's pretty"
,,good initial exposure to the area of a circle. I'll see in the next video.
,,
Circle,MyzGVbCHh5M,What I want to do in this video
,,"is to prove one of the more useful results in geometry, and"
,,that's that an inscribed angle is just an angle who's vertex
,,sits on the circumference of the circle. So that is our inscribed angle. I'll denote it by si -- I'll
,,"use the si for inscribed angle and angles in this video. That si, the inscribed angle,"
,,is going to be exactly 1/2 of the central angle that
,,subtends the same arc. So I just used a lot a fancy
,,"words, but I think you'll get what I'm saying. So this is si. It is an inscribed angle. It sits, it's vertex sits"
,,on the circumference. And if you draw out the to rays
,,that come out from this angle or the two cords that define
,,"this angle, it intersects the circle at the other end. And if you look at the part of"
,,"the circumference of the circle that's inside of it, that"
,,"is the arc that is subtended by si. It's all very fancy words,"
,,but I think the idea is pretty straightforward. This right here is the arc
,,"subtended by si, where si is that inscribed angle right over"
,,"there, the vertex sitting on the circumference. Now, a central angle is an"
,,angle where the vertex is sitting at the center
,,of the circle. So let's say that this right
,,here -- I'll try to eyeball it -- that right there is
,,the center of the circle. So let me draw a central angle
,,that subtends this same arc. So that looks like a central
,,"angle subtending that same arc. Just like that. Let's call this theta. So this angle is si, this"
,,angle right here is theta. When I'm going to prove in this
,,video is that si is always going to be equal
,,to 1/2 of theta. So if I were to tell you that
,,"si is equal to, I don't know, 25 degrees, then you would"
,,immediately know that theta must be equal to 50 degrees. Or if I told you that theta was
,,"80 degrees, then you would immediately know that"
,,"si was 40 degrees. So let's actually proved this. So let me clear this. So a good place to start,"
,,"or the place I'm going to start, is a special case. I'm going to draw an inscribed"
,,"angle, but one of the cords that define it is going to be"
,,the diameter of the circle. So this isn't going to be the
,,"general case, this is going to be a special case. So let me see, this is the"
,,center right here of my circle. I'm trying to eyeball it. Center looks like that. So let me draw a diameter. So the diameter
,,looks like that. Then let me define
,,my inscribed angle. This diameter is
,,one side of it. And then the other side
,,maybe is just like that. So let me call this
,,"right here si. If that's si, this length right"
,,here is a radius -- that's our radius of our circle. Then this length right here is
,,also going to be the radius of our circle going from the
,,center to the circumference. Your circumference is defined
,,by all of the points that are exactly a radius away
,,"from the center. So that's also a radius. Now, this triangle right here"
,,is an isosceles triangle. It has two sides
,,that are equal. Two sides that are
,,definitely equal. We know that when we have two
,,"sides being equal, their base angles are also equal. So this will also"
,,be equal to si. You might not recognize
,,it because it's tilted up like that. But I think many of us when we
,,"see a triangle that looks like this, if I told you this is r"
,,"and that is r, that these two sides are equal, and if this is"
,,"si, then you would also know that this angle is"
,,also going to be si. Base angles are equivalent
,,"on an isosceles triangle. So this is si, that is also si. Now, let me look at"
,,the central angle. This is the central angle
,,subtending the same arc. Let's highlight the arc that
,,they're both subtending. This right here is the arc that
,,they're both going to subtend. So this is my central
,,"angle right there, theta. Now if this angle is theta,"
,,"what's this angle going to be? This angle right here. Well, this angle is"
,,"supplementary to theta, so it's 180 minus theta. When you add these two angles"
,,together you go 180 degrees around or the kind
,,of formal line. They're supplementary
,,to each other. Now we also know that these
,,three angles are sitting inside of the same triangle. So they must add up
,,to 180 degrees. So we get si -- this si plus
,,"that si plus si plus this angle, which is 180 minus"
,,theta plus 180 minus theta. These three angles must
,,add up to 180 degrees. They're the three
,,angles of a triangle. Now we could subtract
,,180 from both sides. Si plus si is 2 si minus
,,theta is equal to 0. Add theta to both sides. You get 2 si is equal to theta. Multiply both sides by 1/2
,,or divide both sides by 2. You get si is equal
,,to 1/2 of theta. So we just proved what we set
,,out to prove for the special case where our inscribed angle
,,"is defined, where one on the rays, if you want to view these"
,,"lines as rays, where one of the rays that defines this"
,,inscribed angle is along the diameter. The diameter forms
,,part of that ray. So this is a special
,,case where one edge is sitting on the diameter. So already we could
,,generalize this. So now that we know that if
,,this is 50 that this is going to be 100 degrees
,,"and likewise, right? Whatever si is or whatever"
,,"theta is, si's going to be 1/2 of that, or whatever si is,"
,,theta is going to be 2 times that. And now this will
,,apply for any time. We could use this notion any
,,"time that -- so just using that result we just got, we can now"
,,"generalize it a little bit, although this won't apply"
,,to all inscribed angles. Let's have an inscribed
,,"angle that looks like this. So this situation, the center,"
,,you can kind of view it as it's inside of the angle. That's my inscribed angle. And I want to find a
,,relationship between this inscribed angle and the central
,,angle that's subtending to same arc. So that's my central angle
,,"subtending the same arc. Well, you might say, hey, gee,"
,,"none of these ends or these cords that define this angle,"
,,"neither of these are diameters, but what we can do is"
,,we can draw a diameter. If the center is within
,,these two cords we can draw a diameter. We can draw a diameter
,,just like that. If we draw a diameter just like
,,"that, if we define this angle as si 1, that angle as si 2. Clearly si is the sum"
,,of those two angles. And we call this angle theta
,,"1, and this angle theta 2. We immediately you know that,"
,,"just using the result I just got, since we have one side of"
,,"our angles in both cases being a diameter now, we know"
,,that si 1 is going to be equal to 1/2 theta 1. And we know that si 2 is
,,going to be 1/2 theta 2. Si 2 is going to
,,"be 1/2 theta 2. So si, which is si 1 plus si 2,"
,,"so si 1 plus si 2 is going to be equal to these two things. 1/2 theta 1 plus 1/2 theta 2. Si 1 plus si 2, this is equal"
,,to the first inscribed angle that we want to deal
,,"with, just regular si. That's si. And this right here, this"
,,is equal to 1/2 times theta 1 plus theta 2. What's theta 1 plus theta 2? Well that's just our
,,original theta that we were dealing with. So now we see that si
,,is equal to 1/2 theta. So now we've proved it for a
,,slightly more general case where our center is inside
,,"of the two rays that define that angle. Now, we still haven't addressed"
,,a slightly harder situation or a more general situation where
,,if this is the center of our circle and I have an inscribed
,,angle where the center isn't sitting inside of
,,the two cords. Let me draw that. So that's going to be my
,,"vertex, and I'll switch colors, so let's say that is one of the"
,,"cords that defines the angle, just like that. And let's say that is the"
,,other cord that defines the angle just like that. So how do we find the
,,"relationship between, let's call, this angle right"
,,"here, let's call it si 1. How do we find the relationship"
,,between si 1 and the central angle that subtends
,,this same arc? So when I talk about the same
,,"arc, that's that right there. So the central angle that"
,,subtends the same arc will look like this. Let's call that theta 1. What we can do is use what we
,,just learned when one side of our inscribed angle
,,is a diameter. So let's construct that. So let me draw a diameter here. The result we want still is
,,"that this should be 1/2 of this, but let's prove it. Let's draw a diameter"
,,just like that. Let me call this angle right
,,"here, let me call that si 2. And it is subtending this arc"
,,right there -- let me do that in a darker color. It is subtending this
,,arc right there. So the central angle that
,,"subtends that same arc, let me call that theta 2. Now, we know from the earlier"
,,part of this video that si 2 is going to be equal
,,"to 1/2 theta 2, right? They share -- the"
,,diameter is right there. The diameter is one of the
,,cords that forms the angle. So si 2 is going to be
,,equal to 1/2 theta 2. This is exactly what we've been
,,"doing in the last video, right? This is an inscribed angle. One of the cords that define"
,,is sitting on the diameter. So this is going to be 1/2 of
,,"this angle, of the central angle that subtends"
,,"the same arc. Now, let's look at"
,,"this larger angle. This larger angle right here. Si 1 plus si 2. Right, that larger angle"
,,"is si 1 plus si 2. Once again, this subtends this"
,,"entire arc right here, and it has a diameter as one of the"
,,cords that defines this huge angle. So this is going to be 1/2
,,of the central angle that subtends the same arc. We're just using what we've
,,already shown in this video. So this is going to be equal to
,,1/2 of this huge central angle of theta 1 plus theta 2. So far we've just used
,,"everything that we've learned earlier in this video. Now, we already know that si"
,,2 is equal to 1/2 theta 2. So let me make that
,,substitution. This is equal to that. So we can say that si 1 plus
,,-- instead of si 2 I'll write 1/2 theta 2 is equal to 1/2
,,theta 1 plus 1/2 theta 2. We can subtract 1/2 theta
,,"2 from both sides, and we get our result. Si 1 is equal to 1/2 theta one. And now we're done. We have proven the situation"
,,that the inscribed angle is always 1/2 of the central angle
,,"that subtends the same arc, regardless of whether the"
,,"center of the circle is inside of the angle, outside of the"
,,"angle, whether we have a diameter on one side. So any other angle can be"
,,constructed as a sum of any or all of these that
,,we've already done. So hopefully you found this
,,useful and now we can actually build on this result to do some
,,more interesting geometry proofs.
,,
Circle,1m9p9iubMLU,What I have attempted to
,,draw here is a unit circle. And the fact I'm
,,calling it a unit circle means it has a radius of 1. So this length from
,,the center-- and I centered it at the origin--
,,"this length, from the center to any point on the"
,,"circle, is of length 1. So what would this coordinate"
,,"be right over there, right where it intersects"
,,"along the x-axis? Well, x would be"
,,"1, y would be 0. What would this"
,,"coordinate be up here? Well, we've gone 1"
,,"above the origin, but we haven't moved to"
,,"the left or the right. So our x value is 0. Our y value is 1. What about back here? Well, here our x value is -1. We've moved 1 to the left. And we haven't moved up "
,,or
,,"down, so our y value is 0. And what about down here? Well, we've gone a unit"
,,"down, or 1 below the origin. But we haven't moved"
,,"in the xy direction. So our x is 0, and"
,,"our y is negative 1. Now, with that out of the way,"
,,I'm going to draw an angle. And the way I'm going
,,to draw this angle-- I'm going to define a
,,convention for positive angles. I'm going to say a
,,"positive angle-- well, the initial side"
,,of the angle we're always going to do along
,,the positive x-axis. So you can kind of view
,,"it as the starting side, the initial side of an angle. And then to draw a positive"
,,"angle, the terminal side, we're going to move in a"
,,counterclockwise direction. So positive angle means
,,we're going counterclockwise. And this is just the
,,"convention I'm going to use, and it's also the convention"
,,that is typically used. And so you can imagine
,,a negative angle would move in a
,,clockwise direction. So let me draw a positive angle. So a positive angle might
,,"look something like this. This is the initial side. And then from that, I go in"
,,a counterclockwise direction until I measure out the angle. And then this is
,,the terminal side. So this is a
,,positive angle theta. And what I want to do is
,,think about this point of intersection
,,between the terminal side of this angle
,,and my unit circle. And let's just say it has
,,the coordinates a comma b. The x value where
,,it intersects is a. The y value where
,,it intersects is b. And the whole point
,,of what I'm doing here is I'm going to see how
,,this unit circle might be able to help us extend our
,,traditional definitions of trig functions. And so what I want
,,to do is I want to make this theta part
,,of a right triangle. So to make it part
,,"of a right triangle, let me drop an altitude"
,,right over here. And let me make it clear that
,,this is a 90-degree angle. So this theta is part
,,of this right triangle. So let's see what
,,we can figure out about the sides of
,,this right triangle. So the first question
,,"I have to ask you is, what is the"
,,length of the hypotenuse of this right triangle that
,,"I have just constructed? Well, this hypotenuse is just"
,,a radius of a unit circle. The unit circle
,,"has a radius of 1. So the hypotenuse has length 1. Now, what is the length of"
,,this blue side right over here? You could view this as the
,,"opposite side to the angle. Well, this height is"
,,the exact same thing as the y-coordinate of
,,this point of intersection. So this height right over here
,,is going to be equal to b. The y-coordinate
,,"right over here is b. This height is equal to b. Now, exact same logic--"
,,what is the length of this base going to be? The base just of
,,"the right triangle? Well, this is going"
,,to be the x-coordinate of this point of intersection. If you were to drop
,,"this down, this is the point x is equal to a. Or this whole length between the"
,,origin and that is of length a. Now that we have
,,"set that up, what is the cosine-- let me"
,,use the same green-- what is the cosine of my angle going
,,to be in terms of a's and b's and any other numbers
,,"that might show up? Well, to think"
,,"about that, we just need our soh cah toa definition. That's the only one we have now. We are actually in the process"
,,of extending it-- soh cah toa definition of trig functions. And the cah part is what
,,helps us with cosine. It tells us that the
,,cosine of an angle is equal to the length
,,of the adjacent side over the hypotenuse. So what's this going to be? The length of the
,,"adjacent side-- for this angle, the"
,,adjacent side has length a. So it's going to be
,,"equal to a over-- what's the length of the hypotenuse? Well, that's just 1. So the cosine of theta"
,,is just equal to a. Let me write this down again. So the cosine of theta
,,is just equal to a. It's equal to the x-coordinate
,,of where this terminal side of the angle
,,intersected the unit circle. Now let's think about
,,the sine of theta. And I'm going to do it in-- let
,,me see-- I'll do it in orange. So what's the sine
,,"of theta going to be? Well, we just have to look at"
,,the soh part of our soh cah toa definition. It tells us that sine is
,,"opposite over hypotenuse. Well, the opposite"
,,side here has length b. And the hypotenuse has length 1. So our sine of
,,theta is equal to b. So an interesting
,,"thing-- this coordinate, this point where our"
,,terminal side of our angle intersected the
,,"unit circle, that point a, b-- we could"
,,also view this as a is the same thing
,,as cosine of theta. And b is the same
,,"thing as sine of theta. Well, that's interesting. We just used our soh"
,,"cah toa definition. Now, can we in some way use"
,,this to extend soh cah toa? Because soh cah
,,toa has a problem. It works out fine if our angle
,,"is greater than 0 degrees, if we're dealing with"
,,"degrees, and if it's less than 90 degrees. We can always make it"
,,part of a right triangle. But soh cah toa
,,starts to break down as our angle is either 0 or
,,"maybe even becomes negative, or as our angle is"
,,90 degrees or more. You can't have a right triangle
,,"with two 90-degree angles in it. It starts to break down. Let me make this clear. So sure, this is"
,,"a right triangle, so the angle is pretty large. I can make the angle even"
,,larger and still have a right triangle. Even larger-- but I can never
,,"get quite to 90 degrees. At 90 degrees, it's"
,,not clear that I have a right triangle any more. It all seems to break down. And especially the
,,"case, what happens when I go beyond 90 degrees. So let's see if we can"
,,use what we said up here. Let's set up a new definition
,,of our trig functions which is really an
,,extension of soh cah toa and is consistent
,,with soh cah toa. Instead of defining cosine as
,,"if I have a right triangle, and saying, OK, it's the"
,,adjacent over the hypotenuse. Sine is the opposite
,,over the hypotenuse. Tangent is opposite
,,over adjacent. Why don't I just
,,"say, for any angle, I can draw it in the unit circle"
,,using this convention that I just set up? And let's just say that
,,the cosine of our angle is equal to the x-coordinate
,,"where we intersect, where the terminal"
,,side of our angle intersects the unit circle. And why don't we
,,define sine of theta to be equal to the
,,y-coordinate where the terminal side of the angle
,,"intersects the unit circle? So essentially, for"
,,"any angle, this point is going to define cosine"
,,of theta and sine of theta. And so what would be a
,,"reasonable definition for tangent of theta? Well, tangent of theta--"
,,even with soh cah toa-- could be defined
,,"as sine of theta over cosine of theta,"
,,which in this case is just going to be the
,,y-coordinate where we intersect the unit circle over
,,"the x-coordinate. In the next few videos,"
,,I'll show some examples where we use the unit
,,circle definition to start evaluating some trig ratios.
,,
Circle,iX5UgArMyiI,"So we have a circle here and they specified some points for us. This little orangeish, or,"
,,"I guess, maroonish-red point right over here is the"
,,"center of the circle, and then this blue point"
,,"is a point that happens to sit on the circle. And so with that information,"
,,I want you to pause the video and see if you can figure out
,,"the equation for this circle. Alright, let's work through this together. So let's first think about"
,,the center of the circle. And the center of the
,,"circle is just going to be the coordinates of that point. So, the x-coordinate is negative one and then the y-coordinate is one. So center is negative one comma one. And now, let's think about what the radius of the circle is. Well, the radius is going"
,,"to be the distance between the center and any point on the circle. So, for example, for example, this distance. The distance of that line. Let's see I can do it thicker. A thicker version of that. This line, right over there. Something strange about my... Something strange about my pen tool. It's making that very thin. Let me do it one more time. Okay, that's better. (laughs) The distance of"
,,"that line right over there, that is going to be the radius. So how can we figure that out? Well, we can set up a right triangle and essentially use the distance formula which comes from the Pythagorean Theorem. To figure out the length of that line, so this is the radius, we could figure out a change in x. So, if we look at our "
,,change in x right over here. Our change in x as we go from the center to this point. So this is our change in x. And then we could say that
,,this is our change in y. That right over there is our change in y. And so our change in x-squared plus our change in y-squared is going to be our radius squared. That comes straight out of
,,"the Pythagorean Theorem. This is a right triangle. And so we can say that r-squared is going to be equal to our change in x-squared plus our change in y-squared. Plus our change in y-squared. Now, what is our change in x-squared? Or, what is our change in x going to be? Our change in x is going to be equal to, well, when we go from the radius to this point over here, our x goes from negative one to six. So you can view it as our ending x minus our starting x. So negative one minus negative, sorry, six minus negative one is equal to seven. So, let me... So, we have our change in x, this right over here, is equal to seven. If we viewed this as the start "
,,"point and this as the end point, it would be negative seven, but we really care"
,,"about the absolute value in the change of x, and once you square it it all becomes a positive anyway. So our change in x right over here is going to be positive seven. And our change in y, well, we are starting at, we are starting at y is equal to one and we are going to y is"
,,"equal to negative four. So it would be negative four minus one which is equal to negative five. And so our change in y is negative five. You can view this distance right over here as the absolute value of our change in y, which of course would be"
,,"the absolute value of five. But once you square it, it doesn't matter. The negative sign goes away. And so, this is going to"
,,"simplify to seven squared, change in x-squared, is 49. Change in y-squared,"
,,"negative five squared, is 25. So we get r-squared, we get r-squared is equal to 49 plus 25. So what's 49 plus 25? Let's see, that's going"
,,"to be 54, or was it 74. r-squared is equal to 74. Did I do that right? Yep, 74. And so now we can write the"
,,equation for the circle. The circle is going to be
,,"all of the points that are, well, in fact, let me right all of the, so if r-squared is equal to 74, r is equal to the square-root of 74. And so the equation of      "
,,"the circle is going to be all points x comma y that are this far away from the center. And so what are those points going to be? Well, the distance is going to be x "
,,"minus the x-coordinate of the center. x minus negative one squared. Let me do that in a blue color. Minus negative one squared. Plus y minus, y minus the y-coordinate of the center. y minus one squared. Squared. Is equal, is going to"
,,be equal to r-squared. Is going to be equal to the
,,"length of the radius squared. Well, r-squared we already"
,,know is going to be 74. 74. And then if we want to
,,"simplify it a little bit, you subtract a negative,"
,,"this becomes a positive. So it simplifies to x plus one squared plus y minus one squared is equal to 74. Is equal to 74. And, we are all done."

Circle,6r1GQCxyMKI,Now that you know what the conic
,,"sections are and why they're called conic sections, let's"
,,see if we can understand the actual equations of the conic
,,"sections a little bit better, and use that knowledge to be"
,,"able to at least recognize them when we see the equation, and"
,,"then if we see the equation, know how to plot them. So the first one we'll start"
,,off with is the circle. And you've probably seen this
,,"for many years already, but I'll review, if you"
,,don't know it already. The general form of an
,,"equation, or the general equation for a circle, is x"
,,"squared plus y squared is equal to r squared, where r is"
,,the radius of the circle. And this would be a circle
,,"centered at the point 0,0. So I'll just draw this kind of"
,,"a general graph right here. So that's the x-axis, that's"
,,"the y-axis, the circle will look like this-- let me do it"
,,in a different color-- the circle would look something
,,"like-- make sure it's a circle-- well, it's supposed to"
,,"be centered at 0,0, but that's close enough-- so its center"
,,"will be right here, and the radius if you go from the"
,,center to any point along that circle will have a distance of
,,"r, so if you go from there to there it's r, from there to"
,,"there it's r, from there to there it's r, and to some"
,,"degree, this formula, all it is is an extension of the distance"
,,"formula, which is really just the extension of the"
,,"Pythagorean Theorem. So for example, the distance"
,,"formula, if I want to know the distance between some point x,y"
,,"and the point 0,0, what you do is, you take the difference of"
,,"the x's-- so x minus 0-- you square that, and then you add"
,,that to the distance between the y's squared-- so that's one
,,"y point minus 0y-- y is equal to 0-- square that, and that is"
,,"equal to the distance squared. So if you simplify this, x"
,,"minus 0 squared, that's just x squared plus-- and this"
,,"is just y squared is equal to distance squared. So essentially, this equation"
,,"is the plot of all points that are exactly d away, a distance"
,,"of d away, from the point 0,0, and that's just a circle. And I'll let you think about"
,,"it, I think I actually showed this to you in a distance"
,,"formula video, but the distance formula just comes out of"
,,the Pythagorean Theorem. And if that's not completely
,,"obvious for you, just think about a little bit, and"
,,"it'll hopefully become a little bit more obvious. But anyway, this was probably--"
,,"you probably already knew this, and actually just to hit the"
,,"point home, if we had the equation like this x squared"
,,"plus y squared is equal to 9, the graph of this circle"
,,"would look like this. So that's the x-axis, that's"
,,"the y-axis, then draw the circle itself, circle looks"
,,"like-- close enough, and then the distance or the radius from"
,,"the center of the circle, that's going to be 3. There's a 9 here, why"
,,"isn't the radius 9? Oh, that's because this"
,,is the radius squared. Remember the original formula I
,,just showed you. x squared plus y squared is equal
,,to r squared. So this right here is r
,,"squared, so if r squared is equal to 9, than"
,,"r is equal to 3. It can't be minus 3. I mean, it could, you can't"
,,"have a negative radius, or if you did you're just going in"
,,"the other direction, but it's the same thing. So the radius is equal to 3. So that's a circle, and that's"
,,"pretty straightforward, but in a lot of algebra classes, they"
,,complicate the issue a little bit by shifting the circle. So let's just shift
,,this circle. Instead of having-- so
,,let me just rewrite it. So the unshifted circle was x
,,squared plus y squared is equal to-- let me write it this way--
,,"is equal to 3 squared, that's the same thing as 9, and let's"
,,"say that the new circle, the shifted circle, is x minus 1"
,,squared plus y plus 2 squared is equal to 3 squared. Now all of a sudden this looks
,,"really complicated and daunting and all the rest, but all you"
,,"have to recognize is, we just substituted an x minus 1 for"
,,"the-- whoops, messed up my pointer. We just substituted an x"
,,"minus 1 for the x, and we just substituted a"
,,y plus 2 for the y. So it has the same basic
,,"pattern as of this circle, and the fact that we added or"
,,subtracted numbers from the x's and the y's tells us that we
,,"shifted the circle, and so the next obvious question is,"
,,"where did you shift it to? And your impulse might be, oh,"
,,"well maybe I shifted it to, instead of the center being"
,,"0,0, your intuition might be to say that, well, now the"
,,"center is at negative 1,2. And you'd be almost right,"
,,except you'd be exactly the opposite of the correct answer. The new center is now x is
,,equal to positive 1 and y is equal to minus 2. And that might be unintuitive
,,for you at first-- and you might want to watch some of the
,,"videos, I think I've done them already, or I've always"
,,"intended to, on shifting functions-- but the way to"
,,"think about it is the center here is x is equal to 0. So when x and y is equal to 0,"
,,"x squared plus y squared is 0, you're exactly 0 away from the"
,,"center, or we're at the center. So now if we want to be-- if we"
,,"want x to be 0 away from our new center, this term"
,,has to be equal to 0. And if-- just like when x was
,,"equal to 0, this term equaled 0, so now for us to be at the"
,,"center of our new circle, so to speak, this term has to be 0. So the new center has to"
,,"be at x is equal to 1. Likewise, this has to be"
,,"0, and so the center is at y is equal to 2. Another way to think about it"
,,"is this-- let's say when y, you know what happens here"
,,when y is equal to 2. Whatever part of the circle
,,we're in when y is equal to 2. There's some part of the circle
,,"we're at, in fact I could draw it, when y is equal to 2. Let's say this radius is 3 when"
,,"y is equal to 2, we're probably right around there"
,,on the circle. We could be there or
,,"we could be there. Now we're shifting the circle,"
,,"so now instead of being at 0,0, we're going to be at 1 minus 2. So now we're going to be at the"
,,"new center is x is equal to 1, y is equal to minus 2, the new"
,,"center is there, and if I were to draw the new circle, it"
,,would look something like this. I'm going to try my best
,,to draw it still as a circle and show you
,,"that it's been shifted. No, that's not good. Let me draw it like-- I"
,,pressed the wrong button. That's not good. Let me draw it right there. That's close enough. I don't have to keep doing it. So what we did is we shifted
,,"this circle down 2, and to the right 1. So if we take its center"
,,"point, we went down 2 and to the right 1. And so if you think about up"
,,"here, when y was equal to 2, we could have been at this point"
,,"or this point, the kind of equivalent points of the new"
,,"circle are going to be here. Are going to be roughly here,"
,,where you're shifting it down and to the right. And in order to have that
,,"same behavior in the circle there, this whole thing"
,,should be equal to 2. So that same point on the
,,"circle, if this whole thing is going to be equal to 2--"
,,because it's going to be the same kind of behavior in the
,,"equation, and I hope I'm not confusing you there-- then the"
,,"new y has to be 0, and you see it there. At both of these points"
,,"now, y is equal to 0. So I know that's a little"
,,"unintuitive, but I want you to sit and think about that a lot. I mean, you could just memorize"
,,"it, that it's the opposite, when you have x minus 1 and y"
,,plus 2 that it's actually you shifted to x is equal to-- the
,,"center is now 1, minus 2, or you could memorize, if you"
,,"like, that what makes this 0 and what makes this 0, and"
,,that's your new center. But I really want you to
,,"think about it, this is really a shift. And of course, if you were"
,,"to graph it, you were to get this thing up there. Anyway, let me see how"
,,much time I have. Actually I didn't even
,,"keep track of the time. I'll leave you there, I'll"
,,continue this in the next video where I'll talk a little
,,bit about ellipses.
,,
Circle,U2W7HPyC0cM,Let's start again with a point. Let's call that point point
,,A. And what I'm curious about is all of the points on
,,"my screen right over here, that are exactly 2"
,,centimeters away from A. So 2 centimeters on my
,,screen is about that far. So clearly if I
,,"start at A and I go 2 centimeters in that direction,"
,,"this point right over there, is 2 centimeters from A. If"
,,"I call that point, point B, then I could say line"
,,segment AB is 2 centimeters. The length is 2 centimeters. Remember this would refer
,,"to the actual line segment. I could say this looks nice,"
,,"but if I talk about its length, I would get rid of"
,,that line on top and I would just say
,,AB is equal to 2. If I wanted to put units I
,,could say 2 centimenters. But I'm not curious just about
,,"B, I want to think about all of the points, the set"
,,of all of the points that are exactly 2
,,centimeters away from A. So I could go 2 centimeters
,,"in the other direction, maybe get to point"
,,C right over here. So AC is also going to be
,,"equal to 2 centimeters, but I could go 2 centimeters"
,,in any direction. And so if I find the
,,set of all of the points that are exactly 2
,,"centimeters away from A, I will get a very familiar"
,,"looking shape, like this, and I'm trying to"
,,draw it freehand. So I would get a shape
,,"that looks like this. Actually, let me draw it in. I don't want to make you think"
,,"that it's only the points where there's white, it's all of"
,,these points right over here. I don't want to draw a dashed
,,"line over there, which maybe I should just, let me"
,,clear out all of these and I'll just draw
,,it as a solid line. So this could look
,,something like that. My best attempt. And this set of all
,,of the points that are exactly 2
,,"centimeters away from A, this is a circle, as I'm sure"
,,you are already familiar with. But that is the formal
,,definition-- the set of all points that
,,"are a fixed distance, or that have a fixed"
,,"distance, from A that are a given"
,,distance from A. If I said the set of all points
,,"that are 3 centimeters from A, it might look"
,,something like this. It might look
,,something like that. That would give
,,us another circle. I think you get
,,the general idea. Now what I want to
,,do in this video is introduce ourselves into
,,some of the concepts and words that we use when
,,dealing with circles. So let me get rid of
,,"that 3-centimeter circle. So first of all, let's"
,,"think about this distance. This distance, or one"
,,"of these line segments that join A, which we would"
,,call the center of the circle. So we'll call A the
,,"center of the circle, and it makes sense"
,,just from the way we use the word center
,,in everyday life. What I want to do is think
,,about what line segment AB is. AB connects the center and it
,,"connects a point on the circle itself. Remember, the circle itself"
,,is all of the points that are equal distance
,,"from the center. So AB, any line"
,,"segment, I should say, that connects the center"
,,"to a point on the circle, we would call a radius. And so the length of the"
,,"radius, AB over here, is equal to 2 centimeters. And you're probably already"
,,"familiar with the word radius, but I'm just being a"
,,little bit more formal. And what's interesting
,,"about geometry, at least when you start learning"
,,"it at the high school level, is it's probably the"
,,first class where you're introduced into a slightly more
,,"formal mathematics, where we're a little bit more careful"
,,about giving our definitions and then building
,,on those definitions to come up with
,,interesting results and proving to ourselves
,,that we definitely know what we think we know. And so that's why we're
,,being a little bit more careful with our
,,"language over here. So AB is our radius,"
,,"line segment AB, and so is line segment-- let me"
,,"draw another point on here, let's say this is X-- so line"
,,segment AX is also a radius. Now you can also have other
,,forms of lines and line segments that interact
,,in interesting ways with the circle. So you could have a line
,,that just intersects that circle at
,,exactly one point. So let's call that point right
,,"over there, let's call that D. And let's say you have a"
,,"line, and the only point on the circle-- the only point"
,,"in the set of all of the points that are equal distant from A,"
,,the only point on that circle that is also on that
,,line is point D. And we could call that line l. So sometimes you'll
,,"see lines specified by some of the points on them. So for example, if I had another"
,,"point right over here called E, we could call this line"
,,"line DE, or we could just put a little script"
,,letter here with an l and say this is line l. But this line that only
,,"has one point in common with our circle, we call"
,,this a tangent line. So line l is a tangent. It is tangent to the circle. So let me write it
,,"this way, line l is tangent-- you normally"
,,"wouldn't write it in caps like this,"
,,I'm just doing that for emphasis-- is tangent
,,to-- instead of writing the circle centered
,,"at A, you'll sometimes see this notation-- to"
,,the circle centered at A. So this tells us that this is
,,"the circle we're talking about. Because who knows, maybe we"
,,had another circle over here that is centered at
,,"M, another circle. So we have to specify it's"
,,"not tangent to that one, it's tangent to this one. So this circle with"
,,a dot in the middle tells we're talking
,,"about a circle, and this is a circle"
,,"centered at point A. I want to be very clear,"
,,"point A is not on the circle, point A is the"
,,center of the circle. The points on the circle
,,"are the points equal distant from point A. Now, l is"
,,"tangent, because it only intersects the"
,,circle in one point. You could just as
,,easily imagine a line that intersects the
,,"circle at two points. So we could call, maybe"
,,"this is F and this is G, you could call that line FG. So we could write it"
,,"like this, line FG. And this line that"
,,"intersects it at two points, we call this a"
,,secant of circle A. It is a secant line to this
,,"circle right over here, because it intersects"
,,"it in two points. Now, if FG was just"
,,"a segment, if it didn't keep on going forever,"
,,"like lines like to do, if we only spoke about"
,,this line segment-- let me do this in a new
,,color-- if we only spoke about this line segment
,,"between F and G, and not thinking about going on"
,,"forever, then all of a sudden we have a line segment,"
,,which we would specify there. And we would call this
,,"a chord of the circle, a chord of circle A. It starts"
,,"at a point on the circle, a point that is exactly in"
,,"this case 2 centimeters away, and then it finishes at"
,,a point on the circle. So it connects two
,,"points on the circle. Now, you could have"
,,"chords like this, and you can also have a"
,,"chord, as you can imagine, a chord that actually"
,,goes through the center of the circle. So let's call this
,,"point, point H, and you have a straight line"
,,connecting F to H through A. So that's about as straight
,,as I could draw it. So if you have a
,,"chord like that, that contains the actual"
,,"center of the circle, of course it goes from"
,,one point of the circle to another point of
,,"the circle, and it goes through the center"
,,"of the circle, we call that a diameter of A. And you've probably seen"
,,"this in tons of problems before, when we were not talking"
,,"about geometry as formally, but the diameter is made"
,,up of exactly two radiuses. We already know that a radius
,,connects a point to the center. So you have one
,,radius right over here that connects F and
,,"A, that's one radius, and then you have"
,,"another radius connecting A and H, the center to"
,,a point on the circle. So the diameter is made
,,"up of these two radiuses, or radii I should"
,,"call it, I think that's the plural for radius. And so the length"
,,of a diameter is going to be twice the
,,length of a radius. So we could say the length of
,,"the diameter, so the length of FH-- and once again I don't"
,,put the line on top of it when I'm just talking
,,about the length-- is going to be equal to
,,"FA, the length of segment FA, plus the length"
,,of segment AH. Now there's one
,,last thing I want to talk about when we're
,,"dealing with circles, and that's the idea of an arc. So we also have the parts"
,,of the circle itself. So let me draw another
,,circle over here. Let's center this circle
,,right over here at B. And I'm going to find
,,all of the points that are a given distance from
,,"B. So it has some radius, I'm not going to specify"
,,"it right over here, and let me pick some random"
,,"points on the circle. So let's call this J, let's"
,,"call that K, let's call this S, let's call this T, let's"
,,call this U right over here. And I know it doesn't look that
,,"centered, let me try to center B a little bit better. Let me erase that. And if I put B a"
,,"little bit closer to the center of the circle, so"
,,"that's my best shot, so let's put B right over there. Now, one interesting"
,,"thing is, what do you call the length of the circle"
,,that goes between two points? So what would you call-- let
,,"me get a good color here-- what would you call this? Well, you could imagine"
,,in everyday language we would call something
,,"that looks like that an arc, and we would also call"
,,that an arc in geometry. To specify this
,,"arc we would call this JK, the two"
,,"endpoints of the arc, the two points on"
,,the circle that are the endpoints
,,"of the arc, and you use a little notation like that. So you put a little curve on"
,,top instead of a straight line. Now you could also have
,,"another arc that connects JK, this is the minor arc. It is the shortest way along"
,,"the circle to connect J and K, but you could also go"
,,the other way around. You could also have
,,this thing that goes all the way
,,around the circle. And we would call
,,that the major arc. And normally when you
,,"specify a major arc, just to show that you're going"
,,"the long way around, it's not the shortest way"
,,"to get between J and K, you'll often specify"
,,"another point that you're going through. So for example, this major arc"
,,"we could specify we start at J, we went through-- we could"
,,"have said U, T, or S, but I'll put T right over"
,,there-- we went through T and then we went
,,all the way to K. And so this specifies
,,the major arc and this thing could have been
,,"the same thing as if I wrote JUK, these are specifying"
,,"the same thing, or JSK. So there's multiple ways"
,,to specify this major arc right over here. But the one thing
,,"I make clear is, is that the minor arc is"
,,"the shortest distance, so this is the minor arc, and"
,,the longer distance around is the major arc. And I'll leave you there and
,,maybe the next few videos we'll start playing with some of this
,,notation a little bit more.
,,
Circle,TWocMNAtmns,What is
,,the length of arc ABC? So arc ABC is this arc right over here and the reason why they
,,"have to give us three points is because if they just said arc AC, it would still ambiguous"
,,because there's two arc ACs. It could be this arc right over here or it could be this arc over here. And so when they tell us B we know that we're going from A to C 
,,"through B, so that's why this kind of, by"
,,"giving us that third letter, it resolves the ambiguity on"
,,"which arc we're talking about. What is the length of that arc? Well the first thing we could do is well, let's just"
,,"think about the entire, what's the circumference of this circle? And then we can say well, what fraction of the entire circumference is this arc? And a big hint here is if we were to go all the way around the circle,"
,,"that would be 360 degrees, but we're only going 135"
,,of those 360 degrees. But let's first think
,,about the circumference. So the circumference of
,,"a circle is equal to two, is equal to two pi times"
,,"the radius of the circle, and they give us the"
,,"radius as three inches. So the circumference is going to be two pi times three inches, so times three inches, or two times three is six, times pi, so it's going to be six pi, six pi inches. Now, and actually if"
,,"you look at the choices, if you look at the choices over here, the entire circumference of"
,,"the circle is six pi inches. Remember, pi is 3.14159,"
,,"so this is going to be something in the, you"
,,"know, it's going to be a little bit over 18 or 19 inches. So you could immediately,"
,,"if the entire circumference is a little over 18 or 19 inches, this is only a fraction of"
,,"that entire circumference, so actually if you even"
,,"were looking at the choices, you'd say, well hey,"
,,"these are way too large. But actually, let's see if we can get to the exact right answer. So the entire circumference"
,,"is six pi inches, but this arc length isn't"
,,the entire circumference. It only goes 135 degrees
,,"out of 360 degrees, so we could say, so it is 135/360 of the entire circumference. Remember, if we were to"
,,"go all the way around, that's 360 degrees, while"
,,"this angle right over here is 135 degrees, the angle"
,,"that is subtended by this arc. So this arc length is going to be 135/360 of the entire circumference, so times six pi, six pi inches. So let's see if we can"
,,"simplify this a little bit. So let's see, we could"
,,"divide the numerator and the denominator by six. Six divided by six is one. 360 divided by six is 60. Let's see, if we divide 135 by five, that is going to be 27. Yeah, 100 divided by five is 20, and then 35 divided by five is seven, so this is going to be 27, and then this would be 12,"
,,"if we divide 60 by five. Let's see, we could then"
,,"divide the numerator and the denominator by three. 27 divided by three is nine, and 12 divided by three is four, so we're left with 9/4 times pi inches, so 9/4 times pi inches, or we could multiply the"
,,"numerator times the pi. We would say nine pi over four inches. Now when you look at the choices, that is this one, that is"
,,this one right over there.
,,
Circle,ZffZvSH285c,"Hello. Well, welcome to the next"
,,presentation in the trigonometry modules. Just to start off a little
,,"bit, let's review what we've done so far. In the last couple modules, we"
,,"learned the definitions-- or at least, I guess, we could call"
,,"it a partial definition-- of the sine, the cosine, and"
,,the tangent functions. And the mnemonic we used to
,,"memorize that was sohcahtoa. Let me write that down. Sohcahtoa. And what that told us is, let's"
,,"say we had a right triangle. Let me draw a right triangle. This is a right angle here. This is the hypotenuse. Let me label the hypotenuse, h. Let me label this-- and so we"
,,"want to figure out, we want to use this angle right here. Theta, we'll call this theta. Whatever. Then this is the adjacent side,"
,,and this is the opposite side. And that's an o. So soh tells us that sine
,,is equal to opposite over hypotenuse. Cosine is equal to
,,adjacent over hypotenuse. And tangent is equal to
,,"opposite over adjacent. And I think, by this point--"
,,and especially if you did some of the exercises on the Khan
,,Academy-- that should be second nature and should make
,,"a lot of sense to you. But this definition, using a"
,,"right triangle like this, actually breaks down"
,,"at certain points. Actually, at a lot of points. For example, what happens"
,,as this angle right here approaches 90 degrees? You can't have two 90
,,"degree angles in a right triangle, can you? Then it would be like a"
,,rectangle or something. But you could actually probably
,,"figure out what happens as it approaches 90 degrees. But the definition, this"
,,"definition, breaks down for that. Also, what happens if"
,,this angle is negative? Or what happens if this angle
,,is more than 90 degrees? Or what happens if
,,"it's 800 degrees? Or you know, 8 pi radians? Not that 800 and 8 pi"
,,"radians are the same thing. But obviously, this definition"
,,starts to break down. Because we couldn't even
,,draw a right triangle that has those properties. So now I'm going to introduce
,,"you to an extension of this definition. It's really the same thing, but"
,,"it allows the sine, the cosine, and the tangent functions to be"
,,"defined for angles greater than or equal to pi over 2, or 90"
,,"degrees, or less than 0. So let's draw a unit circle. So this is just the coordinate"
,,"axis, and here is a circle of radius 1. And let's make-- let me see. Let me make sure I'm using"
,,the correct pen tool. OK. So let's call this right
,,"here-- so this is theta. This is an angle, right? Between the x-axis and this"
,,"line I just drew here. And this is a radius, right? And we said that this"
,,has a radius 1. So the length of this
,,"line is 1, right? Because it just goes"
,,from the origin to the outside of the circle. So it has a radius of 1. And now I'm going to draw
,,a right triangle again. Let me just drop a
,,line from here. So there I have a
,,right triangle. So if we use the old
,,definition we learned before. Let's just focus
,,on sine for now. So sine is equal to
,,opposite over hypotenuse. Let's apply that to this
,,right triangle right here. This is the right angle. So what's the opposite
,,angle of this? What's the opposite
,,"side from this angle? I'm going to change to yellow. It's this side, right? This is the opposite side. And what's the hypotenuse? The hypotenuse is just"
,,"this radius, right? And let's just say that this"
,,"point, where it intersects the circle-- let's call this"
,,point right here x comma y. So what's the height of
,,"this opposite side? Well, it's y, right? Because it's just the"
,,height of that point. This is of height y. So sine of this angle right
,,"here, sine of theta, is going to equal the opposite"
,,"side-- which is this yellow side, which is just the"
,,y-coordinate-- is going to equal y over the hypotenuse. The hypotenuse is
,,this pink side here. And what's the length
,,"of the hypotenuse? Well, it's the radius"
,,"of this unit circle. So it's 1. And y divided by 1? Well, that's just y. So we see that sine of"
,,theta is equal to y. Let's do the same thing
,,"for cosine of theta. Well, we know that cosine"
,,"is equal to adjacent over hypotenuse. Well, what's the"
,,adjacent side here? I'm running out of colors. The adjacent side is this
,,"bottom side, right here. So that would equal-- so"
,,"if I said-- I'm running out of space, too. Cosine of theta would equal"
,,this gray side-- which is the adjacent side--
,,and what is that? What is this length? What is the length
,,"of this side? Well, it's just x, right? If this is the point x, y then"
,,this distance here is x and we already learned this distance--
,,or we already observed-- that this distance is y. So this distance being
,,"just x, we know that the adjacent length is x. So we say cosine of theta is"
,,"equal to x over the hypotenuse. And once again, the"
,,hypotenuse is 1. So cosine of theta
,,"is equal to x. I know what you're thinking. Sal, that's very nice and cute. Cosine of theta equals x,"
,,sine of theta equals y. But how is this really
,,"different from what we were doing before? Well, if I define it this way,"
,,"now all of a sudden when the angle becomes 90 degrees,"
,,"now I can actually define what sine of theta is. Sine of theta now is just y. Is just the y-coordinate,"
,,which is 1. If theta is equal to-- I'm
,,going to make sure it's very messy right here-- if theta
,,"is equal to 90 degrees, or pi over 2 radians. This is pi over 2. This angle right here. And similar, cosine"
,,of pi over 2 is 0. Because the x-coordinate
,,right here is 0. Let me do it with a
,,"couple more examples. Oh, I'm forgetting the"
,,tangent function. And you could probably
,,"figure out now, what is the definition now we can use"
,,"for the tangent function? Well, going back-- let's"
,,use this green theta here. Because it's kind
,,of a normal angle. So in this green angle
,,"here, tangent is opposite over adjacent. So tangent now, we"
,,"can define as y/x. And remember, these y's and x's"
,,that we're using are the point on the unit circle where the
,,angle that's defined by this-- by whatever-- where the radius
,,"that is subtended by this angle, or I guess the arc,"
,,"intersects-- actually, I'm getting confused"
,,with terminology. It's where this line
,,intersects the circumference. The coordinate of that-- the
,,sine of theta is equal to y. The cosine of theta
,,is equal to x. And the tangent of
,,theta is equal to y/x. Let's do a couple of examples
,,and hopefully this'll make a little bit more sense to you. Let me try to really fast
,,draw a new unit circle. So that's my unit circle. And here's the coordinate axis. It's one of them. And here is the other one. So if we use the angle-- let's        
,,"use the angle pi over 2, right? Theta equals pi over 2. Well, pi over 2 is right here. It's a 90 degree angle, if"
,,"you wanted to use degrees. And now, we just figure"
,,"out where it intersects the unit circle. And once again, this is"
,,"a unit circle, so it has a radius of 1. So we can see that sine of pi"
,,over 2 equals the y-coordinate where it intersects
,,"the unit circle. So that's just 1. What's cosine of pi over 2? Well, it's just the"
,,"x-coordinate, where you intersect the unit circle. And the x-coordinate here is 0. And what's the tangent"
,,"of pi over 2? This is interesting. The tangent of pi over 2. Well, the tangent we"
,,"defined now as y/x. So the y-coordinate, this"
,,"is the point 0, 1, right? The y-coordinate is 1. So it equals 1/0. So this is undefined. So still, we don't have a"
,,tangent function that can define itself at
,,"certain points. But in the next module, we're"
,,actually going to graph this. And you'll see that it
,,"approaches infinity. And similarly, we could try to"
,,"find the functions for when theta equals pi, right? That's like 180 degrees. That's this point right here. So sine of pi. What's the y-coordinate"
,,"at this point? Well, this point is"
,,"negative 1 comma 0. So the y-coordinate is 0. What's the x-coordinate? Cosine of pi. That's negative 1. And of course, what's the"
,,tangent of pi radians? It's y/x. So it's 0 over negative
,,"1, which equals 0. Hopefully this makes sense. Now in the next module I'll"
,,actually graph these points. And you'll see how it all comes
,,"together and why it is useful to define the sine, the cosine,"
,,the tangent functions this way. See you soon. Bye.

Circle,WgW_KwtBvro,find the circumference of the circle that has a radius of 12 inches so if I were to draw the circle right over here the radius so that's the center of the circle the radius here is 12 inches we need to figure out how what's the distance to go around the circle the distance of the if if I were to make a string here and go actually around just like this so the first thing to realize is that there's a very special number called pi that we use when we deal with circles and pi is actually defined as the ratio between the circumference and the diameter of a circle this is one of the ways that one can define pi and pi is denoted by the Greek letter pi and this is and we can keep adding digits to it but it's 3.14159 and some people make sport out of trying to memorize as many digits of pi as possible but it's one of those weird wacky numbers that show up throughout nature and it just keeps on repeating for actually it keeps them going on forever but it does not repeat which is crazy 
,,I mean maybe you know there why wasn't the ratio of the circumference of the diameter of circles three it's just this you know instead it's this kind of wacky wacky 
,,wacky number but with that out of the way through this definition of what pi is we actually get a formula for if you know pi and if you know one of these two things 
,,you can get the other one so if you will know the diameter and you want to come out of the circumference you multiply both sides of this really this definition of pi you multiply both sides by D and you get C is equal to pi times D or another way to think about it because the diameter of a circle is two radii the length of a diameters two times the length of the radius you can replace your diameter with two times the radius and so that gives you and this is kind of a famous formula C is equal to or circumference is equal to two pi two pi R or here it's pi times two times our you switch them around you get two pi R and we just apply that our radius is twelve inches so this is going to be 12 we need to calculate the circumference our circumference is going to be two times pi times 12 that is 24 times pi if we want the exact number remember pi is an actual number it's 3.14159 keeps on going on and on forever let's actually get our calculator out so we can multiply we can multiply 24 and then we have to find pi here pi is right in yellow there so I press second and that right over there 24 pi which literally just means 24 times the number pi which is 24 times 3.14159 on and on and on and we get 75 point three nine eight so depending they haven't told us exactly exactly how much precision they want over 
,,here but if we round to the nearest actually even if we round to the hundredths place we get seventy five point four oh so I'll go with that so this is equal to approximately equal to seventy five point four oh and we're done

Circle,Ia04DUkYHyc,hello welcome back to algebra the title of this lesson is called conic sections circles part one so a title at this.look this way because we're going to be learning 
,,about circles for the next five or six lessons really diving into the details but I also want you to keep in mind that it's part of the family of shapes that we call conic sections we've already talked about the fact that we have circles that's a conic section we have ellipses we have parabolas and we have hyperbolas we have four conic sections which can be obtained from taking cones just a regular cone and slicing them in different ways we get these different shapes called the conic sections so we're going to talk about probably the most important one the circle the most beautiful shape it's all it's always been said throughout history is a circle because it goes back and it joins back to its starting point all right so what we're gonna do in this lesson is I'm gonna give you the equation of a circle right here in the beginning we're gonna do a few quick examples to show you how to graph or how to sketch the shape of a circle but really in the beginning here you won't understand why that's the equation of a circle right you're not gonna really understand that but the next part of this lesson right after we get through with the first examples we're gonna really dive in and show why this equation I'm about to write on the board actually does describe the shape of the circle because I want you to understand what you're doing I don't want you to just blindly trust me I want you to understand hey there's a there's a logical way I can understand what this equation really is so let's first write this equation down again one of the most important equations so here we have what we call a circle and you all know in general what a circle is it has a central point and all of the points on the circle are an equal distance away which we call the radius from the central point so what we say is if we have a center of the circle at the point H comma K because this circle we're going to draw it can be in the center of the xy-plane or we can move the circle anywhere we want you know left right up down in the XY plane so it has to have some center we call it HK these are just placeholders the center of the circle can be 1 comma 2 the center of the circle can be negative 19 comma 7 the circle can be centered at 0 0 or any other value you can come up with so it has a center at H okay and a 
,,radius which we denote by R which is obvious because it's a radius right so what is the equation of the circle and this is the famous equation of a circle in general a circle has this form all circles look like this X minus H quantity squared plus y minus K quantity squared is equal to R squared now I'm gonna let that sink in for a little second even though you won't really understand why it's the case but I'm just I'm gonna circle it on the board because we're gonna leave it up there now in general we're saying the center is at H comma K so we're saying the center of the circle can be anywhere that we want it to be but for now let's just pretend the circle is centered at the origin right the circle is centered at the origin if the center then is at 0 comma 0 then this is 0 and this is 0 and then the entire equation boils down to x squared plus y squared is equal to R squared so the equation of a circle is quite beautiful really when you think about it you have the X variable squared plus the Y variable squared is equal to whatever the radius is squared now you don't understand yet why this actually does describe a circle in fact this equation looks really weird compared to any equation or function that we have drawn in the past right because usually when we graph things we put Y the variable Y on one side of the equal sign and everything else on the other side so we have for instance y equals MX plus B or you know 3 X plus 4 for a line or for a parabola we'll 
,,say y equals 16x squared or for any other polynomial y is equal to 2x squared plus 3x plus 4 always y is on one side of the equal sign and everything else is on the 
,,other side of the equal sign which lets us you know plot the thing but this is different because we have the X variable and the Y very variable which are both squared of course we have the h and the K we'll talk about that later but they're both squared and they're both on one side of the equal sign so it's not set up like the other equations you've ever plotted before and that's because conic sections are just a little bit different all of them are like that the equation of a circle is set up this way it looks a little different the equation of an ellipse looks very very different than other equations you've plotted or looked at before the equation of hyperbolas and parabolas also look different so you're just gonna have to get used to the idea that the conic section equations look a little bit different than what you've graphed in the past and that's because they're defined in a different way so in fact one thing I want you to keep in the back of your mind is one reason why circles look so different the equation of a circle looks different is it turns out a circle is not a function and I know you might say well if it's not a function why do we care well lots of things are important in our functions and this is one of the most important ones a circle is not a function because if you think about a circle being you know circular figure it fails that vertical line test remember we said long time ago with functions that in order for it to be a function there needs to be a one-to-one correspondence between the x value and the y value you know so that means it passes that vertical line test if if it's a function now with a circle you of course you're gonna always cut through two halves as a circle no matter how you do the vertical line test so it's not a function does it mean a circle is not important of course not circles are one of the most important things all right so let's jump into some examples to show you how to use this equation really quickly and then we're going to derive it I'm going to show you where it comes from alright so let's take the most simple circle I can probably think of here's the simplest one in existence x squared plus y squared is equal to 1 this is an equation of a circle you might say how does he know it's an equation of a circle well the way you know is because it follows this form you have the X variable squared plus the Y variable squared equals something squared yes I know it's a 1 but when you think about it 1 is really 1 squared so the right hand side is something squared right and you might say well wait a minute is different than this well not really if the center is H comma K then we know from this that I can write this you know I didn't give it to you this way but I could write it as H minus 0 squared I'm sorry X minus 0 squared plus y minus 0 squared is equal to 1 squared so I'm not going to give it to you like that on a test I'm gonna give it to you like this and I'm gonna say hey what is the center and what is the radius of that circle and in your mind you need to say well I can that's really a shift a shift of the center by 0 units and a shift of the center in the Y direction by 0 units and so what this really tells me is the center of the circle is located at 0 comma 0 and the radius is equal to one why is it one because the right hand side is R squared the radius is what we call our but the right hand side is R squared so really to find the radius you take the square root of 1 and so the radius is equal to 1 so the bottom line for a circle you read the center directly out of how the x and y variables are shifted and the radius is read directly off the right hand side you take the square root of whatever is on the right hand side because remember the right hand side is the radius squared so to read the radius out I take the square root to get back the radius that I have so this particular circle for instance if I wanted to draw it or sketch it I'm 
,,not gonna sketch every one of these things but we just put it off in a little XY plane here the center is located at 0 comma 0 that means in the center is right in the center of the coordinate system and the radius is 1 now the radius of a circle means all of the points on the circle are the distance a radius 1 radius unit however far the radius is away from the center so the way the sketch it is if this is 1 and this is 1 and this is negative 1 and this is negative 1 then the circle must go through all these points because the radius is 1 so if I'm going to sketch it I'm gonna go down I'm gonna go down through here I'm gonna go up through here and I'm gonna go through here is that a perfect circle no you can tell it's lopsided the way I've drawn it here because I didn't do my tick marks perfectly but you get the 
,,idea when you sketch it you're saying one unit away one unit away one unit away one unit away the center is read directly out the radius is read by taking the square root of the right hand side I do not expect you to understand yet why this equation actually gives you this shape we haven't talked about that yet for now I want you to trust me and let's do a couple of quick little examples and then when we get through those I will show you exactly why this equation actually produces this shape all right so for now let's let's just kind of plow ahead and let's take a look at another circle let's say I give you another circle X minus 1 quantity squared plus y minus 1 quantity squared is equal to 25 now first you ask yourself does it follow the form of what I have here and the answer is yes X minus some number squared 
,,y minus some number squared radius squared so the way you do this is you read the center directly out of the equation so the center of this circle is located at 1 comma 1 and the radius is equal to whatever is on the right hand side you take the square root of it 25 so the radius is equal to 5 notice I picked these this number nicely so I could take the square root of it there but you don't have to have a nice number if I put 10 on the right hand side then I would the radius will be the square root of 10 the square root of 10 is an ugly number but it's a number if I whatever number is on the right you take the square root of it if you don't have a nice perfect square it's okay you just have a radius that's some decimal and units long I mean of course you can have a circle with a 1.39 5 centimeter radius of course 
,,that can happen but in this case I'm choosing nice numbers so notice what we're saying if the center is at H comma K its X minus H y minus K so I just read the center directly off this minus business comes directly from the idea of shifting a function now we've talked about shifted functions to a great length in the past and I don't want to get into an entire lesson on why this shifted version that's what these minus signs produces a shift to the right I've done that many many times in the 
,,past but probably the easiest way to do it is to compare this equation x squared plus y squared is one with this equation X minus one squared y minus one squared and you can in your mind you can replace this with a one basically this equation is shifted to the right one unit and up one unit because if I put a 1 in here and I put a 1 in here I'm gonna get a 0 squared in a 0 squared if I put a 0 here I'm gonna have a 0 squared in a 0 squared so the bottom line is the only way I can get these 
,,equations to kind of like look similar to one another is if I shift every x value to the right one unit because one minus one is zero and every Y value up one unit because one minus one is zero so when you're comparing the basic equation of a circle this is the basic equation of a circle the equivalent shifted version would look something like this X minus let's say 2 quantity squared plus y minus 2 quantity squared is equal to one so I'm claiming that this equation is exactly the same shape as this one has the same radius but this one is shifted to the right two units and up two units and the reason or I don't want to get into a bunch of lecturing on 
,,it but the reason that it's that way with a minus sign shifting to the right and a minus sign shifting up is because when you compare these equations are exactly the same but if I want to for instance make this quantity zero here the only way I can do it is to feed X values in here two units bigger than I'm feeding them in here 
,,because two minus two is zero so if I want these to be I mean we know it's the same shape we know they have the same radius but I want to figure out how to make them kind of equivalent how do I go from here to here and the only way I can do that is to feed X values in that are two units bigger than that two minus two giving me zero zero being here and also the same thing with Y if I envision feeding a y value of zero in here the only way I can do it is to feed a Y unit into this equation two units bigger so it's the same exact shape it's just shifted over to the right and up two units over to the right two units and up two units because the only way that I can feed the same values as I'm feeding into the base equation is to feed two units bigger into the shifted version that's why it becomes shifted over to the right and shifted up there all right so anyway getting back to our problem is shifted over to the right and up one so the center is one one the radius is five now we're not going to do this for every single problem but let's go ahead and sketch this one as well so here is XY plane right and the center of this thing is that 1 comma 1 so here is 1 comma 1 we're gonna put a dot right here now the center is no longer at the origin the center is shifted over to the right up 1 but the radius is 5 so how do we do that well you have to be 5 units away so 1 2 3 4 5 I'm gonna put a little tick mark here 1 2 3 4 5 and put a little tick mark here I need to go to the left 5 units 1 2 3 4 5 that put a little tick mark here and then I need to go down 1 2 3 4 5 and then put a tick mark here I put these little tick marks here because that helps me guide my pencil whenever I am drawing the circle of course I'm not a good artist so it's not gonna be a good drawing but you see the idea here when you look here at the FE my pencil is a little bit too long but you can see the radius is 5 units of constant 5 units away so basically you put your Center down you count 5 units down 5 units up 5 units to the right 5 units to the left put a little tick mark and then you can of course see that this is 1 2 3 4 5 6 this is 6 units away this is negative 1 negative 2 negative 3 this is negative 4 units away and so on I can count up and count down as well all right we're gonna get a little more practice with the circle business before we move on what if we have the circle X minus 2 plus y squared is equal to 16 now a lot of students look at a circle like this and say well it doesn't really look like a circle it's a sorry mr. squared there it's um it looks different this one shifted in this one isn't okay well that's fine if you want to in your mind transform this that's fine too you don't have to do this but a lot of times what I'll tell people to do is I say write it like this instead of Y squared write it as Y minus 0 squared now suddenly it mirrors exactly what the form of the circle should be if you were going to read the center of the circle off of this equation what would the center be the center would be there's a shift to the right 2 units that means the center is 2 units to the right but the shift up or down is really zero so it's just 2 comma 0 that's the center right the radius is whatever is on the right hand side you take the square root of it because what's on the right hand side of this equation as the radius squared so that means the radius is square root of 16 which is 4 okay again we're not going to do sketching of a million of these things but we will do a little bit here so the center here being at 2 comma 0 means the center is 1/2 units over comma 0 it means it's right on the line right there and then the radius is 4 units so I have 1 2 3 4 units to the right 1 2 3 4 units up I'm gonna put a little tick mark there because that's where my radius is gonna be 1 2 3 4 tick marks to the left and 1 2 3 4 tick marks directly below now you see the tick mark all through here that I'm going to try to go 
,,through is it perfect no but that's mostly what you're trying to do to come a zero radius of four you can see it's a constant distance away from the center of this guy so the base equation of the circle is just x squared plus y squared is R squared whatever you're doing inside the parentheses shifting the thing left or right up 
,,or down is just determining where the new center is again because when I shift the thing I have to feed units have to feed x and y values 2 units bigger and Y value 
,,2 units bigger in order to give me the same shape as my original base equation all right now I want to do a couple more and I think I want to try to squeeze them in 
,,over here because I need to shave the last two boards for the probably the most important part of this lesson here let's go and take a look at x squared plus y squared is equal to 100 what would be I'm not going to graph this one but what is the center and what is the radius here so you know as I said you know you can it's almost exactly the same thing as what we've done up here X minus 0 squared you can write it as Y minus 0 squared you can write it as but you know you don't have to do that that's something that I tell people to do in the beginning but really when you don't see any shift here then you know right away that the center is just located at 0 comma 0 right and the radius is just whatever is on the right hand side but you have to take the square root of it so the radius is 10 units so if I wanted to sketch this I would draw an XY plane I would put the center of the circle right in them in the origin right at 0 0 and I would count 10 use to the right 10 units up 10 
,,years to the left and that would basically draw my circle which will be a pretty large circle all right so that's just one more little example I want to do one more 
,,and have a little space to graph it because it's a little more important what if you have X plus 2 quantity squared plus y minus 1 quantity squared is equal to 9 now this one looks a little different because the Y minus 1 is written just like it is here Y minus something but the X here there's no minus sign so a lot of times students will get confused okay when you're shifting functions and I covered all of this when we did the original shifting functions lesson a long time ago when you shift things when you shift any function it could be a circle could be a line could be a parabola could be cubic could be a square root anything any graph you can shift anywhere you want on the XY plane when the X variable is shifted with a minus sign it means it shifted in the positive x-direction when the Y variable has a minus sign shift it's shifted in the positive y-direction but when you have plus signs it's shifted in the opposite direction why because you can write this you can write this X plus 2 you can write it as X minus a minus 2 if you want to you don't have to I'm just trying to give you different ways to think about it this is perfectly exactly the same as this so this is a shift to the right but negative to unit so I'm shifting to the right but oh hold on a second I'm actually shifting to the left because I'm shifting negative two units to the right so it's a little bit of a convoluted way to think about it but the way to really think about it is that when you see a plus sign you actually go the opposite direction which is left when you see a minus sign you go to the right so the center of this guy the center is really located at negative 2 comma positive 1 like this and the radius is the square root of 9 which is 3 like this ok and I will try to do a little quick sketch here let's see if we can we can fit it in right here we're gonna do it we're gonna do it right here we're gonna go and say okay we have an XY plane where is the center negative 2 
,,comma 1 so negative 2 for X here's a negative 1 negative 2 for X 1 for y so there's one for Y so that the center is no longer on the right-hand side of the planets on the left-hand side of the plane the radius is a 3 so you have to count up 1 2 3 units from there put a tick mark 1 2 3 units left from there 1 2 3 units down from 
,,there and 1 2 3 units from there so I'm putting a little tick marks there so there's 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 now I know these tick marks are not perfect because they're not evenly spaced and I did a little sloppy job with that but this is basically what you look at or the reason it looks a little bit oblong is because these tick marks are a little bit wider than those but there's there's a radius of one to three to the left one to three to the right it's just I've compressed things a little bit but that's more or less how you how you graph this thing so now what we've done is I've introduced the equation of a circle and you know how to use it but so far you don't know why it works you don't know why I mean when we learn how to graph lines we make a table of values and we show that that's the graph of a line when we do graph parabolas initially we do a table of values and I'll show you that that's how you graph a parabola but here for the circle business I just told you trust 
,,me this is the equation of a circle but you don't actually know why it's the equation of a circle so what we're gonna do now is we're gonna go and explore that in more detail it's extremely important when you get into higher math to know where things come from otherwise you're not doing anything other than just you know repeating what you've been taught so what we want to do is I want to do a circle I want to show a circle with Center at 0 comma 0 and a radius of 4 so what I want to do is draw this and I want to figure out what the equation of that circle must be now we already know what it must be because I already showed you what the equation of a circle is but let's pretend we have no idea what an equation of a circle is and I want to draw this and I want to understand where everything comes from so what we do 
,,is we say ok I'm gonna go ahead and draw an XY plane I'm going to try to draw it large so that we can see everything so there's X here's Y and the center of this circle is at 0 0 right there and the radius is 4 that means that there must be 1 2 3 4 must be a little crossing there 1 2 3 4 crossing there 1 2 3 4 crossing there 1 2 3 4 crossing there so the circle must look something like this it goes down and then it goes way down here and it goes way over here and goes way up is that perfect no it's not perfect but that's basically what the circle centered at zero radius of 4 looks like now what we want to do is we want to recognize that the blue line here is the set of all points that make up that thing that we call a circle there must be some kind of an equation that will predict for lack of a better word all the points that lie on the blue curve if we can't figure out what the equation is of what's on the blue curve then we failed so we need to figure out what the equation 
,,is that describes what the blue curve is how did we do that well let's first go over here and say well let me switch colors actually up here we're gonna say that the points on this curve there's infinite points of course on this blue curve but I'm just gonna pick one of them right here and I'm gonna say it's point P because that makes sense point P right and this point P has a value X comma Y now we're saying that the blue curve really is the set of all points P right so there's a point P here another point P here another point P here there's an infinite number of points all the way around and every one of those points have a different value X comma Y 
,,"right this one might be I don't know this is 1 2 3 , 12.8 or something so this might be 3 comma 2.8 whatever you can see that as you go around the circle the different values of P are gonna all be different but there should be an equation to predict what those points are all right so what we're gonna do to figure this out is the following we want to we want we know let me put it this way that between the center and all of the points on here the critical thing is the distance here is what we call the radius the distance here is what we call the radius and we know that it's equal to 4 units that's the critical thing that lets us figure out the equation of a circle because we know that if the point is here the distance must be 4 units if the point is over here the distance must also be 4 units if the distance is here 4 units distance here 4 units no matter where I point the thing the distance from the center must be point 4 units now remember I'm saying that distance from the center must be 4 units the distance from the center must be 4 units remember we learned something called the distance formula we know how to find distances anytime we "
,,have two points in the XY plane we can just stick it right into the distance formula and calculate the distance and we're saying that all of these points have to be 
,,4 units from the center so we can then write down the equation by using that now remember the distance formula comes directly from the Pythagorean theorem which we've discussed a long time ago all right so if you think about it if this is the point X I'm sorry P which is X comma Y then there must be some x value right here of course binding for that value of P and there must be some Y this is the X comma Y X you read it from this axis and Y you read it from this axis right and the center don't forget is located at 0 comma 0 that's what a center is it's located at 0 comma 0 so how can you write down what we need to figure out we know the distance from 0 comma 0 to whatever point we care about X comma Y is equal to 4 but for this particular circle 4 units the distance from 0 to whatever point but I drew the point here but I could have drawn the point here or here or here it doesn't matter whenever the point is the distance between the center and that is 4 units so how do we write that down the way we're gonna write that down is called the distance formula what is the distance between 0 0 and X Y now I know we don't know what X Y is that's 
,,the whole point we don't know what P X Y is but we know that there's some point has an x value and it has some y value so if if we were gonna find the distance between here and here we would do it exactly as we always do remember the distance formula is what it's x2 minus x1 quantity squared plus y2 minus y1 quantity squared we 
,,take the square root of that whole thing right that's what the distance formula is the only thing about it is we know what one of the points is but the other point we don't really know what it is we just know it has some X and some Y value so then to find the distance between them going from here subtracting here the distance would be whatever X is minus 0 quantity squared plus whatever Y is minus 0 this is the distance between those two points make sure you understand it yes I don't know what x and y is of course I don't know what they are it could be you know 1 2 this would be 2 points something you know whatever 2 points something of course I don't 
,,know what it is but I know it's X Y so I take X - the x value y minus the y value I stick it into the distance formula and I know that this must be equal to a distance of 4 units of 4 units why because the radius of the circle is 4 units I know what the distance is so I calculate the distance between the points and I said it equal to 4 because that's the radius of the circle I drew now how do I do anything with this equation I have this large square root but I'm going to not deal with that 
,,right now let's go ahead and just rewrite this this is just X minus 0 squared so we can write it as x squared this is y minus 0 squared we can write it as this squared we still have a square root is equal to 4 now in order to get rid of the square root on the left what do I do I take the square of both sides right so I say x squared plus y squared is equal to 4 I have a square root but what I can do is I can raise the left hand side to the power of 2 and since it's an equation I can do the 
,,same thing to the right hand side I can do anything I want to both sides of the equation now on the left hand side the square kind of cancels with the square root so all you have is x squared plus y squared is equal to 4 squared which is 16 this is the equation of the circle this is exactly what we would expect based on the problems that we did before right we said a center of circle always has a center H comma K and a radius of 4 the center is located at whatever the shift is here and but 
,,in this case the circle that we drew on the board we didn't have any shift at all so we expect it to be x squared plus y squared is equal to something and it has to 
,,be whatever the radius is square the radius is 4 you square it you get 16 so this is the equation of a circle with a radius centered at 0 comma 0 with a radius of 4 
,,and you can generalize this so let's generalize this because we drew the circle as a radius of 4 but we know if we make the circle bigger or smaller the only thing that's really going to change is you know the distance formula we're gonna change what's on the right-hand side so even if you make it a generic are all you're saying is that a circle has the general form of x squared plus y squared is equal to the radius squared that's all we did on the right hand side we squared the radius so if the radius were 10 we would square it and we would get 100 on the right if the radius were 3 we would square it and we would get 9 on the right so this is the equation of a circle centered at 0 0 with a radius of are whatever that radius is so that's how we go from here's the special shape color circle to what is the equation 
,,of that now it's not like a traditional equation that you've learned before because the Y is not by itself on the left hand side it and notice it's not a function either because if it's it fails the vertical line test I'm cutting through two values of the relation here every time I cut through like this so back to what is a function back we learned a long time ago it's not a function but that's ok it doesn't mean it's not important circles are one of the most important shapes in all of nature I mean really and I mean that seriously I mean you get calculus you're using circles all the time but it's not a function that's okay so if you give a trick question on test is if there's a circle of function no it's not a function but it's an extremely important relation which is what we would call the  equation now this I went from a circle centered at the origin with a radius of 4 and we figured out what the equation of the circle must be so we can generalize this is why the equation 
,,of a circle looks like this but what if the circle is not centered at 0 0 let's quickly do that if you can understand that which I know that all of you can then the 
,,the next one is not hard at all let's shift let's shift this circle to units right and three units down so what we want to do is go through the whole exercise again 
,,but with the circle in a slightly different location and we want to show that the thing that you get out of it is actually this business we want to show that that describes a circle that's shifted anywhere other than origin all right so we're going to draw a XY plane so we can always have a picture I always recommend that so here is our XY plane like this now we're saying basically that the center of this circle is two units to the right and three units down so here's two units to the right one two three units down that means the center of the circle is here so we say the center is sorry I can't spell Center we say the center is at two comma negative three right and we say the radius is the same as the radius before we're not changing anything we're saying the radius is still four everything is the same but we're 
,,just shifting the thing here so how do we draw sorry that R equals R we're saying R is equal to four same as before we're just shifting a thing so how do we draw this well if the radius is 4 it's 1 2 3 4 and then 1 2 3 4 we're gonna put a little tick mark there and then 1 2 3 4 we'll put a little tick mark there and then 1 2 then 3 4 we'll put a little tick mark here so this should describe this circle something like this now before we go on I want you to agree with me that this circle is exactly the same as this one I mean I know I drew it maybe it's a little tick marks are a little different but you see the idea this one's centered at the origin radius of 4 all I'm doing is shifting it over two units three units down it was originally here over two units three units down but the circle is the same I mean the shape of the thing is the same it's just located in a different place so how would I go about doing that how would I go about figuring out what happens here well we do 
,,the same kind of thing we pick a point on the circle let's call it this one let's call a point P it's got X comma Y the center here is now at 2 comma negative 3 that's what the center of the circle is right but we also know that the radius 2 from this point to this point is 4 units same as before 4 units exactly the same thing so we're gonna do the exact same thing we're gonna figure out what is the distance using the distance formula from this point to this point and no matter where you are in the circle the distance must be four units that's what the circle is that that's what defines the shape of the points that we call the circle so if we're gonna 
,,put that distance formula in there we're gonna do the same thing it's x2 minus x1 quantity squared plus y2 minus y1 quantity squared this is the distance between any two points in the XY plane but this point has an x coordinate of we're just calling it X this thing has an x coordinate now of two so we have to subtract two this thing has a y-coordinate of Y but this thing has a y-coordinate of negative three so we do have to subtract it but you have a negative three here and that's squared and we take the square root we're saying this distance is what we have written down as the distance formula between those two points and we're saying that it's a radius of four units away so we have to put that the distance between them is equal to four now let's crank through this and see what we get we're gonna have X minus 2 quantity squared then we're gonna have what this becomes y plus 3 quantity squared we have a square root here and this is equal to 4 now the same exact sort of thing 
,,can happen in order to get rid of the square root we can just square both sides so to make it clear I'm gonna say X minus 2 quantity squared plus y plus 3 quantity squared I'm gonna take the square root I'm gonna have 4 now in order to make it clear what I'm saying is it's an equation I can do what I want to both sides I'm going to square the left-hand side so then I also have to square the right-hand side so immediately the square cancels with the square root right here and so what you're 
,,gonna have left over is just what's underneath X minus 2 quantity squared plus y plus 3 quantity squared is equal to 16 we're saying this is the equation of a circle that has a radius of 4 meaning you take the square root of the right-hand side but located somewhere other than zero comma zero two units to the right three units down let's go back and look and see if that makes sense Center is located H comma K radius and of course I can't spell radio sorry about that radius of our new shift 
,,the Y in the y-direction is what do we have what do we pull pull out of it two units to the right in the X direction and because there's a plus sign it's actually the opposite direction three units down that's exactly what we would predict from here it's two units to the right this builds a plus sign so it was three units down so we can then generalize exactly as we did before that really the equation of a circle is X minus H quantity squared plus y minus K quantity squared is equal to whatever the radius is because we just picked a circle here so this is the general circle right and all circles will look like that you put the equation in the equation 
,,of a circle down on your paper you put the center in you put the radius in you square the thing and that and that's what it is that's what the equation of a circle is it comes directly from the distance from formula knowing that the distance between the center to any point on the circle has to be the same for all the points and 
,,so we just crank through it so make sure you understand this you should understand the general idea of what a circle is you should understand where it comes from we're not done not by a long shot we need to sketch circles we need to do more complicated problems we need to do all kinds of things we have a lot to do but this is the most important part of it all follow me on to the next lesson we'll continue conquering conic sections and specifically circles
,,
Circle,vhuOfzDCw4c,hello welcome back the title of this lesson is called counting angles in degrees around the unit circle now truthfully this is the kind of lesson that i really wish 
,,i had when i first started learning this stuff because what's going to happen is right after you learn what an angle is very very quickly you're going to be learning something called the unit circle and the unit circle is a big circle in your textbook or wherever you're learning and it'll have all the angles written down and all of the lots of other information and it's kind of thrown at you and it's just very overwhelming at first so what we need to learn how to do is learn what the unit circle really means and learn how to use it and it is a process that takes a little while it's not something you can look at and just oh i got it unit circle if you think you got it right away you probably don't okay so what i want to do is teach you what the unit circle is kind of an introduction here and also teach you how to count count in degrees to go around the unit circle because we're going to start learning how to do all of these things in degrees because we all kind of have a good 
,,idea of what degrees are 360 degrees in a circle right but very soon we're going to switch over to radian measures radian is a different way to measure angles but in terms of pi basically and i don't want to get into the details of radians yet but it's much more difficult to understand because we don't have a good grasp of rating and measure in everyday life so what we're going to do is learn how to walk around this unit circle in degrees first and so you understand exactly what it means and then we'll do sine and cosine and tangent all of that and then we'll come back to the unit circle and we'll talk about radians this idea of counting what i call counting in degrees around the unit circle is not something you will see in most textbooks but i personally find it to be one of the most important things you can learn because it will impact every single problem that we do from here on out alright so we're going to be counting we're going to be learning how to count here and also i would say one last thing i want you to stick with me to the very end of this lesson because it's easy to think you got it but i really want you to practice with me because it will become so critical that you understand what we're doing here so in general this is what we have what we call a unit circle over here right it's got uh it's a circle obviously and you have a crisscross an x and y axis here the black lines and then we have all of these angled lines right so we're going to be getting very very up close and personal with this unit circle idea so we have to kind of start with the basics all right so what we want to do is talk about what does it mean to have a unit circle what is a unit circle anyway all it means it's a circle with a radius of one that's all it means and you might say well one what one centimeter one meter one yard one light year what okay honestly it doesn't matter what unit you're talking about you could consider this thing to be one you know foot if you want to one meter one centimeter it doesn't matter for now just consider it to be a radius of one so the distance from the center to the edge all of these distances here is just a length of one it doesn't matter what units you work in so if it's convenient for you you can think of it in terms of meters or whatever just think of it as a radius of one all right now this uh is a circle so it starts at zero degrees over here and in fact that's the very first thing we're going to write is that we have over here this black line right here is zero degrees this is the zero degree line right here now we said that positive angle measure goes around in this 
,,direction counterclockwise right and we said negative angle measure starts from the x-axis and it goes around like this so we can label a couple of additional things on this unit circle we can label this uh black line here is what i'm labeling here this is the x-axis and then this vertical black line right here we can call this 
,,i'm going to put it way up at the top y-axis because i'll probably put some other numbers and markings around the circle as we go so this is just an x y axis that's 
,,it this other stuff is stuck on top of it so here is positive x values negative x values here's positive y values here's negative y values it's just an x y axis all 
,,we have done is put a circle that has a radius of one that means the distance from here to here along the x-axis is just one one what okay call it one meter if you want to call it one foot call it one centimeter i don't care it doesn't matter but it's a distance of one this is the distance of one so in the y direction one unit this is negative uh negative one in the x direction and down here will be negative 1 in the y direction so it's just an xy grid now we obviously have a bunch of angled lines here right here and the way this is laid out is right here from here to here is 90 degree angle you all know that because it's a right angle so this is a 90 
,,degree angle and then from here to here's another 90 degrees and then from here down to here's another 90 degrees and then from here over here is another 90 degrees 
,,so if you know that from here to here is 90 degrees then this line is cutting this angle in half so this angle is 45 degrees and we're going to label all of this in 
,,a second but these diagonal lines like this this is 45 and then this one is a distance here from here to here of 45 the distance from here to here is 45 and the distance from here here's 45 and then so you have the the entire thing broken up into segments of 45 degrees and you might say okay well if this is 45 degrees what is this angle one right here well this is a 30 degree angle and then that would mean this is a 30 degree angle and then this is another 30 degrees and another 30 degrees 
,,and then the last thing is this angle here since you know this one is 30 and this one is is a 30 more degrees this is a 60 degree angle and then from here to here's 
,,another 60 degree angle so i haven't written anything down yet but i just want to talk you through it the unit circle in general is going to have all these diagonal 
,,lines and it gets overwhelming all you need to know is that these black lines are increments of 90 degrees and then you have 45 degree angles that are cutting those 
,,in half and then you also have 30 degree angles and 60 degree angles which are also marked on the unit circle all the way around now the 30 degree angles and the 60 
,,degree angles and the 45 degree angles and the 90 degree angles those are the very most important angles we learn in trigonometry i mean we can put any angle into a 
,,calculator and get a number and we'll be doing that but when we're doing a unit circle and doing things manually it's going to be 30 degrees 60 degrees 45 degrees 90 degrees or some other multiple that's why we go all the way around the unit circle like that so now we need to start with the easiest thing possible we want to count in degrees we want to count in 90 degree increments 90 degree increments what do i mean by that i want you to ignore the gray lines ignore these gray lines ignore 
,,these gray lines and ignore these gray lines focus on the black lines right if this is 0 degrees and if this one is a right angle to that then what must this angle measure be from here going up like this that means that this angle measure must be a 90 degrees so as you walk around the unit circle the angle measure from here to here is a 90 degree angle measure all right now if this is 90 degree angle then what must this angle be over here because this is another 90 degrees over here so if this is 0 and this is 90 and this is what's the next thing 90 plus 90 this thing has to be 180 degrees and that makes sense because if 0 is over here then all the way on the other side from geometry you know this has to be 180 degrees away now again if we have another 90 degree angle down like this what must this angle down at the bottom as measured from the x-axis all the way around what must this angle be well it would be this plus another 90 degrees so what this angle measure is is 270 degrees these are numbers that you're going to have to remember okay and if you take from 270 degrees and you walk another 90 degrees because this is another 90 degree angle 270 plus 90 what do you get you get to 360 degrees so notice the way i'm writing this the zero degree angle is written right above that's telling you that if 
,,i start at zero then that's where i start and as i walk around i do one entire circle of 360 degrees i get back to where i start from and the angle that i and end on is a positive 360 degrees that's exactly what you would expect when you go one circumference one circle around you always go 360 and you get back to where you started from all right so so far we just kind of wrote the angle measures down here on the on the unit circle but we didn't do any counting yet and that's really what i want to talk to you about i want to talk and you might say this is trivial okay that's cool but when we get to more complicated angles and radians this is going to be very very helpful so what we want to do is count by 90 degrees and what i mean by that is i want to count in increments of 90 degrees count in increments of 90 degrees all right and what i mean by that is this angle measure from here to here this is a 90 degree angle so think about the 90 degree angle as being a quantity of something it's a slice of this circle i want to count around that circle in chunks of 90 degrees in increments of 90 degrees in units of 90 degrees i want you to think 
,,of this 90 degree wedge of a circle as a thing it's an object it's a solid pie shaped wedge and we're going to now count by increments of 90 degrees so this is a 90 
,,degree increment and we're going to count around the unit circle so let's say what happens if we start at 0 then the first angle we have is 0 but then we go and increment by 1 times 90 degrees okay 1 times 90 degrees and we're counting by 90 degree increments so if we increment again then we'll increment another time so it'll be 2 times 90 degrees to get to the next location so again this is zero this is one chunk of 90 degrees this is two chunks of 90 degrees this is three chunks of 90 degrees and this is four chunks of 90 degrees the numbers are all here but i don't want you to think of those numbers now i want you to think about this being an increment of 90 another increment of 90 another increment of 90 another increment of 90. i can keep going and saying here's one increment two increments three increments four increments of 90. five increments of 96 increments of 97 and eight increments of 90. and i can keep going and going 10 11 12 and 13 increments of 90 degrees so what will i get one increment of 90 2 increments of 90 3 increments of 90 i'm going to drop the degree symbol 4 increments of 90 and so on this is four increments of 
,,90 degrees and what would come next i mean obviously we can continue this game let me go down to the next line we would have five increments of 90 and then six increments of 90 and then i'm gonna go all the way around seven increments of 90 and then eight increments of 90. i'm counting by chunks of only 90 degrees you might say 
,,why is he doing this okay of course we know this yes it's because when we get to radians it's going to be so helpful to count in chunks of radian measure right so then what happens if we if we count by 90s what do we get then we know that this corresponds to zero this corresponds to 90. this corresponds to 180 because 2 times 90 is 180 this corresponds to 270 this corresponds 4 times 9 is 36 so 360 and i'm going to keep on going 5 times 9 this is going to correspond to 450 this 6 times 90 is going to correspond to 540 degrees and then this is going to correspond to 630 degrees and then this is going to correspond to 720 degrees all right so i put my little degree symbols here to try to keep it organized okay so why am i doing all this stuff it's because when you first hit the unit circle a lot of students try to memorize things i try to memorize how many degrees it is if i go here and there and all that you don't ever have to do that okay what you have to do is recognize that you can count by certain increments of 90. if you want to know what this angle measure n is down here just say one chunk of 90 two chunks of 90. three chunks of 90. okay 3 times 90 that's 270. four chunks of 90 is 360. notice that that's what we said here right but then we can go to 450 and 540. how do we know that these are the angle measures well that's because if this was four times 90 this is five 90s and then six 90s and then seven 90s and then eight nineties eight times nine is 72 so this is this 360 degrees if you go around again 360 plus 360 720 degrees okay now if you were to take a look at these larger numbers you might not recognize these larger angle measures but if you take the 450 and if you subtract off 360 from that let's see if i can do it 360 then what you're going to get is 90 degrees if you go down here and you subtract off 360 because you're taking a big number minus 360. then what you're going to get is 90. i'm sorry not 90. you're going to get 180. 180. if you take this guy and subtract off 360 then what you're going to get is 270. and if you take this guy and subtract off 360 what you're going to get is 360. so what i'm trying to say is these really large angle measures if you don't know exactly where there are in the unit circle like if i look at 630 degrees i don't know off top of my head where is it is it over here is it i don't know so just take those large numbers back off one revolution of the circle and then you have 270 and then you immediately know it's here so really 630 degrees means it goes all the way around the unit circle but then all the way another three more chunks of 90 degrees to get down here to 270. so one way that you could look at that is to say this is one chunk two chunks three chunks four chunks five chunks six chunks seven chunks eight chunks and so on all the way around to wherever you're trying to be all right now the same process works with negative angles i'm not going to write all of the multiplications on the board for negative angles but if you start here you know that positive angles go this way and you know that negative angles go this way so this angle measure down here of course we know it's 270 as measured in the positive direction but this angle measure here is also equivalently negative 90 degrees right 
,,and then negative 180 and then negative 270 and then negative 360. so all of these angle measures that have positive angle measures they also have equivalent negative angle measures as well so what i'm saying is this angle measure of 270 as measured from the positive axis is exactly the same thing as negative 90 degrees because 
,,you're going down by negative 90. one chunk of 90 in the negative direction two chunks of 90 in the negative direction would be negative 180 this would be negative 270. so negative 270 degrees is exactly the same thing as positive 90. uh negative 180 is exactly the same as positive 180 and so instead of memorizing all these things you need to learn to count it's literally like learning third grade math again second grade math when you learn to count we have to learn accounting degrees all right so i think we've exhausted counting in 90 degree chunks we're not going to do probably quite as much talking for the next ones but now that we have the idea we 
,,can certainly talk intelligently about what we're going to do next so let me pick uh try to pick a different color and let's figure out what this angle is we just talked about it if this is 90 then what's this this is 45 degrees so if this is 45 degrees it's going to be right here that would be the 45 degree angle measure so now instead of counting by 90s let's count in chunks of 45 degrees so what i want to do over here is i want to say we're going to count by chunks of 45 degree measure that's what we're going to do all right so what do we have here this pie wedge this chunk right here forget about this line this doesn't exist just this chunk from here to here this whole segment here this is a 45 degree object so one chunk of 45 is right here and then 145 is here and then two chunks of 45 is here that would be here three chunks of 45 would be here four chunks of 45 is here five chunks of 45 6 45s 7 45s 8 45's i can keep going 9 45 10 45 11 45 12 45 13 45 14 45 15 45 16 45 i can keep going forever all right but let's write down a few things let's say we count by 45 we're gonna start with zero and then we're going to have one chunk of 45 and then we're gonna have two chunks of 45 and then three 45s and then four 45s and then five 45s and then six whoops six 45s and then seven forty fives and then eight forty fives all right so let's go around that far what do these correspond to all right so then this is going to correspond to zero this is one times 45 is 45 degrees what is 2 times 45 it's 90 degrees what is 3 times 45 it's going to be 135 degrees let me space things out to try to speed to kind of make them correspond a little better 4 times 45 is going to be 180 degrees 5 times 45 is 225 degrees 6 times 45 270 and then we're going to have 7 times 45 is 3 15. and then 8 times 45 and you multiply that out you actually get 360 degrees now you see these angle measures these are the angle measures that exist on the unit circle now of course i could just i could just write them down and say hey remember them but that's no fun so what we have is this is 45 and this is 2 times 45 which is 90. all right so actually 
,,i think what i'm going to do is i'm going to erase this in red and we're going to try to keep everything in the same color so here we have a 45 degree increment one 
,,chunk of 45 two chunks of 45 was 90. three chunks of 45 we just figured out was 135 so this angle measure which is 45 from here is 135 but then 4 chunks of 45 when you multiply that out comes out again to 180 then 5 chunks of 45 this comes out to 225 and then 6 chunks of 45 is going to come out to 270 and then 7 chunks of 45 is 
,,going to come out to 315 degrees and then eight chunks of 45 is going to come out to 360. grab a calculator 1 times 45 2 times 45 3 times 45 that's what you're going to get now in a similar way i can go in the negative direction this angle measure is measured as 315 in the positive direction 315 degrees now but this angle measure this location is exactly the same as negative 45 degrees negative 45 degrees is the same thing as positive 315. negative 90 degrees is the same exact thing as this and negative 135 degrees measured from here negative 135 is the same as positive 225. all right so you see the symmetry of things so a lot of students are like well should i count positive should i count negative how do i do it what you really need to know is that these diagonals here that are on the diagonals those are just increments of 45 degrees and if you forget that 315 is over here just remember you're going to have to remember some of these numbers you know this is 270 45 more is going to be here here 45 more is 360 and so on and then of course i can go up i went this was 8 times 45 then 9 and 10 and 11 times 45 12 times 45 and so on i can go 
,,all the way around and do that so i can measure my angles like this all right so now we have counted by 45 degree chunks and we've counted by 90 degree chunks now i 
,,want to spend a few minutes talking about counting by 30 degree chunks and then we'll talk about 60 degree chunks so on this unit circle this angle measure we already said is a 30 degree angle measure from the axis so this is a 30 degree chunk so in your mind you need to remember that this is a 30 degree chunk so this angle measure is the same as this angle measure which is the same as this angle measure and is the same as this angle measure so these are all chunks of 30 degrees as you go around right so you could say this is 30 degrees and then another chunk of 30 degrees would be 30 plus 30 is 60 degrees and then another chunk of 30 degrees would be 
,,90 degrees and then you can continue walking around but instead of doing it doing it on the unit circle over there let's go over here and say we're going to count by 30 degree chunks we're going to count by 33 chunks so we're going to have 1 or 0 and then 1 times 30 and then 2 times 30. and then 3 times 30 and then 4 times 30 and then 5 times 30 and then 6 times 30 right now we have to keep actually no we're fine there so six times three um yeah actually let's go down here let's go down and say seven times thirty eight times thirty whoops nine times thirty i know this is a little boring but it's going to pay out payoff 10 times 30 11 times 30 and 12 times 30. all right what do these correspond to in terms of angle measure you just do the multiplication so what this is going to correspond to is 0 this is going to correspond to 30. this is going to be 60. this is going to be 3 times 3 is 90. 4 times 3 is 120. 5 times 3 is 150 6 times 3 is 180. i'm going to put my little degree 
,,symbols here like this all right 7 times 3 is 210 8 times 3 is 24 9 times 3 is 27 10 times 3 is 300 11 times 3 is 330 and then here you have 12 times 3 is 36 so 360. you see what's going on here we're basically calculating the degree measures as we walk around all right so all of these correspond so here you have 0 then you have 30 60 90 the next one after that is 120 degrees so this is another 30 degree chunk which comes out to 120 degrees and then here you skip over this because this is another 30 degree chunk and it comes out to 150 degrees and this is another 30 degree chunk so you add 30 you get 180. then this is another 30 degree chunk and you get 210 and then this is another 30 degree chunk right and then you end up with 240s checking myself here 240 just add 30 to this and then add 30 to get this you get 270. add 30 to this you get 300 and then add 30 to get this and you get 330. add 30 to this and you get 360. so you see you can count by 45 degree chunks and get all 
,,the way back to 360. you can count by 90 degree chunks and get all the way back around the 360. you can count by 30 degree chunks you have more chunks but you're still going to count all the way back around the 360 and the same thing happens in the negative direction this angle is a positive 330 degrees as measured from the positive direction but that's exactly the same thing as a negative 30 degree angle this is exactly the same as a negative 60 degree angle and this is a negative 90 degree angle so count by negative 30 negative 60 negative 90 negative 90 we already said is the same as positive 270. so we have now labeled essentially everything on the unit circle but notice we never counted by 60s so i want to spend a second and i want to count by 60 degree chunks and actually the work is already done for us so let's just go ahead and say we start with zero one times chunk of 60 two chunks of 60 3 chunks of 60 then we have four chunks of 60 then we have five chunks of 60 and then we have six chunks of 60. what do these correspond to you might have guessed this corresponds to 0 degrees 60 degrees 2 times 6 is 12 so 120 degrees 3 times 6 
,,18. so 180 degrees 4 times 6 24 so 240 degrees 5 times 6 30. so 300 degrees and then 6 times 6 36 so 360 degrees so you see when we count by 60 degree chunks we get 
,,0 60 120 180 and so on now think about it in terms of 60 degree chunks forget about the 30 degree line forget about the 45 degree line this is a chunk of 60 degrees 
,,this is a 60 degree chunk another chunk when you add it to this is going to be this chunk it's you're going to land over here so you're counting by 60 60 then you land over here uh this is 60 then you land over here on 120. another 60 degree chunk is down here you land on 180. so that's the numbers we're getting 0 60 120 180. you have 0 then 60 then 120 then 180. what's another 60 degree chunk it's going to be down here at 240. that's what we get right here what's another 60 degree chunk here it's going to be sweeping through here to 300 and then the 360. 300 then to 360. so again counting by 60 60 then 120 then 180. then 240 then 300 then 360. and i can continue on incrementing i stopped at 6 times 60 but this would be 7 times 60 and then 8 times 60 and then 9 times 60. this was 6 times 60. this is 7 times 60. this is 8 times 60 this is 9 times 60 and then i can keep going around and the negative angles is the same thing this is a negative angle measure of 60 degrees so this is negative 60 right here negative 60 is exactly the same thing as positive 300 and over here this would be negative 120 is exactly the same thing as positive 240. 
,,so why am i doing all of this i mean really all of it is just multiplication i mean nothing we've done is more than arithmetic and and multiplication why am i taking the time because when we ditch the degree measures which we're going to do pretty soon you'll no longer have the comfort of the experience of knowing oh that's about 90 degrees oh that's about 270 degrees because we don't have a good numbers in our mind when it comes to radian measure which is coming very soon so in radian measure it's going to be critical that you count around the unit circle in the proper increments of the radian measure to figure out what angle you're on so i'm showing 
,,you that by counting by 30s counting by 60s counting by 45s counting by 90s you can land on any part of this unit circle in the positive direction or in the negative direction and figure out what quadrant you're in and where you're at because later on when we learn about sine and cosine it's critical for you to know what quadrant you're in it's extremely important to know that i'm somewhere over here in this quadrant at 315 degrees or that i'm over here in this quadrant at 210 and that's 30 degrees from from the x-axis over here it's important for you to know where you're at and how many degrees you are away from the different axes so we're going to solve some problems in the next lesson on on counting around the unit circle and getting a lot more practice with it for now i want you to kind of watch this a couple 
,,of times and make sure you understand what i'm saying and then also try to commit to memory these numbers around the outside it sometimes gets confusing and you sometimes forget but try to remember i know we can all remember the first quadrant but in the second quadrant 120 135 150 180 210 that these are the important numbers in degrees because it's going to be numbers that we'll be using over and over and over again follow me on to the next lesson once you understand the concept here and then we're going to crack the crack the very important topic of what is the actual meaning of sine and cosine forget about equations what is the meaning of it we want to understand what it is so that we can calculate things and understand what we're doing so follow me on the next lesson and we will conquer that right now
,,
Circle,UHRAgWxgVug,okay now we're going to talk about the area of the circle we've talked about the circumference which is how far around you go the area is just like the area of the triangles and the other objects we've talked about so far it's how much paint would it take so to speak to paint the circle how much surface area does it have so in order to figure that out here's the circle and what we're trying to do and let's say this circle has a radius of are okay just like before well what we're trying to actually calculate is how much surface area does it actually have okay and that's a very useful thing to be able to calculate and so the area of a circle is simply PI times R squared okay so you see PI comes up everywhere it's just a nice number and it's very important to circles into other areas of math pi times the radius times the radius again radius squared that is going to be the area so as an example okay as an example you have a circle and the radius is 2 centimeters okay 2 centimeters then the area is equal to PI R squared which is equal to 3.14 that's PI R is 2 so it's 2 squared 2 times 2 is 4 4 times 3.14 so the area is equal to 4 times 3.14 is 12 0.56 and I'm dealing with centimeters and I'm dealing with area so it's centimeters squared because units of area always have square terms so PI R squared ok and we'll do one final example here and we'll say we have a circle with a diameter of 10 feet well the area of a circle is PI R squared okay but I'm not given a radius here I'm given the diameter but we've already said this is super easy to calculate the radius is just equal to the diameter divided by 2 because the radius goes from the center to the edge the diameter goes the whole way so if you take the diameter and / - you're going to get the radius so the radius is 10 / - that's just five 
,,feet okay so then using that number down in here the area is pi times five squared putting the 5 in here 5 squared equals 3.14 5 times 5 gives me 25 and so then the 
,,area is 3.14 times 25 which is 78 2.5 feet squared because we're dealing with feet when we're dealing with area so we have to have a square so it's PI R squared in all cases we had to calculate the radius given the diameter and that was the only real trick to this problem then take that plug it back in and go from there so here 
,,is a good introduction to circles a good introduction of the circular figures circumference and area of the circles

Circle,A99trDp_uK4,hi and welcome to the section of the geometry tutor where we're going to talk about circles and circular figures in fact this is the first part of the course where we've actually started to talk about circles at all and we're actually going to focus on the circumference of a circle which I know you've heard that term before and 
,,also the area of a circle it's not going to be very hard so let's just jump right into it well first let's do what I always like to do and let's just draw a picture 
,,because pictures can really make things clear so there's a circle okay all right now here's a line that goes all the way through the center of the circle it goes through the very center point of the circle and it goes all the way from one side to the other okay that meant line has a very special name this this distance from here to here has a very special name and it's called d okay which means diameter okay so it's a term you're learning here this is a diameter of the circle all it means is it's just the distance okay that goes through the center of the circle from one side to the other it's called the diameter now the distance just from the middle of the circle to the edge has a very special name we label it are and that's called the radius of the circle now these are two you know if you haven't been exposed to 
,,this stuff before these two words even by themselves can make things seem kind of complicated or hard but this is stuff that's simple for anyone to understand you take a circle and you cut it exactly in half now notice we didn't cut it here okay we didn't cut it up here it had to go exactly through the center of the circle then 
,,that distance here is called a diameter and the half of that distance is called the radius because the radius only goes from the middle to the edge and the diameter 
,,goes from edge to edge so from there you can see that the radius is just one half of the diameter one half of the damage ER so let's talk about something very very important we're going to talk about the circumference of a circle okay on the circle circumference of a circle okay the circumference very simply is basically like the perimeter when we talked about the perimeter of a square we said okay if we walk around the edge of the square all the way around how far would we have walked okay circumference is perimeter that's exactly what it is it's just it applies only to circles they pick the different word to use you could say the perimeter of the circle but nobody does everyone uses the term circumference circumference means if I start out at one point now walk all the way around here and a potato and I figure out exactly how far I've walked the distance I've walked is called the circumference just like the distance was called the perimeter whom we're talking about squares 
,,and rectangles and other stuff so the circumference of any circle okay is equal to and I'm going to explain this something called pi times the diameter of this circle now forget about what PI is for a minute we'll talk about that but it's some something called pi times the diameter that's why the diameter is so incredibly important now because the radius is one half the diameter you can also say that the circumference is equal to is equal to two times pi times R so these are two different ways of saying the same thing pi times D or two PI R because look at to ours are here and are here two times r is equal to the diameter so because it's pi times D if 
,,you just take d out and you replace it by two times are then you get this other formula 2 PI R sometimes you use this one depending on what you have maybe you have the diameter in your problem and you have that number on your figure and you can use this number here sometimes you only have the radius and you use this one here but in any case if you're given the radius R just multiplying by 2 that gives you the diameter so it's the same thing okay

Circle,nFnNurQh0IQ,hi guys in this next video I'm going to introduce you to a couple of circle parents so these are the standards talked about in the video today the first one is a triangle in a semicircle so whenever you see a triangle in half a circle so this is the diameter here for angle that touches the circumference here is always 90 degrees so you just need to remember that the second one is this one here so you've got a line coordinate tangent so this is just a straight line but just skims it just touches the circle here in one place and this hopefully you know this one already this is the radius whenever you see tangents and the radius they always make an angle 
,,of 90 degrees with each other you've got two angles of 90 degrees that you need to remember in those two different situations so let's the motion passes so you can see in the first one again we've got a triangle in semicircle this is the diameter passing through the center of the circle which means this angle here is 90 degrees 
,,this one so we also have to remind ourselves how many degrees there are in a triangle in a triangle we have 180 degrees so this one is 20 this one is 90 so so far we've got 110 degrees so if you work out the missing angle you just need to subtract that from 180 so when you subtract 100 cents from one hundred bases you get 70 degrees so that is the answer to the first order okay so otherwise is 70 degrees and if they asked for an explanation how did you know that was 70 while we use two different rules you would say we know this angle is 90 degrees because there's a triangle in a semicircle and also we use the rule that in a triangle the angles add up to 180 it means so if you ask to explain how you work how you would need to use those to rule in your explanation as well as the calculations which are useful too so 
,,in the second question I can see there's a tangent in this one and here is the radius so from the center of the circle to the circumference which means we have another angle there this one which is 90 degree view so the same as before in a triangle all the degrees add up to 180 so so far I've got the 19-year plus the circle over here which leaves me with a hundred and twenty but we need to find this one down here so subtract that answer from 180 to work out the missing angle so that is the 
,,value of x is sixty degrees okay and just like in the last one here if you're asked to dig blowing thinly with me to explain the angle that the tangent and the radius make with each other is a wave 90 degrees and angles in a triangle add up to 180 so then I have a couple of easy examples I'm going to have a got some harder ones 
,,just now you so in this next example here I'm using triangle in a semi-circle again you can see there's a triangle in half circle this is the diameter which means this angle at the top is 90 degrees now we need to use algebra and we need to form an equation in order to work out the value of x in this question we know that in a triangle all the angles add up to 180 degrees so we can use this fact to write down an equation if I add together all of these three angles of X plus 90 plus 2x I know that if I add those three together it should give me 180 degrees now we're going to simplify this and then solve the equation here at 1x and I'm adding 2x here so 
,,that gives me 3x and then still got plus 90 and 180 to build over on the right recognize so remember when you're solving linear equations you need to reverse all of 
,,the operations around X until X by itself so I'm going to start by subtracting 90 and remember to do the same thing on both sides of the equation on the next run sorry that just goes to 0 and I'm left with 3x and on the right hand side I'm left with 90 degrees so the last step is to remove that to me so I need to divide by 3 remember to do the same thing on both sides of the equation so speed divided by 3 B leaves me with 1 X and on the right hand side 90 divided by 3 is 30 degrees so I've 
,,solved that equation and I found the values of this angle here so this one up here is 30 and if they ask you to work out what it's underneath as well well it's just 
,,- lots of it so - not the 30 which is 60 degrees now on to the last example down here so if you do this one over here the tangent and the Radian except I can see two tangents in this diagram one here and another one here this is the radius and so is it which means we've got two angles in this shape here that are useful to 90 degrees so this one and this one now I consider for a quadrilateral here remember these diagrams aren't the scale you can't use a protractor to measure this angle and you can see really that this doesn't look like 130 degrees just by looking at it so we just have to use the fact that in a four-sided shape all the angles add up to 360 degrees so if you don't know that I suggest you just try and remember that so so far if I add those angles together we've got 130 plus 90 plus 90 which is 180 so 
,,"if I add those together so far I've got 310 degrees which means the remaining angle must be 50 because if you subtract 310,000 60 if you knew is 50 degrees so there "
,,are just a couple of simple theorem there are lots more to learn but there's two just to get you started

,,the operations around X until X by itself so I'm going to start by subtracting 90 and remember to do the same thing on both sides of the equation on the next run sorry that just goes to 0 and I'm left with 3x and on the right hand side I'm left with 90 degrees so the last step is to remove that to me so I need to divide by 3 remember to do the same thing on both sides of the equation so speed divided by 3 B leaves me with 1 X and on the right hand side 90 divided by 3 is 30 degrees so I've 
,,solved that equation and I found the values of this angle here so this one up here is 30 and if they ask you to work out what it's underneath as well well it's just 
,,- lots of it so - not the 30 which is 60 degrees now on to the last example down here so if you do this one over here the tangent and the Radian except I can see two tangents in this diagram one here and another one here this is the radius and so is it which means we've got two angles in this shape here that are useful to 90 degrees so this one and this one now I consider for a quadrilateral here remember these diagrams aren't the scale you can't use a protractor to measure this angle and you can see really that this doesn't look like 130 degrees just by looking at it so we just have to use the fact that in a four-sided shape all the angles add up to 360 degrees so if you don't know that I suggest you just try and remember that so so far if I add those angles together we've got 130 plus 90 plus 90 which is 180 so 
,,"if I add those together so far I've got 310 degrees which means the remaining angle must be 50 because if you subtract 310,000 60 if you knew is 50 degrees so there "
,,are just a couple of simple theorem there are lots more to learn but there's two just to get you started

,,okay so today I'm going to show you how to find the area and perimeter of semicircles and culture circles so here we have a semicircle and here we have a quarter of 
,,a circle so first of all I'm going to show you how to find the area of a semicircle so here is our semicircle and as we can see we have a full circle over here on the right okay so a semicircle is just half of the circle now we know that the area of a circle is equal to PI times R squared so this here is for the area of a circle now we know from the pictures that this full circle when we divide it in two we get two semicircles one here and one here so we're also going to do the same to our 
,,equation so we're going to have pi times R squared and then we're going to divide our answer by two and this will give us the area of a semicircle so it's quite simple we just need to find the area of the circle and then just divide it by two to get the area of a semicircle next we need to work out their perimeter of a semicircle now we already know to work out this LR circle we to work out the perimeter of a circle we do pi times diameter now a semicircle as we said is half of a circle so 
,,now for this semicircle what if we did pi times diameter and / - well look carefully well that's going to give us so we've said that pi times diameter gives us the circumference or perimeter of this circle if we now divide that by two we'll be working out half of the perimeter of this circle so we would in fact be getting half of this which is just that there now that's not exactly what we want because in the semi circle we have another length over here so we then always need to add this extra length in over here to complete our semi circle so we need to plus another D because if we have our circle if we cut a semicircle we can see that this here is the diameter because it goes from one side of the circle to the other side and through the center of the circle so what we could say is that this length here from here to here is the diameter okay so the formula to work out the perimeter of a semi circle is pi times D with n divided by 2 and then add D again so here's an example here so first of all let's work out the area of this so if this was a full circle then this distance here on the diagram it tells us is 8 centimeters so 8 equals the 
,,diameter therefore 4 equals the radius now to work out the area of this circle we're gonna have to do pi times 4 squared but that's going to give us the area of a circle but we want the area of the semicircle so we need to buy this all by two and that's going to give us twenty five point one three two so you can round that to twenty five point one this is going to be centimeters squared because it's an area next to work out the circumference or perimeter so if this was a full circle again we know the diameter is equal to eight centimeters and we know the diameter of a full circle which is pi times D now remembering what I told you before if we just divide this by two then we're going to get half a circle like this but we still need to add in the original diameter over here so we need to plus another D on there so 
,,now if you plug in our numbers we have pi times the diameter which is 8 divided by 2 of course and then we're going to add the extra 8 at the bottom and if we tap it into a calculator that comes out as 20 point five six six so you can just round up to 20 point six and this time let's not forget it's just centimeters because it's just a length right next I'm going to show you how to work out the area of a quarter of a circle so now as we can see from this circle over here four quarters make 
,,one whole circle now we know to find the area of a circle we do PI times R squared so that is again the area of a circle now we also know that four quarters equals one circle so to find the area of a quarter of a circle we do pi times R squared and then divide our answer by 4 and that will give us the area of a whoops a quarter 
,,circle now to work out the perimeter of the quarter of a circle as we said last time the quarter of a circle if we have four of them we make a whole circle now the circle there's a conference of a full circle is pi time d ok now what we need to realize is if we did pi times D and divide it by 1/4 what are we actually working out here so imagine we had a full circle we've done pi times D which gives us the total length round the outside of the circle so we have our circumference now we've now divided it by 4 so what does it mean well what we have now found is this area over here so if we got rid of this because we divided it by 4 and we've actually only found this part of the circumference now we still need to find this extra bit and this next should be here to make the quarter of the circle so we need to add these two lengths onto it these two lengths here if we have a look are just the radius so we're going to add one radius and another radius so plus 2r now we also know that the radius times by 2 must equal the diameter so therefore finally we can say PI times D divided by 4 and then add the diameter to it so that there is how you work out the perimeter of the quarter of a circle okay so if we had this quarter circle here and we had to work out the area to start with let's quickly imagine we had a full circle we're now going to split this into 4 so we can see that we have this part of the circle over here now we can also see that five centimetres is this length over here from there to there so we can see that five is actually equal to the radius of this if it was a circle therefore ten is equal to the diameter so first of all let's start by working out the area so area now the area of a full circle is pi times R squared but we want to find the quarter of a circle so we just divide it by four so if you plug some numbers in we're going to have pi times five squared and we're going to divide that by four and if you put that into a calculator so come out has nineteen point six and our area is with centimeters squared so that's our area calculated over here we now need to work out the perimeter so now we know that the perimeter or circumference of a full circle is pi times D now we have a quarter of a circle so we need to divide this by a four and if you remember as I said if we're finding a full circle and dividing it by four we've just found this here from here to here so we found a quarter we still need to add on those extra two lengths there and we know that that is five this is also five now we know that five is our radius as we saw from this diagram here and 10 is our diameter from this here so we have our formula which is pi times the diameter divide it by four to give us the blue pot and then we have to add two radiuses to it to are we also know that two times R equals just the diameter so now if we just put the numbers in we're going to have pi times 10 divided by 4 and we're going to plus 10 to that and then that will give us an answer of seventeen point nine and they our units are going to be centimeters squared so this here is our final answer okay so now I hope you know how to find the area and perimeter of semi circles and quarter circles here are a couple of questions that you can try so find the area and perimeter of each of these shapes so a semicircle and a quarter circle and I'll put the answers up in the next video which will be title as it is down here thank you good luck see you soon

Circle,Ctq49JKZvLQ,the circling lines our planet rotates on its axis and revolves around the Sun on its orbit axis it is an imaginary line on which the Earth rotates or spins it meets 
,,the Earth's surface at the North Pole and South Pole one complete rotation takes 24 hours or one day one complete revolution takes 365 and one-fourth days or one year hence we are able to calculate time days and years as the earth does both the actions that is rotation and revolution simultaneously we experience the different seasons to look at the globe of the earth here we can see the axis the equator and lots of other lines these are imaginary lines and they aren't visible on the Earth's surface latitudes latitudes are lines that run parallel to the equator and to each other they are called parallels of latitude their size keeps getting smaller as we go north or south of the Equator the last lines at the top and the bottom are like tiny dots these are the poles the equator is the longest and most important latitude as the earth is round the equator is also called the Great Circle it is an imaginary line drawn halfway between the North Pole and the South Pole it divides the earth into two halves the part not of the equator is the northern hemisphere and the part south of the equator is the southern hemisphere the measurement of degrees of latitude begins from the equator all the latitudes are given numbers the N indicates it is north of the Equator and s indicates it is south of the equator the equator is at 0 degree these are some other important latitudes they are Tropic of Cancer is at 23 and 1/2 degrees not Tropic of Capricorn is at 23 and 1/2 degrees south both these are named after the constellation of stars Arctic Circle is at 66 and 1/2 degrees not Antarctic Circle is at 66 and 1/2 degrees south North Pole is at

Operations of While number,P6Q9bcmJYys,if I start counting where do I start usually I start from one so I start from one and then I go to two three four five when I keep doing this how far can I go I can 
,,keep going I can keep going forever so if I can keep doing this then what am I doing here I start from one and then I count forever if I do that then I get a family 
,,of numbers so I'm getting this big family here all the numbers that I will meet when I do this I'll first meet one then meet to then meet three I'll keep going then 
,,all these numbers that I meet belong to a family that I call natural numbers natural numbers so how do you meet all the members of this family called natural numbers you have to start from one and count forever start from one one and that's important here you're starting from one and then you're counting forever count forever now what if you say you know what I don't want to start from one but I'm gonna start from zero I'm gonna start from zero and then I'm gonna do the same thing that you 
,,did that is count one two three four forever so one two three four five keep going so this also keeps going and then how far do you go you go forever you will never 
,,reach a point where you say oh I can't count one more number at least I've reached my last number there is no last number so you'll keep going now if you do this what is the main difference or the only difference it's that you have included zero you've started from zero when you do that and you meet all these members of this family this family is called whole numbers whole numbers so if you have to meet all the members of this family then what must you do you have to start from zero start from zero and then do the same thing count forever count forever so you can notice that the difference between this family called natural numbers and this family called whole numbers is not very big the main difference or the only difference is that this family four whole numbers you start from zero confer ever four natural numbers you start from one and count forever another way to say the same thing is that natural numbers is that family of numbers that contains all the numbers from 1 and 
,,that keeps going forever and ever the family of whole numbers is all those numbers that are contained in natural numbers all the numbers are natural which is here plus an extra number one extra number you add to this family of natural numbers you get whole numbers and what is that number that's zero

Operations of While number,oY4EgyY12-s,hello children today i'm here to teach you chapter 3 in your textbook that's mathematical operations on whole numbers so in this lesson we are doing all four operations addition subtraction multiplication and division look at this one hindu arabic digits used in mathematics what are those so you already know that 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and 9. those are the digits in hindu arabic number system the four operations used in mathematics what are the basic operations addition subtraction multiplication and division so we look at all four operations in this lesson with whole numbers look at this one addition of numbers how you get 6 0 plus 6 1 plus 5 6 or 2 plus 4 you get 6 3 plus 3 you get 6. so what are the ways you get 8 1 plus 7 2 plus 6 3 with 5 and 4 with 4. look at this one how you get 10 1 with 9 2 with 8 3 with seven four with six and five with five these are the possibilities you can get ten with one digit numbers twelve what are the ways we can get twelve one with 11 here you 
,,have to use 2 digit number there 12 you can write 2 with 10 3 with 9 4 with 8 5 with 7 and 6 with 6. so you can create numbers using addition of two numbers now we are adding zeros to any digit what happens zero plus zero zero one plus zero you get one two plus zero two three plus zero is three four plus zero is four and 5 plus 
,,0 is 5 so that means when you add 0 to any number you get the same original number give the answers to the addition of the following numbers just adding two digits two plus seven you get nine three plus four seven six plus four you get ten zero plus 7 you get this same answer 7 8 plus 4 12 9 plus 5 you get 14 3 plus 8. eleven nine plus eight seventeen six plus six you get twelve nine plus seven sixteen nine plus one ten four plus four you get eight find the value of twenty three plus forty 
,,how we do that so we'll write 23 in tens place you get 20 and one's place you get 3. how you get 45 tens place 40 and once play is 5. so when you add ones place values what you get 3 plus 5 you get 8. tens place values you get sixty so what's the answer now sixty in tens place and eight in one's place sixty and eight you get sixty eight find the value of this one so we'll write in tens place values and ones place values 46 40 and 6 33 how can you write 30 and 3 30 tens and three once so what's the total here you get 70 6 plus 3 9. so what's the final answer 70 and 9 79 now do this one so 52 plus 36 so you need 52 and 36 so tens place you get 50 here this one is 2 what about 36 30 and 6 now add it 2 plus 6 becomes 8 50 plus 30 you get 80. so 80 tens and ones plays eight what's the total 88 now do the same way 73 plus 24 73 is the number 24 is the other number write in tens this becomes 70 and once you get 3 24 20 and 4 when you add it together what happens 3 plus 4 you get 7. 
,,70 plus 20 you get 90. now 90 and 7 you get 97 find the value of 38 plus 47 38 47 so tens place what are the values 30 and here 40. what are the units place values eight and seven now what happens when you are adding the numbers 8 and 7 you get 15 now 2 digit numbers you are getting so i'll write 8 plus 7 15 but i'm not going to write 15 there because that's two digit numbers so i'll write 5 here and take 10 to this side so 40 plus 30 70 70 plus 10 you get 80. now 80 and 5 you get 85 so it 
,,should go to tens place when you get two digit numbers and cross out 8 and 7. so that's what we do when you are adding numbers and when you get two digit numbers when you are adding ones place you take it to the tens place now similarly do this one 56 and 29 how many tens are there 50 here 20. how many ones are there 6 and 9 now 9 plus 6 what is nine plus six fifteen fifteen is two digit number so fifteen you can write ten and five so we write five here and what we do we can cross out these two and take 10 to this side now 50 plus 20 70 70 plus 10 you get 80 80 and 5 85 so that's the final answer do this one now 66 plus 25 66 25 66 write in tens 60 and 1 6 25 you can write 20 and 5 now add it 6 plus 5 6 plus 5 is 11 11 is two digit number you can't write it so we can write 10 and 1. so i can cross out these two and i can put 1 here and take 10 to tens place 60 plus 20. 80 80 plus 10 90. so the answer is 91 90 and 1. now we'll do the same way without creating a table this is ones and this is tens place four plus three seven three plus two five so that's easy you can straight away at three plus two five five plus four nine here six plus two eight three plus two five now here eight plus five eight plus five thirteen so what we do we write three here take one to the tens place four plus three seven seven plus one you get eight here also eight plus four eight plus four is twelve so you put two here take one to the tenths place six plus one seven seven plus two 9 this one 9 and 9 18 put 8 and take 1 to the tenths place 4 plus 3 7 7 plus 1 8 this one 7 plus 2 9 you get 1 digit number 6 plus 2 8 here 8 plus 9 8 and 8 sixteen sixteen plus one seventeen one you take it to the tens place three plus one four four plus one five nine plus seven you get sixteen write six and take one to the tens place eight plus one you get nine find the value of 237 plus 356 now you get hundreds place as well so how can you write 237 200 30 tens and seven years 356 356. now what happens seven plus six you get 13. 13 is two digit number you can't write you have to split ten l three so you write cross out these two and you write three here 
,,and take ten to this side 50 plus 30 80 80 plus 10 90. then hundreds when you add you get 500 so what's the answer 509 so that's the final answer this number 378 and 256. so split into hundreds place that's 300. here 200 is there then 70 that's tens place and 8 is the units place value ones place 256 50 here and 6 here now add these to 8 plus 6 14 14 you can't write so split it to 10 and 4. so you can write 4 here take 10. now 7 t plus 10 80 80 plus 50 130 now you get three digit number 130 you can split it to 100 plus 30. now you can keep 30 here and take 100 to this side now what's the final answer 300 plus 200 500 and 600 there so what's the final answer 634 now without writing in a table you can do same way this is units place of ones place tens place and hundreds place so eight plus six eight plus six fourteen you write the first ones place digit and take one to the tenths place one plus seven eight eight plus five 13 and take 1 to the hundredths place 1 plus 3 4 4 plus 
,,2 6. so you can do the same question this way so this is easy when you write ones place tens place and hundreds place you can take one to the next level at the numbers given below 5 plus 3 8 4 plus 2 6 3 plus 2 5 here 3 plus 4 7 7 plus 1 8 4 plus two six this one zero plus seven you get seven zero plus four four six plus two eight so it's easy you are not getting two digit numbers three plus two five six plus zero six four plus three seven here also you get one digit numbers five plus 4 9 0 plus 1 1 7 plus 2 9 here 3 plus 5 8 7 plus 1 8 4 plus 3 you get 7. now you are getting 1000 plays as well 3452 so similarly you do the column wise addition 2 plus 4 6 5 plus 3 8 4 plus 0 4 3 plus 1 4 3 plus 2 here 5 8 plus 1 9 0 plus 5 5 4 plus 2 6. these are all one digit numbers so straight away you can write down 4 plus 5 nine eight plus zero eight zero plus seven seven three plus three you get six this one four plus two six four plus three seven four plus five nine and three plus two five so you get five thousand nine hundred and seventy six this one three plus three six nine plus zero nine four plus zero four three plus two five here also one digit numbers three plus six nine six plus zero six four plus two six and two plus ones you get three find the value of 3765 and 2887 now we can write into thousands place hundreds place tenths place and ones place so you get three thousand here then seven hundred sixty and five this number two thousand eight hundred and eighty seven two thousand here eight hundred eighty 7. now try to add these to 7 plus 5 12. so you can't write 12 there so what you do you take the last digit and take 10 to this side 60 plus 10 70 70 plus 80 150 so 150 you can't write you write 50 there and take 100 to this side then 100 plus 700 800 800 plus 800 1600 now you need hundreds place so you write 600 there and take thousand to this side then thousand plus three thousand four thousand four thousand plus two thousand you get six thousand so what's the final answer six thousand six hundred fifty two when you look at the last row you can say six thousand six hundred and fifty two is the final answer now similarly you can do the same question this way 7 plus 5 you write down the last digit that's 12 2 there and you take 1 to the other side 8 plus 6 14 fourteen plus 
,,one fifteen take one to this side one plus seven eight eight plus eight sixteen take one so this is 1 8 plus 8 16 you take 1 to this side then 3 plus 1 4 4 plus 2 6 
,,6 652 we'll check it 6652 so you can easily do this way you write in a column and add it when it's more than one digit you take it to the next level now add these numbers thousand th means thousand hundreds tens units eight plus seven 15 we take 1 there 3 plus 1 4 4 plus 8 12. we write 2 here and take 1 to the next level 7 plus 
,,1 8 eight plus five thirteen take one here two plus one three three plus one is four this one four plus seven eleven take one to this side 8 plus 1 9 9 plus 3 12 and 1 you can take it to this level 9 plus 1 10 10 plus 5 15 and you take 1 to thousands place three plus one four four plus one five what about this one five plus seven you get twelve one you can take it to the next level seven plus one eight eight plus eight sixteen one take it to this level then nine plus one ten ten plus three 
,,thirteen take one to this side so 4 plus 2 6 6 plus 1 you get 7 this one 4 plus 8 12 take 1 to this level 9 plus 1 10 10 plus 3 13 take 1 8 plus 1 9 9 plus 3 12 then take 1 here 5 plus 1 six six plus three nine again addition seven plus six thirteen take one here seven plus six thirteen thirteen plus one fourteen and take one there eight plus six fourteen fourteen plus one fifteen so you put five and take one to the next level four plus one five five plus one six again this one now you get 
,,nine plus six nine plus six fifteen so you write five there take one to the next level seven plus 1 8 8 plus 2 10 and take 1 there 5 plus 1 6 6 plus 7 13 and take 1 
,,to the next level 5 plus 1 6 6 plus 1 you get 7. now we'll do addition without writing you needs tens and thousand place just add it all the digits in column wise 5 
,,plus 5 10 you take 1 to the next level 7 plus 1 8 8 plus 4 12 and take one two plus one three three plus one you get four add these two numbers four plus eight twelve take one to the next level seven plus seven fourteen fourteen plus one fifteen and take one to the next level three plus one four four plus one five this one seven plus eight fifteen take one to the next level nine plus one ten ten plus four four t take one there so six plus one seven seven plus five you get 12. here 8 plus 4 
,,12 take 1 there 7 plus 1 8 8 plus 5 13 take 1 here one plus one two two plus one three three plus two get five this one seven plus four eleven take one here eight and eight 16 1 there 10 plus 5 15 1 here then 2 plus 2 get 4 this one 5 plus three eight eight plus seven fifteen take one there ten plus one eleven one there so four 
,,plus two six fill in the blanks now answer is given so how you get 6 here 5 plus 1 how you get 0 you need to add 6 to 4 6 plus 4 tens then 1 is already there so you 
,,are getting 4 so that means this should be 0 this number you need 8 6 is already there so you need to add 2 6 plus 2 8. then how you get 10 here 7 plus 3. so 1 is already there so 3 is therefore to get 6 you need to add 2 this one you just added 9 plus 4 13 we take 1 there are 7 plus 1 8 plus 1 9 3 plus 2 5 here also just addition 5 plus 4 9 7 plus 2 9 1 plus 1 2 5 3 8. this one answer is given other way around you need 9 from 8 you have to add 1 to that so here you get 14 four you get four six is there so what's the number you need to add you need to add eight eight plus six fourteen so one already there now seven and 1 8 how do you get 3 8 plus 5 13 
,,so 1 already there so 2 plus 1 3 you need to add 2 to get 5 here you got 7 as the answer so how you get 7 from 8 you have to add 9 so that's 17. so you are taking 1 
,,there so 6 plus 1 7 is already there how you get 1 7 plus 4 11 1 is already there so we take 1 to this side 7 plus one eight how you get nine from eight you have to 
,,add one there then you already have one there how you get five you need to add four look at this question there are 2172 boys and 3247 girls in school a cool a 2170 
,,boys 3247 girls in school b there are three thousand 142 boys and 2173 girls complete the table given below so you need total so how many boys are there we can add these two 4 7 plus 4 11 take 1 you get 3 here 3 plus 2 5. now add these two 7 plus 3 10 take 1 8 plus 4 12 2 there and take 1 2 plus 1 3 plus 1 4 and 3 plus 2 5. now 
,,we'll take the total this way can you add this way units place separately 7 plus 2 9 4 plus 7 11 take one to the next level 2 plus 1 3 3 plus 1 4 and 3 plus 2 5. try to add this way if you can't you write as a column and at two plus three five four plus seven eleven put one and take one to the hundredths place so one plus one 2 
,,2 plus 1 3 and 3 plus 2 5. now we'll add it and see 9 plus 5 14 1 remaining so you get 3 7 10 10 734 now i want to check whether this is correct this way as well this total should be the same as this one so four plus zero four that's correct one plus two three three plus four seven that's okay last one five plus five ten so the 
,,final answer is correct in a factory 2748 employees turned up for the first shift 3249 employees turned up for the second shift find the total number of employees engaged so first shift how many employees 2748 second shift how many employees 3249 total means you need to add these two so find out the total 8 plus 9 17 and take 1 
,,4 plus 4 8 8 plus 1 9 7 plus 2 9 there 2 plus 3 five so all together 5997 employees are there look at this question 2379 mangoes are plucked from one tree 3068 mangoes were plucked from another tree find the total number of mangoes plucked first three that's 2379 from the second tree 3068 now total means addition add these two 8 plus 8 16 plus 1 7 1 taking to the this level 7 plus 7 14 1 there so you get 4 and 5 all together 5 447 mangoes are there look at this question 1765 cement stone blocks were transported in one tractor 2 348 similar cement stone blocks were transported in another tractor find the total number of civil blocks transported in the first structure so how many cement blocks transported 1765 in the second tractor 2348 now if you want the total that means take the addition of the two numbers add it together 8 plus 5 13 and take 1 7 plus 4 11. another one here 8 plus 3 eleven one there two plus one three three plus one you get four so all together four thousand one hundred and thirteen cement blocks transport this one 6349 bricks was transported in one lorry 4728 similar bricks were transported in the second larry find the total number of bricks transported so you have to first find this in the first lorry 6349 in the second lorry that's four thousand seven hundred and twenty eight to get the total you add it nine plus eight seventeen let's take one there four plus two six plus one 7 and 3 plus 7 10 take 1 there 6 plus 4 10 10 plus 1 11 11 07 bricks transported here now we look at subtraction so how we subtract simple digits 7 minus 3 get 4. nine minus five that's also four eight minus two six nine minus four you get five six minus six you get zero eight minus seven that's one nine minus three six four minus two you get two four minus three you get one eight minus six you get two eight minus five that's three six minus three again three find the value now we'll try to subtract column wise you write in a column and subtract separately units place tens place and hundreds place eight minus three you get five so we put five there then 7 minus 4 you get 3 so this is 3 then 3 minus 1 you get 2. so you put 2 here now look at this one 9 minus 5 you get 4 5 minus 2 that's 3 and 6 minus 2 you get 4. now we'll do this one 8 minus 5. so you start from the right side 
,,units place or ones place 8 minus 5 you get 3. right here 5 minus 2 3 and 9 minus 3 you get 6. so 633 this one 4 minus 2 you get 2 6 minus 2 that's 4 and 8 minus 3 you get 5. so you write 5 here 542. find the value so same thing now you get thousands place as well eight minus zero here this should be zero eight minus zero is eight five minus four you get one two minus zero is two and seven minus three you get 4. this one 9 minus 6 you get 3. 5 minus 2 3 again 8 minus 1 seven and seven minus three you get four four thousand seven hundred thirty three seven minus six one two minus zero that's two four minus one you get three and nine minus two that's seven in this question three minus one that's two five minus two you get three here eight minus six two there nine minus two that's seven population of a town is 6759 out of which 2354 are children find the remaining portion total amount is given number of children given how we find out the remaining part you subtract here not addition so total population is 6759 2354 children are there so the remaining population you subtract the two values nine minus four get five five minus five zero seven 
,,minus three that's four six minus two you get four four thousand four hundred five remaining population are there in 2015 7249 motor vehicles were manufactured in a 
,,factory in 2014 it was 5200 and how many more were manufactured in 2015 than in 2014 that means the number manufactured in 2015 is higher than that so we can subtract the two values so in 2015 that was 7249 in 2014 that's 5228 to get the number of extra vehicles in 2015 we can subtract the two 9 minus 8 that's 1. 4 minus 2 2 2 minus 2 0 7 minus 5 that's 2. so 2021 extra vehicles in 2015. last year there are worth 7 645 vehicles in a garage out of which 4232 are motor cars find the number of other vehicles again here total number is there and number of motor cars there so you are asking to find other vehicles here also you have to subtract number of vehicles 7645 and number of cars that's four thousand two hundred and thirty two so subtract these two five minus two three four minus three what six minus two four and seven minus four that's three now find the value so we can write in columns units place tens place hundreds place and now thousand plays also there so same method as before when you subtract here six minus three you get three so you write 3 here 7 minus 5 2. 13 minus 4. now you can't subtract 4 from 3. so what you do you take 1 from there so when you take 1 this becomes 13. so we write 10 here so 13 minus 4 you get 9. so we write 9 here now what's 5 minus 3 now that's not 5 why we already 
,,we have taken 1 from there so this becomes 4 now 4 minus 3 you get 1. so 4 cannot be deducted from 3 1 is taken from the thousands place it is 13. now this one subtract these two 7 minus 2 you get 5. then can you subtract 7 from 5 we can't we take 1 from there so when you take 1 this becomes 15 15 minus 7 you get 8 here now what's the number here we took 1 there this becomes 2 but can we subtract 6 from 2 you can't so you are taking 1 from there so when you take 1 that becomes 12 12 minus 6 is 6. now you took one from this side now this is not six this is five five minus two you get three so this is three now subtract these two three minus eight you can't you are taking one from here that becomes ten thirteen minus 8 what's 13 minus 8 that's 5. now this number is 4 now not 5. now 14 you have to take 1 so that becomes 14 14 minus 7 that's 7 here now again this is not 4 this is 3 now then take another one to this side that means 13 13 minus 6 you get 7 so 7 here now again this 
,,is not 7 this is 6 6 minus 2 you get 4. so this becomes 4. so we'll subtract now we can't subtract 8 from 3 so we are taking 1 from there so this becomes 13 so we are taking 10 10 plus 3 30 13 minus 8 what's 13 minus 8 5. now what's this number not 4 this becomes 3 so you need 1 from there so 13 minus 7 that's 6. then here this 
,,becomes 0 not 1. you can't subtract so take 1 from there 10 minus 4 that's 6. this becomes 6 now 6 minus 5 1. now when you add these two you need to get this answer 
,,just check 8 plus 5 13 and 14 1 remaining 11 and 7 so it's correct now subtract this one y minus 2 straight away you can write 3 but you can't subtract 7 from 6 take 1 so 1 and 6 means 16 16 minus 7 that's 9 then this becomes 3. so 13 take 1 from here 13 minus 7 6. here this becomes 2 2 minus 1 you get 1. 4 minus 7 you can't so 
,,you are taking 1 from this side so 14 minus 7 is 7. this becomes 5 now but we need 1 from there 15 minus 8 what is 15 minus 8 you get 7. so now what's this number this becomes 6. you can't subtract 9 so you take 1 from here 16 minus 9 you get 7 then this becomes 4 4 minus 2 you get 2. now do the subtraction here you can't subtract 9 from 7 you take 1. so this becomes 10. 17 minus 9 what is 17 minus 9 8 then this is 1 now we have already taken 1. can we subtract 5 from 1 you can't so take 1 
,,from here so 11 minus 5 that's 6. this becomes 2 now still you can't subtract so you need 1 from here 12 minus 6 you get 6. now this becomes 3 3 minus 1 that's 2. subtract the following numbers now you don't need to write it down so we can just subtract column wise without writing circles can we take out 9 from 7 no so you are taking 1 17 minus 9 8. now this becomes 11 11 minus 6 so you are taking 1 from here as well 11 minus 6 you get 5 now this is 2 2 minus 2 0 4 minus 1 3. this one you can't subtract 9 from 7 you take 1. 17 minus 9 8. this becomes 5 then 5 minus 5 0 you can't subtract 6 from 2 so take 1 from here 12 minus 6 that's 6. now what's the 
,,number here it becomes 6 6 minus 2. 4. do the same thing you can't subtract 8 from 3 you take 1 from here 13 minus 8. what's 13 minus 8 that's 5. so what's the number here now that's 1. so still you can't subtract you have to take 1 from this side 11 minus 6 that's 5. now what's a number here eight eight minus six you get two four minus one you get three look at this one a farmer took 3458 coconuts to the market and sold 2729 of them how much was left so how many coconuts brought 3458 and he sold 2729. so what's the number left that means we need to subtract the two numbers we'll subtract we can't subtract nine from eight take one eighteen minus nine is nine now this becomes 4 4 minus 2 you get 2 then again you can't subtract 7 from 4 you take 1 from here 14 minus 7 you get 7 now what's the remaining one here it becomes 2 2 minus 2 that's 0. so all together 729 coconuts left look at this question there were 4123 children in a mixed school out of which 2728 were boys find out 
,,the number of girls so this is also subtraction total number is given that's 4123 and how many boys 2 700 boys so the girls are the remaining parts so you subtract can we subtract 8 from 3 you can't you take 1. 13 minus 8 that's 5. so this becomes 1 now still you can't subtract you are taking 1 from here 11 minus 2 that's so what about this number now 10 10 minus 7 that's 3. so you are taking 1 from there so what's the number here so 3 minus 2 you get 1. now we'll look at multiplication so 
,,look at this question there are six buttons on a shirt find number of buttons in five shirts so what we can do you can add it so this is first shirt second third fourth fifth so we are adding all buttons to get the total number of buttons 6 plus 6 12 12 6 18 18 plus 6 24 24 plus 6 30. so you can get the same answer by multiple using multiplication number of buttons in five shirts means one shirt six and multiply by five because five shirts are there so you get 6 times 5 30. so multiplication is a sequence of addition but it takes time to add it's easy to know how to multiply because you can get the answer at once look at this question there are 8 pencils in a box how many are there in 6 boxes so number of pencils in a box is eight how many boxes are there six boxes all together number of pencils in six boxes you multiply eight by six eight times 6 is 48 48 pencils are there there are seven days in a week find the number of days in 11 weeks so number of days in a week is 7 we 
,,know that number of days in 11 weeks you multiply this by 11. so what you get 11 times 7 is 77 days are there the multiplication of any number by 10 100 or 1000 can 
,,be found by adding one two or three zeros to the number if you're multiplying by 10 means you add one zero if you're multiplying by hundred means you put two zeros multiplied by thousand means you put three zeros ten you put one zero and multiply by one seven times one seven one zero and multiply by nine nine times one nine put 
,,zero and one times 63 you get 63 put 0 75 times 1 75 1 0 there you get 280 one no multiplied by a hundred you put two zeros and thirty seven times one thirty seven put two zeros eight times one eight now thousand thousand means put three zeros and nine times one nine here also three zeros thirty one times one is thirty one three zero is there and one times 431 that's 431 here multiplied by 100 means put two zeros three times 318 times 1 380. multiply by 10 means put 1 0 and multiply by 1 51 put here on 0 and multiplied by 1 430 so it's easy when you get multiples of 10. fill in the blanks so first one done for you 2 times 7 is 14. so 14 you can write other way around 7 times 2 as well 8 times 3 24 24 you can write other way around 3 times 8 as well how you get 54 from 6 6 times 9 so that is same as 9 times now this one nine times five nine times five you get forty-five forty-five is same as five times nine eight times six is forty-eight so 48 you can write 6 times 8 as well so for multiplication order is not important you can multiply 2 into 3 or 3 into 2 you get the same answer now we'll multiply in a column like this this is units place tens place and hundreds place so we need to multiply 87 by 6. so we write 87 and 6 here with multiplication sign so what we do first 6 times 7 6 times 7 is 42 two 
,,digit numbers are there so what we do we write 2 here and take 4 to the next level then you multiply these two 6 times 8 6 times 8 48 and this 48 and this 4 you have to add 48 plus 4 is 52 now you can put 2 here and take 5 to the next level so what's the answer 522 to the multiplication 95 times 7 7 times 5 35 so we can't write 
,,both so you put 3 and take 3 to the next level 7 times 9 63 and 63 and this 3 you get 6 six so now you put six there and take six to the next level so what's the final answer 665 807 into 6. now you need thousands plays as well so what's the first step 6 times 6 36 so you write 6 here and take 3 to the tenths place 7 times 6 42 
,,42 plus 3 you have to add it together so what's 42 plus 3 forty five now we write five here so take four to this level six times eight forty eight and 48 and this 4 
,,when you add it you get 50 2. so you write 2 here take 5 to the next level that's thousands place so this is five multiply following numbers so we can do straight away without writing separately so we'll try to do 6 times 8 48 i'll write 8 and take 4 to the next level 6 times 4 24 24 plus 4 28 and 2 you take it to this level 6 times 3 18 18 plus 2 20. do this multiplication like that 7 times 9 63 take 6 7 times 7 49 49 and 6 you have to add it you get 55 so you write 5 here take 5 to the next level 6 times 7 42 42 plus 5 47 this one 7 times 9 63. you take 6 here 7 times 1 6 7 times 1 7 7 plus 6 thirteen take one there seven times seven forty nine forty nine plus one fifty this one eight times seven fifty six you take 5 there but 8 times 0 is 0 0 plus 5 becomes 5 8 times 8 64. now try this one nine times seven sixty three six you take it to the next level then nine times one nine nine plus six fifteen take one then so 9 times 8 72 72 plus 1 73 again check it nine times seven sixty three and nine times one nine plus six fifteen and this is seventy two plus one seventy three this one five times eight forty 4 you take it to the next level 5 
,,times 7 35 35 plus 4 39 and you take 3 to the next one 5 times 0 0 plus 3 that's 3. then 5 times 6 30 30 390. this one this is done for you so just check it 53 times 34 now 2 digit numbers so then you can split 34 as 30 and 4. so you can write 30 and 4. so what we do you multiply by 4 and multiply by 30 and add it together so multiply by 4 4 times 8 32 3 remaining 4 times 5 4 times 5 you get 20 20 plus 3 23 and 2 remaining so you can write 2 there now multiply by 30 means put a 0 and multiply by 3. so put 0 3 times 8 24 4 you take 2 there so 3 times 5 15 15 plus 2 17. so you write 17 and now add these 2 7 9 and 1. so what we do first multiply by 4 and 
,,multiply by 30 so instead of multiplying by 30 put a 0 and multiply by 3. now we'll do the same thing so we'll write down 43 how can you write 43 3 and 40. you can do other way round as well 40 and 3 doesn't matter so we'll multiply by 3 3 times 7 21 2 remaining 3 times 6 18 plus 2 20. so if you can't multiply like that so you can do this way 3 times 7 21. 6 times 3 18 plus 2 20. so 201 so you get 201 there so multiplying by 40 means put a 0 and multiply by 4. so what you do 67 multiplied by 4 4 times 7 28 2 remaining 4 times 6 24 plus 2 26 so 2 680 is the answer here 2 680 now add these two 1 8 8 2 so 2 81 now 348 multiplied by 36 so what are the steps you can multiply by 6 and 30. so if you can't do it once what you do you do separately we'll take 345 multiplied by 6 6 times 5 30 3 remaining 6 times 4 24 24 plus 3 27 2 remaining 6 times 3 18 18 plus 2 20. so 2 thousand seventy there so i can write two thousand seventy now multiply by thirty put a 0 and multiply by 3. so i can write 345 multiplied by 3. 3 times 5 50 1 remaining 3 times 4 12 plus 1 30 1 remaining 3 times 3 9 plus 1 10. so you get 10 35 and put a 0. so what's the answer when you multiply by 30 you get 10 350 when you add it you get the final answer so when you add it you need to get twelve thousand four hundred and twenty so we'll add it zero twelve one remaining so this becomes four two one twelve thousand four hundred and twenty will multiply now so i'll do first 4 and then 20. so how you do at once so look at carefully 4 times 8 32 3 remaining 4 times 4 16 16 plus 3 ninety one you take it there four times three twelve twelve plus one thirteen it's not hard if you can do that at once so how you multiply by 20 you put a 0 there and multiply by 2 2 times 8 60 one remaining two times four eight eight plus ones nine then two times three six again put a 0 multiplied by 2 2 times 8 16 1 remaining 2 times 4 8 plus 1 9 and 2 times 3 6 now add these two you get 2 here 15 so 1 there 10 plus 3 13 1 take it to this side 7 plus 1 8 now multiply by 33 so what's the method multiply by 3 and then 30. have you multiplied by 3 3 times 4 12 1 remaining three 
,,times one three plus one four three times five fifteen now multiply by thirty put a zero and multiply by three 3 times 4 12 1 remaining 3 times 1 3 plus 1 4 3 times 
,,5 15. so can you see in this one you are multiplying by 3 so what you do same answer you are getting but with a 0 2 6 9 6 1 16 962 how you multiply by 37 7 30 multiplied by 7 7 times 3 21 2 remaining 7 times 7 49 49 plus 2 51 5 remaining 7 times 6 42 42 plus 5 47 if you can't do that at once make sure that you do separately and 
,,write down the answer then multiply by 30 means put a 0 and multiply by 3 3 times 3 9. 3 times 7 21 2 remaining 7 times 6 42 42 plus 2 44 now add these you get 10 and 1 there 8 and 1 9 here 4 and 4 8 and 4 48 901 now multiply by 64 however you multiply by 64 60 and 4 so 4 and 60. multiply by four four times two eight four times 
,,one four four times seven twenty eight multiply by sixty means put a zero and multiply by 6 6 times 2 12 1 remaining 6 times 1 6 plus 1 7 6 times 7 42 now at 8 6 8 plus 7 15 and 2 and 2 4 and 1 5 45 568 23 motorcycles can be packed into a lorry how many motorcycles can this lorry transport in 230 trips so that means you need to 
,,multiply so what's the number here lorry of motorcycle in one trip that that's 23 number of motorcycles in 230 trips that means 23 into 230 so what you do 213 to 23 
,,means you multiply 20 and 3 or 3 and 20 odd is not important so multiply by 20 means put a zero and multiply by two zero six three times zero zero three times three 
,,nine three times two six and you add it when you add it you get 5290 motorcycles in 230 trips a tractor can transport 3220 bricks how many bricks can be transported 
,,in nine trips so in one trip 3200 bricks in nine trips means you multiply this by nine so we'll do it here if you can't multiply this way it's better to write in a column and multiply nine times zero zero nine times two eighteen one remaining nine times two eighteen plus one nineteen one remaining nine times three twenty 27 27 plus 1 28 28 980 bricks are there there are 144 tablets in one bottle how many tablets can eight bottles hold so you need to multiply this by eight multiply separately 8 times 4 32 3 remaining 8 times 4 32 32 plus 3 35 again three remaining eight times one eight eight plus three eleven thousand one hundred and fifty two tablets in eight bottles price of one coconut is 48 rupees what is the price of seven such coconuts so what's the price of one coconut 48 rupees and seven coconuts means you 
,,multiply this by seven shall we multiply this way this is how we do seven times eight fifty-six you put five you put 6 and 5 remain 7 times 4 28 28 and this 5 you get thirty three so thirty three here so if you can't do that way you do better to do this way seven times eight fifty six five remaining seven times four twenty eight plus 5 you get 33. 336 rupees a small lorry can transport 78 cement bags how many cement bags can the lorry transport in 74 trips so what's the number of cement bags can transport in one trip 78. so there are 14 trip sauce here 74 trips i'll put 74 trips so what's the value of 78 times 70 78 times 74. so how do you do that 78 74 74 means 70 and 4. so how you multiply by 70 you put a 0 and multiply by 7 7 times 8 56 5 remaining 7 times 7 49 49 plus 5 54 4 times 8 32 3 remaining 4 times 7 28 plus 3 28 plus 3 31 now add it 2 7 7 5 5 5772 cement bags are there in 74 trips the daily wage of laborer is 1560 rupees find the total wage is of 18 laborers so what's daily wage of one laborer thousand five hundred and sixty rupees so there are 18 laborers so you multiply that value into 18. so this is in rupees multiply 1560 multiplied by 18 that means 10 n 8. have you multiplied by ten put a zero and multiply by one six five one then multiply by eight eight times zero zero eight times 
,,six forty-eight four remaining 8 times 5 40 40 plus 4 44 4 remaining 8 times 1 8 8 plus 4 12 when you add it you get 6 plus 4 10 1 remaining that's 6 plus 2 8 and 2. so you get 28 000. 80 rupees fill in the blanks now answer is given and you need to fill in between so that's not easy 23 how you get 23 so you can write 3 and 20. 
,,that's how we multiply you split 3 and 20. so 20 means you put a 0 and multiply by 2. and here to get this answer multiplied by 3 so we need to this do 3 times 8 24 
,,2 remaining and you need to get 3 here so what should be the number 2 digit number 2 23 so what's the number 3 times so you better to do this way 23 minus 2 what's the answer you get 21 how you get 21 from 3 this should be 7. now check it 3 times 8 24 2 remaining 3 times 7 21 plus 2 23 so better to subtract this number first and then figure out the number now you have the number you can multiply by 20 put 0 and multiply by 2 2 times 8 16 1 remaining 2 times 7 14 plus 1 15. now see the addition is correct 5 plus 2 7 so that's correct so that should be 7 there this one you are getting 268 so two numbers are missing so 80 is this number and we don't know 
,,which number is that so how do you figure out that so here we need to find out both numbers how we get 8 here and 7 here what's the multiplication 7 times what you get the last digit 8 check it 7 times 7 49 7 times 5 no 7 times 4 you get 28 so that's what you have to do here 7 times 4 so this can be 4 so if this is 4 this becomes 4 here now check that value 4 times 7 28 2 remaining answer is 26 26 minus 2 you get 24. how do you get 24 from 4 4 times 6 so 4 times 6 24 plus 2 26 now that one 
,,is okay now how you multiply by 80 put a 0 and multiply by 8 8 times 7 56 5 remaining 8 times 6 48 48 plus 5 53 so you get 53 here now edit 8 6 and 6 12 1 remaining 
,,3 plus 2 5 plus 1 6 and here 5. so not easy so you have to figure out one value and then after you get the one value it's easy look at this one so 20 something there so that means 20 n we don't know this value so put a 0 here you get the answer here multiplied by 2. now how do you figure out this number how you get 9 9 times something is 5. 9 times 5 only 45 all the other numbers you are not getting 5 so that should be 5 there 9 times 5 45 that means here this is multiplied by 5 5 times 9 45 4 remaining and then it's 4 already there so that means when you subtract 4 there you are getting 160 164 minus 460 that means you are getting 0 there so what's the number to get a 0 there so you can put 0 there pi times 0 only you get 0. we'll check it out 5 times 0 0 and you get 4 there then 5 times 3 15. so that means not correct so you need to get not 0 10 so how you get 10 there so you can erase that so how you get 10 i can put 2 there 5 times 2 10. 10 plus 4 14. and put 4 and you can take 1 there 5 times 3 15 plus 1 you are getting 16 now so that's correct now we can multiply this answer by twenty so put a zero and multiply by two two times nine eighteen one remaining so two times two four four plus one five two times three six now add it you get five twelve one there six and six twelve one remaining you get here when you are writing the columns are like this this is with this this this and this is with this so here multiply by 2 again 2 times 9 18 1 remaining 2 times 2 4 plus 1 5 2 times 3 6. so when you are adding this is 5 8 plus 4 12 and then 12 here 1 remaining 7 plus 1 8 now we will look at division of numbers so look at this question sunil has 24 toffees and he distributed these are my six friends equally how many toffees does each friend receive so first 24 so what's the remainder after giving once 24 minus 6 you get 18. then second time when you get give another 6 18 minus 6 you get 10. third time 12 minus 6 you get 6 4 times 6 times 6 0. so that means how many time how many toffees you can give four toffees each so this one you can do it with division straight away so what we do total number of toffees is 24. there are six friends number of friends six so you divide 24 divide by six you get four toffees each four toffees for each fret so division is a sequence of repeated subtraction so we can see that without subtracting separately you can straight away divide so same question we can do 24 divide by 6 this way so we call this a simple division 24 6 you get 4 and the remainder is 0. so that means not remaining anything so just 4 you are getting this is called long division you divide this way so 6 times 4 24 and the remainder we call that's 0. so same way you can divide so either this simple division or long division look at this question if sunil has 
,,27 toffees after giving six of his friends equally how much is left so what's the remainder so if you are doing simple division what's 27 6 times 4 24 and 3 remaining so we can write the remaining part like this or if you are doing long division divide by 6 6 times 4 24 when you subtract you get 3 so this is called the remainder and this is the answer so he can give sunil can give four toffees each for six friends and remaining three toffees now when you are dividing by multiples of ten what happens you are just removing zeros if you are dividing by 10 you are removing 1 0 so you remove 1 0 the answer is 43 this answer divided by 10 means you are removing 1 0 answer is 60 this one remove 1 0 206 this one remove 1 0 170 when you are dividing by 100 you cross out two zeros divide by 100 that means 7 here remove this one 78 is the answer divide by 100 means remove two zeros that's 32. write the answer at once this is divided by ten one zero remove divide by hundred two zeros you remove divide by ten one zero remove divide by 10 1 0 you can remove divide by hundred two zeros you can remove divide by hundred two zeros divided by 10 means one 
,,zero you can remove divide by thousand means three zeros you can remove 785 divided by 5. so we'll do long division you write like this and divide by 5. 5 times 1 that's 5. so what's the remainder you get 2 now take the next digit 28 5 times 5 25 so when you subtract you get 3 here then take the next digit 35 5 times 7 35 so what's the remainder when you subtract you get 0 remainder so first 7 divide by 5 you get 1 and remainder 2 28 then divide by 5 you get 5 and remainder 3 then you do 35 35 divided by 5 you get 7 remainder 0. so the answer is 157 what's the remainder remainder is zero now we'll divide this one so what's the first step you can't divide 4 by 8 so you need 45 45 divided by 8 how many eights for 45 you get 8 times 540 so 5 so that's 5 45 that's 40 8 times 5 so what's the remainder remainder is 5 now take the next digit that's 56 how many 8s for 56 that's 7 8 times 7 56 and you get remainder 0. so what's the final answer answer is 57 and remainder 0 here nothing remaining look at this question if 987 biscuits are shared equally among 24 children how many biscuits does each child receive what is the remainder so that means 
,,you take 987 divide by equally divide by 24 how many 24's for 98 you need can we take four we can take four four times four sixteen one remaining four times two 8 8 
,,plus 1 9 now what's the remainder you get 2 so 7 is there so we will take the next digit for 27 how many 24's that's what what's the remainder now you get three remainder so number of biscuits for one child you can give 41 biscuits and number of remaining biscuits you get three it is decided to distribute 3068 kilograms of rice 
,,among 203 people who are destitute by floods how many kilograms of rice will each one receive what is the remain so what's the total 3068 and you have to divide this with 203 people so when you divide you can't divide 3 30 so you have to take the whole 306 so that's when you take 2 that's 400 something so that's 1 only 203. when you subtract these two you get 3 here and 103. now we need to find out for 138 how many 200 threes are there so what's the number if you put five you get less than 
,,this so this is 5. 5 times 3 15 5 times 2 10. so when you subtract you get 3 here and 2. so 23 remaining what's the answer then each receive 15 kilos so 15 times 203 you get something and what's the remainder 23 kilos remaining so you can't divide that in between 203 people so 23 kilos remaining in a 23 storey building each storey has an equal number of rooms if the building has 4991 rooms in all calculate the number of rooms in one store so what's the total number of rooms 4991 in each one there are 23. so there are 23 stories are there how you find out number of rooms in each story so you have to take 4991 divided by 23 23 times 2 you can do that so 
,,that's 46 subtract you get 39. for 39 that's 1 that's 23 remaining you get 16. 461 how many 23s 7 7 times 3 21 2 remaining 7 times 2 14 plus 2 16. so remainder is 0 
,,so that means how many rooms in each story there are 217 rooms this one in 36 boxes of pastel there is a total of 432 pastels how many pastels does each box contain 
,,so all together 432 so how many boxes are there 36. so how we find out number of pastels in each box you have to divide we'll use long division 36 times 1 is 36. when you subtract you get 7 for 72 how many 36 are there so you get 2. 2 times 6 12 and 2 times 3 6 plus 1 so so the remainder is 0. so number of pastas in each box that's 12. now we'll look at examples and exercises in your textbook example number one just add the two numbers so what we do we write in a column and add it seven plus three ten so one you take it to tens place eight plus two ten ten plus one eleven one you take it to hundredths place six plus one seven seven plus two nine this one eight plus six fourteen you take one to the next level five plus one six six plus two 8 9 plus 4 13 take 1 here 2 plus 1 3 3 plus 1 4 example number 3 add three numbers six seven six twelve twelve plus eight twenty take two seven plus two nine nine plus five fourteen and one consider in hundreds place four plus one five five 
,,plus three eight eight plus two ten and take one here one and one this becomes 2 in this one 7 plus 6 13 take 1 5 plus 1 6 6 plus 2 8 here and 1 there exercise 3.1 simplify the following all these are addition 5 plus 4 9 3 plus 2 5 9 plus two eleven take one six plus three nine seven plus five twelve take one here seven plus four eleven this one six plus two eight five plus two seven three plus one four five plus eight thirteen you take one here four and four eight four plus three seven eight plus seven fifteen take one ten plus nine nineteen take 1 there 6 plus 3 you get 9. this one add these two numbers 8 plus 9. 17 1 there 6 plus 2 8 plus 1 9 4 plus 7 11 this one add eight plus zero eight eight plus three eleven one you take there six plus four ten ten plus one eleven and take one two plus one three three plus 
,,one 4 9 plus 3 12 take 1 6 plus 8 14 take 1 there 8 plus 4 twelve and take one there so this becomes three this one six plus five eleven take one nine plus four 13 13 take 1 there so 10 you get and take 1 there so 2 plus 1 you get 3. now 3 numbers five plus nine fourteen fourteen plus one fifteen so one you need to take there eight plus seven fifteen plus one sixteen sixteen plus seven 23. so you take 2 to the next level 2 plus 3 5 5 plus 6 11 11 plus 1 12 here you get 9 plus 1 10 10 plus 7 17. take 1 there 10 and 1 11. another one here so you get 1 2 3. and 1 there simplify the following so you have given the addition this way so you write in a column and at you get 8 3 plus 2 5 43 plus 29 9 plus 3 12. 1 remaining so 5 plus 2 7 72 176 and 217 edit 6 plus 7 13 1 remaining 8 plus 1 9 and you get 3 here 352 and 189 
,,when you add it 9 plus two eleven one you take it to this level five plus one six six plus eight fourteen one take it to this level so you get four plus one five addition again so you write in a column and then at 7 plus 4 eleven take one nine plus five fourteen take one so nine plus one ten and take one there are two plus one three three plus one you get 4 395 and 1936 when you add it 5 plus 6 11 take 1. so 10 plus 3 13. take 1 there so 10 and take 1 there so what you get here 3 plus 1 4 4 plus 1 5 add these to 84 258 8 plus 4 12 take 1 there 9 nine plus five fourteen take one here two plus one three seven plus hundred ninety five seven plus 5 12 and 
,,1 you have to take it there 9 plus 1 10 and 1 take it here so 1 plus 1 2. some more addition 139 so 2875 so you have to write in a column 9 plus five fourteen one you take it there so ten plus one eleven one take it there eight plus one nine nine plus one ten so one here two plus one you get three this one three numbers thousand nine hundred eighty seven thirty six and hundred and seventy one all addition six plus one seven seven and seven fourteen one there so nine nine plus ten nineteen take one so ten plus one eleven take one there one and one you get two this one three numbers 657 eleven thousand three hundred and eighty nine and sixty four thousand seven 721 add all these numbers 10 10 plus 7 17. you take 1 here then 8 plus 2 10 ten plus six sixteen take one here six plus three nine nine plus one ten ten plus seven seventeen another one here four plus one five five plus one 6 and 6 plus 1 you get 7 76 767. there are 486 boys and 658 girls in a certain school how many students are there in total so you have to add number of boys 486 number of girls 658 total number you need to add 8 plus 6 40. let's take one there 9 plus five fourteen take one there six plus four ten ten plus one eleven thousand one hundred and forty four is the total number of students in that school question number four in january 1846 coconuts were plucked from the coconut trees in a certain estate and in march another thousand 1384 coconuts were plucked how many coconuts were plucked in total during the two months so january number of coconuts in january that's 1805 number of coconuts in march you get 1384 you need total number so add it 10 write down the answer 6 plus 4 10. you take 1 there 8 plus 4 12 12 1 13 take one there nine plus three twelve take one there one plus plus one plus one you get three three 
,,thousand two hundred and thirty coconuts all together the number of shoes manufactured by a certain company during the month january february and march were given how many shoes were manufactured in total so you can write number of shows in january so you get 1395 number of shows in february 1426 number of shoes in much 1737. so you can find out the total total number of shoes is addition of all three numbers so edit 6 plus 5 11 eleven plus seven eighteen and one you take it there ten plus 
,,two twelve twelve plus three fifteen and one you take it there four plus four eight 8 plus 7 15 take 1 there so you get 2 plus 1 3 3 plus 1 4 4 58 number of shoes all together nimal who is businessman received an income of 810 rupees on the first day an income of 985 on the second day and an income of 1130 on the third day what 
,,was his total income during the three days income first day what's the income eight hundred and ten rupees income second day nine hundred and income on the third day thousand one hundred thirty so what's the total total means addition you add these three numbers you get five nine nine plus three twelve one you take it up ten plus eight eighteen eighteen plus one nineteen and one there one and one becomes two so total is two thousand nine hundred and twenty five rupees question number seven 
,,if 974 milk bottles were collected at a certain collection center on monday and if 103 more milk bottles were collected on tuesday then on monday then how many bottles of milk were collected in total on the two days so number of bottles on monday that's 974 how we find out number of bottles on tuesday you need to do it separately 103 more than monday so 974 plus 103 you get 1077. now we can find our total number is just adding these two 7 plus 4 11 and 1 there 7 plus 7 14 plus 1 15 and 1 you take it up 1 plus 9 10 and 1 and 1 becomes 2 2051 bottles all together example number one simplify the following now you get subtraction so here 6 minus 1 becomes 
,,five seven minus four that's three it's easy you can subtract straight away four minus three you get one five minus two three three minus one two 2 231 this one 7 minus 2 5 5 minus 3 2 2 minus 1 is 1 4 minus 2 you get 2 there exercise 3.2 simplify the following just subtract 5 minus 3 you get 2 3 minus 2 1 8 minus 3 seven minus 
,,five two four minus one three five minus one four seven minus four three nine minus three six three minus two 1. this one you can't subtract 8 from 2. so you have to take 1 from there so 12 minus 8 becomes 4. so this becomes 6 6 minus 3 you get 3 what about this one take 1 from here 16 minus 9 so what is 16 minus 9 you get 7 then this becomes 6 6 minus 2 you get 4 and here what's the number here so this is 5 minus 1 you get what about this one take 1 from here 12 minus 5 that's 7. so this becomes 4. so 14 minus 7 is 7. this becomes 2 again 2 minus 1 is 1. so if you are not sure you can add and see 7 plus 5 12 and 14 plus 1 15 and you get this number when you add the other two look at this question you have to subtract 9 from 4 you can't do that you'd have to take 1 from there 14 minus 9 that's 5. so this becomes 0 now so take another one here 10 minus 5 is 5 this becomes 7 7 minus 3 you get 4 six minus three three and here you have to take one from here ten minus seven that's three so this becomes four four minus two two this one you can't subtract 5 from 2 so you take 1 from here so here you have to take 1 here and from there 1. so 12 minus 5 7 and here this becomes 9 now 9 minus 3 6 this becomes 5 5 minus 4 that's what so check it again 7 plus 5 12 and then 10 so that's correct this one can you subtract 4 from 0 no you have to take 1 from here 1 from there so 10 minus 4 this is 6. so this becomes now 9 9 minus 5 4. this becomes 6 6 minus 3 three here you need to subtract four from one you can't you take one from there eleven minus four that's seven so this becomes seven seven minus five that's two then four minus one is 
,,three seven minus two five can you subtract eight from one you can't you have to take one from here so we are taking one from there eleven minus eight three and here it becomes nine nine minus five four now this is one you can't subtract seven from one so you take one from here eleven minus seven that's four so this becomes three three minus one you get two this one you can't subtract six from 3 so you have to take 1 from there 13 minus 6 that's 7 this becomes 1 so take 1 from here and 1 from there so you get 11 11 minus 9 that's 2. now we can take this one as 9 9 minus 4 that's 5. so this is 2 minus 1 1 check it again when you add these two you are getting this one 6 plus 7 13 and 1 remaining 10 plus 2 12 1 remaining you get 10 and 1 remaining so you get 3023 when you add the other two numbers this one you can't 
,,subtract 8 from 0. so you have to take from here 1 here 1 here and then 1 there so 10 minus 8 10 minus 8 is 2. this becomes 9 now 9 minus 5 4 and here this is 9 again because you took 1 from there 9 minus 3 6 this becomes 5 5 minus 2 that's 3 add it and see 10 and when you take 1 10 again when you take 1 10 again 3 plus 2 5 plus 1 6 so you get this answer simplify the following now you have to subtract so you can write in a column now subtract can we subtract 7 from 2 no you can take 1 from there 12 minus 7 5 this becomes 7 now 7 minus 5 2 and 7 minus 2 you get 5. 524 minus 175 then you subtract what you get take 1 from here 14 minus 5 9 and this becomes 1 now you take 1 from here 11 minus 7 this becomes 4 4 minus 1 you get 3 631 subtract 58. so take one from here 11 11 minus 8 2. so this becomes 2. so you can't subtract 5 from 2 you take 1 there so 12 minus 5 that's 7. so this becomes 5. 246 minus 89. can you subtract 9 from 6 you can't so you take 1. 16 minus 9. that's 7. so this becomes 3 13 minus 8 that's 5 and this becomes 1. 3532 minus 785 you can't subtract 5 from 2 you take 1. 12 minus 5 that's 7. so this becomes 2 now 12 minus 8 that's 4 this is now 4 14 minus 7 is 7 this is 2. another one 4 000 minus 356 you can't subtract so you take 1 here 1 here and 1 10 minus 6 that's 4. this becomes nine nine minus five that's four this is also nine nine minus three is six and this becomes three so when you add it you are getting four thousand question number three if nimal who took 475 coconuts was able to sell 297 of them how many coconuts were remaining so remaining means this is subtraction so total number of coconuts that's 475 he sold 297 297 so the remaining number of coconuts you subtract so how we subtract you have to take 1 from here 15 minus 7 that's 8. this becomes 6 16 minus 9 that's seven so this is three now three minus two 178 coconuts are remaining question number four if there were 192 males in a gathering of 300 people how many females were there so total is there so you need to subtract the two numbers total given as 300 number of meals given as 192 when you subtract this number you get number of females so subtract you need to take 1 from here 1 from there 10 minus 2 8 this becomes 9 9 minus 9 0 and here 2 minus 1 1. question number five in a certain 
,,factory 1450 cars were manufactured in 2013 and 232 cars were manufactured in 2014. how many more cars were manufactured in 2014 than in 2013. this is also subtraction so you can first find out cars in 2014 so what's the number 2325 cars manufactured in 2015 that's 1450. so to find out how many cars more in 2014 you need to subtract the two values y minus 0 is 5. then you can't subtract 5 from 2. so you take 1. 12 minus 5 that's 7. this becomes 2 now take 1 12 minus 4 you get 8. so 1 minus 
,,1 that's 0. so all together 875 cars are extra in 2000 15 here not 15 what's the year given this is 13 2013 and 2014. so how many cars more in 2014 than 2013 that's 
,,875. question number six heishan received 325 from his father and 430 from his mother if he bought a pair of slippers for 149 and a book for 225 from this money how 
,,much money was left over so what's the total given by father and mother total money so you need to first add and get the total money from father 325 and from his mother 430 rupees that's the total five five and seven 755 rupees are there so he bought pair of slippers and a book so what's the total cost total cost for both book and the pair of slippers 149 and 225 so that's also you need to add 9 plus 5 40 1 remaining 5 plus 2 7 and 2 plus 1 3. now when you subtract these two you get the remaining money so money was left over so left over you can find out by subtracting he had 755 rupees and he spent 374 rupees for slippers and a book so when you subtract get 1 15 minus 7 is 8 and this is 6 6 minus 3 3. so the left over is 381 rupees so look at this one when the three groups of five are separated into groups of three we obtain five groups so three into five you get fifteen or you can split like this 5 into 3 groups that's also 50. so a multiplication table of the whole numbers from 0 to 9 is given below so you need to know the multiplication so here 0 times 0 now look at this one 5 times 3 here so you get 15. and again you get 15 that's three times five can you see this one if you take six six times two 12 2 times 6 or 6 times 2 you get 12. now when you look at the table you get all same number twice and here 10 10 so diagonally can you see a pattern 18 18 then 14 14 8 8 so this side and this side is the same exercise 3.3 obtain the following products using the 
,,multiplication table given above 3 times 4 so that means 3 into 4 that's 12. 7 times 3 7 times 3 21 8 times 0 8 times 0 you'll get 0. 9 times 6 that's this number 54 evaluate the following so we can use the multiplication table 42 times 3. so we can multiply like this so 3 times 2. so three times two six three times four three times four twelve so hundred twenty six this one 122 times four four times two that's eight four times two again eight four times one four then third one 78 times 7 7 times 8 what's 7 times 8 56 you put 6 there take 5 here 7 times 7 49 49 plus 5 you get 54. then part 4 you need 96 times 9 9 times 6 you get 54. 5 remaining 9 times 9 81 81 plus 5 8 6 so 864 evaluate 64 and 36 now two numbers how we find the multiplication 36 you can do 30 and 6 or 6 30 other way round also possible so how you 
,,do 30 put a 0 and multiply by 3 3 times 4 12 1 remaining 3 times 6 18 plus 1 90 6 times 4 24 remain 6 times 6 36 plus 2 38. so when you add these two you get the answer 8 plus 2 10 1 remaining 10 plus 3 13 1 remaining and you get 2 157 multiplied by 52 have you multiplied by 52 50 and then by 2. so how do you multiply by 50 put 
,,a 0 and multiply by 5 5 times 7 35 3 remaining 5 times 5 25 plus 3 28 2 remaining 5 times 1 5 5 plus 2 7. now multiply this by 2 2 times 7 14. one remaining two times five ten ten plus one eleven one remaining two times one two two plus one three so when you add it you get 8164 exercise 3.4 fill in the blanks multiplied by multiples of 10 so what you do we put zeros multiply by 10 means put a zero and multiply by one you get 30 multiplied by 100 means you put two zeros and multiply by one seventy two multiply by thousand means put three zeros and multiply by one it's 54. multiply by hundred put two zeros and you get 39 here 430 given so that means this is multiplied by 10 1 0 is there two zeros there that means multiplied by hundred zero's there so that means this number is 29 so two zeros there so what's the answer that means put two zeros and you get two four five zero multiplied by one here three zeros are there two zeros here so that means multiplied by another one zero multiplied by ten three zeros there so this should be 40 to get four zeros fill in the blanks using suitable values this is multiplication so this means three and ten this is three this is ten three times two six and three times five fifteen multiply by ten means put a zero and multiply by one one times two two one times five five now add it 6 7 6 here multiplied by 24 means 4 and 20 4 times 8 32 3 remaining 4 times 7 28 plus 3 30 multiply by 20 means put a 0 and multiply by 2 2 times 8 16 1 remaining 2 times 7 14 plus 1 15. now add it you get 2 7 8 1 this is 32 how you multiply it by 32 30 and 2 2 times 6 12 1 remaining 2 times 3 6 plus 1 7 2 times 1 2 multiplied by 30 means put a zero and multiply by three three times six eighteen one remaining three times three nine plus one ten one remaining three times one three plus one four now add it you get 8 plus 7 15 1 remaining this becomes 3 simplify the following so that's again multiplication how you get 21 20 and 1. so 1 times

,,20 schools how many shares will each school get so this is also division so 6480 divided by 20 scores 20 times 3 you get 60. remainder 4. for 48 how many 20s for 48 
,,that's 2 2 times 2 4 that's 40. so remainder is 8. for 80 this is 4 4 times 2 8 so you put a 0. so the remainder is 0. so how many shares you can give for each school so that's 324 chairs cheers number of chairs per school is equal to 324 question number five if the cakes of soap in 12 boxes each containing 25 cakes of soap are 
,,divided equally among 15 employees how many cakes of soap will each employee get so there are 12 boxes each containing 25 so you need to find out total number of cakes of soap total number of soups 12 boxes each box 25 that's multiplication so multiply 25 by 12 that means 10 and 2 multiply by 1 and multiply by 2. add it together you get 300. all together now you have to divide this equally with 15 employees so that means divide by 15 15 times 230 and you put a zero so 20. so you can say number of soaps each employee get number of so per person you can say per person that's 20 each miscellaneous exercise the number of people who visited an art exhibition on the first three days of the exhibition was respectively 1320 567 1624 how many people in total visited the art exhibition on these three days total means addition so you can find out total number this is equal to 1320 that's first day second day 1567 third day 1624 just add all these together you get the total 7 plus 4 11 and 1 remaining 6 plus 2 9 plus 1 6 plus 2 8 8 plus 1 9 9 plus 2 11 and 1 here you get 4 4 plus 5 9 9 plus 6 15 and 1 here you get 1 2 3 4. so total number is four thousand five hundred eleven question number two a factory produced three thousand seven hundred eighty eight yogurts during the first week and four thousand one hundred and twenty four yogurts during the second week how many more yogurts were produced in the second week than the first week so we have to take the difference so number of extra yogurts is equal to so second day it's more second week 4124 minus 3788 you subtract to get the difference you can't subtract 8 from 4 you take 1. 14 minus 8 6. this is 10 this is 1 11 minus is 3 and this becomes 0 0 means 10 minus 7 3 so this is 3 minus 3 0. you and then see whether you get this number 8 plus six fourteen nine plus three twelve and then eight plus three eleven and you get four thousand one hundred and twenty five so the answer is three hundred and thirty six question number three there are 10 identical book tracks in a library each book rack contains 5 shelves 30 books are placed on each of these shelves how many books are there in total in the library in these 10 book tracks so you need to read it carefully 10 identical book cracks in a library each book crack contain five shells so five shelves racks all together 10 and 30 books are placed on each of these shelves books 30 for 1. so how many books are all together so you can multiply all these numbers together total number of books so you can find out first how many books in one rack that's 5 times 30 and there are 10 racks so you multiply this by 10. so 
,,here multiply by 100 to two zeros and multiply this by five times three you get fifteen so thousand five hundred books all together question number four a man needs 
,,to plant 152 coconut plants however he is able to plant only eight per day how many days will he require to plant all 152 of them this is division so you have to divide and find out how many days so we can say number of days needed is 152 divided by 8. so you do long division 152 divided by 8 8 times 1 8 7 remaining for 72 this 
,,is 9. so no remainder so that means he needs 19 days to plant all these 152 coconut trees question number five it is required to bring 740 cement banks to a cement sales center the maximum number of cement bags that can be transported in a vehicle is 24. find the number of trips the vehicle needs to make to bring all the cement 
,,bags to the center so that means this is also division so how many trips number of trips is equal to 740 divided by 24 because each vehicle only 24 7 bags we can transport so we'll do long division so 140 divided by 24 24 times 3 72. then subtract this one 20. so again 3 times 4 12 3 times 2 6 plus 1 7. so 20. so that means you 
,,can't take this one so that means what's the answer there are 20 again remaining but what happens when you take this one so you have to transport all cement bags so 
,,30 here and another extra 20 you need to transport so 31 trips you need so here 20 remaining 20 cement bags remaining so 30 trips all together but we need to transport this 20 as well so all together how many trips so number of trips should be one more than that number of trips is 31 this 30 and to transport this extra 20 cement bags you need another one trip so all together 31. so in this lesson we covered all theory related to all basic operations addition subtraction multiplication and division only for whole numbers so practice and identify where you use addition and where you use subtraction division and multiplication

Operations of While number,HiNrFT280_Y,Let's think a little
,,bit about what it means to multiply
,,2/3 times 6. One way to think about it
,,is to literally take six 2/3 and add them together. This is six 2/3 right over here. And if we wanted to
,,"actually compute this, this would be equal"
,,"to-- well, we're going to take these six"
,,2's and add them together. So we could view it
,,"as 2 times 6 over 3. 2 times 6 over 3, which"
,,"is the same thing, of course, as 2, 4,"
,,"6, 8, 10, 12, 12/3. And what is 12/3 equal to? Well, we could rewrite"
,,12 as-- so this is equal to-- we could rewrite 12
,,as 3 plus 3 plus 3 plus 3 over the yellow 3. Let me do it like
,,this so I don't have to keep switching colors. This is going to be
,,the same thing as 3/3 plus 3/3 plus 3/3 plus 3/3. And each of these are
,,"obviously a whole. Each of these equal 1. That's 1 and that's 1, so this"
,,is going to be equal to 4. So that's one way to
,,conceptualize 2/3 times 6. Another way to think
,,of it is as 2/3 of 6. So let's think about that. Let me draw a number line here. And I'm going to draw
,,the number line up to 6. So what I care about is the
,,"section of the number line that goes to 6. So that looks pretty good. So this is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. So if we want to"
,,"take 2/3 of 6, we can think of this whole"
,,section of the number line between 0 and
,,6 as the whole. And then we want to
,,"take 2/3 of that. So how do we do that? Well, we divide it into thirds,"
,,to three equals sections. So that's one equal
,,"section, two equal sections, and three equal sections. And we want two of those thirds. So we want 1/3 and 2/3. Now where does that get us? That gets us to 4. So we "
,,"get, obviously,"
,,to the same answer. We would be in a tough
,,"situation if somehow we got two different answers. Either way, 2/3"
,,"times 6 or 6 times 2/3, either way, that is"
,,going to be equal to 4. But there are two different
,,ways of viewing this. This first way is literally
,,viewing it as 2/3 six times. And this way is we're taking
,,a fraction of the number 6. We're going 2/3 of the way to
,,"6, which would get us to 4."

Operations of While number,HAhg0uXn9GA,"welcome to math with mr. J in this video I'm going to be doing a review of how to add subtract multiply and divide whole numbers so a quick refresher on those four things now if you're looking for more examples or a more in-depth explanation of these things I drop the link down to my whole number videos down in the description if you're ready for this review let's jump right into number one here where we have addition now for addition and subtraction one of the most important things is getting your problem lined up properly and we need to line up our places so the ones place the tens place hundreds so on and so forth so for this one we have five thousand eighty two plus nine hundred fifty-seven so again I have my ones place my tens place my hundreds and thousands place here everything's lined up now I'm ready to add so 2 plus 7 is 9 8 plus 5 is 13 1 plus 9 is 10 and 1 plus 5 is 6 so the answer would be 6,000 39 number two subtraction same thing as addition we need to make sure our places are lined up then we can subtract so 813 minus 298 now this is a borrowing subtraction problem because we cannot do 3 minus 8 that would get us into the negatives which we're we are not going to deal with for this problem so we need to borrow so we borrow from the 1 and it's now a zero this 3 is now a 13 so 13 minus 8 is 5 I cannot do 0-9 so I need to borrow from the 8 the 8 is now a 7 and that 0 is a 10 10 minus 9 is 1 now 7 minus 2 will wrap the problem up and give us 5 so our difference or solution to that subtraction problem is 515 on to multiplication so we have 452 times 72 so again let's line our places up and for multiplication we "
,,need to take our 2 to the 2 5 & 4 and then the 7 to the 2 5 & 4 so 2 times 2 is 4 2 times 5 is 10 2 times 4 is 8 plus that one is 9 I'm done with this - and I'm done with that regrouped 1 I'm moving on to the tens place now so that 7 has a value of 70 so I need a 0 here for my second partial product because again that 7 has a value of 70 so now I need to do 7 times 2 is 14 7 times 5 is 35 Plus that one is 36 7 times 4 is 28 plus that 3 is 31 now I'm ready to add my these are called partial 
,,products here partial products I can add them up to get my product or answer so 4 plus 0 is 4 0 plus 4 is 4 9 plus 6 is 15 regroup my 1 1 plus 1 is 2 and then bring 
,,"down my 3 here so my answer or product to a multiple product which is an answer to a multiplication problem 32,500 forty-four and lastly we have division so 918 918 "
,,divided by 34 so the first thing I need to do 9 divided by 34 which I cannot do and get a whole number so I need to move to my 91 here and do 91/30 4 so how many whole groups of 34 can I pull out of 91 well only two that gives me 268 that is as close as I can get so I need a 2 above the 91 do not put it above the 9 because that 
,,is going to mess up the alignment with how our places and where the numbers need to be and it's going to give us an incorrect answer and kind of throw us off so it needs to go above the 91 now we do 2 times 34 is 68 we subtract and we get 23 bring down our 8 now we have 238 divided by 34 now you might not know off the top of your head how many whole 34s can I pull out it 238 so it might take some estimating and checking so for example I know 34 times 10 is 340 well 238 is pretty well below 
,,that so maybe we start with trying 34 times 6 and seeing how close we get well that gives us 204 which hmm let's see if we can get any closer let's try 7 just in case we can get any closer 34 times 7 actually hits 238 exactly so we put a 7 up here because 238 divided by 34 is 7 now we multiply 7 times 34 is 238 subtract and we did a remainder of zero so our quotient or answer to a division problem is 27 so there you have it there's the whole number review now I went kind of fast through those because this is meant to be a review or a refresher just in case you needed a little help or reminder with any of those and like I said at the beginning if you need a more in-depth or slower explanation more examples of any of those I put the links to my whole number videos in the description hopefully that helped thanks so much for watching until next time peace

Operations of While number,N66KAyP7Zb0,properties are whole numbers properties of whole numbers there are five properties of whole numbers closure property of addition and multiplication commutative property of addition and multiplication associative property distributive property and identity property let us understand each of the properties of whole numbers one by 
,,one closure property of addition when two whole numbers are added we always get the sum as a whole number for example five plus six is equal to eleven which is a whole number closure property of multiplication when two whole numbers are multiplied we always get the product as a whole number for example three multiplied by nine is equal to 27 which is a whole number commutative property of addition prabha and manoj were putting wallpapers to decorate their room Prabha has four blue patterns 
,,and two green patterns Manoj has two blue patterns and four Green patterns they want to put all the wallpaper pieces on the wall how many wallpaper pieces has each of them put let us look at some examples of addition observe that the sum of two whole numbers is the same irrespective of the order of the addends this property is called as commutative property of addition thus Prabha and Manoj would have put same number of wallpaper pieces let us take an example add 380 plus 240 for using commutative property we can write three eighty plus two forty four is equal to two forty four plus three eighty three eighty plus two forty four is equal to six twenty four to forty four plus three eighty is equal to six twenty four so we can conclude that even if we change the order of the add-ins the sum remains the same commutative property of multiplication Brahma has six blue wallpaper pieces in each of the three walls and Manoj has put three wallpaper pieces in each of the six walls of the house how many wallpaper pieces has each of them put let us look at some examples of multiplication observe that the product of two whole numbers is the same irrespective of the order of the factors this property is called as commutative property of multiplication thus prabha and manoj both have put same number of wallpaper pieces let us take an example multiply using commutative property 312 into 120 is equal to 120 into 312 312 into 120 is equal to thirty seven thousand four hundred and forty 120 into three hundred and twelve is equal to thirty seven thousand four hundred and forty so we can conclude that even if we change the order of the multiplicand the product remains the same commutative property of subtraction rubber has 36 wallpaper pieces they need 63 pieces of wallpaper to cover the wall entirely how 
,,many more wallpapers are needed will the result of the subtraction remains same if the orders of the numbers are changed the result is not the same in both the cases as we can see that the result of the subtraction is not the same therefore we say that commutative property does not hold true for subtraction of whole numbers commutative property of division now let us see Prabha and manoj want to put 32 wallpapers equally in four walls how many wallpapers should they put in each wall well the result of the division remains same if they change the order of the numbers as we see that the results differ as the order of the numbers are changed therefore we 
,,say that commutative property does not hold true for division associative property of addition and multiplication if three whole numbers are to be added the sum will be the same even if the order of the numbers is changed similarly if three whole numbers are to be multiplied the product will be the same even if the order of numbers are changed thus associative property of addition and multiplication holds true for whole numbers let us see how this property works in making a cat easier example at 44 plus 60 plus 24 to add these three numbers we can associate the last two numbers that is 44 plus in bracket 60 plus 24 is equal to 44 plus 84 which gives 128 to add these three numbers we can also associate the first two numbers that is 44 plus 60 in bracket plus 24 is equal to 104 plus 24 which also gives 128 in both the cases the sum is the same which is equal to 128 so we can conclude that of three or more whole numbers are to be added the sum will be the same even if the order 
,,of the numbers are changed let us now see how associative property of multiplication makes our calculation easier example to multiply 12 into 10 into 42 to multiply 
,,these three numbers we can associate the last two numbers that is 10 x 42 in bracket multiply it by 12 which is equal to 12 x 4 20 which gives 5042 multiply these three numbers we can also associate the first two numbers that is 12 x 10 in brackets x 42 which is equal to 120 x 42 which gives 5040 in both the cases the product is same which is equal to 5040 so we can conclude that if three or more whole numbers are to be multiplied the product will be the same even if the order of the numbers are changed distributive property of multiplication over addition let us understand how distributive property is used to simplify our calculation we know that the 
,,multiplication problem 6 multiplied by 9 also means 6 rows of 9 this grid represents an array of six rows of nine we can find the product of 6 & 9 by counting the number of boxes in the grid we see that there are 54 boxes in the grid therefore 6 multiplied by 9 equals 54 let us see how further we can simplify this multiplication for this we can write this statement 6 multiplied by 9 as 6 multiplied by 5 plus 4 that is we break the second number that is 9 into 2 parts 5 & 4 we can show this 
,,in our grid by breaking the whole grid in 2 parts the bigger rectangle still has 6 rows but it has now 5 columns similarly the smaller rectangle has 6 rows and 4 columns we can solve this by counting the number of boxes in each strecht angle we know that 6 rows of five columns will result to 30 as a product similarly we know that 6 rows of 4 columns will result to 24 as a product thus 30 plus 24 gives 54 this means 6 x 9 can be written as 6 x 5 for let us see how we can apply the distributive property in solving a multiplication problem multiplied 212 into 155 we are already aware of the usual way of multiplying two numbers the other way is by using the property we can break the number 155 into three parts as 150 and 5 which we can write inside the bracket we then multiply the numbers in parts that is 212 multiplied by hundred plus 212 multiplied by 50 plus 212 multiplied by 5 which is equal to 20 1200 plus ten thousand six hundred plus thousand sixty which is equal to 32 thousand eight hundred and sixty thus we can see that our calculation becomes much easier by using the property identity properties let us see the different identity properties for addition and multiplication one adding 0 to a whole number gives the number itself for example 2345 plus 0 is equal to 2345 we call zero the identity for addition or additive identity for the whole number two multiplying any whole number to 0 gives the product as zero for example 678 into 0 is equal to 0 3 multiplying a whole number by 1 gives the product as the number itself for example 9200 into 1 is equal to nine thousand two hundred we call 1 the identity for multiplication or multiplicative identity for the whole number let us do a quick recap of what we have studied till now let us do a quick recap of what we have studied till now remember one in commutative property we can move the numbers to make convenient pairs for easy addition two in associative property we can group the add-ins or multiplicand in such a way that the operation is easier and faster three the distributive property of multiplication over addition simplifies the process of multiplication

Operations of While number,ClYdw4d4OmA,In this video we're going
,,to talk a little bit about order of operations. And I want you to pay close
,,attention because really everything else that you're
,,going to do in mathematics is going to be based on you
,,having a solid grounding in order of operations. So what do we even mean when
,,we say order of operations? So let me give you an example. The whole point is so that we
,,have one way to interpret a mathematical statement. So let's say I have the
,,mathematical statement 7 plus 3 times 5. Now if we didn't all agree on
,,"order of operations, there would be two ways of"
,,interpreting this statement. You could just read it left to
,,"right, so you could say well, let me just take 7 plus 3, you"
,,"could say 7 plus 3 and then multiply that times 5. And 7 plus 3 is 10, and then"
,,"you multiply that by 5. 10 times 5, it"
,,would get you 50. So that's one way you would
,,interpret it if we didn't agree on an order of operations. Maybe it's a natural way. You just go left to right. Another way you could interpret
,,"it you say, I like to do multiplication before"
,,I do addition. So you might interpret it as --
,,I'll try to color code it -- 7 plus -- and you do
,,"the 3 times 5 first. 7 plus 3 times 5, which would"
,,"be 7 plus 3 times 5 is 15, and 7 plus 15 is 22. So notice, we interpreted"
,,this statement in two different ways. This was just straight left
,,to right doing addition then the multiplication. This way we did the
,,"multiplication first then the addition, we got two different"
,,"answers, and that's just not cool in mathematics. If this was part of some effort"
,,to send something to the moon because two people interpreted
,,it a different way or another one computer interpreted one
,,"way and another computer interpreted it another way, the"
,,satellite might go to mars. So this is just completely
,,"unacceptable, and that's why we have to have an agreed"
,,upon order of operations. An agreed upon way to
,,interpret this statement. So the agreed upon order of
,,operations is to do parentheses first -- let me write it over
,,here -- then do exponents. If you don't know what
,,exponents are don't worry about it right now. In this video we're not going
,,"to have any exponents in our examples, so you don't"
,,really have to worry about them for this video. Then you do multiplication --
,,"I'll just right mult, short for multiplication -- then you do"
,,"multiplication and division next, they kind of have the"
,,same level of priority. And then finally you do
,,addition and subtraction. So what does this order of
,,"operations -- let me label it -- this right here,"
,,that is the agreed upon order of operations. If we follow these order of
,,operations we should always get to the same answer
,,for a given statement. So what does this tell us? What is the best way to
,,interpret this up here? Well we have no parentheses --
,,parentheses look like that. Those little curly
,,things around numbers. We don't have any
,,parentheses here. I'll do some examples that
,,do have parentheses. We don't have any
,,exponents here. But we do have some
,,multiplication and division or we actually just have
,,"some multiplication. So we'll order of operations,"
,,do the multiplication and division first. So it says do the
,,multiplication first. That's a multiplication. So it says do this
,,operation first. It gets priority over
,,addition or subtraction. So if we do this first we
,,"get the 3 times 5, which is 15, and then we add the 7. The addition or subtraction --"
,,"I'll do it here, addition, we just have addition. Just like that. So we do the multiplication"
,,"first, get 15, then add the 7, 22. So based upon the agreed order"
,,"of operations, this right here is the correct answer. The correct way to"
,,interpret this statement. Let's do another example. I think it'll make things a
,,"little bit more clear, and I'll do the example in pink. So let's say I have 7 plus 3 --"
,,I'll put some parentheses there -- times 4 divided by
,,2 minus 5 times 6. So there's all sorts of crazy
,,"things here, but if you just follow the order of operations"
,,you'll simplify it in a very clean way and hopefully we'll
,,all get the same answer. So let's just follow the
,,order of operations. The first thing we have to
,,"do is look for parentheses. Are there parentheses here? Yes, there are. There's parentheses"
,,"around the 7 plus 3. So it says let's do that first. So 7 plus 3 is 10. So this we can simplify,"
,,"just looking at this order operations, to"
,,10 times all of that. Let me copy and paste
,,that so I don't have to keep re-writing it. So that simplifies to
,,10 times all of that. We did our parentheses first. Then what do we do? There are no more parentheses
,,"in this expression. Then we should do exponents. I don't see any exponents here,"
,,"and if you're curious what exponents look like, an"
,,exponent would look like 7 squared. You'd see these little small
,,numbers up in the top right. We don't have any exponents
,,here so we don't have to worry about it. Then it says to do
,,multiplication and division next. So where do we see
,,"multiplication? We have a multiplication,"
,,"a division, a multiplication again. Now, when you have multiple"
,,"operations at the same level, when our order of operations,"
,,"multiplication and division are the same level, then"
,,you do left to right. So in this situation you're
,,going to multiply by 4 and then divide by 2. You won't multiply
,,by 4 divided by 2. Then we'll do the 5 times
,,6 before we do the subtraction right here. So let's figure
,,out what this is. So we'll do this
,,multiplication first. We could simultaneously do this
,,multiplication because it's not going to change things. But I'll do things
,,one step at a time. So the next step we're going
,,"to do is this 10 times 4. 10 times 4 is 40. 10 times 4 is 40, then you"
,,"have 40 divided by 2 and it simplifies to that right there. Remember, multiplication and"
,,"division, they're at the exact same level so we're going"
,,to do it left to right. You could also express this as
,,"multiplying by 1/2 and then it wouldn't matter the order. But for simplicity,"
,,multiplication and division go left to right. So then you have 40 divided
,,"by 2 minus 5 times 6. So, division, you just"
,,"have one division here, you want to do that. You have this division and you"
,,"have this multiplication, they're not together so you"
,,can actually kind of do them simultaneously. And to make it clear that you
,,do this before you do the subtraction because
,,multiplication and division take priority over addition and
,,"subtraction, we could put parentheses around them to say"
,,"look, we're going to do that and that first before I do that"
,,"subtraction, because multiplication and"
,,division have priority. So 40 divided by 2 is 20. We're going to have that minus
,,"sign, minus 5 times 6 is 30. 20 minus 30 is equal"
,,to negative 10. And that is the correct
,,interpretation of that. So I want to make something
,,"very, very, very clear. If you have things at the same"
,,"level, so if you have 1 plus 2 minus 3 plus 4 minus 1. So addition and subtraction are"
,,"all the same level in order of operations, you should"
,,go left to right. So you should interpret this as
,,"1 plus 2 is 3, so this is the same thing as 3 minus"
,,3 plus 4 minus 1. Then you do 3 minus 3
,,is 0 plus 4 minus 1. Or this is the same thing
,,"as 4 minus 1, which is the same thing as 3. You just go left to right. Same thing if you have"
,,"multiplication and division, they're at the same level. So if you have 4 times 2"
,,"divided by 3 times 2, you do 4 times 2 is 8"
,,"divided by 3 times 2. And you say 8 divided by 3 is,"
,,"well, we got a fraction there. It would be 8/3. So this would be 8/3 times 2. And then 8/3 times to"
,,is equal to 16 over 3. That's how you interpret it. You don't do this
,,multiplication first or divide the 2 by that and all of that. Now the one time where you can
,,"be loosey-goosey with order of operations, if you have all"
,,addition or all multiplication. So if you have 1 plus 5 plus 7
,,"plus 3 plus 2, it does not matter what order you do it in. You can do the 2 plus 3, you"
,,"can go from the right to the left, you can go from the"
,,"left to the right, you could start some place in between. If it's only all addition. And the same thing is true if"
,,you have all multiplication. It's 1 times 5 times
,,7 times 3 times 2. It does not matter what
,,order you're doing it. But it's only with all
,,multiplication or all addition. If there was some division
,,"in here, if there's some subtraction in here, you're"
,,best off just going left to right.

Operations of While number,mqPqfR6UgqM,we know that four and five are whole numbers what is four plus five it's nine nine is also a whole number even the numbers 22 and 33 are whole numbers what is 22 plus 33 you're correct it's 55 and 55 is also a whole number are you getting a gist of what I'm trying to say also if I add two whole numbers 350 and 620 the answer to 
,,"that is again a whole number similarly 28,000 plus 50 9,000 also result in a whole number whenever we add any two whole numbers the resultant number that we get is also a whole number and this is the first property of a whole number however instead of this we say that whole numbers are closed under addition this is just a mathematical way of saying it this statement is actually the same as this if I add any two whole numbers the number that I get will also be a whole number now here is a question for you to answer our whole numbers closed under subtraction pause the video and give it a thought first of all let's understand what the question means what "
,,do we mean by closed under subtraction it means that if we take any two whole numbers and subtract them then we will always get whole number will this way always happen let's try to find this out by subtracting any two random whole numbers 35 minus 20 is equal to 15 we subtracted two whole numbers and we got whole number again similarly one thousand minus 999 will give us one a whole number again what about five minus eight what will we get when we subtract eight from five wait a moment can we even subtract eight from five no we can't do that even if we try to subtract them here's what we get a negative number we are not talking about negative numbers 
,,"now you will learn that in the future lessons but we know that this is certainly not a whole number hence we will term this subtraction as invalid similarly if you subtract 100 from 50 the answer that you will get is a negative number both numbers are not whole numbers so we can say whole numbers are not closed under subtraction what about multiplication our whole numbers closed under multiplication yes they are closed under multiplication when you multiply any two whole numbers you will always get a whole number here are a few examples to support this argument 5 times 5 is 25 a whole number 1 times 1,000 is 1,000 a whole number again let's involve the whole numbers 0 0 times 10 is what when you multiply any number with 0 we get 0 again so it's 0 we take any two whole numbers and multiply them the answer that we get will always be a whole number here's a quick recap of what we studied so far in this video we learned that whole numbers are closed under addition not closed under and closed under multiplication these three are arithmetic operations that we commonly use is there another one which is the fourth most common operation that you "
,,know of its division I'm sure that you must have already guessed the next question that I'm going to ask you our whole numbers closed under division four and two are whole numbers and if we divide 4 by 2 we get a whole number again but if we divide 6 by 5 the answer we will get will be in decimals which is not a whole number similarly examples such as 3 divided by 12 4/9 will not result in whole numbers hence we say that whole numbers are not closed under division what is 0 divided by 4 it's 0 and what is 4 divided by 0 is it also 0 or perhaps some other number in order to understand this we first need to be sure that we know the meaning of division we have studied arithmetic operations and the fact is that among all the arithmetic operations students find division to be the most difficult one what is division when we divide a number 8 but therefore what actually are we doing imagine the scenario there are 8 chocolates and 4 people and we want to distribute these 8 chocolates to 4 people such that everyone gets equal number of chocolates how many chocolates will a single person get each person will get 2 chocolates how did we get this to yes we divided 8 by 4 and that gave us 2 or in other words we divided the number of chocolates available equally among all the people now let's say instead of 4 there are two people now how will we divide ate chocolates between two people how many chocolates will each person get you're absolutely correct each one will get 4 chocolates let's act a bit crazy now let us divide eight chocolates equally among zero people that is 8 divided by zero does it even makes sense to divide eight chocolates amongst no one no it doesn't hence we say this is undefined or in other words any whole number divided by zero is undefined on the same lines these are all undefined quantities we will see another property of whole numbers in the next video

Operations of While number,-QHff5pRdM8,So we have a
,,"bunch of numbers listed up here, and my goal, in this video,"
,,is to see if we can classify them into different types
,,"of number categories, and let me draw the categories. So this circle, over here, this represents all of the numbers that can be represented as the fraction of two integers, and, of"
,,"course, the denominator can't be equal to zero,"
,,because we don't know what it means to put a
,,"zero in the denominator. So, let's call these, or the standard way of calling these things. These things can be"
,,"represented as a fraction of two integers, we call"
,,these rational numbers. Rational numbers. And if something cannot be
,,"represented as a fraction of two integers, we"
,,call irrational numbers. Irrational numbers. Irrational numbers. And the size of these circles don't show how large these sets are. There's actually an
,,infinite number of rational and an infinite number
,,"of irrational numbers. So, these are the irrational numbers. Irrational. So, these cannot be"
,,"represented as a fraction of two integers. And then, within rational numbers, you have integers themselves. So, I'll do that in, let me"
,,"do that in this blue color. Integers. So, integers are numbers that don't have to be represented as a"
,,"fraction or a decimal. So, these are integers, right over here. Integers. And then a subset of"
,,"integers are whole numbers. So, if you essentially say"
,,"the non-negative integers, you're then talking about whole numbers. So let me do that subset, right over here. So, these are going to"
,,"be the whole numbers. So, whole numbers. Whole numbers, right over here. And, actually, let me just label it all. These are rational... Let me do that in the same color. Rational numbers. And, of course, irrational numbers. Irrational numbers. Irrational numbers. An integer. Well, if I could say,"
,,"Look, that is an integer. Let's think about the integers."" But I wouldn't say, ""Let's"
,,"just think about the rational."" I'd say, ""Let's think about"
,,"the rational numbers."" All right, now that we have"
,,"these categories in place, let's categorize them. Like always, pause the video. See if you can figure out what category these numbers fall into. Where would you put "
,,"them on this diagram? So, let's start off with three. This is positive three. It can be definitely"
,,"represented as a fraction. You can represent it as three over one. But, it doesn't have to be"
,,"represented as a fraction. It, literally, could be just"
,,"a three, right over there, but it's also non-negative. So three is a whole number. So three, and maybe I'll do it"
,,"in the color of the category. So, three is a whole number. So, it's a member of that set. But if you're a whole number,"
,,"you're also an integer, and you're also a rational number. So, three is a whole"
,,"number, it's an integer, and it's a rational number. Now, let's think about negative five. Now, negative five, once"
,,"again, it can be represented as a fraction, but it doesn't have to be, but it is negative. So, it's not gonna be a whole number. So, negative five is going"
,,"to sit right over here. It's an integer, and if you're an integer, you're definitely going"
,,"to be a rational number, but it's not a whole number"
,,"because it is negative. Now we have 0.25. Well, this, for sure, can be"
,,"represented as a fraction. This is 25-hundredths, right over here. So, we can represent that as a fraction of two integers, I should say. It's 25-hundredths. But there's no way to represent this except using a fraction of two integers. So, 0.25 is a rational number, but it's not an integer"
,,"and not a whole number. Now what about 22 over seven. Well, here it's clearly"
,,"represented, already, as a fraction of two integers, but I don't think I can"
,,"represent this any other, except as a fraction of two integers. I can't somehow make this without using a fraction"
,,"or some type of decimal that might repeat. So, this, right over here, this would also be a rational number, but it's not an integer,"
,,"not a whole number. Now this over here. 0.2713. Now the 13 repeats. This is the same thing as 0.27131313, that's what line up there represents. Now, you might not realize it yet, but any number that repeats eventually, this one does repeat eventually, you have the .1313, or you have the 0.27131313, any number like this can be   "
,,"represented as a fraction. For example, and I'm"
,,"not going to do it here, just for the sake of time, but, for example, 0.3, repeating, that's the same thing as one-third. And later on, we're gonna see techniques of how do you convert this to"
,,"a fraction of two integers. But, for our sake, we just know that this can be represented"
,,"as a fraction of two integers just the way that 0.3, repeating, can be. And so, we would put this"
,,"under rational numbers. 0.2713, repeating. But you have to represent"
,,"it either as a decimal or a fraction of integers. If you didn't have to, then"
,,"it could have been an integer, but we'll throw it up"
,,"there in rational numbers. Now the square root of ten. Square root of ten. This is interesting. So, any square root of"
,,"a non-perfect square is going to be irrational. So, this is gonna be irrational. I'm not proving it to you here, but you cannot represent this as the ratio of two integers, or a"
,,"fraction with two integers, with an integer in the numerator and an integer in the denominator. This will be, if you were to represent it as a decimal, it will not repeat. It'll just keep being new and new digits. It will not repeat over time. So, this, right over here,"
,,is an irrational number. It's not rational. It cannot be represented as
,,"the ratio of two integers. All right, 14 over seven. This is the ratio of two integers. So, this, for sure, is rational. But if you think about it, 14 over seven, that's another way of saying, 14 over seven is the same thing as two. These two things are equivalent. So, 14 over seven is"
,,"the same thing as two. So, this is actually a whole number. It doesn't look like a whole number, but, remember, a whole number is a non-negative number that doesn't "
,,need to be represented as the
,,"ratio of two integers. And this one, even though"
,,we did represent it as the ratio of two
,,"integers, it doesn't need to be represented as the"
,,"ratio of two integers. You could have represent this as just two. So, that's going to be a whole number. 14 over seven, which is"
,,"the same thing as two, that is a whole number. Now, two-pi. Now pi is an irrational... Pi is an irrational number. So if we just take a multiple of pi, if we just take a integer multiple of pi, like that, this is also going"
,,to be an irrational number. If you looked at its
,,"decimal representation, it will never repeat. So that's two-pi, right over there. Now what about... Let me do that same, since"
,,"I've been consistent, relatively consistent, with the colors. So, this is two-pi right over there. Now, what about the"
,,"negative square root of 25. Well, 25's a perfect square. Square root of that's just gonna be five. So, this thing is going to be, this thing is going to be"
,,"equivalent to negative five. So, this is just another representation of this, right over here. So, it is an integer. It's not a whole number"
,,"because it's negative, but it's an integer. Negative square root of 25. These two things are actually... These two things are"
,,"actually the same number, just different ways of representing them. And then you have, let's"
,,"see, you have the square root of nine over... The square root of nine over seven. Well, what's the principal root of nine? This thing is gonna be the same thing, this thing is the same... Let me do this in a different color. This is the same thing as, square root of nine is three, it's the principal root of"
,,"nine, so it's three-sevenths. So, this is a ratio of two integers. This is a rational number. Square root of nine over seven is the same thing as three-sevenths. Now, let me just give you"
,,"one more just for the road. What about pi over pi? What is that going to be? Well, pi divided by pi is"
,,"going to be equal to one. So, this is actually a whole number. So I could write pi over"
,,"pi, right over there. That's just a very"
,,fancy way of saying one.
,,
Operations of While number,XaJQse2u5TQ,We've already seen that the
,,"fraction 2/5, or fractions like the fraction 2/5, can"
,,"be literally represented as 2 times 1/5, which"
,,"is the same thing, which is equal to literally"
,,having two 1/5s. So 1/5 plus 1/5. And if we wanted
,,"to visualize it, let me make a hole"
,,here and divide it into five equal sections. And so this represents
,,two of those fifths. This is the first of the
,,"fifths, and then this is the second of the fifths,"
,,"Literally 2/5, 2/5, 2/5. Now let's think about something"
,,a little bit more interesting. What would 3 times
,,2/5 represent? 3 times 2/5. And I encourage you
,,"to pause this video and, based on what"
,,"we just did here, think about what you think"
,,"this would be equivalent to. Well, we just saw that 2/5"
,,would be the same thing as-- so let me just
,,rewrite this as instead of 3 times 2/5
,,"written like this, let me write 2/5"
,,like that-- so this is the same thing as
,,"3 times 2 times 1/5. And multiplication, we can"
,,multiply the 2 times the 1/5 first and then
,,"multiply by the 3, or we can multiply the 3"
,,times the 2 first and then multiply by the 1/5. So you could view this literally
,,"as being equal to 3 times 2 is, of course, 6, so this is"
,,the same thing as 6 times 1/5. And if we were to try
,,"to visualize that again, so that's a whole. That's another whole. Each of those wholes"
,,have been divided into five equal sections. And so we're going to
,,"color in six of them. So that's the first 1/5, second"
,,"1/5, third 1/5, fourth 1/5, fifth 1/5-- and that"
,,gets us to a whole-- and then we have
,,6/5 just like that. So literally 3 times 2/5
,,"can be viewed as 6/5. And of course, 6"
,,"times 1/5, or 6/5, can be written as--"
,,"so this is equal to, literally-- let me do the"
,,"same color-- 6/5, 6 over 5. Now you might have said, well,"
,,"what if we, instead of viewing 2/5 as this, as we just"
,,"did in this example, we view 2/5 as 1/5 plus"
,,"1/5, what would happen then? Well, let's try it out. So 3 times 2/5-- I'll rewrite"
,,"it-- 3 times 2/5, 2 over 5, is the same thing as"
,,3 times 1/5 plus 1/5. 2/5 is the same thing
,,as 1/5 plus 1/5. So 3 times 1/5 plus
,,"1/5 which would be equal to-- well, I just"
,,have to have literally three of these added together. So it's going to be
,,1/5 plus 1/5 plus 1/5 plus 1/5 plus-- I think
,,"you get the idea here-- plus 1/5 plus 1/5. Well, what's this going to be? Well, we literally"
,,have 6/5 here. We can ignore the parentheses
,,"and just add all of these together. We, once again, have"
,,"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6/5. So once again, this"
,,is equal to 6/5. So hopefully this
,,shows that when you multiply-- The 2/5 we saw
,,"already represents two 1/5s. We already saw that,"
,,or 2 times 1/5. And 3 times 2/5 is literally
,,"the same thing as 3 times 2 times 1/5. In this case, that would be 6/5."

Operations of While number,tsOibhsgYoQ,welcome to math with mr j in this video i'm going to cover how to multiply a whole number by a decimal so let's jump right into number one where we have 14 times six tenths and the three steps that we're going to take in order to solve these two examples correctly are at the top of your screen and step one says remove any decimals within that problem and we're going to rewrite the problem without those decimals so let's rewrite number one as 14 times six so we're removing or forgetting about any decimals they will come into play later on in the problem though number two we multiply or solve just like we would any other multiplication problem involving 
,,whole numbers so 6 times 4 is 24 6 times 1 is 6 plus that 2 is 8. so we get an answer of 84 but we're not quite done yet step 3 we need to place the decimal in our answer and we do that by looking at the original problem and seeing how many digits are to the right or are behind a decimal however you like thinking about it and we have one this six here and i like circling any digits to the right of a decimal or behind that way i make sure i include everything so we have one digit behind a decimal that means our answer has to have one digit behind the decimal so this four will be our one digit and we can place our decimal right there so we have eight and four tenths as our answer another way of thinking about it we had 84 as our answer so for every whole number the decimal is at the end so we can bring our decimal in once that way it gives us one digit behind the decimal or you can just how i did right here kind of counted how many digits i needed and placed the decimal accordingly whatever works best for you so on to number two here where we have seven times five and twenty two hundredths first step remove any decimals and rewrite the problem so we get seven times five hundred twenty two now when it comes to multiplication we want the number with more digits on top we can solve it like this but it's 
,,much easier to have the number with more digits on top so we can actually do 522 times 7 and that's because multiplication is commutative you'll get the same answer 
,,either way 7 times 522 or 522 times 7. so now we multiply step two we multiply and solve here seven times two is fourteen seven times two is fourteen plus that one is fifteen seven times five is thirty-five plus one is 36 so we get 3 654 but that's not our final answer we need to place the decimal so let's look at our original problem see how many digits are behind or are to the right of a decimal and we have one two so that means our answer needs to have two we can think of it like this bring it in one two that will give us two digits behind the decimal or you can go one two and place your decimal there either way whatever works best for you and we will rewrite our final answer without any marks under it and we get 36 and 54 hundredths so there you have it there's how you multiply a whole number by a decimal i hope that helped thanks so much for watching until next time peace

Operations of While number,aqsIWLqlDhE,"We are asked, what number set"
,,does the number 8 belong to? So this is actually
,,a good review of the different sets of numbers
,,that we often talk about. So the first set
,,under consideration is the natural numbers. And these are essentially
,,"the counting numbers, and you're not counting 0. So just if you were"
,,"actually to count objects, and you have at"
,,"least one of them, we're talking about"
,,"the natural numbers. So that would be 1, 2,"
,,"3, so on and so forth. So clearly, 8 is"
,,a natural number. You can count up to 8 here. You could count 8 objects. So 8 is a member of
,,the natural numbers. The next one we
,,"should consider, let's consider the whole"
,,numbers right over here. And I should say
,,natural numbers. So let's consider
,,the whole numbers. The whole numbers
,,are essentially the same thing as
,,"the natural numbers, but we're now"
,,"going to include 0. So this is 0, 1, 2,"
,,"3, so on and so forth. So clearly, 8 is one"
,,of these as well. You could eventually
,,"increment your way to 8, like you're just counting"
,,all of the whole numbers. Another way to view this is
,,the non-negative numbers. So 8 clearly belongs
,,to this as well. So let's expand our
,,set a little bit. Let's think about integers. Now these are all the
,,"numbers starting with, well you could keep counting"
,,"down, all the way up to negative 3, negative"
,,"2, negative 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, and you could just"
,,"keep going there. Now clearly, 8 is"
,,"one of these as well. You can just keep counting to 8. In fact, let me just"
,,"put our check box there. In general, you"
,,have your integers that contain both the positive
,,"and the negative numbers and 0, depending on"
,,whether you consider that positive or
,,"negative, or neither. So that's the integers,"
,,right over here. And then the whole numbers
,,is a subset of the integers. So I'll draw it like this. The whole numbers
,,"are right over here, that is the whole numbers. We've now excluded all"
,,of the negative numbers. So these are all the
,,non-negative numbers. All the non-negative
,,"integers, I should say. So these are the whole numbers. And then the natural numbers"
,,are a subset of that. It's essentially everything. So the only thing that's
,,in whole numbers that's not in the natural numbers
,,is just the number 0. So this whole area
,,right here just corresponds to the number 0. So it really should
,,be a bit of a point. So let me make it clear. This circle is
,,"the whole numbers, and then I have the"
,,"natural numbers, which is a subset of that. Obviously this isn't"
,,drawn to scale. The natural numbers
,,is a subset of that. 8 is a member of all of them. 8 is sitting right over here. So it's a member of the
,,"natural numbers, whole numbers, and the integers. Now let's keep expanding things. Let's talk about"
,,rational numbers. Now these are numbers that
,,"can be expressed in the form p over q, where both p"
,,"and q are integers. So can 8 be expressed this way? Well, you can express"
,,8 as 8 over 1. Or actually 16 over 2. Or you could just
,,"keep going, 32 over 4, you can express it as a"
,,"bunch of p's over q's, where both the p and q are integers. So it's definitely"
,,"a rational number. And in fact, all of these things"
,,over here are rational numbers. So let me draw. So this is all a subset
,,of rational numbers. So 8 is definitely a
,,"member of that as well. Rational numbers, so let me"
,,put the check box over here. Now what about
,,"irrational numbers? Irrational numbers. Well, by definition, these are"
,,numbers that are not rational. These are numbers that cannot
,,"be expressed in this form, where p and q are integers. So if something is rational,"
,,it just cannot be irrational. So 8 is not a member of
,,the irrational numbers. The irrational numbers are
,,just a completely separate set over here. So I would draw it like this. This area right over
,,"here, this would be the irrational numbers. Irrational. Rational is not a subset of"
,,"irrational, they are exclusive. You can't be in both sets. So that's irrational"
,,"right over there. And then finally let's ask, is"
,,8 a member of the real numbers? Now the real numbers are
,,essentially all of these. It's combining both the
,,rational and the irrational. So the real numbers is all
,,of this right over here. And so 8 is clearly
,,a member of the real. It's a member of the
,,"real, and within the real, you either can be rational or"
,,"irrational, 8 it is rational. It's an integer. It's a whole number. And it is a natural number. So it's definitely a"
,,member of the reals. And just to give
,,"you might be saying, hey well, what is an"
,,irrational number then? Can't almost every number
,,be represented like this? Or every number you can think
,,of be represented like this? And an example of maybe
,,"the most famous example of an irrational number is pi. Pi is equal to 3.14159, and"
,,people devote their lives to memorizing the digits of pi. But what makes this irrational
,,"is you can't represent it as a ratio, or as a"
,,"rational expression, of integers, the way you"
,,can for rational numbers. And this right here
,,is non-repeating. And if it was
,,"repeating, you actually could express it as"
,,"a ratio of integers, and we do that in other videos. It is non-repeating"
,,"and non terminating, so you never run out digits to"
,,the right of the decimal point. So this would be an example
,,of an irrational number. So pi would sit here
,,"in the irrationals. Anyway, hopefully you"
,,found that helpful.

Operations of While number,piIcRV2dx7E,Now that we've got the basics
,,"of order of operations out of the way, let's try to tackle a"
,,"really hairy and beastly problem. So here, we have all"
,,sorts of parentheses and numbers flying around. But in any of these order of
,,"operations problems, you really just have to take a deep breath"
,,"and remember, we're going to do parentheses first. Parentheses. P for parentheses. Then exponents. Don't worry if you don't know"
,,"what exponents are, because this has no exponents in them. Then you're going to do"
,,multiplication and division. They're at the same level. Then you do addition
,,"and subtraction. So some people remember PEMDAS. But if you remember PEMDAS,"
,,"remember multiplication, division, same level. Addition and subtraction,"
,,also at the same level. So let's figure what the
,,order of operations say that this should evaluate to. So the first thing we're going
,,to do is our parentheses. And we have a lot of
,,parentheses here. We have this expression in
,,"parentheses right there, and then even within that we"
,,"have these parentheses. So our order of operations say,"
,,"look, do your parentheses first, but in order to evaluate"
,,this outer parentheses-- this orange thing-- we're going to
,,have to evaluate this thing in yellow right there. So let's evaluate
,,"this whole thing. So how can we simplify it? Well, if we look at just inside"
,,"of it, the first thing we want to do is simplify the"
,,parentheses inside the parentheses. So you see this 5
,,minus 2 right there? We're going to do that
,,first no matter what. And that's easy to evaluate. 5 minus 2 is 3. And so this simplifies to--
,,I'll do it step by step. Once you get the hang of
,,"it, you can do multiple steps at once. So this is going to be"
,,"7 plus 3 times the 5 minus 2, which is 3. And all of those have"
,,"parentheses around it. And of course, you have"
,,all the stuff on either side-- the divide 4-- no. Oops. That's not what I want. I wanted to copy and paste. I want to copy and paste
,,"that right there. So copy, then-- no, that's"
,,giving me the wrong thing. It would've been easier--
,,let me just rewrite it. That's the easiest thing. I'm having technical
,,"difficulties. So divided by 4 times 2. And on this side, you had that"
,,"7 times 2 plus this thing in orange parentheses there. Now, at any step you"
,,just look again. We always want to do
,,"parentheses first. Well, you keep wanting to"
,,do and is there really no parentheses left? So we have to evaluate this
,,parentheses in orange here. So we have to evaluate
,,this thing first. But in order to evaluate
,,"this thing, we have to look inside of it. And when you look inside of it,"
,,you have 7 plus 3 times 3. So if you just had 7 plus
,,"3 times 3, how would you evaluate it? Well, look back to your"
,,order of operations. We're inside the parentheses
,,"here, so inside of it there are no longer any parentheses. So the next thing we should do"
,,is-- there are no exponents. There is multiplication. So we do that before we do
,,any addition or subtraction. So we want to do the 3 times
,,3 before we add the 7. So this is going to be 7
,,plus-- and the 3 times 3 we want to do first. We want to do the
,,multiplication first. 7 plus 9. That's going to be in
,,the orange parentheses. And then you have the 7
,,"times 2 plus that, on the left hand side. You have the divided by 4 times"
,,2 on the right hand side. And now this-- the thing in
,,parentheses-- because we still want to do the
,,parentheses first. Pretty easy to evaluate. What's 7 plus 9? 7 plus 9 is 16. And so everything we have
,,simplifies to 7 times 2 plus 16 divided by 4 times 2. Now we don't have any
,,"parentheses left, so we don't have to worry"
,,"about the P in PEMDAS. We have no E, no"
,,exponents in this. So then we go straight to
,,multiplication and division. We have a multiplication--
,,we have some multiplication going on there. We have some division
,,"going on here, and a multiplication there. So we should do these"
,,"next, before we do this addition right there. So we could do this"
,,multiplication. We could do that
,,multiplication. 7 times 2 is 14. We're going to wait
,,to do that addition. And then here we have a
,,16 divided by 4 times 2. That gets priority of the
,,"addition, so we're going to do that before we do the addition. But how do we evaluate that? Do we do the division first,"
,,"or the multiplication first? And remember, I told you in the"
,,"last video, when you have 2-- when you have multiple"
,,"operations of the same level-- in this case, division and"
,,multiplication-- they're at the same level. You're safest going
,,left to right. Or you should go left to right. So you do 16 divided by 4 is 4. So this thing right here--
,,simplify 16 divided by 4 times 2. It simplifies to 4 times 2. That's this thing in
,,green right there. And then we're going to want to
,,do the multiplication next. So this is going to simplify
,,to-- because multiplication takes priority over addition--
,,this simplifies to 8. And so you get 14-- this
,,14 right here-- plus 8. And what's 14 plus 8? That is 22. That is equal to 22. And we are done.

Operations of While number,1YWyTdtofdE,see if we can figure out what 2/3 divided by five is equal to. Pause this video and see
,,"if you can figure this out. Well, there is a couple of"
,,"ways that we can approach it. We can first do it in a conceptual way, think about it visually. To do that, let me represent 2/3, so let's say that what I'm drawing right over here is a whole. This is a square, and"
,,"it represents a whole. Now, I can divide into"
,,"three equal sections. I'm gonna try to hand-draw that. So, this is, that looks pretty good, three equal sections here. Each is 1/3, and we have 2/3, so we are really representing all of this stuff right over here. That is two of my thirds. Now, I wanna divide those 2/3 by five. Well, the way I could do this is I could divide it "
,,into
,,"five equal sections. But, if I'm doing it, I might as well just divide everything, all the thirds, into five equal sections,"
,,"so let me do that. So, one, two, three, and then"
,,"four, and five equal sections. So, what is one of those"
,,"five equal sections of my original 2/3? Well, this right over here is one of those five equal"
,,"sections of my original 2/3. Notice I could draw that, I"
,,"could draw another one here, another one here, another one"
,,"there, and another one there, and I would have five equal"
,,"sections that make up those 2/3. But, what does just one of them represent? And if we figure out what"
,,"this represents of the whole, then we know what 2/3 divided by five is. Well, when I took my"
,,"thirds and I divided them into five equal sections, I"
,,"essentially constructed 15ths. How do I know that? Well, I had one, two, three thirds, and then I divided it into one, two, three, four, five sections, so each of these squares"
,,"right over here is a 15th. You have three times five, and you could count 'em if you like. And, what we have circled off"
,,"in red is two of these 15ths. We have 1/15 right over here, and then 2/15 right over there. So, this is going to be equal to 2/15. Now, another way that"
,,"you could think about, and over time this is the"
,,"way you will approach it, but it's nice to think"
,,"about it conceptually, when you divide by any number, it's the same thing as"
,,"multiplying by the reciprocal. So, five is the same thing"
,,"as five wholes, or 5/1. And so, 2/3 divided by"
,,"five is the same thing as 2/3 times the reciprocal of five, or the reciprocal of 5/1,"
,,which is you just swap the numerator and the
,,"denominator, which is 1/5. And so, another way of"
,,"thinking about this is this is 1/5 of 2/3, which"
,,"it once again will be this section right over here. The way you could compute this, conceptually, you see that this is 2/15, but you could also say well,"
,,"I could just multiply it. When I multiply fractions I can just multiply the numerators. Two times one is two. We do that same red color. Two times one is two, and then I could multiply"
,,"the denominators. Three times five is 15. And, hopefully, what we just drew out may help make sense of"
,,why dividing by something is the same thing as
,,"multiplying by the reciprocal. Then, when you multiply fractions, it's the same thing as"
,,"multiplying the numerators to get our new numerator,"
,,and then multiplying the denominators to get
,,our new denominator.

Operations of While number,4yp5v64XuRc,We're asked to compute
,,"3,060 divided by 36. We want to figure out how many"
,,times does 36-- I don't need to write it that big. We need to figure out how many
,,"times does 36 go into 3,060. Now, this is interesting because"
,,"we're dividing by a two-digit number, by 36. We're going to see in this video"
,,that the process is the exact same way. There's just going to be a
,,"little bit more mental estimation going on, but we'll"
,,"do it explicitly here, so hopefully, it won't"
,,"be too bad. So we first look at 36, and we"
,,"say, well, does 36 go into 3? Well, no. 3 is smaller than 36, so"
,,"it won't go into 3. Does 36 go into 30? No, 30 is still smaller than 36,"
,,"so it won't go into that. Does 36 go into 306? Well, sure. 306 is larger than 36, and if"
,,"we were to estimate it, 30 would go into 300 ten times, but"
,,"this is larger than 30, so it's going to go fewer times. Maybe it's 9. I'm not sure. Let's try it out. Let me try it out over"
,,on the side. What is 36 times 9? And this is kind of the art of
,,doing these problems when you're dividing a two-digit
,,"number into something. So 6 times 9 is 54. Regroup, or carry the 5. 3 times 9 is 27, plus 5. 27 plus 5 is 32. So 36 times 9 is 324. That's still larger than 306,    "
,,"so we're going to have to go 36 less than that,"
,,so we're going to have to do eight times. So we're going to have to
,,"go into it eight times. And remember, the way I thought"
,,about that is I said my first guess was maybe it goes
,,"in nine times, but when I tried out 36 times 9, that was"
,,"still larger than 306. That got me 324. Eight times should work, because"
,,"if you take 36 away, if you only do 8 times"
,,"36, that's going to take us below 300. 342, 136 away from that, or"
,,"another way, 324 minus 36 is going to get us below 300. So let's try this out"
,,and just make sure. 8 times 6 is 48. Put the 8 there; carry the 4. 8 times 3 is 24 plus 4 is 28. So 8 times 36 is 288
,,and it fits. It's less than 306. 9 would've been too much. It would've been greater
,,"than 306, so now we can just subtract. So we have 6 minus 8. We can't just subtract"
,,8 from 6. We have to do a little
,,bit of regrouping. Let's get a 10 from the ones
,,"place right here, but we can't borrow anything from here or"
,,"regroup anything from there, so let's go to the"
,,hundreds place. Let's take 1 from the hundreds
,,"place, and so this will become a 2, and then this 0 here"
,,will become a 10. Another way to think about it
,,"is this is now 10 tens. We took 100 from there,"
,,and we're now writing 100 as 10 tens. Or another way to think about it
,,"is you borrowed a 1, or you took a 1, really. You took a 1 from the"
,,"hundreds place. That made it into a 2, and"
,,then you put the 1 out in front of the 0. That's kind of the process
,,"way of thinking about it. Now, we have this 10 here,"
,,"and now we can borrow from this 10. So let's borrow from this 10. So this 10 can become a 9. 1 is really taken from it, and"
,,"then this 6 becomes a 16. Because if you think about it,"
,,"this 10 was really 10 tens. It's in the tens place, so when"
,,"you put a 10 there, it really means 10 tens. So if you take 1 away from it,"
,,"this is actually now 90, and we have 10 to give to this 6,"
,,"and 10 plus 6 is 16, so that's what we're really doing. But now we're ready to subtract,"
,,"so we have 16 minus 8 is 8, 9 minus 8 is 1,"
,,"and 2 minus 2 is 0. So we have 18 left over, and now"
,,we can bring down this 0 right here. Bring down that 0. So how many times does
,,"36 go into 180? And once again, this is going"
,,to be estimation. It's not going to
,,"be six times. 6 times 30 would be 180. 6 times 36 would be too big,"
,,"because 36 is bigger than 30, so let's try 5. Let's see if 5 works. So let's see. 5 times 6-- and there's"
,,a little trial and error here sometimes. 5 times 6 is 30. Put the 0; carry the 3. We don't need that. That's from last time. 5 times 3 is 15 plus 3 is 18. It looks like it works out. You subtract 180 from
,,"180, your get zero, so we have no remainder. So we're left with 36 goes in"
,,"3,060 eighty-five times. So this is equal to 85."

Operations of While number,STyoP3rCmb0,Let's see if we can
,,"multiply 9 times 0.6. Or another way to write it, we"
,,want to calculate 9 times 0.6. I'll write it like this-- 0.6. We want to figure out
,,what this is equal to. And I encourage you
,,to pause the video and try to figure
,,it out on your own. And I'll give you a
,,little bit of a hint. 0.6 is the same thing
,,as 6 divided by 10. We know that if we start with
,,"6, which we could write as 6.0, and if you were to divide"
,,"it by 10, dividing by 10 is equivalent to moving"
,,the decimal place one place to the left. So 6 divided by 10 is 0.6. We are moving the decimal
,,one place to the left. So I'm assuming you
,,given a go at it. But what I'm going
,,to do is use this that we already know to rewrite
,,what we're trying to multiply. So 9 times 0.6 is the
,,same thing is 9 times-- 0.6 is 6 divided by 10. And this expression
,,"right over here, we could either do the 6 divided"
,,"by 10 first, in which case we would get 0.6, and this"
,,would turn into this problem. Or we could do the
,,"9 times 6 first. And so let's do 9 times 6,"
,,"which we know how to calculate, and then divide by 10, which"
,,we also know how to do. That. all about just moving
,,"the decimal place. So we could write 9 times 6. 9 times 6, we"
,,"already know, is 54. I'll do that in orange--"
,,is going to be 54. So this right over here is 54. And now to get to
,,"this expression, we have to divide by 10. We have to divide by 10. And what happens when we"
,,divide something by 10? And we've seen this in previous
,,"videos, why this is the case. This is all about what"
,,decimal notation means. Each place represents 10
,,"times as much as the place to its right, or each place"
,,represents 1/10 of the place to the left. So 54 divided by
,,"10, this is going to be-- you could start with 54. And I'll put a 0 here"
,,after the decimal. And when you divide
,,"by 10, that's equivalent of shifting the"
,,decimal one to the left. This is going to
,,be equal to 5.4. And that should
,,make sense to you. 5 times 10 is 50. 0.4 times 10 is 4. So it makes sense that
,,54 divided by 10-- I shouldn't say equal. I'd write 54 divided
,,by 10 is equal to 5.4. So this right over
,,"here is equal to 5.4, and that's what this is. This is equal to 5.4. Notice, 9 times 6 is 54. 9 times 0.6 is 5.4. Now you might see a"
,,"little pattern here. Between these two numbers,"
,,"I had exactly one number to the right of the decimal. When I take its product, let's"
,,"say I ignored the decimal. I just said 9 times 6,"
,,I would've gotten 54. But then I have to
,,divide by 10 in order to take account of
,,"the decimal, take account of the fact"
,,this wasn't a 6. This was a 6/10. And so I have one number to
,,the right of the decimal here. And I want to you
,,to think about that whether that's a
,,general principle. Can we just count the
,,total numbers of digits to the right of the
,,decimals and then our product is going to have
,,the same number of digits to right of the decimal? I'll let you to
,,think about that.

Operations of While number,x0tTvUyF3sM,if I say our food as a picture come to your mind and when I was in school the picture that came to my mind was this symbol that that I saw in books for four but I also thought of maybe four pencils or four razors or four elephants some something for four of something so I used to imagine it as four dots and if you had told me five then I might have imagined five as also maybe five dots this was my way of imagining this number picturing this number another way to do that is to arrange all of them from left to right starting from zero I go one two three four and I keep going and going and going and how far can I go I'll can go forever I'll never reach a 
,,place where I say oh this is the biggest number I'm never going to reach that so I'll go forever and you can see that these are all whole numbers this entire family 
,,because I start from zero and count forever these are whole numbers so what I'm really doing here is just arranging all these whole numbers in a line from left to right so I can just call this my line of numbers line of numbers so I have to make sure that I don't miss any number I can't just write 0 1 3 5 it's not like that I have to read all the numbers 0 1 2 so I have to keep doing plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 and keep writing as long as I don't miss any number and if I start from 0 then I get my line of whole numbers now this line of whole numbers is just what we call a number line now it might sound all big and new when you first hear it but this is all it is it is just a line of numbers so you draw it slightly differently we draw it like this just kind of paste it here so this is how you draw it but this is the same 
,,thing it starts from 0 this dot represents 0 it jumps plus 1 so if you just add 1 to 0 you'll get 1 and then plus 1 again you'll get 2 and this goes on now you can imagine your dots again over here if you want to 0 has no dots 1 has 1 dot 2 has 2 dots 3 will have 3 dots and so on so to say that it goes for we put a little arrow 
,,over here this arrow is to say that hey this does not stop with eight it goes on but I'm too lazy to draw all of it so this is just to say that so this what we have 
,,over here is what we call a number line and in this case because it has all the whole numbers we might call it a whole number line or a number line of whole numbers 
,,now one thing I want you to notice here is that as you go from left to right here you get bigger and bigger 1 2 3 and so on you'll keep getting bigger and bigger so 
,,right is always bigger than left I'm gonna write that over here right bigger than left so that's that's because of the way we have drawn it from left to right and one step will mean plus one one step to the right will mean plus one and one step to the left will mean minus one now you can do many things with this if you're wondering why this is useful you can imagine adding subtracting multiplying and all of it on this and as you play with the number line more you will see that it's it's quite a bit useful it's a quite a quite a useful way of imagining numbers

Operations of While number,cLP7INqs3JM,So let's talk a little bit
,,about rational numbers. And the simple way to think
,,about it is any number that can be represented as
,,"the ratio of two integers is a rational number. So for example, any integer"
,,is a rational number. 1 can be represented as 1/1 or
,,"as negative 2 over negative 2 or as 10,000/10,000. In all of these cases, these are"
,,"all different representations of the number 1,"
,,ratio of two integers. And I obviously can
,,have an infinite number of representations
,,"of 1 in this way, the same number over"
,,the same number. The number negative 7 could be
,,"represented as negative 7/1, or 7 over negative 1, or"
,,"negative 14 over positive 2. And I could go on, and"
,,"on, and on, and on. So negative 7 is definitely"
,,a rational number. It can be represented as
,,the ratio of two integers. But what about things
,,"that are not integers? For example, let us imagine--"
,,"oh, I don't know-- 3.75. How can we represent that as"
,,"the ratio of two integers? Well, 3.75, you"
,,"could rewrite that as 375/100, which is the"
,,"same thing as 750/200. Or you could say, hey,"
,,3.75 is the same thing as 3 and 3/4-- so let
,,me write it here-- which is the same
,,"thing as-- that's 15/4. 4 times 3 is 12, plus 3 is"
,,"15, so you could write this. This is the same thing as 15/4. Or we could write this as"
,,negative 30 over negative 8. I just multiplied the
,,"numerator and the denominator here by negative 2. But just to be clear,"
,,this is clearly rational. I'm giving you multiple
,,examples of how this can be represented as
,,"the ratio of two integers. Now, what about"
,,"repeating decimals? Well, let's take"
,,"maybe the most famous of the repeating decimals. Let's say you have 0.333, just"
,,"keeps going on and on forever, which we can denote by"
,,putting that little bar on top of the 3. This is 0.3 repeating. And we've seen--
,,and later we'll show how you can convert
,,any repeating decimal as the ratio of two integers--
,,this is clearly 1/3. Or maybe you've seen things like
,,"0.6 repeating, which is 2/3. And there's many, many,"
,,many other examples of this. And we'll see any
,,"repeating decimal, not just one digit repeating. Even if it has a million"
,,"digits repeating, as long as the pattern"
,,starts to repeat itself over and over and
,,"over again, you can always represent that as"
,,the ratio of two integers. So I know what you're
,,"probably thinking. Hey, Sal, you've"
,,just included a lot. You've included all
,,of the integers. You've included all of finite
,,"non-repeating decimals, and you've also included"
,,repeating decimals. What is left? Are there any numbers
,,that are not rational? And you're probably
,,"guessing that there are, otherwise people"
,,wouldn't have taken the trouble of trying to
,,label these as rational. And it turns out-- as you
,,can imagine-- that actually some of the most famous
,,numbers in all of mathematics are not rational. And we call these numbers
,,irrational numbers. And I've listed there
,,just a few of the most noteworthy examples. Pi-- the ratio of
,,the circumference to the diameter of a circle--
,,is an irrational number. It never terminates. It goes on and on and on
,,"forever, and it never repeats. e, same thing-- never"
,,"terminates, never repeats. It comes out of continuously"
,,compounding interest. It comes out of
,,"complex analysis. e shows up all over the place. Square root of 2,"
,,"irrational number. Phi, the golden ratio,"
,,irrational number. So these things that
,,"really just pop out of nature, many of these"
,,"numbers are irrational. Now, you might say, OK,"
,,are these irrational? These are just these
,,special kind of numbers. But maybe most
,,"numbers are rational, and Sal's just picked out"
,,some special cases here. But the important thing to
,,"realize is they do seem exotic, and they are exotic"
,,in certain ways. But they aren't uncommon. It actually turns out
,,that there is always an irrational number between
,,"any two rational numbers. Well, we could go on and on. There's actually"
,,"an infinite number. But there's at least one,"
,,so that gives you an idea that you can't
,,really say that there are fewer irrational numbers
,,than rational numbers. And in a future
,,"video, we'll prove that you give me two rational"
,,"numbers-- rational 1, rational 2-- there's going to be"
,,"at least one irrational number between those, which"
,,"is a neat result, because irrational"
,,numbers seem to be exotic. Another way to think about it--
,,"I took the square root of 2, but you take the square root"
,,"of any non-perfect square, you're going to end up"
,,with an irrational number. You take the sum
,,of an irrational and a rational number-- and
,,we'll see this later on. We'll prove it to ourselves. The sum of an irrational
,,and a rational is going to be irrational. The product of an
,,"irrational and a rational is going to be irrational. So there's a lot, a lot, a"
,,lot of irrational numbers out there.

Operations of While number,mbc3_e5lWw0, If you're
,,watching a movie and someone is attempting to do fancy
,,"mathematics on a chalkboard, you'll almost always see a"
,,symbol that looks like this. This radical symbol. And this is used to show the square root and we'll see other
,,"types of roots as well, but your question is, well, what does this thing actually mean? And now that we know a"
,,"little bit about exponents, we'll see that the square"
,,root symbol or the root symbol or the radical is not
,,"so hard to understand. So, let's start with an example. So, we know that three to"
,,"the second power is what? Three squared is what? Well, that's the same"
,,"thing as three times three and that's going to be equal to nine. But what if we went the other way around? What if we started with the nine, and we said, well, what "
,,times
,,"itself is equal to nine? We already know that answer is three, but how could we use a"
,,"symbol that tells us that? So, as you can imagine,"
,,"that symbol is going to be the radical here. So, we could write the"
,,"square root of nine, and when you look at"
,,"this way, you say, okay, what squared is equal to nine? And you would say, well,"
,,"this is going to be equal to, this is going to be equal to, three. And I want you to really look at these two equations right over here, because this is the essence "
,,"of the square root symbol. If you say the square root of nine, you're saying what times"
,,"itself is equal to nine? And, well, that's going to be three. And three squared is equal"
,,"to nine, I can do that again. I can do that many times. I can write four, four"
,,"squared, is equal to 16. Well, what's the square"
,,"root of 16 going to be? Well, it's going to be equal to four. Let me do it again. Actually, let me start"
,,"with the square root. What is the square root of 25 going to be? Well, this is the number that"
,,"times itself is going to be equal to 25 or the number,"
,,"where if I were to square it, I'd get to 25. Well, what number is that, well, that's going to be equal to five. Why, because we know that"
,,"five squared is equal to, five squared is equal to 25. Now, I know that there's a nagging feeling that some of you might be having, because if I were to take negative three, and square it, and square"
,,"it I would also get positive nine, and the same"
,,thing if I were to take negative four and I were
,,"to square the whole thing, I would also get positive"
,,"16, or negative five, and if I square that I"
,,"would also get positive 25. So, why couldn't this thing"
,,"right over here, why can't this square root be positive"
,,"three or negative three? Well, depending on who you talk to, that's actually a reasonable"
,,thing to think about. But when you see a
,,"radical symbol like this, people usually call"
,,"this the principal root. Principal root. Principal, principal square root. Square root. And another way to think"
,,"about it, it's the positive, this is going to be the"
,,positive square root. If someone wants the
,,"negative square root of nine, they might say something like this. They might say the negative,"
,,"let me scroll up a little bit, they might say something like the negative square root of nine. Well, that's going to be"
,,equal to negative three. And what's interesting
,,"about this is, well, if you square both sides"
,,"of this, of this equation, if you were to square both"
,,"sides of this equation, what do you get? Well negative, anything negative"
,,squared becomes a positive. And then the square root
,,"of nine squared, well, that's just going to be nine. And on the right-hand side,"
,,"negative three squared, well, negative three times"
,,"negative three is positive nine. So, it all works out. Nine is equal, nine is equal to nine. And so this is an"
,,"interesting thing, actually. Let me write this a little"
,,"bit more algebraically now. If we were to write, if we were to write the principal root of nine is equal to x. This is, there's only one"
,,"possible x here that satisfies it, because the standard convention, what most mathematicians"
,,"have agreed to view this radical symbol as, is that this is a principal square root, this"
,,"is the positive square root, so there's only one x here. There's only one x that"
,,"would satisfy this, and that is x is equal to three. Now, if I were to write x"
,,"squared is equal to nine, now, this is slightly different. X equals three definitely satisfies this. This could be x equals"
,,"three, but the other thing, the other x that satisfies this is x could also be"
,,"equal to negative three, 'cause negative three squared"
,,"is also equal to nine. So, these two things,"
,,"these two statements, are almost equivalent,"
,,"although when you're looking at this one, there's two"
,,"x's that satisfy this one, while there's only one x"
,,"that satisfies this one, because this is a positive square root. If people wanted to write"
,,something equivalent where you would have two
,,"x's that could satisfy it, you might see something like this. Plus or minus square root"
,,"of nine is equal to x, and now x could take on positive"
,,three or negative three.

Operations of While number,X3JqIZR1XcY,Let's think about
,,different ways that we can represent the number 675. So the most obvious
,,way is to just look at the different place values. So the 6 is in the
,,hundreds place. It literally represents 600. So that's 600. I'm going to do that
,,"in the red color-- 600. The 7 is in the tens place. It represents 7 tens, or 70. And then the 5 in"
,,the ones place. It represents 5. So let me copy and paste
,,this and then think about how we can regroup the
,,value in the different places to represent this
,,in different ways. So let me copy and
,,"let me paste it, and maybe I'll do"
,,"it three times. So let me do it once, and"
,,let me do it one more time. So one thing that we could do is
,,"we could regroup from one place to the next. So, for example,"
,,we could take if we wanted to-- we could take
,,1 from the hundreds place. Taking 1 from the hundreds
,,place will make this a 5. That's essentially
,,taking 100 away. So this is really
,,making this a 500. And we could give
,,"that 100 to-- well, we could actually give"
,,"it to either place, but let's give it"
,,to the tens place. So we're going to give
,,"100 to the tens place. Now, if you give 100"
,,"to the tens place and you already had 70 there,"
,,"what's it going to be equal to? Well, it's going"
,,"to be equal to 170. Well, how would we"
,,"represent that is tens? Well, 170 is 17 tens. So we could just say"
,,"that 7 becomes 17. Now, we could keep doing that. We could regroup some of"
,,"this value in the tens place to the ones place. So, for example, we could"
,,give 10 from the tens place and give it to the ones place. Let's do that. So let's take 10 away from here. So that becomes 160. This becomes 16. And let's give that 
,,"10 to the ones place. Well, what does the"
,,"ones place now become? Well, 10 plus 5 is 15. So this 5 is now a 15. Let's do another scenario. Let's do something nutty. Let's take 200 from"
,,"the hundreds place. So this is going to now 4, and"
,,this is going to become 400. That's what this
,,4 now represents. And let's give 100
,,to the tens place. And let's give another
,,"100 to the ones place. So in other words, I'm"
,,"just regrouping that 200. Those 200's, I've taken"
,,"from the hundreds place, and I'm going to give it"
,,to these other places. So now the tens place
,,is going to be 170. We're going to have 170
,,"here, which is 17 tens. So you could say that"
,,the tens place is now 17. And now the ones
,,"place, well, I had 5, and now I'm going"
,,"to add 100 to it. So it's going to be 105. And 105 ones is literally 105. And notice, this is 400 plus"
,,"17 tens, which is 170 plus 105. You add these together,"
,,"you're still going to get 675. Let's do that again. So let's take, I don't know. Let's take all of"
,,the hundreds away. Let's take all of
,,the hundreds away. So that goes zero. That goes zero. And let's give 400
,,to the tens place. So let's give 400
,,"to the tens place. Well, that'll make that 470. Let me do that in"
,,"that green color. That will make that 470, which"
,,is the same thing as 47 tens. And then I still have 200
,,to give to the ones place. So let me do that. So I still have 200 to
,,give to the ones place. And so that's going
,,"to go from 5 to 205. Once again, all"
,,I've done is I've regrouped the value
,,in the number 675. Any of these still
,,represent 675. You can add these
,,numbers on the right. They all add up to 675.

Operations of While number,BItpeFXC4vA,"So I have a number written here. It's a 2, a 3, and a 5. And we already have some"
,,experience with numbers like this. We can think about
,,'what does it represent'. And to think about that we just have
,,to look at the actual place values. So this right-most place right over here.
,,"This is the ones place. So this 5 represents five ones, or I guess"
,,"you could say that's just going to be 5. This 3, this is in the tens place. This is"
,,"the tens place, so we have three tens. So that's just going to be 30. And the 2 is in the hundreds place. So putting a 2 there means"
,,that we have two hundreds. So this number we can view as
,,"two hundred, thirty, five. Or you could view it as"
,,two hundred plus thirty plus five. Now what I want to do in this video
,,is think about place values to the right of the ones place.
,,"And you might say 'wait, wait, I always thought"
,,"that the ones place was the place furthest to the right.' Well everything that we've done so far,"
,,it has been. But to show that you can go
,,even further to the right I'm going to put a little dot. I'm going
,,to put a little dot right over here. We call that a 'decimal point'. And that dot means that anything
,,"to the right of this is going to be place values that are smaller,"
,,"I guess you could say, than the ones place. So right to the left"
,,you have the ones place and the tens place and
,,"the hundreds place, and if you were to keep going"
,,you'd go to the thousands place and the ten thousands place. But then if
,,you go to the right of the decimal point now you're going to divide by 10.
,,"So what am I talking about? Well, right to the right of"
,,the decimal point you are going to have-- find a new color-- this is going to be the tenths place. Well what does that mean? Well whatever number I write here that tells us how many tenths
,,we're dealing with. So if I were to write the number 4
,,"right over here, now my number is 2 hundreds plus 3 tens plus 5 ones"
,,plus 4 tenths. So you could view this a 4 times 1/10. Or you could write this as 4 tenths.
,,"Not tens, 4 tenths. Or 4 tenths is the same thing as this"
,,right over here. So this is a super important idea
,,in mathematics. I can now use our place values
,,"to represent fractions. So this right over here, this 'point 4',"
,,"this is 4/10. So another way to write this number-- I could write it this way, I could write"
,,"it as two hundred, thirty-- let me do the thirty in blue-- two hundred"
,,"and thirty five and four tenths. So I could write it like this,"
,,as a mixed number. So this up here would be a
,,decimal representation: 235.4 And this right over here would be a mixed number representation:
,,235 and 4/10 but they all represent 200
,,plus 30 plus 5 plus 4/10. Let's look at a few more examples of this. So let's say I were to write the number 0.7--
,,and actually let me go one space even further to the right-- 0.76. So what would this be if I were
,,to write it as a fraction? So let's just think about the place value. We have our decimal point. To the left of the decimal point
,,"is the ones place, but I have a zero there,"
,,"so this is 0 ones. Now I have 7 tenths, so this is"
,,the tenths place. And then this is going to be this place
,,to the right of that. We're going to divide by 10 again. So this is going to be the
,,hundredths place. This space right over here is
,,going to be the hundredths place. So this number right over here is--
,,we can rewrite it as 0-- let me write it this way-- we could
,,"rewrite it as 0 ones plus 7 tenths-- plus 7 tenths--- not tens, tenths-- plus 6 hundredths-- plus 6 hundredths-- not hundreds, hundredths. Or we could write this as "
,,0 plus 7/10-- let me write that a little bit neater--
,,plus 7/10 plus 6/100-- 6 over 100. So you could write this-- 7/10 plus
,,"6/100 is exactly what this is. You could say this is 0 ones,"
,,"7 tenths, and 6 hundredths. Now another way we could"
,,"write this-- well look, if we wanted to write it as a fraction, or talk"
,,"about it as a fraction-- I could ignore the 0, that's not going to change the"
,,value of the sum but I could add the 7/10 to the 6/100. So how could
,,I write 7/10 in terms of hundredths? Well 7 over 10 is the same thing as
,,"70 over 100. 7/10 is the same thing as 70 over 100. One way to thing about it is, if"
,,"I multiply the denominator by 10 well, I can multiply the numerator by 10"
,,as well and not change the value of it. 7/10 is the same thing as 70/100.
,,And then you could add 6/100 to that-- 6/100 to that.
,,And what will that give you? Well that's going to give you 76/100-- 76/100. So this number up here--
,,a lot of people will call this-- they might say
,,'zero point seven six' or they might call this
,,"'seventy-six hundredths'. This is the hundredths place,"
,,this is the tenths place. But each tenth is worth
,,ten hundredths. And you see that-- you could
,,either view this as 7 tenths. or you could view it
,,as 70 hundredths. So this is 76 hundredths. And you could keep going to the right. If you go to the right one more space you would get to the thousandths place and then the ten thousandths place. So you keep dividing by 10
,,each place you go to the right. And you multiply by 10
,,each place you go to the left.

Operations of While number,HAhg0uXn9GA,"welcome to math with mr. J in this video I'm going to be doing a review of how to add subtract multiply and divide whole numbers so a quick refresher on those four things now if you're looking for more examples or a more in-depth explanation of these things I drop the link down to my whole number videos down in the description if you're ready for this review let's jump right into number one here where we have addition now for addition and subtraction one of the most important things is getting your problem lined up properly and we need to line up our places so the ones place the tens place hundreds so on and so forth so for this one we have five thousand eighty two plus nine hundred fifty-seven so again I have my ones place my tens place my hundreds and thousands place here everything's lined up now I'm ready to add so 2 plus 7 is 9 8 plus 5 is 13 1 plus 9 is 10 and 1 plus 5 is 6 so the answer would be 6,000 39 number two subtraction same thing as addition we need to make sure our places are lined up then we can subtract so 813 minus 298 now this is a borrowing subtraction problem because we cannot do 3 minus 8 that would get us into the negatives which we're we are not going to deal with for this problem so we need to borrow so we borrow from the 1 and it's now a zero this 3 is now a 13 so 13 minus 8 is 5 I cannot do 0-9 so I need to borrow from the 8 the 8 is now a 7 and that 0 is a 10 10 minus 9 is 1 now 7 minus 2 will wrap the problem up and give us 5 so our difference or solution to that subtraction problem is 515 on to multiplication so we have 452 times 72 so again let's line our places up and for multiplication we "
,,need to take our 2 to the 2 5 & 4 and then the 7 to the 2 5 & 4 so 2 times 2 is 4 2 times 5 is 10 2 times 4 is 8 plus that one is 9 I'm done with this - and I'm done with that regrouped 1 I'm moving on to the tens place now so that 7 has a value of 70 so I need a 0 here for my second partial product because again that 7 has a value of 70 so now I need to do 7 times 2 is 14 7 times 5 is 35 Plus that one is 36 7 times 4 is 28 plus that 3 is 31 now I'm ready to add my these are called partial 
,,products here partial products I can add them up to get my product or answer so 4 plus 0 is 4 0 plus 4 is 4 9 plus 6 is 15 regroup my 1 1 plus 1 is 2 and then bring 
,,"down my 3 here so my answer or product to a multiple product which is an answer to a multiplication problem 32,500 forty-four and lastly we have division so 918 918 "
,,divided by 34 so the first thing I need to do 9 divided by 34 which I cannot do and get a whole number so I need to move to my 91 here and do 91/30 4 so how many whole groups of 34 can I pull out of 91 well only two that gives me 268 that is as close as I can get so I need a 2 above the 91 do not put it above the 9 because that 
,,is going to mess up the alignment with how our places and where the numbers need to be and it's going to give us an incorrect answer and kind of throw us off so it needs to go above the 91 now we do 2 times 34 is 68 we subtract and we get 23 bring down our 8 now we have 238 divided by 34 now you might not know off the top of your head how many whole 34s can I pull out it 238 so it might take some estimating and checking so for example I know 34 times 10 is 340 well 238 is pretty well below 
,,that so maybe we start with trying 34 times 6 and seeing how close we get well that gives us 204 which hmm let's see if we can get any closer let's try 7 just in case we can get any closer 34 times 7 actually hits 238 exactly so we put a 7 up here because 238 divided by 34 is 7 now we multiply 7 times 34 is 238 subtract and we did a remainder of zero so our quotient or answer to a division problem is 27 so there you have it there's the whole number review now I went kind of fast through those because this is meant to be a review or a refresher just in case you needed a little help or reminder with any of those and like I said at the beginning if you need a more in-depth or slower explanation more examples of any of those I put the links to my whole number videos in the description hopefully that helped thanks so much for watching until next time peace

Operations of While number,dAgfnK528RA,"Hi and welcome to Math Antics. Today were gonna talk about an important math concept called Order of Operations. Order of Operations is just a set of math rules that tell you which math operations (like addition or multiplication) to do first. Now you might be wondering (especially if youre a teenager), Why do I need RULES to tell me which operations to do first?  Cant I just do them in any order I want? Well, thats a really good questions! And to answer it, were going to give two TOTALLY different people the SAME math problem to solve. The problem is: 2 + 5  4 Hmmm I like addition better than multiplication, so Im gonna do that first! Lets "
,,"see 2 + 5 gives us 7.  And then I just multiply that 7 by the 4 and I get 28. That was easy!  But youd better not copy my answer! Uh, dont worry Im not gonna copy your answer, cuz I want the RIGHT answer! And I prefer multiplying, so Im going to do THAT first. Lets see 4  5 = 20, and THEN Ill add the 2 which gives me 22 for a final answer. What makes you think THATS the right answer?  All my calculations were correct. I even checked it with a calculator! Pfffff - the only calculator I need is right up here! And the correct answer is boop, boop, boop boop, boop. 22! Okay, so which one of these guys do you think is right?  Neither one made any mistakes with the calculations. They just did the operations in a different order and got DIFFERENT answers! Well since there were no mistakes, in a way, they were BOTH right! But math would be a VERY confusing subject if there were different answers to the same problem. And thats where Order of Operations can help us out. "
,,"The Order of Operations Rules are a way for us all to agree on the order that you should do math operations in. And if we always do operations in the same order, then well always get the same answer. So now that you know WHY we need Order of Operations rules, lets find out what those rules are. Therere basically four of them "
,,"and they go something like this: FIRST: do operation in parentheses and brackets NEXT: do exponents THEN: do multiplication and division LAST: do addition and subtraction Lets take a closer look at each one of these rules, and see some examples where they will help us. First on the list was:  do operations in parentheses and brackets. Now in case you havent seen parentheses or brackets used in math before, let me briefly explain how they work. Parentheses are just these symbols that curve forwards and backwards, and theyre used in pairs like this. And when we put numbers and operators in between them, it forms a group. Its almost like the parentheses form a package to hold whatever math stuff we put inside them. And brackets work exactly the same way as parentheses. They just have a different shape that looks "
,,"a little more boxy, but they mean exactly the same thing. So parentheses and brackets are used to group things together, and our rules tell us to do any operations inside these groups FIRST. For example, have a look at this problem: 10  (4 + 5) It has 3 numbers and 2 operations: multiplication and addition. But 2 of the numbers and the addition symbol are inside parentheses. That means that they form a group and we need to do that part of the problem first. 4 + 5 = 9, so the part inside the parentheses can just be replaced with the simplified value 9. Oh and once you do the math thats inside parentheses and get a single number like this, you usually dont need to show the parentheses anymore. Now that the parentheses are gone, we just have one operation left to do. We multiply 10  9 and that gives us 90 as our final answer. So parentheses can really help you know what part of a problem youre supposed to do first. But what if you get a problem that has more than one set of parentheses, like this:   (5 ? 3) + (6  2) Fortunately, it doesnt matter which set of parentheses you do first. You just need to do everything thats inside the "
,,"parentheses BEFORE you do anything that's NOT inside parentheses. In other words, we need to simplify BOTH of our parentheses groups before we can do this addition IN-BETWEEN them. The first group (5 ? 3) simplifies to 2, and the second group (6  2) simplifies to 12. Now we can do the last operation and add the values that we got from simplifying: 2 + 12 = 14 Okay, now that we know we always do operation in parentheses or brackets FIRST, lets take a closer look at the second rule that says the next thing we do is exponents. Now if you havent seen exponents before, theyre just a way of writing repeated multiplication. For example, the repeated multiplication 4  4 can be written in a shorter form as 4 multiplied twice. And 4  4  4 can be written as 4 multiplied 3 times, and 4  4  4  4 can be written as 4 multiplied 4 times.  get the idea? This small number is called an exponent (or power). It just tells you how many times to multiply the bigger number together. So after we take care of any parentheses, simplifying any exponents becomes the next highest priority. For example in this problem, we have to simplify the exponent BEFORE we can do the other multiplication. The exponent is telling us to multiply 5 together twice.  So 5 times 5 is 25. And after we do that, THEN we multiply the result by 3.  So 25 times 3 is 75. Oh, and one thing I should point out sometimes youll get a problem that has exponents inside of parentheses, like this problem. And you may wonder, How can I get rid of the parentheses BEFORE I do the exponent? You might think that if you simplify the exponent first, youre breaking the rules. But the truth is that by doing whatever operations are inside the parentheses, you ARE doing the parentheses first. The parentheses really just tell you where to start. So in this problem, first we do 3 to the power of 2, which means 3  3 which is 9. Then the part inside the parentheses is 9  4, which equals 36. And once the parentheses are gone, we add 36 + 6 and get 42 as our final answer. Alright, now were gonna look at the last two rules together. These two rules are really important because they deal with the most common math operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication & division. And the rules tell us that we need to do multiplication and "
,,"division BEFORE we do addition and subtraction. To see how these rules work, lets look at a few quick examples that use those basic operations. First lett try this "
,,"one:  2 + 5 + 4  Ah Ha! Does this look familiar? Yep, its the one we gave to my two friends earlier. And now that we have our rules, we see that we have to do the "
,,"multiplication before the addition. 5  4 = 20 and THEN we add the 2, which gives us 22 so the second guy WAS right! [Sarcastically] What a surprise! Now lets try "
,,"this one:  3  5 ? 1 Our rules tell us that multiplication is higher on the list than subtraction, so we do 3  5 first. That gives us 15, and THEN we subtract the 1 which leaves 14 as our final answer. Heres one with division and subtraction: 20 ? 10  5 And since division has a higher priority, we do the 10 divided by 5 first, which equals 2. And then we subtract 2 from 20 and get 18 as our final answer. And heres another problem: 12  6 + 5 Again, our rules say to do the division before addition, so 12 divided by 6 equals 2 and then we add the 5 to get 7. And heres one last problem: 40  4  5 Which do we do first? the multiplication or the division?  Our rules dont tell us. Well, thats because multiplication and division are TIED for priority or importance.  So are addition and subtraction. And THATS "
,,"the reason we need an extra part at the end of each of these rule that says from left to right If you have a problem that has BOTH multiplication AND division, then youre supposed to work it from left to right. Thats because in some cases, you can get a different answers if you go from right to left. For example, in this problem, if you work from right to left (the wrong way) you would do the 4  5 first and get 20. And then 40 divided by 20 equals 2. But if you go from left to right, you would do 40 divided by 4 first, which is 10, and then 10 times 5 equals 50. Wow! The direction we went made a BIG difference. So whenever you have a problem that "
,,"has a mixture of multiplication and division OR a mixture of addition and subtraction, you know to do the operations in order from left to right. Alright, were just about done, but lets have one more look at all four of our rules before you start practicing with the exercises. The Order of Operations rules say: FIRST: do operation in parentheses and brackets NEXT: do exponents THEN: do multiplication and division (from left to right) LAST: do addition and subtraction (from left to right) "

Operations of While number,mqPqfR6UgqM,we know that four and five are whole numbers what is four plus five it's nine nine is also a whole number even the numbers 22 and 33 are whole numbers what is 22 plus 33 you're correct it's 55 and 55 is also a whole number are you getting a gist of what I'm trying to say also if I add two whole numbers 350 and 620 the answer to 
,,"that is again a whole number similarly 28,000 plus 50 9,000 also result in a whole number whenever we add any two whole numbers the resultant number that we get is also a whole number and this is the first property of a whole number however instead of this we say that whole numbers are closed under addition this is just a mathematical way of saying it this statement is actually the same as this if I add any two whole numbers the number that I get will also be a whole number now here is a question for you to answer our whole numbers closed under subtraction pause the video and give it a thought first of all let's understand what the question means what "
,,do we mean by closed under subtraction it means that if we take any two whole numbers and subtract them then we will always get whole number will this way always happen let's try to find this out by subtracting any two random whole numbers 35 minus 20 is equal to 15 we subtracted two whole numbers and we got whole number again similarly one thousand minus 999 will give us one a whole number again what about five minus eight what will we get when we subtract eight from five wait a moment can we even subtract eight from five no we can't do that even if we try to subtract them here's what we get a negative number we are not talking about negative numbers 
,,"now you will learn that in the future lessons but we know that this is certainly not a whole number hence we will term this subtraction as invalid similarly if you subtract 100 from 50 the answer that you will get is a negative number both numbers are not whole numbers so we can say whole numbers are not closed under subtraction what about multiplication our whole numbers closed under multiplication yes they are closed under multiplication when you multiply any two whole numbers you will always get a whole number here are a few examples to support this argument 5 times 5 is 25 a whole number 1 times 1,000 is 1,000 a whole number again let's involve the whole numbers 0 0 times 10 is what when you multiply any number with 0 we get 0 again so it's 0 we take any two whole numbers and multiply them the answer that we get will always be a whole number here's a quick recap of what we studied so far in this video we learned that whole numbers are closed under addition not closed under and closed under multiplication these three are arithmetic operations that we commonly use is there another one which is the fourth most common operation that you "
,,know of its division I'm sure that you must have already guessed the next question that I'm going to ask you our whole numbers closed under division four and two are whole numbers and if we divide 4 by 2 we get a whole number again but if we divide 6 by 5 the answer we will get will be in decimals which is not a whole number similarly examples such as 3 divided by 12 4/9 will not result in whole numbers hence we say that whole numbers are not closed under division what is 0 divided by 4 it's 0 and what is 4 divided by 0 is it also 0 or perhaps some other number in order to understand this we first need to be sure that we know the meaning of division we have studied arithmetic operations and the fact is that among all the arithmetic operations students find division to be the most difficult one what is division when we divide a number 8 but therefore what actually are we doing imagine the scenario there are 8 chocolates and 4 people and we want to distribute these 8 chocolates to 4 people such that everyone gets equal number of chocolates how many chocolates will a single person get each person will get 2 chocolates how did we get this to yes we divided 8 by 4 and that gave us 2 or in other words we divided the number of chocolates available equally among all the people now let's say instead of 4 there are two people now how will we divide ate chocolates between two people how many chocolates will each person get you're absolutely correct each one will get 4 chocolates let's act a bit crazy now let us divide eight chocolates equally among zero people that is 8 divided by zero does it even makes sense to divide eight chocolates amongst no one no it doesn't hence we say this is undefined or in other words any whole number divided by zero is undefined on the same lines these are all undefined quantities we will see another property of whole numbers in the next video

Operations of While number,CdTUq5TTDEo,hello children today i'm here to teach you chapter 3 in your textbook that's operations on whole numbers in this lesson we are only considering whole numbers write down the four mathematical operations you know what are the basic four operations that you know addition subtraction multiplication and division so those are the four basic mathematical operations that you know now take a look at this one so same whole number with four different mathematical symbols operations 8 plus 4 we are adding 8 minus 4 means subtracting you get 4 8 times 4 multiplied by 4 you get 32 and here 8 divided by 4 you get 2. appearing above is how the four mathematical operations of addition subtraction multiplication and division are used only once look at this one you get three whole numbers so we'll add these two first three plus two 
,,you get five then add seven to that five plus seven twelve now we'll take the last two first and then edit 2 plus 7 what you get 9 3 plus 9 you get the same answer so no difference in the answer is experience even either 3 and 2 are first added or 2 and 7 added first so in addition order is not important simplify each expression appearing below and get the answer so here two plus eight ten ten plus seven seventy now we'll do the other way round eight plus seven first 15 and 15 plus 2 17. you get the same answer 5 plus 7 first that's 12. 12 plus 3 you get 15. now we'll take 7 plus 3 first that's 10 5 plus 10 that's 15. you get the same one we'll do first one 8 plus 2 you get 10 here 10 plus 7 you get 17. now the last two first 2 plus 7 you get 9. 8 plus 9 you get 70. so order is not important in addition 6 plus 4 10 10 plus 5 you get 15. now do the next one other way around 4 plus 5 first that's 9 6 plus 9 you get 15. first two numbers first 9 plus 3 12 12 plus 4 16. last two 
,,first 3 plus 4 7 9 plus 7 you get the same 16. 12 plus 4 16 plus 3 you get 90. 4 plus 3 7 7 plus 12 you get 90. here also we see order is not important in addition eleven plus nine you get twenty twenty plus eight twenty eight last two first eight plus nine seventeen seventeen plus eleven you get twenty eight fifteen plus four you get ninety nineteen plus three 20 2 4 plus 3 7 7 plus 15 you get the same answer 22 6 plus 6 12 12 plus six you get eighteen here six plus six twelve six plus twelve again eighty seven plus zero 7 7 plus 3 you get 10 here when you add the last 2 0 plus 3 3 7 plus 3 again you get 10 same answer write the answer of the expressions with only the addition at once so we found out you can either add from the left side or any two first and then add the other number so we'll add from left to right 6 plus 3 9 9 plus 8 17 2 plus 9 eleven plus five sixteen six plus four ten ten plus three thirty seven plus seven fourteen fourteen plus seven 21 8 plus 2 10 10 plus 4 14 3 plus 7 10 10 plus 2 12 7 plus 4 11 11 plus 3 14 9 plus 9 18 18 plus 9 20 7 six plus eight fourteen fourteen plus eight what's fourteen plus eight twenty two four plus four eight eight plus zero that's it now we'll look at this one this is multiplication first we'll multiply the first two three times two you get six then six with four you get twenty four now we'll do the last two numbers multiplication two times four eight three times eight you get the same answer as addition so when there is only the multiplication both above method give the same answer so order of operation is not important in multiplication as well get the answer by multiplying each of the following expressions two times three six six times four you get 24. now we'll do last two first three into four twelve two times twelve you get the same answer five times two ten ten times three thirty then last two three times two six five times six you get the same answer this one seven times two fourteen fourteen times two you get 28 2 times 2 4 7 times 4 you get 28 as well look at this one 8 times 3 24 24 times 4 what you get 4 times 4 16 1 remaining 4 times 2 8 plus 
,,1 9 here 3 times 4 12. eight times twelve eight times two sixteen one remaining eight times one eight plus one nine so you get the same answer ninety six this one first two numbers six times two twelve twelve times two you get twenty four now last two first two times two four here six times four twenty-four seven times three twenty-one twenty-one times three you get sixty three three times three nine times 9 you get 63 as well so here what we can see for multiplication is also odd is not important eleven times three thirty-three thirty-three times two you get sixty six three times two six here eleven eleven times six also you get sixty-six six times five thirty thirty times three you get ninety and here five times three fifteen six times fifty multiply separately 6 times 5 30 3 remaining 6 times 1 6 plus 3 9. so 90 find the answer of the expressions with only multiplication now odd is not important so we'll start from left 2 times 2 4 4 times 3 12 7 times 2 14 14 times 2 20 8. 5 times 3 15 15 times 2 you get 30. 8 times 1 8 8 times three twenty-four eleven times two twenty-two twenty-two times three you get sixty six eight times one eight eight times two sixteen nine times two eighteen eighteen times three three times eight twenty-four two remaining three times one three plus two five four times four sixteen sixteen times one that's sixteen eleven times one eleven eleven times two 22 2 x 1 2 2 x 11 22 the answers of expression with either addition or multiplication do not change however they are simplified so order is not important now the combination of addition and multiplication look at this one 3 plus two when you add 
,,it you get five then five times five you get 25 here if you do last two first two times five ten and three plus ten thirteen now what happens answers are not the same so what's the mistake there shall not be two answers when the same expression is simplified the above expression consists of the mathematical operations plus and multiplication so what's the correct way of doing when you get addition and multiplication at once here plus has been used first and multiplication did however multiplication should be done first according to the stand so remember that even though when you start from left you get plus sign you can't do plus first you have to first do multiplication and then do addition so what's the correct way of doing so this is actually wrong and here this one is correct because first multiplication and then consider addition so here what's the multiplication here 3 times 2 6 and then add 5 to that you get 11. so that's the correct way of adding and multiplying at once simplify the following expressions use only additional subtraction now now some questions addition sum with subtraction so what you do so we can add these two 10 
,,plus 2 you get 12 12 plus 5 70. what can you do here you can do subtraction and see 7 minus 4 you get 3 3 plus 5 so here three three plus five you get eight six plus four ten ten minus three you get seven eight plus 7 15 15 minus 5 you get 10 9 plus 11 that's 20 20 minus 3 17. seven minus three four four plus nine thirteen this 
,,one eight minus six you get two two plus two four six minus five one one plus nine ten three plus seven ten ten minus eight you get two 6 minus 5 1 1 plus 9 10. parts only with division and multiplication should be simplified from left to right as the first step and then the paths only with addition subtraction should be simplified from left to right so it's easy to follow from left to right so when you get an expression with combination of operations you first check what's the first symbol if it is multiplication or division you have to do that first compared to addition and subtraction simplify the following expressions used only multiplication and division now we start from left 24 divided by 4 6 six times three eighteen twenty-four times two forty-eight forty-eight divided by three three times one three for eighteen that's 6. now left to right first multiplication 9 times 2 18. 18 divided by 6 that's 3. 10 times 550 50 divided by 25 how many 25s are there for 50 you get 2. now the division first 9 divided by three that's three three times eight twenty-four twenty-two divided by eleven you get two two times seven fourteen 24 times 2 48 48 divided by 16 that's 3 next one 33 multiplied by 2 66 divide by 11 you get 6 there starting from left 15 divided by 5 that's 3. 3 times 3 9 16 divided by 4 you 
,,get 4 4 times 2 8. simplify from left to right even when mathematical operation subtraction or division is applied twice so always start from left what we can do 12 
,,minus 5 that's 7. so 1 minus 3 4. starting from left 18 minus 7 you get 11 11 minus 6 5. look at this one starting from left 48 divided by 6 you get eight eight divide by two that's four eighty divided by ten is eight eight divided by four you get two simplify the following expressions now we'll do starting from left seven minus three four four plus four you get eight eight minus two six 6 plus 6 12 9 plus 5 14 14 minus 2 you get 12 11 plus three fourteen fourteen minus seven answer is seven eleven minus three four four minus three you get 1 15 minus 3 that's 12 12 minus 2 that's 10. 12 plus 8 20. 20 minus fifteen answer is five twenty three minus twenty that's three three plus seven answer is ten simplify the following expressions so start from left 40 divided by 10 that's 4. 4 times 2 you get 8. 80 divided by 8 
,,that's ten ten times three you get thirty fifty times two hundred hundred divided by twenty five how many twenty fives four hundred you get 4 40 times 2 80. 80 divided by 16. you get 5. 5 times 6 30 3 remaining 5 times 1 5 plus 3 you get 80. this one 9 times 2 18. 18 divided by 6 get 3 24 divided by 3 you get 8 8 times 4 32 21 divided by 3 you get 7 7 divided by 7 answer is 1. 32 divided by 2 16 16 divide by 8 you get 2. so when you get any operation start from left this one 15 times 2 30. 
,,30 divided by 10 you get 3 21 times 2 42 42 divided by 7 you get 6 here simplify the following expressions start from left 15 divided by 5 and also remember multiplication of division comes you have to do that one first compared to addition or subtraction so division comes first 15 divided by 5 that's 3 3 minus 3 0 division first 20 divided by 2 10 10 minus 8 you get 2 division first here also 32 divided by 8 is 4 4 minus 3 answer is 1. 24 divided by 12 is 2 2 minus 2 answers 0. now this one don't do 50 minus 8 that's you have to multiply first 8 times 2 16 now subtraction 50 minus 16 so you get 4 here 10 so 2 remaining so 2 there so 3 is the answer 34 which one we need to do first division first 16 divided by 2 8 20 minus 8 you get 12. now division first not the subtraction 10 divided by 10 is 1 40 minus 1 that's 39 this one first division 24 divided by 8 is 3 3 minus 2 that's 1. which one first the division so 8 divided by 2 4 then you do the addition from left to right 5 plus 4 9 9 plus 3 12 this one the division first 15 divided by 5 is 3 then 30 plus 3 33 33 plus 3 36 write correct mark for true expressions and wrong mark for false 
,,expressions now subtraction addition there's no order 8 minus four four four plus three seven that's correct this one division first nine divided by three three three plus one you are getting 4 not 10. this one multiplication first 16 times 8 8 times 6 48 4 remaining 8 times 1 8 plus 4 12 128 minus 10 that's the answer 118 but the answer is given 38 that's wrong division first here fifteen divided by five that's three three plus four seven this is wrong which one first you have to do division first 8 divided by 16 when you write like this you get 8 times 1 8 times 2 half 24 plus half or 24.5 this one you can write in decimal 0.5 so you are not getting 
,,2 that's wrong this one you can start from left to right 6 times 9 54. 54 divided by 3 you get 1 there 3 times 1 3 for 24 that's 8 so this is correct 32 divided by eight you do this one first four four divide by four you get one that's also correct this one that's addition and subtraction you can start from left 23 minus 5 you get 18. 18 plus 7. 25 but 11 is given that's wrong you have to do division first 4 divided by 2 that's 2 then 20 plus 2 22 that's correct 4 times 2 8 8 plus 8 16. here you can start from left 6 plus 6 12 12 minus 4 8 that's also correct multiplication first 9 times 9 81 81 minus 40. you get 41 that's correct 20 divided by 4 you get 5. 5 divided by 20 you are getting one over four not four so that's wrong nine divided by three is three three divide by three that's one this answer is wrong 25 
,,times 2 50 50 minus 40 that's 10. that one is correct simplify the following expressions multiplication first 20 times 240 40 plus 7 47 division first here 14 divided by 2 is 7 7 times 3 21. here multiplication 300 plus 7 three hundred and seven we'll do multiplication first eight times fifty four hundred four hundred divided by hundred answer is 4 division first 900 divided by 100 you get 9 9 plus 5 14. this one division first 24 divided by 24 is 1 1 plus 9 you get 10. starting from left 8 divided by 8 is 1 1 divided by 1 the answer is 1 this is addition subtraction you can start from left 7 plus 0 7 7 minus 5 you get 2. this one division first 23 plus 2 divided by 2 is 1. so you get 24 there's one division first 35 divided by seven that's five five minus five that's zero multiplication first 4 times 2 that's 8 32 plus 8 answer is 40. addition subtraction odd is not important 12 plus 3 15 15 minus 7 answer is 8. simplify which one we need to do first multiplication three there two times eight sixteen now now you can edit three plus sixteen eighteen three plus sixteen that's nineteen nineteen plus five 20 4 this one you have to do division first 25 divided by 5 you get 5. 5 plus 3 minus 2. so 5 plus 3 8 8 minus 2 6. this one starting from left multiplication first 8 times 4 32 32 plus 3 and minus 30. 32 plus 3 35 35 minus 30 you get 5. this one addition and subtraction there's no order 7 minus 2 5 5 plus 10 minus 3 15 minus 3 you get 12. this one starting from 
,,left multiplication you can do 8 times 2 16. now division 16 divided by 4 that's 4 4 minus 1 you get 3 starting from left 56 divided by 7 that's 8 8 now divide by 8 
,,what's 8 divided by 8 1 now addition 1 plus 5 answer is 6 starting from left we can do multiplication 9 times 7 63 then we can do division so what's the division here 63 divided by 21 that's 3. so 3 plus 5 you get eight starting from left again 24 divided by eight that's three three plus seven minus one so what's three plus seven ten ten minus one is nine we'll do this one first 81 divided by nine that's nine now we'll look at divisions 9 divided by 3 you get 3 3 plus 5 answer is 8. now we'll see when you get brackets how you do the operations look at this one 2 plus 7 add 2 and 7 that's 9. now if you want to subtract 9 from 12 so what's the answer 12 
,,minus 9 you get 3. so this can be written as can write 2 plus 7 add it and subtract from 12. so 12 minus this so here we have written like that 12 minus 2 plus 7. when you get brackets what you do 2 plus 7 that's 9 12 minus 9. so what's the answer you get 3. now do these questions so what you have to do when you get brackets simplify inside the brackets first so 30 divided by 7 plus 3 you get 10. now do the division 30 divide by 10 you get 3. this one 20 plus 4 what's 20 plus 4 24 24 divided by 6 what's the answer you get 4. now this bracket first 28 plus 2 30 12 plus 3 you get 15. now you can divide 30 divided by 15 you get 2 here also two brackets you have to simplify separately these two brackets nine plus seven sixteen eight into one multiply by one you get eight now 16 divided by 8 you get 2. this one brackets first 4 plus 3 7 21 divided by 7 you get 3 here in this one this bracket first 12 minus 5 you get 7 7 divided by 7 that's 1. now look at this one brackets first so you take this one first five plus two seven now you can write the question again nine times three minus seven then what you do you have to do the multiplication first starting from left you get multiplication so 9 times 3 27 27 minus 7 you get 20. look at this one brackets first three times five fifteen so you write two plus fifteen plus three addition here you can do from left to right 2 plus 15 17 17 plus 3 20. this one brackets first 12 plus 2 14. 5 times 14 divided by 10 so you can start from left multiplication comes so you have to do that 5 times 4 20 2 remaining 5 times 1 5 plus 2 7 so 70 divided by 10 you get 7 this one 3 times 4 that's 12. 20 minus 12 plus 7. now start from left 20 minus 12 that's 8. 8 plus 7 you get 15. look at this one brackets first 12 divided by 6 you get 2. now what's the next step 
,,multiplication three times two six eight plus six minus five eight plus six fourteen fourteen minus five you get 9 this one brackets first so what you do 10 plus 7 multiplied by 4 minus 2 you get 2 and this is multiplication 3 plus 4. what's the next one you need to start from left and c multiplication is there 10 plus 7 times 2 14 into 3 plus 4 again from left you get this multiplication 10 plus 3 times 4 12 1 remaining 3 times 1 3 plus 1 4 plus 4 what you get 10 plus 42 you get 52 52 plus 4 56 this one first brackets 7 minus 2 plus 5 times 6 30 30 plus 4. now you can do starting from left or any order so i'll start from left 7 minus 2 5 5 30 35 35 plus 4 3 9 this one brackets first 8 times 2 60. this brackets these two brackets next 24 divided by 3 8 30 divided by 15 you get 2. now you can do addition and subtraction 16 plus 8 24 24 minus 2 you get 20 2 this one these three brackets first 12 divided by 3 that's 4. 24 divided by 3 8 30 divided by 15 that's 2 addition and subtraction so 8 plus 4 12 12 minus 2 you get 10 this one brackets first these two we can do 12 minus 3 9 3 minus 1 2 now starting from left 9 times 2 18 18 divide by 9 you get 2. this question we can do brackets first three hundred minus twelve times eight sixteen one remaining eight times one eight plus one ninety six twelve times five you get hundred now what we do we can do this subtraction 300 minus 96 what's that when you subtract you get 200 so 204 minus 100 you get 104. so the answer is 104. this one this bracket first 24 plus 3 27 now division first 27 divided by 9 you get 3 3 plus 5 that's 8. now worded problem there are six boxes of eggs with 12 eggs in each equally distribute them all among eight housewives how much eggs would one housewife get so how many eggs in six boxes twelve times six and then number of eggs one would get so how many housewives are there eight so this is equally divided so you can divide this by eight so we'll do first one six times two 12 1 remaining 6 times 1 6 plus 1 7 now 72 you have to do divide equally by 8 housewives so 72 divided by 8. you get 9 so how many eggs one would get 9 eggs this question 18 out of 90 oranges bought by a merchant was rotten when the remaining good ones are distributed among 12 persons how much oranges would one person get total how many oranges brought 90 oranges all together how many rotten oranges are there 18 are rotten balance of good oranges so you have to subtract 19 minus 80. what's the value 2 here 10 1 is there so 2 plus 7 that's 90. so 72 then what we have to do we have to divide this equally with 12 persons so number of oranges one would get you take the total good ones divide by 12 persons so 72 divided by 12 you get 6. so 6 oranges one would get so we can write the same question at once how can we write we can write 20 minus 18 inside brackets and then divide this by 12. look at this question 400 rupees for the first 15 words and 20 rupees for each excessive word is charged for publishing a newspaper advertisement find how much would be charged for a newspaper advertisement containing 23 words so excessive number of words after the first 50 all together how many words are there 23 first 15 that's a different charge so we have to subtract 15 to get the excessive number of words so what's the value 23 minus 15 you get 8 here so 8 23 minus 15 is 8. price for extra 8 words so what's the charge 20 rupees for each excessive word so 8 times 20. that's 100 60 rupees first charge first 15 words the charge is 400 so what's the total so you have to add 400 plus 160 what's the total you get 560 rupees for an advertisement with 23 words look at this one 12 rupees for the first minute and 8 rupees for every next minute is charged for international direct dialing calls taken to a foreign country find out the total cost of a call of 12 minutes taken to that country so what's the extra number of minutes spent so all together 12 minutes extra is first minute that's 12. so 12 minutes minus 1 so 11 more minutes so this is minutes 11 minutes are there then what's the total amount payable first minute is 12 then 8 rupees for next minute is charge every one minute you need eight rupees so all together this is eight times eleven eighty eight plus twelve so what's the total amount payable 100 rupees for this call 8 plus 210 1 remaining 9 plus 1 so for 12 minute call the person has to pay 100 rupees write the simplifying order of whole number expressions so what is the first thing you have to do simplify inside brackets after that you look at left to right left to right then multiplication or division whatever comes first from left to right division from left to write then you can do addition and subtraction then you can do addition or subtraction whatever comes first from left to right look at this question the age of 38 boys in a grade 7 class is 12 years each two of the other two boys is 13 years old write a number expression for the total number of ages of all the 40 students and find out the total age of them so we try to write down an expression at once 38 boys in grade seven class is 12 years each so 38 into 12 and two boys with 13 years old so two boys with 30. so you have to do separately and at so 38 times 12 38 times 12 10 and 2 so you multiply by 1 and multiply by 2 you get 456 now do this multiplication 2 times 13 you get 26 now add 26 to that 400 years old the total is 482. look at this one a cyclist spends 
,,five minutes per each kilometer to cycle the first five kilometers while they spend eight minutes per each kilometer of the second five kilometers then ten minutes per each of the next five kilometers and 12 minutes per each of the final five kilometers calculate the time he would spend to cycle 17 kilometers so we'll try to write an expression at once total time spent five minutes per each kilometer to cycle the first five so first five five minutes then why we spend eight minutes per each kilometer of the second five kilometers so eight times the next five kilometers then the third one ten minutes per each of the next five ten into five now all together 50 kilometers now the last 5 kilometers that's 12 minutes but how many kilometers are there this is 5 and 5 10 10 plus 5 15 but all together 2 so you have to multiply 2 into 12 that's the last one now we can add it separately first you have to multiply 5 times 5 25 8 times 5 40. 10 times five fifty two times twelve twenty four now add all together and get five plus 4 9 4 plus 2 6 6 plus 5 11 11 plus 2 13 139 minutes so how we find out number of hours and minutes what you do you have to 
,,divide by 60 because 60 minutes per hour so you get 120 so how many minutes are there 19 minutes so 2 hours and 19 19 minutes so i can write separately 2 hours and 19 minutes now we look at example 1 in your textbook write down the operations of the expression 12 into 2 minus 5 into 3 in the order in which they appear so from left to right so first you have to do multiplication another multiplication because before subtracting numbers we have to do either division or multiplication first so another multiplication and then only you can do subtraction exercise 3.1 for each of the following numerical expressions write down the mathematical operations in the order in which they appear so this is addition you can start from left so this is adding and adding this one multiplication first and then subtraction here first 
,,division then you have to do multiplication and then subtraction fourth one starting from left you have to do multiplication then from left that's addition and subtraction this one starting from left first do division and then this division next and then finally addition exercise 3.2 simplify each of the following expressions addition so 12 plus 5. 17 17 plus 8 20 5 multiplication so you can do first two 5 times 8 40. 40 times 3 you get 120 7 plus 3 10 2 plus 6 8 10 plus 8 eighteen two times five ten four times three twelve ten times twelve you get hundred twenty odd is not important in additions only and multiplication only example number one simplify so 7 minus 4 plus 5 subtraction and addition you can start from left 7 minus 4 you get 3 3 plus 5 8. this one 80 divided by 10 into five so starting from left 80 divided by 10 that's 8 then you do multiplication 8 times 5 40. this one you can start from left to right 4 times 6 24 then you do the division 24 divided by 3 answer 
,,is 8 here 25 plus 10 minus 7 starting from left you can add first 25 plus 10 that's 35 minus 7 you get 20 8. example number 5 28 divided by 2 minus 3 division first 
,,from left to right 28 divided by 2 you get 14. 14 minus 3 that's 11. here 50 minus 10 into 3 which one we have to do first multiplication 10 times 3 30. now we can subtract 50 minus 30 that's 20. 18 into 5 minus 62 18 times 5 so here 8 times 5 you get 40 4 remaining 5 times 1 5 5 plus 4 90. so 90 minus 62. you get 8 here and 2 so 20 8 this one 50 minus 10 divide by 2. now you have to do division first 10 divided by 2 you get 5 50 minus 5 answer is 45 example number 9 5 plus 6 divided by 3 plus 2 left to right first division so 5 plus 6 divided by 3 that's 2. now you can add 5 plus 2 7 7 plus 2 9 this one simplify 2 times 12 divided by 3 multiplied by 5 first these two you get 24. now what's next from left to right 24 divided by 3 that's 8 8 times 5 answer is 40. exercise 3.3 place a tick mark next to the correct statement and wrong sign next to incorrect statement so this is subtraction addition you can do in any order 8 minus 5 3 3 plus 2 you get 5 so this is not 1 so this is wrong 12 times 3 multiplication first you get 36 36 minus 11 that's 25 that's correct this one which one we do first 18 divided by 6 that's 3 7 plus 3 you get 10. 
,,from left multiplication 30 then 30 divided by 3 you get 10 10 plus 7 17 this is wrong simplify the following expressions so what's the order when you get multiplication or division from left to right you have to do that first before addition and subtraction so 10 times 4 first 40 40 plus 17 you get 57. times 3 24 24 plus 5 29 this one division first 14 divided by 7 is 2 then multiplication 2 times 5 10 division first 12 divided by 3 is 4. 448 plus 4 you get 452 this one multiplication first seven times two hundred thousand four hundred now add hundred and eight to that you get eight zero five and one thousand five hundred and eight eight times nine seventy two seventy two minus sixty one you get 11. this multiplication first 100 minus 8 times 7 56 now subtract you get 4 here 6 plus 4 10 so 44 from left to right multiplication first 195 minus 12 times 10 120. now division 120 divided by 5 you get 5 times 2 10 for 20 that's 4. so 5 times 2 10 2 remaining so that's 24 now do the subtraction 195 minus 24 what's the subtraction 7 and 1. so you get 171 as the answer this one starting from left to right multiplication 7 plus what's 37 times 5 
,,5 times 7 35 3 remaining 5 times 3 15 plus 3 80. now you can do the addition 185 plus 7 192 now add 278 to that you get 8 plus 2 10 17 1 remaining so 470 example number one now you get brackets so what we do brackets first 12 minus 7 you get 5. so you can rewrite the question 20 divided by 5 now 20 divided by 5 is 4. here from left first brackets 10 plus 12 22. now rewrite the question 5 times 22 divide by 11 now left to right whatever comes first multiplication or division so you can multiply first 5 times 2 10 1 remaining 10 plus 1 11. so 110 divided by 11. so you get 10. example number three brackets first 10 plus 2 12. now rewrite the question 8 plus 5 times this is division 3 minus 4. now from left to right multiplication 8 plus 12 times 5 60. next from left to right division 8 plus 60 divided by 3 you get 20. now you can do addition and subtraction 8 plus 20 28 28 minus 4 you get 24. example number four the pencils in five boxes each of which contains 12 pencils are divided equally among four students write down an expression for the number of pencils a single student receives and simplify it so number of then six how do we find out what's the total five boxes each twelve pencils so all together five times twelve are equally divided among four students so i'll write other way around divide by 
,,four now left to right first multiplication twelve times five sixty sixty divide by four four times one four and for 20 that's five so each person get 15 pencils example number 5 nimal plucked 47 mangoes from a tree in his garden he kept 18 in his position and sold the rest to his neighbor at nine rupees per fruit write down an 
,,expression for the total amount of money nima learned in rupees by selling the mangoes and simplify it so total amount is this is in rupees he plucked 47 mangoes from a tree in his garden he kept 80. so what's the remaining part 47 minus 80. that one each mango for 9 rupees so multiply by 9 so that's the total amount here so what we do first brackets what's the subtraction you get 9 and 2 so 29 47 minus 18 is 29 now multiply by 9 9 times 9 81 8 remaining 9 times 2 18 18 plus 8 2 26 so 261 rupees example six the taxi fare for the first kilometer is 50 rupees it is 42 rupees for each kilometer above the first write down an expression for the amount paid 
,,by a passenger who enjoyed a ride of 12 kilometers and simplify your answer so you need to find out the amount paid first kilometer 50 rupees so 50 plus so how many 
,,kilometers extra all together 12. so you need to subtract 1 that value multiplied by 42 because after the first kilometer you have to pay 40 rupees each per kilometer so how you do this so this is in rupees first brackets so 50 12 minus 1 is 11 times 42. now multiplication second 50 plus multiply this by 11 42 times 11 10 and 1 
,,you get here 264 462. now add 50 to that you get 2 and 5 plus 6 11 1 remaining and this is 5 512 rupees exercise 3.4 simplify the following expressions so first you 
,,have to do brackets 12 plus 8 20. now subtraction 12 20 minus 15 that's 5 brackets first 35 minus add these two get 23. so subtract you get 2 here and 1. so the answer is 12. here brackets first 5. here there's no multiplication sign because there's a bracket brackets means multiply so 7 times 5 you get 35. here 27 minus 13 first so you get fourteen three times that and add hundred and eight so first multiplication three times four twelve one remaining three times one three plus one four now add hundred and eight and forty two five what hundred and fifty this one brackets first 17 minus 5 you get 12. 24 divided by 12 you get 2. this one first brackets 
,,five plus two seven now three times seven into eight you can do multiplication here three times seven twenty-one twenty-one times 8 168. 16 divided by 4 you get 4. so 31 plus 4 you get 35. 8 times 9 72 73 minus 72 you get 1. 19 times 10 190 plus 38 you get 228 again at 8 12 and 1 remaining 228 this one 30 divided by 6 you get 5 
,,475 minus 5 you get 470 an international call to a certain country cost seven rupees for the first minute and four rupees per minute thereafter write down an expression in rupees for the cost of a 10 minutes long international call simplify your expression so you need to find out the total cost cost for the call first minute that's seven rupees plus so how many extra minutes are there this is 10 minute so you have to subtract one for those number of means you need to pay four rupees each so what you do first 10 minus 9 first 10 minus 1 first that's 9 7 plus 9 into 4 then multiplication you get 9 times 4 36 36 plus 7 43 rupees for the 10 minutes call write down an expression for the number of 2 litre bottles that can be filled with a fruit drink made from eight liters of water and four liters of fruit juice so number of bottles what's the mixture eight liters of water and four liters of fruit juice that's the total number of liters but dividing into two liter bottles you have 
,,to divide this by 2 now here first do addition 12 12 divided by 2 you can get 6 bottles with 2 liters simplify the following expressions when you get an expression first start from left brackets first then multiplication or division and finally addition of subtraction so starting from here 30 divided by 10 you get 3 then 3 times 5 15 starting from left 40 times 10 400 divide by five you get 80. this one multiplication first 400 minus 200 that's 200 brackets first 10 times 3 30. 30 divided by 30 you get 1 brackets first 40 divided by 10 that's 4. now multiply 8 times 4 32 multiplication first 7 times 5 35 35 plus 3 38 division first 6 divided by 2 you get 3 three plus seven that's ten here brackets first 24 times three seventy two now divide by eight you get 9 brackets 4 times 3 12 24 divided by 12 you get 2 here now this one first brackets you get 9. now rewrite the question again then starting from left you can do multiplication 6 times 9 54. now rewrite again do division 3 
,,plus 54 divide by 3 1 and for 24 that's 8. now you can do addition and subtraction from left to right 18 plus 3 21 21 minus 7 you get 14. this one brackets first 10 
,,plus 8 this is multiplication 11 minus 3 you get 8 multiplied by 4 minus 4 from left to right then you have to do this multiplication 10 plus 8 times 8 64 times 4 minus 4 again multiplication 10 plus 4 times 4 16 1 remaining 4 times 6 24 plus 1 25 now you can do addition and subtraction 256 plus 10 266 266 minus 4 you get 262. so all these expressions first brackets then multiplication or division and finally addition or subtraction so we covered all theory in this lesson so you need to remember first perform any calculations inside brackets then perform all multiplication or division working from left to right finally perform all additions and subtractions working from left to right so practice all exercise and examples and thorough with the basic operations in whole numbers

Operations of While number,iczjmY53_4o,introduction I have 20 marbles I have 22 marbles Wow I have more than you we can count the things around us like vegetables cars etc certain things cannot be counted like stars in the sky hair on a head etc mathematically you are talking about whole numbers let us learn about whole numbers in this lesson objectives at the end of this lesson you will be able to list natural numbers and whole numbers draw a number line perform addition subtraction and multiplication on number line discuss the properties of whole numbers discuss identity identify patterns in whole numbers natural numbers we use one two three four to count the objects counting numbers are 
,,also known as natural numbers adding one to any number gives its successor example one added to 20 gives 21 which is successor of 20 subtracting one from any number 
,,gives its predecessor example subtracting one from 20 gives 19 which is the predecessor of 20 interesting question what is the largest natural number whole numbers whole numbers include zero and all the natural numbers points to remember 1 all natural numbers are whole numbers 2 all whole numbers are not natural numbers 3 there 
,,is no largest whole number the number line the number line helps to display the whole numbers visually to construct a number line we simply draw a straight line and 
,,choose any point on the line and label it 0 this point is called the origin we then choose some convenient length and moving to the right mark off consecutive intervals thoughts along the line starting at 0 we label each new interval endpoint with the next whole number the distance between any two consecutive points on a number 
,,line is called unit distance out of two whole numbers greater number comes on the right of other number on the number line operations on number line addition is easily visualized on the number line let's visualize the addition of 4 & 3 using the number line to find 4 plus 3 1 start at 0 to move to the right 4 units we are now located for three from four move to the right three units we are now located at seven thus four plus three is equal to 7 while subtracting two whole numbers move left 
,,the number of spaces that need to be subtracted suppose the sum of two whole numbers is 11 and from 11 we remove 4 using the number line to help our visualization we see that if we are located at 11 and move 4 units to the left and thus remove 4 units we will be located at 7 thus 7 units remain when we remove 4 units from 11 units multiplication means moving towards right hoping specified units at a time multiple times for example 2 into 5 start from 0 move 2 units at a time to the right make such 5 moves you will reach 10 so we say 2 into 5 is equal to 10 properties of whole numbers on adding any two whole numbers the sum is still a whole number on multiplying any two whole numbers the product is still a whole number if 3 whole numbers are to be added the sum will be the same if the first two are added first then the sum is added to the third or the second two are added first and that sum is added to the first if three whole numbers are to be multiplied the product will be the same if the first two are multiplied first then the product is multiplied to the third or the second two are multiplied first and that product is multiplied to the first if two whole numbers are added in any order the sum will not change if two whole numbers are multiplied in any order the product will not change the distributive property states that multiplying a Samba a number gives the same result as multiplying each addint by the number and then adding the products together the above properties do not hold for subtraction and division identity the hole number zero is called the additive identity since when it is added to any whole number the sum is identical to that whole number the hole number one is called the multiplicative identity since when it is multiplied to any whole number the product is identical to that whole number pattern's in whole numbers numbers can be arranged in some elementary shapes using dots the shape could be a line square rectangle triangle every number can be arranged as a line for example some numbers can be arranged as squares for example some numbers can be arranged as rectangles rectangles can be horizontal arrangement or a vertical arrangement for example some numbers can be arranged as a triangle for example sometimes some kind of pattern is observed in whole numbers which can help in simplifying the calculation process for example let's look at another one one more example summary let us summarize what we have learnt natural numbers are 1 2 3 4 whole numbers are 0 1 2 3 4 number line is visual presentation of numbers in form of a line it is easy to add subtract and multiply on a number line properties of whole numbers include closure associative commutative and distributive properties whole numbers follow a pattern

Operations of While number,Val4TmjHXRY,welcome to math with mr j in this video i'm going to cover how to divide a decimal by a decimal so let's jump into our two examples here and for number one we have five and 76 hundredths divided by three-tenths so let's set our problem up five and seventy-six hundredths is our dividend so it goes underneath the division bar here it's the number that we are splitting or dividing up now 3 10 is our divisor it's the outside number so now that we're set up we need to ask ourselves a very important question before we start this problem is the divisor a whole number and in this case that three-tenths there that is not a whole number we need to have a whole number on the outside there that divisor in order to go through our division process so we can do this by multiplying that divisor by a power of 10 and therefore creating a whole number divisor so we can do this by moving the decimal to the right once that will give us a whole 3 right moving the decimal to the right once will push the digits to the correct place it will push that 3 over to the ones place so moving the decimal once to the right or you can think of it as sliding the 3 over to 
,,the ones place we multiplied that outside number by 10. so if you do something to the outside number that divisor you have to do the same thing to the inside remember whatever you do to the outside you have to do to the inside so we moved the decimal once to the right and therefore shifted each digit one spot to the left let's do the same thing to the inside the dividend now we're ready to go as far as setting up our problem with a whole divisor so we have those arrows underneath there so let's rewrite our problem so it's a little more neat so we have 3 as our divisor and for our dividend we have 57 and six tenths so now is our divisor whole yes we can start our problem so once your divisor's whole you bring your decimal straight up and go through your division process so divide multiply subtract bring down and repeat so five divided by three how many whole groups of three out of five well one one times three is three subtract we get two bring down the seven 27 divided by three is nine nine times three twenty seven subtract we get zero bring down this six here and we end with six divided by three which is two two times three is six subtract and we get a clean cut zero here and a final answer of nineteen and two-tenths so let's do another example here in order to get this down a little better and number two is going to be a little different and you'll see why here in a second so our dividend 86 and four tenths is the number being divided or split up and that goes underneath the division bar so eighty-six and four-tenths divided by twelve hundredths so twelve hundredths is our divisor it goes on the outside now let's ask ourselves the important question is the divisor a whole number no so we need to make it a whole number in order to go through the process so let's multiply by a power of 10 let's multiply by 10 and now the decimal will be between the 1 and the 2. is that a whole number no so we need to multiply by 10 again so 10 times 10 we need to multiply that outside number by 100 in order to push the digits to the correct place values in order to make it a whole number so we need to move the decimal twice 
,,or multiply that 86 and 4 tenths by 100 as well remember whatever you do to the outside you do to the inside so once twice and we can fill that with a placeholder zero there and our decimal goes at the end so now we actually have a whole dividend so our new problem is going to be 12 and on the inside our dividend is 8640 and that decimal is at the end so we don't really need it when it comes to whole numbers but we can put it there in case we need to extend with zeros for remainder purposes so we'll see if we'll need that decimal uh as we go through this problem so let's go through our steps so 8 divided by 12 well we can't pull any whole groups of 12 
,,out of 8 so we need to go to 86 so how many whole groups of 12 out of 86 well 7 times 12 is 84. that's as close as we are going to get so 7 7 times 12 is 84 subtract we get 2. bring down the 4. so 24 divided by 12. how many whole groups of 12 out of 24 well 2 2 times 12 is 24 subtract we get zero now do not stop here we did not 
,,go all the way over to the ones place here so our answer is not 72 we need to keep going because we still have numbers to bring down here so let's bring our zero down and we have zero divided by twelve so how many whole groups of twelve out of zero well zero zero times twelve is zero subtract and we get zero so remember our decimal is at the end there so it's just a whole number and our final answer is going to be seven hundred twenty so there you have it there's how you divide a decimal by a decimal remember is the divisor a whole number if not we need to multiply it by a power of 10 in order to make it a whole number whatever you do to the outside you have to do to the inside so whatever you do to the divisor you have to do to the dividend then you can rewrite your problem go through the division process and that will bring you to the correct answer i hope that helped thanks so much for watching until next time peace

Operations of While number,USmit5zUGas,"Hi!  Welcome to Math Antics. In this lesson, were gonna learn what proportions are and how we can use them to find an unknown value. The good news is, if you know about equivalent fractions, then you already know a lot about proportions. To see what I mean, lets start with the simple fraction 1 over 2 (or one-half). Now lets "
,,"look at a pair of equivalent fractions, 1 over 2 and 5 over 10. These fractions are equivalent because, even though they have different top and bottom numbers, they "
,,"have the same value. 1 is half of 2, and 5 is half of 10, so they represent the same amount. Okay, but to understand what a proportion is, we need to start with a ratio instead. A ratio is basically just a fraction thats used in a certain way. If you dont remember what a ratio is, you can watch our video about them. So lets imagine that a student, whos a really good reader, can read 1 book in 2 days. We could say that the ratio of books to days is 1 over 2 (one book per two days). Alright, but what if our student reads books at that same rate for 10 days. How many books would they read? Well, if they finish 1 book every 2 days, then in 10 days theyll have read 5 books, so that ratio would be 5 books per 10 days. Ah, do you see what we have here? These are equivalent ratios! Just like the equivalent fractions, they represent the same amount so we can put an equals sign between them. When we do that, we have a proportion. A proportion is just two ratios that are equivalent (or equal). Oh, and one thing thats really important to remember In order for two ratios to be equivalent, they not only have to have the same value, they also have to have the same units. That is, they have to be representing the same thing on the top and bottom. Let me show you what I mean. This is a proportion because the "
,,"top numbers both refer to books and the bottom numbers both refer to days. But what if we change the top unit of the second ratio to be pizzas instead of books? 5 pizzas in 10 days is NOT equivalent to 1 book in 2 days. So even though the numbers are still the same, this is no longer a proportion. Or, what if we keep the same units and just switch them in the second ratio so that the days are on top and books on the bottom. Are they still equivalent? Nope! This is not a proportion anymore either. 5 days per 10 books is NOT equivalent to 1 book per 2 days. So the units have to be exactly the same for both ratios to form a proportion. Alright then So a proportion is a pair of equivalent ratios. But why do we care?  What are proportions good for? Well, it turns out that proportions are really good for figuring out something you DONT know from something you DO know, and that makes them very useful! For example, lets suppose that our student (whos a good reader), has a BIG stack of books that they want to read (23 books to be precise), and they want to know how many days it will take them to finish. How do we figure that out? "
,,"Well, lets start with what we DO know. We know that they can read 1 book in 2 days. So lets take that ratio and set up an equivalent ratio for 23 books. They key in setting up that equivalent ratio is to make sure that the units are the same as the first ratio; books on the top and days on the bottom. We know that the number of books that they want to read is 23, so that goes on top. But the number of days it will take is unknown, so instead of putting a number there, were going to put the letter n there temporarily to stand for the number that we dont know. This is how youll usually see and use proportions in math. Three of the proportions numbers will be known and one will be unknown. Fortunately, if you know three of the numbers, you can find the missing number easily using a procedure called cross-multiplying. Cross-multiplying is just a short-cut way of doing some basic algebra to re-arrange our proportion so we can find the unknown number. To do it, we first start by writing down a new equal sign because cross-multiplying will give us another equation. Next, imagine that a criss-cross shape (like an x) is overlaid on the "
,,proportion. This cross shape tells you which numbers to multiply together on each side of the new equals sign. 1 and n will be multiplied together on this side of 
,,"the equation, and 2 and 23 will be multiplied together on the other side of the equation. Oh, and as long as you follow the criss-cross guides, it doesnt matter which pair goes on which side. Okay, so our proportion has been re-arranged now what? Well, on one side of the new equation we have two numbers being multiplied together. The next step is to go ahead and simplify by doing that multiplication.  2  23 = 46. But what about the other side of the equation. That has a number being multiplied by our unknown letter n. How can we multiply when one of the numbers is unknown? Actually, we cant! Fortunately, we dont need to because were just trying to figure our what our unknown number is. What does it equal? In other words, we need to keep re-arranging our equation until the unknown value is all by itself on "
,,"one side of the equals sign and all the known values have all been combined on the other side of the equals sign. Then well have found the unknown. In this problem, getting the n by itself is easy because its just being multiplied by the number 1. And what happens to a number when we multiply it by 1? Yep - absolutely nothing. 1 times n is exactly the same thing as just plain n, so we can just ignore or get rid of the 1. And look!  Our equation is now n = 46. That means that we know what n equals. Weve figured out what the missing number of our proportion is. If our student can read 1 book in 2 days, then they can read 23 books in 46 days. Weve used a proportion to solve for an unknown. Alright, lets see another example of using a proportion to find an unknown. This one involves a map. Have you ever noticed that maps are a lot smaller than the real-life places that they show? A map is a good example of something called a scaled drawing, which is just a drawing "
,,"that's either larger or smaller than the real thing it depicts, but its still in proportion to that thing. For example, this map of Hawaii is a lot smaller than the actual Hawaii. But even though the map is smaller, its still proportional to the real island and theres even a scale on it to show the relationship between the "
,,"two sizes. It says that 5 centimeter on the map is equal to 9 miles on the real island. Okay, suppose that we want to know how many miles it is from the Hawaiian volcano, Mona Loa, to the city called Hilo. We can set up a proportion to figure that out. The ratio that we already know is 9 miles per 5 cm. Now we just need to set that equal to an equivalent ratio that has the unknown distance in it. Because we have the map, we can use a ruler to measure how many centimeters it is from Mona Loa to Hilo. It looks like about 20 cm, so the bottom number of the equivalent ratio is 20 cm and the top number is the number of miles, which is unknown. Again, well "
,,"just use a letter n to stand for that missing number. To solve this proportion for the unknown number, we use our cross-multiplying procedure. First, we write a new equal sign and then we imagine the criss-cross to show us what we multiply together on each side. On the first side, we have 9  20. And on the other side, we have 5  n. On the side that has two numbers, we can go ahead and simplify.  9  20 = 180. On the other side, we have 5 multiplied by our unknown value n. We cant multiply that, but we dont need to. Instead, we want to get the n all by itself.  How do we do that? Well, we cant just ignore the 5 like we ignored the 1 in the last problem. Instead, to get the n by itself, all we have to do is divide both sides of the equation by the number that n is being multiplied by. In this case, thats 5.  So on the first side, 180 divided by 5 equals 36. And on the other side, 5 times n divided by 5 is just n since the fives cancel out. There, now we know what the unknown value in our proportion is: 36 = n, which is the same as n = 36. Thats the number of miles it is from the volcano Mona Loa to Hilo. Alright, so in this video, we learned that a proportion is a pair of equivalent ratios, and we learned how we can set up a proportion that has an unknown number and then find out "
,,"what that number is by cross multiplying. Proportions are really important! If you understand how they work, you can use them to solve all sorts of real-world math problems. And the best way to understand them is to practice "

Operations of While number,v-6MShC82ow,"Hi, Im Rob.  Welcome to Math Antics! In this lesson, were going to talk about the Distributive Property, which is a really useful tool in Algebra. And if you watched our video called The Distributive Property in Arithmetic, then you already know the basics of how the Distributive Property works. The key idea is that the Distributive Property allows you to take a factor and distribute it to each member of a group of things that are being added or subtracted. Instead of multiplying the factor by the entire group as a whole, you can distribute it to be multiplied by each member of the group individually. And in that previous video, we saw how you can take a problem like: 3 times the group (4 + 6) and simplify it two different ways. You could either simplify what was in the group first, OR you could use the distributive property to distribute a copy of the factor 3 to each member of the group, and no matter which way you go, you get the same answer. But in Algebra, things are a little more complicated, because we arent just working with known numbers. Algebra involves unknown values and variables, right? So in Algebra, you might have an expression like this:  3 times the group (x + 6). In this expression, we dont know what value x is. It could be 4 like in the last expression, but it doesnt have to be. It could be ANY number at all!  And since we dont know what it is, that means we CANT simplify the group first in this case. Our only option here is to "
,,"either leave the expression just like it is and not simplify it at all, OR to use the Distributive Property to eliminate the group. Just like in the arithmetic video, we can distribute a copy of the 3 times to each member of the group so the group goes away and we end up with 3 times x plus 3 times 6. The 3 time x cant be simplified any further because we still dont know what x is, but we can simplify 3 times 6 and just write 18. So the distributed form of this expression is: 3x + 18 And even though we cant simplify these expressions all the way down to a single numeric answer without knowing the value of x, we do know that these two forms of the expression are equivalent because they follow the distributive property. So the Distributive Property works exactly the same way whether your working with numbers or variables. In fact, in Algebra, youll often see the Distributive Property shown like this: a times the group (b + c) equals ab + ac Or you might see it with different letters, like x, y, and z, but the pattern will be the same. This pattern is just telling you that these two forms are equivalent. In the first form, the factor a is being multiplied by the entire group. But in the second form, the factor a has been distributed so its being multiplied by each member of the group individually. And if youre looking at this thinking, what multiplication?, remember that multiplication is the default operation which is why we dont have to show it in this pattern. Since the a is right next to the group, it means its being multiplied by the group, and on this other side, since the copies of the a are right next to the b and c, it means they are being multiplied also. And even though this pattern is usually shown with addition in the group, remember that "
,,"it also works for subtraction since subtraction is the same as negative addition. But the distributive property does NOT apply to group members that are being multiplied or divided. Okay, so this is the basic pattern of the Distributive Property. Its usually just shown with two members in the group, but remember that it works for groups of any size. We could have a times the group (b + c + d) and the equivalent distributed form would be: ab + ac + ad Heres a few quick examples that "
,,have a combination of numbers and variables to help you see the patterns of the Distributive property: 2 times the group (x + y + z) can be changed into the distributed form:  2x + 2y + 2z 10 times the group (a - b + 4) can be changed into the distributed form: 10a - 10b + 10 times 4 (which is 40). And a times the group (x - 
,,"y + 2) can be changed into the distributed form: ax - ay + a2 (or 2a which is more proper). So whether youre dealing with numbers or variables or both, the key concept is that the factor outside the group gets distributed to each term in the group. Each TERM in the group? But I thought terms were parts of polynomials, and I "
,,"thought we were WAY past all that by now! Ah - I was hoping you would notice that. And in fact, the members of these groups really are just simple terms in a Polynomial. Well thats what Im here for noticing things. Ooooo! - A butterfly!! Realizing that these groups of things being added or subtracted are really just Polynomials will help you see why the Distributive Property is SO useful in Algebra. For example, in this simple expression:  2 times the group (x + y) the x and the y "
,,"are simple terms in the polynomial x + y. Each of the terms has a variable part but no number part. And if we apply the Distributive Property to the group, we get the equivalent form: 2x + 2y But what if the polynomial was just a little bit more complicated? like this:  2 times the group (3x + 5y) In this expression, each of the terms in the polynomial DOES have a number part that is being multiplied by the variable part. But we can still use the Distributive Property to distribute a copy "
,,of the factor 2 to each term in the polynomial. Wait just a second here! I NOTICED earlier that you said the Distributive Property does NOT work with members of a 
,,"group that are being multiplied, and I also NOTICED that these terms DO have multiplication. Whats up with that? Ah Thats a good question! And it can be a little "
,,"confusing to see how it all works at first. But notice that even though the terms do have multiplication in them, the terms THEMSELVES are being added. So we distributed a copy of the factor 2 to each whole term, but NOT to each part of a term. In other words, we treat each term in a polynomial as a individual member of the group, even if that term has multiplication going on inside of it (which is common since there is often a variable part and number part being multiplied together). Getting back to our example  Distributing the factor 2 to each term gives us 2 times 3x plus 2 times 5y. But this can be simplified even further because we know that 2 times 3 is just 6 and 2 times 5 is just 10. So the distributed form is:  6x + 10y Lets try another example of a factor times a polynomial: 4 times the group (x squared + 3x - 5). First we need to identify the terms of this polynomial so when we distribute the factor, we just make one copy of it for each term. This "
,,"polynomial has three terms: x squared, positive 3x and negative 5. So we distribute a copy of the factor 4 to each term and we get: 4 times x squared (or just "
,,"4 x squared) 4 times 3x which is 12x (since 4 times 3 is 12), and 4 times the negative 5 which is negative 20. So the equivalent distributed form is:  4 x squared + 12x - 20 Lets see another example:  x times the group (x squared - 8x + 2) In this expression, the factor being multiplied by the group is actually a variable, but the Distributive Property works exactly the same way. And it says we can distribute that factor and multiply it by each term of the group individually. The first term is x squared (which is the same as x times x) so if we multiply that by x, well get x-cubed since that would be three xs multiplied together. "
,,"The next term is negative 8x so if we multiply that by x well have negative 8 times x times x which is the same as negative 8 x squared. Last of all we have the term positive 2, and x times positive 2 is just 2x, so after distributing the factor x to each member of the original group, we have the polynomial: x cubed - 8 x squared + 2x See why the Distributive Property is so handy in Algebra? It shows us how to multiply a polynomial by a factor! We just distribute a copy of "
,,"that factor to each of the polynomials terms. So I know what youre thinking if we can distribute something to each member of a group Can we do the process in REVERSE and UN-distribute something? We sure can! Take a look at this polynomial:  4 x cubed + 4 x squared + 4x Notice that each term of this polynomial has a factor of 4 as its number part. In fact it kinda looks like someone distributed a factor of 4 to each term. Since distributing a factor means making multiple copies of it for each member of a group, UN-distributing is going to mean consolidating multiple copies of a factor into a single copy that is multiplied by the whole group. "
,,"So in this case, we can remove the factor of '4' that is being multiplied by each term individually, and then we can consolidate those into a single factor of '4' that is being multiplied by the entire polynomial by using parentheses to turn the polynomial into a group. But mathematicians usually dont call this UN-distributing a 4. Instead they would say that we factored out a 4 from the polynomial. So you can use the Distributive Property both ways. If you get the expression a times the group (b + c), you can distribute a copy of the factor a to each member of the group. But if youre given the expression, ab + ac, you can apply the Distributive Property in reverse and factor out the a so that it is multiplied by the whole group at once. Its important to realize that neither of these changes the value of the expression. Distributing and UN-distributing a factor are just ways of going back and forth between two equivalent forms of an expression. And it works in "
,,"cases where its not quite so obvious too. For example, Look at this polynomial: 8x + 6y + 4z. Notice that each of the number parts of this polynomial is an even number which means it contains a factor of 2. 8 is 2 times 4 6 is 2 times 3 and 4 is 2 times 2 So each of these terms has a common factor of 2 and that means that if we want to, we can factor out that 2. We can apply the Distributive Property in reverse! We remove the 2 from each term and consolidate it to form a single factor thats multiplied by the whole polynomial at once. And it works exactly the same way for variables too. What if we have the polynomial:  a x squared + ax + a Each of these terms has the common factor a so you could UN-distribute or factor out the a. Notice that when we do that to the last term (which was just a) that term becomes a 1 because there is always a factor of 1 being multiplied by any term. Alright, so thats the basics of how the Distributive Property works "
,,"in Algebra. As you can see, it can get pretty complicated for big Polynomials, but the most important thing is to understand how it works in simple cases so you can "
,,"build on that understanding in the future. Being able to recognize the pattern of the Distributive Property and to apply it both directions will allow you to rearrange algebraic expressions and equations when you need to. And remember the key to really understanding math is to try working some practice problems so that you actually use what youve learned in the video. As always, thanks for watching Math Antics"

Operations of While number,fd-E18EqSVk,"Hi and welcome to Math Antics. In this video, were going to learn about an important math concept called rounding. To help you understand what rounding is, lets think about how numbers are usually used. Most of the time, numbers are used to represent amounts of things, like how many miles it is to the super market, or how many days until your birthday, or how many students went to your high school. How many students went to my high school?  Oh, about 2,000. Okay. Um  But it wasnt exactly 2,000 was it? Well, no it was more like 1,900. Ah, but it probably wasnt exactly 1,900 either, was it. Well noooo it was more like. 1,860 Alright, fine!  1,863! See what I did there?  At first, the number used to represent the students at high school was a round number. It was a good estimate of how many students there were, but it wasnt exact. The next two numbers were a little closer to the truth, but they were still estimates. Only the final number represented the exact amount of students at the school. All three of the estimate are rounded versions of the exact count, but they have different levels of precision. 1,860 was the most precise estimate, and 2,000 was the least precise estimate. So rounding a number basically means making a less precise version of it. And as you can see, theres usually multiple ways to round a number depending on the level of precision that you need. A really good way to understand whats going on when you round a number is to look at a number line. Heres 1,863.  If we want to round it to the nearest 10, we need to decide if it goes up to 1,870 or down to 1,860. But if we want to round it to the nearest 100, we need to decide if it goes up to 1,900 or down to 1,800. And if we want to round it to the nearest 1,000, we need to decide if it goes up to 2,000 or down to 1,000. And in each case, the decision was based on which round number was closer to the original exact number. But you might be wondering, Why would we ever want to make a number less precise in the first place? What is rounding good for? Well, rounding numbers can often make them a lot easier to do calculations with. Like, it would be a lot easier to quickly add 300 and 500 than it would be to add 312 and 498. Or, sometimes you just dont need very much precision. Like, you "
,,"might not need to know that your dog weighs 55.83297 kilograms. 55.8 kg might be precise enough! And some numbers, like repeating decimals or irrational numbers HAVE to be rounded off, because we cant just keep on writing decimal digits forever! Okay, now that you know what rounding is and why we do it, for the rest of this video, were going to focus on learning the procedure we follow to round off a number. Do you remember how our number system is based on digits and number places? Each "
,,"digit of a number occupies a particular number place. And each number place is named according to the amount it represents (or counts). And its important to know those names whenever youre rounding a number, because youll usually be asked to round to a specific number place. For example, you may be asked to round a number the nearest 10 or the nearest 100. Or, you might be asked to round a number off to the nearest tenth or hundredth. You may even be asked to round  to the nearest whole number, which is another way of asking you to round to the ones place. Okay, so when youre asked to round a number, the first step is to pay very close attention "
,,"to which number place you need to round to. That number place is important because it represents the smallest unit of counting that youre going to keep in your rounded version of the number. In fact, that number place (and the digit inside of it) is so important that Im going to give it a special name just for this video. Lets call it the target. As I mentioned, rounding a number means making a new (less precise) version of it. In that new number, any digits that are in number places smaller than the target will automatically get replaced with zeros. And in most cases, any digits that are in number places larger than the target will automatically be kept the same in the new rounded version. There are some exceptions as well see later in this video. So that seems pretty simple. All the bigger digits you keep and the smaller digits you zero. But what about that target digit itself? What do we do with that? Well, were going to do one of two things: We are either going to keep that digit the same, OR we are going to increase it by one. If we keep that target digit the same, thats called rounding down, which might seem strange at first. I mean, how can leaving the digit the same be rounding down? But remember, were going to automatically replace all of the smaller places with zero. And doing that makes the rounded number smaller, even if the target digit stays the same. On the other hand, increasing the target digit by one is called rounding up, since the new rounded number will be larger than the original number. Alright but how do we decide which to do?  How do we know if we keep the target digit the same or increase it by one? The key is to look at the digit in the next smaller number place; the digit thats just to the right of the target digit. If that "
,,"digit is less than 5 (in other words, if its a 0,1,2,3,4) then well leave the target digit the same in the rounded version. But, if that digit is a 5 or greater (5,6,7,8,or 9) then we will increase the target digit by one. Okay, so now that you know the basic procedure for rounding numbers.  Lets try a few specific examples. Heres the first one: Round 24,623 to the nearest hundred. Since we need to round to the nearest hundred, we first need to identify the digit in the hundreds place. That digit is a 6, so thats our target. And we know that any digits to the right of the target will be replaced with zeros in our rounded version. Next lets decide what to do with the target digit.  We either keep it the same OR we increase it by one. To decide, we look at the value of the next digit to the right. Since that digit is only a '2' (which is less than 5), we round down which means that well keep the target digit the same in the rounded number. Last, we just keep all the digits in bigger number places the same in the rounded version. There weve rounded the original number to the nearest hundred and the answer is 24,600. Lets try another problem. This one has some decimal digits: 32.725 and were asked to round it to the nearest whole number. That means our target digit is in the ones place we need to round it to the nearest one. So any digits to the right of the ones place will just be replaced with zeros in the rounded version. Now, to decide what to do with the target digit, we look at the next digit to the right. Since that digit is a 7 well round up this time.  That means well increase our target digit by one. And finally, we keep any digits to the left of the target digit the same. In this case, thats just the 3.  So, weve rounded this number off to 33.000. or just 33 since we dont really need those extra zeros after the decimal point. ready for one more?  Lets round 65.7991 to the nearest hundredth. The first step is to identify the hundredths place as our target. That place contains the digit '9'. All the digits in smaller number places will just be replaced with zero in the rounded version. Next, we need to decide if we will leave the target digit the same or increase it by one, so we look at the digit to the right of the target. Its a 9 also, so well definitely be rounding up. But since the target digit is already a 9, raising it by 1 is a little more complicated. When you add 1 to a digit that is already 9, you need change it to 0 and increase the digit in the NEXT bigger number place by one. So that means that our "
,,"target digit will become zero and we need to increase the digit in the next bigger number place. That digit is a 7 so well increase it to an 8. The rest of the digits in the original number will be kept the same in the rounded version. So our rounded version will be 65.80. As you can see, in some cases, rounding can actually change the digits to the left of the target digit also. Its sort of a domino effect that can happen when rounding numbers. If you have a lot of 9s, rounding can bump them all up like a chain reaction. Like, what if you need to round 1,999,999 to the nearest 10? The 9 in the ones place tells us that we need to round "
,,"our target digit up by one, but its already a 9 so we need to zero it and increase the next number place, but thats already a 9 so we need to zero it and increase the NEXT number place, but thats already a 9, and that pattern continues until we end up with 2,000,000 as our final rounded number. So sometimes rounding a number is pretty simple, and other times its a little more involved. The key is to remember the rule that if the digit to the right of the target is less than 5, we leave the target digit the same, but if its 5 or more, we increase the target digit by one, even if that causes a chain reaction with the bigger number places. Alright, so now you know a lot about rounding numbers.  You know why we round numbers and youve seen the basic procedure in action. But just watching a video "
,,"about rounding isnt enough to get really good at it. The only way to do that is to practice, so be sure to try rounding some numbers on your own. In fact, rounding "
,,"is such an important math skill that you should probably practice it a lot until youve really got it mastered. As always, thanks for watching Math Antics and Ill see ya next time. Learn more at www.mathantics.com"

Operations of While number,tfZKwMdTt2w,hi I'm Tiffany today I'm going to show you how to add and subtract with fractions and mixed numbers adding and subtracting mixed numbers when adding mixed numbers you want to add your whole numbers together then add your fraction after you're done you're going to place both numbers together meaning you're going to add your whole numbers back to your fractions when subtracting mixed numbers you want to make both numbers into improper fractions then subtract like normal let's jump into example number one example number one I have seven and three tenths plus one and three-fourths I'm going to add my whole numbers like I mentioned before I have seven over 
,,here and a one over here that's going to give me an eight now I'm going to write my fractions directly below these fractions so now three tenths plus 3/4 is really just what we're working with we don't need to consider the whole number anymore until the very end when we add it to whatever we get right here now I'm not going to go into a whole bunch of detail of how to add fractions because I have a whole video dedicated just to that so I'm going to move a little quicker here assuming that you already know how to do it we need to find a common denominator to add right now we have a 10 and a 4 the least common denominator between these two fractions is going to be 20 so I'm going to rewrite both fractions with the denominator of 20 now I have to ask myself to go from 10 to 20 what did I multiply 10 by I multiplied it by 2 now the rule is whenever you multiply the denominator by a number you have to multiply the numerator by that same number so if I multiplied my 10 by 2 to get 
,,20 I must also multiply my 3 by 2 to get my new numerator so 3 times 2 is 6 I'm going to follow the same process over here to go from four to twenty I multiplied by 
,,five so I have to multiply this three by five three times five is fifteen now I add and if you remember your denominator remains the same and your numerator is the only part that gets added becomes twenty-one here this is an improper fraction so I'm going to divide to figure out what this fraction should look like in a mixed form it's going to be 1 + 1 xx I did that division in my head if you're not sure how I did that I'll show you really quickly over here i divided 20 into 21 remember you always divide the bottom number into the top number remember my example with sunny and windy the 21 always gets blown over the sunny and windy example comes from another video 20 goes into 21 one time and it is 20 so when I subtract I get 1 so these are my numbers whenever we divide we go pick up our numbers and it sort of makes like a G shape so this is the direction we go in when we write down our answer the one up top or whatever your answer is up top becomes your whole number so that's where this one came from the subtraction the answer down here your remainder becomes your numerator and the original number that you divided with is your denominator which religious remains the same from the beginning anyway so this was pretty easy I could just do it in my head I knew that 20 was going to go to 21 one time with one left over and my denominator would remain the same now I have one in 120th but I'm not done because remember I have to add my whole number we ended up with a whole number in just a fraction portion that is okay it happens sometimes what I need to do now is take this whole number and add it here if I add 8 plus 1 I get 9 so 
,,I'm going to write nine and my fraction portion just comes with the rest of the number so my answer for example number 1 is 9 and 120th let's move on to example number two example number two we have one mixed number and one regular fraction this time we're going to pull the 2 which is the whole number to the first fraction out to the side we don't have anything to add it to right now so I'm just going to write equals 2 over here so instead of rewriting my fractions this time I'm just going 
,,to cross out the two and use the ones that were already here so now we're only dealing with the fraction portions of the problem just like we did in the last example we move the whole numbers to the side and then we dealt with only the fraction portion so I need to get a common denominator the common denominator between 2 and 5 
,,that's the easiest to work with is going to be 10 5 times 2 gives me 10 so 2 times 2 is 4 2 times 5 gives me 10 so 1 times 5 is 5 now I'm going to add these two and 
,,I get 9 over 10 now it's time for me to add my whole number back to my fraction that would be 2 and 9 tenths the answer to example number two is two and nine tenths 
,,let's move on to example number three example number three we have two whole numbers that we can pull out and add this time we have four and two and that gives me six now I'm going to cross these out again my whole numbers so that I don't have to rewrite my fractions because we've already dealt with the whole numbers over here a good common denominator to use here would be 14 and just a note whenever your denominator that you choose to use to add or subtract is already the denominator of one of your original numbers that entire fraction just remains the same so I can just write a three here and not worry about trying to figure out 14 times what gave me this answer because really if I did do it that way it would be 14 times 1 gives me the 14 so that means that multiply my top number by one and remember anything times one is always itself so 3 times 1 is going to be 3 anyway we're adding let's address this fraction 7 times what gives me the 14 7 times 2 that means I need to multiply times 2 up here 3 times 2 is 6 when I add these I get 9 and 14 now I need to add my whole number back to my fraction and I get 6 and 9 14 the answer to example number 3 is 6 and 9 14 let's move on to example number four example number four you have subtraction this time here's my personal tip for solving a subtraction problem with mixed numbers I prefer to change my mixed number into an improper fraction from the beginning there are going to be times where your numerator is smaller in your first number then it is in your second number just the same way is when you have to regroup and subtraction when you're doing regular subtraction what you're supposed to do if you want to choose to keep your whole number separate is borrow from your whole number in my opinion that gets really complicated I think it's easier to just make the mixed number into an improper fraction in the beginning and then subtract instead of trying to borrow let me show you what that looks like to make a mixed number into an improper fraction you are going to multiply your denominator and your whole number and then you're going to add what you get to your numerator that entire answer is going to become your new numerator you always work in a clockwise direction so let me show you what that looks like 9 times 2 is 18 18 plus 5 is 23 23 is going to become my new numerator my denominator remains the same now I'm going to subtract over here again I need to make my mixed number into an improper fraction 6 times 1 is 6 6 plus 5 is 11 11 is my new numerator and 6 is my denominator now I can think of this as a regular subtraction problem I need to get a common denominator between 9 and 6 the smallest denominator to work with is 18 so I'm going to write 18 here and 18 here and again I'm going to ask myself what does I do to take this number to that number and then do the same thing to my numerator what did I do to go from 9 to 18 i multiplied 9 times 2 so that means I need to take 
,,my 23 and multiply it by 2 if I multiply 23 by 2 you may not know what that is so you can come to the side of your paper so that's what I'm going to do it's 46 to go from 6 to 18 what did you do x 3 11 times 3 is 33 now we can subtract remember our denominator will remain the same we have 18 right now now 46 minus 33 is 13 13 18 cannot be simplified so my answer to example number 4 is 13 18 let's move on to example number 5 again we're subtracting and we have mixed numbers I prefer to make 
,,my numbers into improper fractions I think it's the easiest way 10 times 7 is 70 70 plus 7 is 77 so 77 becomes my new numerator in 10 is my denominator we're going to subtract I need to multiply down here and up here 4 times 6 is 24 24 plus 3 is 27 that's my new numerator my denominator remains 4 now I need to get a common denominator between these two and that would be 20 to go from 10 to 20 I multiply by 2 so I need to take my 77 and multiply it by 2 77 times 2 is 154 now I'm going to subtract to go from 4 to 20 I have to multiply 4 times 5 that means I need to multiply 27 times 5 27 times 5 is 135 now it's time for me to subtract I have 154 minus 135 and that is 19 and my denominator remains the same which is 20 so answer to example number five is 19 over 20 let's move on to our final example example number 6 example number 6 again I need to make my mixed number into an improper fraction multiply here and here 10 times 3 is 30 30 plus 2 is 32 my denominator remains the same I'm going to subtract 10 times 1 is 10 10 plus 9 is 19 19 over 10 is my next fraction 32 minus 19 is 13 my denominator remains the same now I need to divide here a quick reminder of how we divide that is 10 going in to 13 goes in one time and it's 10 you subtract and you get 3 and remember this order tells you how to pick up your numbers how to write them down your 1 becomes your whole number your 3 or your remainder is your numerator and your 10 is your denominator 3 tenths cannot be simplified so the answer to example number 6 is 1 & 3 tenths that's my last example thanks for watching if you liked this video don't forget to click like then head over to super easy math comm from our math tutorials printable video notes worksheets and more

Operations of While number,VZ0jG3W53nE,"Hi, Im Rob.  Welcome to Math Antics! In this video, were going to talk about a really important math concept called The Distributive Property. Well at least thats what its was called sometimes. You may hear it referred to as The Distributive Law or even the  The Distributive Property of Multiplication over Addition by people who want to sound really technical. But no matter what its called, the concept of the Distributive Property is the same. Before we actually dive into that concept, there are two quick things that will help make it easier to understand. The first is simply knowing what the word Distribute mean. To distribute something "
,,"means to give it to each member of a group. like an old-fashioned paper boy delivering newspapers to each house in a neighborhood. One for you One for you Oh! Gee!  Sorry!! One for you And one for you The second thing you need to know is the order of operations rules of arithmetic, which we cover in another video, so you might want to watch that if youre not familiar with those rules already. Thats because the Distributive Property is actually a way of allowing us to change the order of operations we do in certain types of problems. To see what I mean, have a look at this simple arithmetic expression: three times the group 4 plus 6. Were going "
,,"to simplify this expression in two different ways. The first way will just use the basic order of operations rules that you already know. But the second way will use the Distributive Property. And if we do the arithmetic right, both ways will give us the same answer. So for the first way, our order of operations rules tell us that we need to do any operations inside of groups first. And since these parentheses form a group, we first need to add the 4 and 6 which gives us 10. Next, we can multiply that by the 3 which gives us a final answer of 30. Now lets use the Distributive Property. The Distributive Property allows us to change this expression into a different form. Instead of multiplying the 3 by the whole group at once, we can distribute that factor of 3 and multiply it by each member of the group individually. That means well make a copy of the 3 times for each member of the group the 4 and the 6. So after applying the Distributive Property, our expression looks like this: 3 times 4 PLUS 3 times 6. Because we distributed the multiplication to each member of the group, the group isnt needed anymore so the parentheses can go away. Now we can continue to simplify this new form using our order of operations rules. Those rules tell us to do multiplication before addition, so 3 times 4 is 12 and 3 times 6 is 18. The last step is to add those two results together.  12 + 18 = 30. Well look at that we got the same answer in both cases, which means our original expressions are equivalent, even though they have different forms. In the first form, the factor 3 is being multiplied by the entire group all at once, so we needed to do the addition inside the group first. But in the second form, we used the distributive property to rearrange the expression so that the factor of 3 is multiplied by each member of the group individually, instead of the whole group all at once. Distributing that factor made the group go away, so we didnt have to do "
,,"the addition inside that group first. So the Distributive Property is basically a way of getting rid of a group that is being multiplied by a factor. If you distribute the factor to each member of the group, youll get the same answer you would if you calculate whats in the group first and then multiply. And it works no matter "
,,"how many members are in the group. Like in this problem, we have to multiply 4 by the group (1 + 2 + 3). Again, lets try simplifying this both ways. In the first way, we start by simplifying whats in the group. 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 and then we multiply 4 times 6 which gives us 24. Now let's use the Distributive Property. We distribute a factor of 4 to each member of the group which makes the group go away and allows us to do those multiplications individually. 4 times 1 is 4 4 times 2 is 8 and 4 times 3 is 12 Finally, we add up those three individual answers: 4 plus 8 is 12 and 12 plus 12 is 24. See, the Distributive Property gave us another way to arrive at the same answer. Its like the Distributive Property is an alternate path that you can take to arrive at the same point! Oh!  Wa.What are you doing here!? Im always here! Okay, great, we have two ways to get the same answer. But, why do we need two different ways to do the same calculation? And it seemed like the Distributive Property way was even more complicated that the regular way. Why would we ever want to use it? Thats a good question.  And its true! There are times where the "
,,Distributive Property way is harder like in our first problem. It was easier to just go ahead and simplify the group first because its easy to multiply 3 times 10 
,,"mentally. BUT there are also times when the Distributive Property way is easier, like in this case: 8 times the group (50 + 3) If we decide to simplify the group first in this problem, we end up needing to multiply 8 times 53 which is not so easy to do mentally. But if we apply the Distributive Property instead, we can change "
,,"the expression into 8  50 plus 8  3. And thats easier to do mentally. 8 times 50 is 400 and 8 times 3 is 24. So the answer is 424. Realizing that the Distributive Property can make some calculations easier to do mentally can come in really handy for certain basic multi-digit multiplication problems. Thats because you can break up the multi-digit factor into a group sum ya know like expanded form. and then distribute the other factor to the members of that group. sound confusing?  Heres what I mean Lets say you need to multiply 5 times 47. Well, you could just use the multi-digit multiplication procedure, OR, you could change this into a problem where the Distributive Property will make it a little easier to do. The key is to realize that you can replace the 47 with 40 plus 7. Then the problem becomes 5 times the group (40 + 7) and the Distributive Property lets us change that into 5 times 40 plus 5 times 7. Those two multiplications are easy to do! 5 times 40 "
,,is 200 and 5 times 7 is 35. So our answer is 200 plus 35 or 235. Wanna see another example? Lets apply that same idea to this multiplication problem:  3 times 127 
,,"But instead of 127, lets change that into the group (100 + 20 + 7). We need to multiply that by 3 and the Distributive Property lets us distribute that multiplication to each member of the group: 3  100 + 3  20 + 3  7 That helps because we can do those mentally: 3 times 100 is 300 3 times 20 is 60 and 3 times 7 is 21. All "
,,"thats left to do is add those three products up which is not too hard to do mentally either. 300 + 60 + 21 gives us 381 as our final answer. Now before we wrap up, "
,,"theres one more important thing you should know about the Distributive Property. You already know that the Distributive Property works when the members of a group are being added, but it works the same way for members of a group that are being subtracted. like in this problem:  7 times the group (10 - 4) You could do this problem the typical way and simplify the group first. 10 minus 4 is 6 and then 7 times 6 gives us 42. OR you can use the distributive property. You distribute the 7 times to both members of the group to get 7 times 10  MINUS  7 times 4. 7 times 10 equals 70 and 7 times 4 is 28. And 70 minus 28 equals 42. Again, both ways are equivalent! So the distributive Property works for groups of ANY size and it works the same for group members that are being added OR subtracted. even if theres a mixture of addition and subtraction in the group. But The Distributive Property DOESNT work when the members of a group are being multiplied or divided. For example if "
,,"you have 5 times the group (2  3) You CANT distribute a copy of the factor 5 to each member of the group without getting a completely different answer. And the same goes for division. If the members of the group are being divided, like 4 times the group (6  2) you will NOT get the right answer if you distribute the factor 4 to each member. Thats why the 'technical' name is the Distributive Property of Multiplication over Addition. Youre distributing the multiplication over all the "
,,"members of a group that are being ADDED. And the reason that it also works for subtraction is that subtraction is really just a negative form of addition, since subtraction and addition are inverse operations. Alright, so the Distributive Property is a handy way to rearrange arithmetic expressions. Its like a tool that you can "
,,"use in certain situations if you think it will make a particular calculation easier to do. And even if you dont end up using The Distributive Property a whole lot for arithmetic problems, its still a really important math concept that will be even more useful when you get to Algebra. Until then, be sure to practice what youve learned in this video by trying some of the exercise problems. Practice is the best way to make sure you really understand.

Operations of While number,cARsEw-s8Fg,welcome to math and with mr. J in this video we're going to be dividing mixed numbers and as you can see there are two problems on your screen that we're going to be going through in order to get this down now up top there's a very important rule we need to remember when it comes to dividing fractions keep switch and flip so keep that in mind and reference the top of that screen as we go through these problems so let's jump right in to number one so we have 3 and 3/4 divided by 1 and 1/2 so the first thing we need to do when we're dividing mixed numbers we need to change them to improper fractions that way we have a numerator and a denominator so let's change 3 and 3/4 to an improper fraction so the first thing we need to do is do 4 times 3 and then add the numerator so 4 times 3 is 12 plus that 3 is 15 so that 15 is going to be the numerator of our improper fraction we keep the denominator of 4 this 4 right here denominator stays the same now 15 fourths holds the same value 
,,as 3 and 3/4 we're not changing the problem at all we're just putting it into a different form divided by let's do 1 and a half now 2 times 1 is 2 plus 1 is 3 keep the denominator of 2 the same now we have 15 fourths divided by 3 halves so now we need to follow our dividing fractions rules keep switch and flip so the first improper fraction we keep fifteen fourths we switch the division sign to multiplication and swint's since we switched division to the opposite to multiplication we need to flip the second fraction so the two is going to go up top and the three is going to be our denominator so two thirds now we can multiply straight across to give us our answer 15 times two 30 and 4 times 3 is 12 so 30 over 12 is our final answer but we don't want to leave it in as an improper fraction so we need to change it to a mixed number so the first thing we need to do how many whole groups of 12 can we pull out of 30 30 divided by 12 well 12 24 two whole groups of 12 can be pulled out of 30 with a remainder of 6 and we keep our denominator of 12 the same so again two whole groups of 12 can be pulled out of 30 with a remainder of 6 and we keep that denominator of 12 the same so two and six twelfths is our answer but let's check to see if the fractional part the six twelfths can be simplified and it can a common factor the greatest common factor between 6 and 12 is 6 so I'm going to divide both the 6 and 12 by 6 to put that fraction in its lowest terms so we get 2 and 6 divided by 6 is 1 and 12 divided by 6 is 2 so our final simplified answer is 2 and 1/2 so let's try number 2 now so for number 2 we have 10 and 1/3 divided by 3 and 4/5 so again first thing we need to do change these to improper fractions so we have a numerator and a denominator 3 times 10 is 30 plus 1 is 31 we keep our denominator of 3 the same again not changing the value of these mixed numbers or the problem in general just changing the form the mixed numbers are in it divided by 5 times 3 is 15 plus 4 is 9 teen keep the denominator of 5 the same now we need to keep switch and flip so 31 thirds we keep switch the multiplication and flip the second 
,,fraction now we can multiply straight across to get our final answer so 31 times 5 is a hundred fifty-five and three times 19 is 57 so that's our answer but we don't want to leave it as an improper fraction so we need to change it back to a mixed number so we need to do 155 / 57 so I'm going to come to the bottom here some of these you might not be able to do mental math I'm not sure how many groups of 57 can be pulled out of 155 how many whole groups so I'm going to come down to divide and it turns out that two whole groups of 57 can be pulled out of 155 and that gets me to 114 let's subtract to see what the remainder is going to be and the remainder 
,,is going to be 41 so 2 all 57 is out of 155 with the remainder of 41 keep the denominator of 57 same now 41 over 57 is in simplest form there's no other common factors between the two than one so it is done and our answer is two and 41:57 so there you have it there's how you divide mixed numbers change to improper fractions and 
,,then keep switch and flip thanks so much for watching until next time peace

Operations of While number,jcetv-5QDww,in this video I'm gonna show you how to multiply a mixed number by a whole number and vice versa and I'm gonna show you two methods of doing it so in the first half 
,,of the video I'm gonna focus on the first method and in the second half the second method if you're interested so let's multiply 4 and 2/5 by 6 so in the first method what I'm gonna do is convert this into an improper fraction so what you need to do is multiply 4 and 5 which is 20 and then add 2 the denominator will remain the same this won't change so 4 and 2/5 is the same as 22 over 5 so now we need to multiply 22 over 5 by 6 or 6 over 1 and so we need to multiply across so 22 times 6 2 times 6 is 12 carry over the 1 2 times 6 is 12 plus 1/2 that's 13 so 22 times 6 is 132 so this is equal to 132 over 5 now how can we convert 132 over 5 back to a mixed number we need to use long division how many times does 5 go into 13 5 goes into 13 2 times 5 times 2 is 10 and 13 minus 10 is 3 and then we need to bring down the 2 now how many times does 5 go into 32 5 goes into 32 6 times 5 times 6 is 30 and the difference is 2 so our answer as a mixed number is going to be 26 and 2/5 so the 26 that's the whole number and the remainder which is 2 that's going to be the numerator of the mixed fraction and so this is our answer 26 and 2/5 now let's work on another example let's multiply three and two-fifths by eight so let's convert this mixed number into an improper fraction so it's going to be five times 3 which 
,,is 15 and then plus 2 so that's 17 so we're multiplying 17 over 5 by 8 or 8 over 1 now what is 17 times 8 17 is basically 10 plus 7 and so if you distribute 10 times 8 is 80 8 times 7 is 56 and if you add these two you get 136 so 17 times 8 is 136 and 5 times 1 is 5 so now let's convert this improper fraction back into a mixed number so how many times does five and go into 13 you'll know it's 2 5 times 2 is 10 13 minus 10 is 3 and then bring down the 6 how many times does 5 go into 36 5 goes into 36 7 times 5 times 7 is 35 and we get a remainder of 1 so this fraction is equal to 27 and 1/5 and so that's the answer for the second example for the sake of practice let's try two more example problems so let's multiply 7 by 5 and 1/4 feel free to pause the video and try this problem so let's convert the mixed number into an improper fraction so we're going to keep the denominator the same and then we're going to multiply 5 + 4 which is 20 and then we're gonna add 1 to it so we have 21 + 7 we're gonna write that as 7 over 1 now let's multiply 21 by 7 7 times 1 is 7 7 times 2 is 14 so this is gonna give us 147 and then 4 times 1 is so now let's convert 147 over four into a mixed number so let's use long division how many times does 4 go into 14 4 goes into 14 3 times 4 times 3 is 12 if we tried four four times for 16 and that exceeds 14 so we can't use that 14 minus 12 is 2 bringing out a 7 we have 27 now how many times does 4 go into 27 4 goes into 27 6 times 4 times 6 is 24 and so the remainder Street so our final answer is going to be 36 and three-fourths so that's it now let's multiply nine and three and five-eighths so let's begin by converting the mixed number into an improper fraction so the denominator will stay the same and then we need to multiply 3 by 8 3 times 8 is 24 24 plus 5 is 29 so now we need to multiply 9 by 29 one way you can do this is you can think of 29 as 30 a minus 1 and then distribute what's the 9 times 30 9 times 3 is 27 so 9 times 30 is 270 and the height times negative 1 is negative 9 so this is going to be 261 so we have 261 over 8 now let's go ahead and convert that into a mixed number so let's use long division how many times does 8 go into 26 so we know that 8 goes into 26 3 times 8 times 3 is 24 and 26 minus 24 is 2 now let's bring down to 1 
,,how many times this a go into 21 it goes into 21 2 times 8 times 2 is 16 and the difference between 21 and 16 is 5 so our answer is going to be 32 and five-eighths now let's go over the same four examples but using another method so let's start with the first problem 4 and 2/5 times 6 now we can expand a mixed number and write it this way we can write it as a whole number plus the fraction so that's 4 plus 2/5 and then multiply that by 6 so let's distribute 4 times 6 is 24 and then we can multiply 2 over 5 times 6 which is the same as 2 over 5 times 6 over 1 and so 2 times 6 is 12 5 times 1 is 5 so we have 24 plus 12 over 5 now this is an improper fraction and so I'm going to break it down into two other fractions 12 over 5 I'm gonna write that as 10 over 5 plus 2 over 5 the reason being is 10 is the highest multiple of 5 and just under 12 and so this will produce a proper fraction now 10 divided by 5 is 2 and 24 plus 2 is 26 so I get 26 plus 2 over 5 which is 26 and 2/5 so that's another way in which you can get the same answer now let's do the same thing with the second example so let's begin by expanding the mixed number as a whole number and a fraction 1/8 I'm gonna write that as 8 over 1 so 3 times 8 we know that's 24 and then 2/5 times 8 or 2 times 8 that's 16 5 times 1 is 5 now how should we 
,,decompose that fraction what is the highest multiple of 5 under 16 so multiples of 5 are 5 10 15 20 so I want to use 15 so I'm going to write 16 over 5 as 15 over 5 
,,and then if you take the difference between 16 and 15 16 minus 15 is 1 so the missing fraction is 1 over 5 so now we can divide 15 by 5 and that's going to give a stream and then we can combine 24 plus 3 24 plus 3 is 27 so it's 27 plus 1 over 5 which is 27 and 1/5 and so that is the answer so let's work on a third example and you could pause the video if you want to try it so I'm going to multiply directly 7 times 5 is 35 and then it's going to be 7 times 1/4 and you can think of the 7 as 7 over 1 times 1 4 and so 7 times 1 is 7 and then 1 times 4 is 4 now 7 over 4 I need to write that as 4 over 4 plus 3 over 4 and 4 divided by 4 is 1 so I have 35 plus 1 plus 3 over 4 and then I need to combine 35 and 1 which is 36 so the final answer is going to be 36 and 3 over 4 and that is it for this problem now let's work on the last example nine times three and five eighths so let's multiply directly nine times three is 27 and then nine times 5 over 8 so first we're going to multiply nine and five so that's going to give us 45 and then 1 times 8 which is 8 now what is the highest multiple of 8 under 45 so multiples of 8 are 8 16 24 32 40 48 40 a is too much so we're going to use 40 so I'm gonna break down 45 over 8 as 40 over 8 plus something else 45 minus 40 is 5 so the missing fraction is 5 over 8 so now we could simplify this fraction 40 divided by 8 is 5 and then we can add these to 27 plus 5 is 32 and so this gives us the final answer of 32 and five-eighths

Operations of While number,NybHckSEQBI,"Hi! This is Rob. Welcome to Math Antics. In this lesson, we're going to learn some really important things about a whole branch of math called Algebra. The first thing you need to know is that Algebra is a lot like arithmetic. It follows all the rules of arithmetic and it uses the same four main operations that arithmetic is built on: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. But Algebra introduces a new element... the element of the unknown. When you were learning arithmetic, the only thing that was ever unknown was the answer to the problem. For example, you might have the problem 1 + 2 = what? The answer isn't known until you go ahead and "
,,"do the arithmetic. Now the important thing about Algebra is that when we don't know what a number is yet, we use a symbol in its place. that symbol is usually just any letter of the alphabet. A really popular letter to choose is the letter 'x'. So in arithmetic, we would just leave the problem like this: 1 + 2 = ""blank"" and we'd write in the answer when we did the addition. But in Algebra, we'd write it like this:  1 + 2 = x The 'x' is a place holder that stands for the number that we don't know yet. What we have here is a very basic algebraic equation. An equation is just a mathematical statement that two things are equal. An equation says, ""the things on this side of the equal sign have the same value as the things on the other side of the equal sign."" In this case, our equation is telling us that the known values on this side (1+2) are equal to what's on the other side, which happens to be the unknown value that we are calling 'x'. One of the main goals in Algebra is to figure out what the unknown values in equations are. And when you do that, it's called ""solving the equations"". In this equation, it's pretty easy to see that the unknown value is just 3. All you have to do is actually add the 1 and 2 together on this side of the equation and it turns into 3 = x, which is the same as x = 3. So now we know what 'x' is!  It's just 3. That almost seems too easy, doesnt it? And that's why in Algebra, you are usually given an equation in a more complicated form like this: x - 2 = 1. This is exactly the same equation as 1 + 2 = x, but it has been rearranged so that it's not quite as easy to tell what 'x' is. So in Algebra, solving equations is a lot like a game where you are given mixed-up, complicated equations, and it's your job to simplify them and rearrange them until it is a nice simple equation (like x = 3) where it's easy to tell what the unknown values are. We're going to learn a lot more about how you actually do that (how you solve equations) in the next several videos, but for now, let's learn some important rules about how symbols can and can't be used in algebraic equations. The first rule you need to know is that the same symbol (or letter) can be used in different algebra problems to stand for different unknown values. For example, in the problem we just solved, the letter 'x' was used to stand for the number 3, right? But 'x' could stand for a different number in a different problem. Like, if someone asks us to solve the equation, 5 + x = 10. In order for the two sides of this equation to be equal, 'x' must have the value '5' in this problem, because 5 + 5 = 10. So 'x' (or any other symbol) can stand for different values in different problems. That's okay, but what's NOT okay is for a symbol to stand for different values in the same problem at the same time! For example, what if you had the equation: x + x = 10? This equation says that if we add 'x' to 'x' we will get 10. And there are a lot of different numbers we could add together to get 10, like 6 and 4. But, if we had the first 'x' stand for 6 and the second 'x' stand for 4, then 'x' would stand for two different value at the same time and things could get really confusing! If you wanted symbols to stand for two different numbers at the same time, you would need to use two different symbols, like 'x' and 'y'. So in Algebra, whenever you see the same symbol repeated more than once in an equation, it's representing the same unknown value. Like if you see a really complicated Algebraic equation (like this), where 'x' is repeated a lot of different times, all of those 'x's stand for the same value, and it will be your job to figure out what that value is. Okay, so for any particular equation, we can't use the same letter to represent two different numbers at the same time, but what about the other way around? Could we use two different letters to represent the same number? Yes! - Here's an example of that. Let's say you have the equation: a + b = 2 What could 'a' and 'b' stand for so that the equation is true? Well, If 'a' was 0 and 'b' was 2, then the equation would be true. Or, we could switch them around. If 'a' was 2 and 'b' was 0, the equation would also be true. But there's another possibility: If 'a' was 1 and 'b' was also 1, that would make the equation true, right? So, even though 'a' and 'b' are different symbols, and would usually be used to represent different numbers, there are times when they might happen to represent the same number. Oh, and this problem can help us understand something very important about how symbols are used in Algebra. Did you notice that there were different possible solution for this equation? In other words, 'b' could have the value 0, 1, or 2 depending on what the value of 'a' was. If 'a' is 0 then 'b' must be 2 If 'a' is 1 then 'b' must be 1 If 'a' is 2 then 'b' must be 0 'b' can't have two different values at the same time, but it's value can change over time if the value of 'a' changes. In Algebra, 'b' is what's called a ""variable"" because it's value can 'vary' or change. In fact, in this equation, both 'a' and 'b' are variables because their values will change depending on the value of each other. Actually, it's really common in Algebra to refer to any letter as a variable, "
,,"since letters can stand for different values in different problems. But at Math Antics, we'll usually just use the word ""variable"" when we're talking about values that can change or vary in the same problem. Alright, so far we've learned that Algebra is a lot like arithmetic, but that in includes unknown values and variables that we can solve for in equations. There's one other really important thing that I want to teach you that will help you understand what's going on in a lot of Algebra "
,,"problems, and it has to do with multiplication. Here are the four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Although in Algebra, you'll usually see division written in fraction form, like this. In Arithmetic, all four operations have the same status, but in Algebra, multiplication get's some special treatment. In Algebra, multiplication is the 'default' operation. That means, if no other arithmetic operation is shown between two symbols, then you can just assume they're being multiplied. The multiplication is 'implied'. For example, instead of writing 'a' times 'b', you can leave out the times symbol and just write 'ab'. Since no operation is shown between these two symbols, you know that you're supposed to multiply 'a' and 'b'. Of course, you can't actually multiply 'a' and "
,,"'b' until you figure out what numbers they stand for. The advantage of this rule about multiplication is that it makes many algebraic equations less cluttered and easier to write down. For example, instead of this: a * b + c * d = 10 You could just write: ab + cd = 10. You can also use this shorthand when you are multiplying a variable and a known number... like 2x, which means the same thing as 2 times 'x' or 3y which means the same thing as 3 times 'y' Since the symbol and the number are "
,,"right next to each other, the multiplication is implied. You don't have to write it down. Finally some good news! Now I never have to write down that pesky multiplication symbol again! Oh yeah!! Ah, not so fast... there are some cases in Algebra where still need to use a multiplication symbol. For example, what if you want to show 2 x 5? If you just get rid of the times symbol and put the '2' right next to the '5', it's going to look like the two-digit number twenty-five, which is NOT the same as 2 x 5. So, whenever you need to show multiplication between two known numbers, you still have to use the times symbol, unless... you use parentheses instead. "
,,"But aren't parentheses used to show grouping in math? How can you use that to show multiplication? Ah, that's a good question. Parentheses are used to group things, "
,,"but whenever you put two groups right next to each other, with no operation between them, guess what operation is implied. Yep!  Multiplication! For example, if you "
,,"see the this, it means that the group (a+b) is being multiplied by the group (x+y). We could put a times symbol between the groups, but we don't have to because it's the default operation in Algebra. The multiplication is just implied. So, going back to our problem: 2 x 5 If you wanted to, you could put each of the numbers inside parentheses like this, and then you could get rid of the multiplication sign. Now this can't be confused with the number twenty-five, and since the groups are right next to each other, you know that you need to multiply them. Of course, it might seem strange to have just one thing inside 'group' symbols like this, but it's okay to do that in math. An alternate way that you could do the same thing would be to put just one of the numbers in parentheses, like this. Again, you won't confuse this with a two-digit number and you know that multiplication is implied. Okay, so we've learned that Algebra is a lot like arithmetic, but it involves unknown values or variables that we need to solve for. And we learned that in Algebra, the multiplication sign is usually not shown, because it's the default operation. You can just assume that two things right next to each other are being multiplied. But why do we even care about Algebra? Is it good for anything in the 'real world'? or is it just a bunch of tricky problems that keep students busy in school? Actually, Algebra is very useful for describing or ""modeling""  things in the real world. It's a little hard to see that when you are just looking at all these numbers and symbols on the page of a math book. But, it's a lot easier to see when you start taking algebraic equations and graphing their solutions. Graphing an equation is like using its different solutions to draw simple lines and curves that can be used to describe and predict things in real life. For example, there's a whole class of equations in Algebra called ""linear"" equations because they form straight lines when you graph them. Those sorts of equations could help you describe the slope of a roof or tell you how long it will take to get somewhere. Another class of algebraic equations, called ""quadratic"" equations can be used to design telescope lenses, or describe how a ball flies through the air, or predict the growth of a population. So Algebra is used all the time in fields like science, engineering, economics and computer programming. And even though you might not need Algebra to get by in your day to "
,,"day life,... ...so divide both sides by 3. That means x = 42. So... in three... two... one... YES!! Alright... now to see how much butter I need. It's still a very useful part of math. Thanks for watching Math Antics,"

Operations of While number,T5Qf0qSSJFI,"Hi, Im Rob.  Welcome to Math Antics. In this lesson, were going to learn how our basic number system works and were going to learn about an important concept called Place Value. The number system that we use in math is called base 10, because is uses ten different symbols for counting. Math could use other systems that are "
,,"based on a different number (like base 2 or base 8), but Ill give you ten guesses as to why the number ten is such a popular choice. The ten symbols that we use are called digits and they look like this: zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight and nine. At first glance, you might think thats only nine digits, but remember, the zero counts as one of the digits also. To see how our numbers system uses these digits to represent amounts, lets pretend that we have an apple "
,,"orchard full of apple trees, and each of these trees is loaded with big, juicy, red apples that we need to pick and then count for our records. Were going to use something called a number place to count. The best way to understand a number place is to imagine that its like a small box thats only big enough to hold one digit at a time. As we count, well change the digit thats in the number place to match how many apples weve picked. For example, if we start with no apples at all, we "
,,"put the digit 0 in the number place because zero means none. But then, as the apples start coming in from the orchard, we begin to count one, two, three, four, "
,,"five, six, seven, eight and nine. Okay, now weve got nine apples, but weve also got a problem. Weve already run out of digits to count with. The highest digit we "
,,"have is a 9,  but there are a LOT more apples left to count. What will we do? The solution is to use groups to help us count. If we pick just one more apple, well have ten, right? So lets combine those ten apples into a single group. So how many apples do we have? Ten! BUT how many GROUPS of ten apples do we have?  Ah just ONE! Does that help us with our lack of digits problem? It sure does, IF we use another number place! Instead of using this new number place to count up individual apples one at a time like we did with the first number place. Were going to use it to count apples TEN at a time. In other words, well use it to keep track of how many groups of ten apples that weve picked. For example, if weve picked only one group of ten, then well put the digit 1 in that number place. If weve picked "
,,"two groups of ten, then well put the digit 2 in that number place, and if weve picked three groups of ten, then well put the digit 3 in that number place. And so on. Do you see whats happening? Because the new number place is being used to count GROUPS of ten, its allowing us to re-use our original ten digits, but this "
,,"time they are able to count (or represent) bigger amounts. Since this new number place is for counting groups of ten, were going to name it the tens place. And well name our original number place, the ones place because we used it to count things one at a time. And heres the really important thing were not going to use "
,,"the new number place instead of the old one were going to use it along side of the old one so that we have one number place for counting by ones and another number place for counting by tens. Using these two number places together lets us represent amounts that are in-between the groups of ten. For example, if weve already picked thirty apples, then there will be a 3 in the tens place because we have three groups of ten. But there will be a 0 in the ones place, because there are no individual apples left over. But if we have picked thirty-two apples, then there will be a 3 in the tens place and a 2 in the ones place to represent the two individual apples that are not in the groups of ten. In fact, using only our ten digits and these two number places, we can count all the way from zero up to ninety-nine. At ninety-nine, both of our number places are maxed out with the highest digits and we wont be able to count any higher, UNLESS... we get another number place! If weve picked ninety-nine apples and then we pick just one more, well have exactly one-hundred apples. And if we make a group from those one-hundred apples, we can use this new number place to count how many groups of one-hundred weve picked. That means that we can re-use the same ten digits AGAIN in this new number place to "
,,count how many groups of one-hundred we have. And you guessed it its called the hundreds place because we use it to count groups of a hundred. Are you starting to see how our base 10 number system works? It uses different number places to represent the different sized groups that we use to count. And the digits in those number places tell us how many of each group we have. The digit in the ones place tells us how many ones we have. The digit in the tens place tells us how many groups 
,,"of ten we have. And the digit in the hundreds place tells us how many groups of one-hundred we have. And have you noticed that each time we got a new number place to count larger groups, we placed it to the LEFT of the previous number place. Thats important because number places are always arranged in the exact same order. Starting with the ones place, as you move to the left, the number places represent larger and larger amounts. And did you also noticed that each new number place represents groups that are exactly ten times bigger than the previous number place? Ten is ten times bigger than one"
,,and one-hundred is ten times bigger than ten. Thats really important because it helps us see the pattern for bigger number places. It helps us to see that the next 
,,"number place will count groups of ten times one-hundred, which is one-thousand. Thats why its called the thousands place. And the next number place will count groups ten times bigger than that!  Its the ten-thousands place! And the number places keep on going like that. Next is the hundred-thousands place. Then the millions place. Then ten-millions. Then one-hundred-millions. Then billions!  And so on Oh, and you may notice that when we get a lot of number places next to each other like this, its a little hard to quickly recognize which place is which. Thats why many countries use some kind of separator every three places to make them easier to keep track of. For example, in the U.S. we use a comma every three number places to make it easier to identify things like the thousands place, or the millions "
,,"place. Seeing all these number places together helps you understand what we mean by place value. In a multi-digit number, the number PLACE that a digit is in, determines its VALUE. Even though we only have ten digits, each digit can stand for different amounts depending on the place that it occupies. If the digit 5 is in the ones place, it just means five. But, if a 5 is in the tens place, then it means fifty, and if a 5 is in the hundreds place, it means five-hundred. And its the same for bigger number places. A 5 in the hundred-thousands place means five-hundred-thousand, and a 5 in the billions place means five-billion! See how a digits place effects its value? Of course, when we work with numbers in math, most of the time the number places are invisible. But the underlying pattern is always the "
,,"same. Oh, and because the number places are invisible, in certain cases youll need to use zeros to make it clear what number youre talking about. To see what I mean, imagine that this 5 is in the hundreds place to represent five-hundred, but if you make the number places invisible, then it just looks like five and not five-hundred. So to make sure people know you mean FIVE-HUNDRED, you need a 5 in the hundreds place, a 0 in the tens place, and a 0 in the ones place. Now you can tell that the 5 is in the hundreds place and it means five-hundred. Okay now a great way to see place value in action with some actual numbers is to expand them to show that theyre really combinations of different groups. When we do this, its called writing a number in Expanded Form. For example, we can expand 324 to be 300, 20 and 4, because the 3 is in the hundreds place and means three-hundred, the 2 is in the tens place and means twenty, and the 4 is in the ones place so it "
,,"just means four. So 324 in expanded form is the combination of those amounts: three-hundred plus twenty plus four. Lets try writing another number in expanded form:  6,715 We can expand this into six-thousand, (because the 6 is in the thousands place) plus seven-hundred, (because the 7 is in the hundreds place) plus ten, (because the 1 is in the tens place) and five, (because the 5 is in the ones place) So the expanded form is six-thousand plus seven-hundred plus ten plus five. Alright so do you see how our base 10 number system works? Number places are used to count different sized groups. Each group is ten times bigger than the next, and "
,,"the digits in the number places tell us how many of each group we have. The tricky part is that the number places are invisible, so you have to know how they work behind the scenes in order to make sense of multi-digit numbers. How do you like them apples? The exercises for this section will help you practice so that you get used to how place value works, which is super important if you want to be successful in math. As always, thanks for watching Math Antics and Ill see ya next time. That gives me an idea...! ...I could make pies out of these!! Learn more at www.mathantics.com"

J so here we are at the order of operations part 1 video I'm going to tell you a little bit about order of operations in this video and how to solve them as you can see there are 4 problems on your screen that we will solve together then we will try some more difficult problems in part 2 after part 2 you can try some on your own over at the mastery check so take a look at the 4 problems on your screen you'll see addition subtraction multiplication division and even parentheses order of operations problems can have exponents as well so we have a lot of different things mixed within one problem so we need a set of rules or instructions to go through these problems correctly we have an acronym that helps us with these steps and it's at the top of your screen PEMDAS parentheses exponents multiply divide add and subtract and there's also a graphic on the left side of your screen that will help us with these steps so parentheses is up top that's number one priority whenever you see it in a problem that comes first and then we work our way down that chart exponents the second priority level three is multiply and divide and then we have add and subtract so let's hop into number one we have 9 plus 11 minus 4 in parentheses so how do you go about doing these problems is we take a look at our chart over here and we have parentheses up top that means it's number one priority if you see parenthesis in a math problem that's what you do first so let's do 11 minus 4 first for number one 11 minus 4 is 7 and now we need to bring down everything we did not use so we did not use the plus the addition and did not use the nine now we only have one operation left so that's what we have to do so let's end with 9 plus 7 which is 16 and that is the answer to number one number two we have a 3 right next to a parenthesis and then 7 minus 2 within those parentheses so anytime you have a number right next to the parentheses that means multiply so I'm going to rewrite the problem with the multiplication sign in there so again anytime you see a number right next to parenthesis it is multiplication all right so let's go through our steps step one parentheses do we have any in this problem yes so that's what we need to do first 7 minus 2 is 5 and then let's bring down everything we didn't use the multiply and the 3 so we end with 3 times 5 which is 15 so there you have it there's number one and number two so let's hop over to 3 
,,and 4 these get a little more complex and have more steps to them than numbers 1 and 2 now it's important with 3 & 4 and the more complex type of problems to do one 
,,step at a time and make sure you're going through your process so number three let's go through our steps any parenthesis yes so that's what we need to do first 17 minus 6 is 11 let's bring down everything we did not use so now we have multiplication and addition so let's go through our steps any parenthesis now no any exponents now any multiplication or division yes so that's what we need to do next so 3 times 5 is 15 drop whatever we haven't used yet so we have 15 plus 11 which will get us to 26 so number four we have 12 minus 10 divided by 2 plus 16 minus 9 in parentheses so parentheses we need to do first 16 minus 9 is 7 now we need to bring down everything that was not used so now we have subtraction division and addition so any parentheses no any exponents no any multiplication or division yes so that's what comes next 10 divided by 2 is 5 bring down everything we did not use everything still needs to stay stay in the same order when you're rewriting the problem after you're going through your steps so the 12 minus 5 plus 7 has to stay like that so we have subtraction and addition left so any parenthesis no exponents no multiplication or division no addition or subtraction yes now addition and subtraction are both down here on level 4 subtraction and addition both hold the same value you can think of it as so one is not more important than the other so if you get to a point where you have addition and subtraction you go left to right addition is not more 
,,important or comes before subtraction again they're both level 4 down so you just go left to right when you run into both in the same problem so you would do 12 minus 5 first 12 minus 5 is 7 bring down your addition and the 7 so we get 2 7 plus 7 which is 14 so there you have it there's a little intro to order of operations and 
,,the steps slash process on which we go through these types of problems so I will see you over part two where we will try some more challenging problems and we will go from there so I hope this helped thanks so much for watching and until next time peace you

Operations of While number,0NvLtTwnUHs,"Hi and welcome to Math Antics. In todays lesson, were gonna learn all about factoring. Factoring is a math operation.  Its something you DO to a number. Now with "
,,"the other math operations youve done so far, youre given two or more numbers to work with. But with factoring, you only get one number. Thats because factoring is like being given the answer to a multiplication problem and then having to figure out what that problem was. So you can think of factoring as UN-multiplying. When you multiply, you take two numbers and multiply them together to get one number. And when you factor, you take one number, and figure out what two numbers you could multiply together to get that number. For example, lets say youre asked to factor the number 10. Now that means that you need to figure out what numbers you could multiply together to get 10. If you know your multiplication table, youll remember that 2 times 5 equals 10. That means that 2 and 5 are FACTORS of 10. So factors "
,,"are just the parts of a multiplication problem, and factoring is figuring out what those parts are. Im sure some of you are wondering, Why would I ever want to factor a number? Now thats a good question, and I have a good answer. Factoring can make solving some math problems easier. For example, factoring is really useful for simplifying fractions. By breaking a number up into its factors, you can sometimes cancel out factors that arent really needed. For now though, you just need to learn what factoring is and how to do it. So lets see another example.  Lets factor the number 24. For this one, I think Ill use my multiplication table. Lets see here  alright, well 4 times 6 is 24.  So that means that 4 and 6 are factors of 24. Now hold on  Im sure some of you have seen that 3 times 8 is also 24. And thats true.  We could have decided to factor 24 into 3 times 8 instead. So which of the factors is right?  Is is 4 and 6  or 3 and 8? Actually, theyre both right.  There can be more than one way to factor a number. Thats one of the things that might make factoring a little confusing at first. Youre used to having just one right answer, because when you add, subtract, multiply or divide, there is just one right answer. But when you factor (or un-multiply) a number, you might find that theres more than one correct way you can do it. So we can see that the number 24 has quite a few factors. 4 is a factor, 6 is a factor, 3 is a factor and 8 is a factor. "
,,"The fact that each of these numbers is a factor of 24 means that each of them can divide evenly into 24. And when I say divide evenly, I mean that it will divide in without a remainder. For example, if we take our first factor (4) and divide it into 24 using a calculator, our answer will be 6. 4 divides into 24 six times with "
,,"no remainder. But what if we try to divide 24 by a number that ISNT one of our factors; like the number 7? If we try 24 divided by 7 on a calculator, we get 3.42857 blah, blah, blah  a long decimal number. That didnt divide in evenly because theres a big remainder! What we just did is called testing for divisibility. Testing for divisibility is a way to find out if a number is a factor of another number. With the test we just did, we confirmed that 4 is a factor of 24 but 7 is not. Sometimes you may be asked to find ALL the factors of a number. If that happens, you can use testing for divisibility to solve the problem. To see how it works, lets try to find ALL the factor or 24. We already know four of them, but theres a lot more numbers we can test. Fortunately, we only need to test numbers that are less "
,,"than half of the number were testing. And since half of 24 is 12, we just need to test the numbers 1 thru 12. To keep things organized, lets list the numbers we are gonna test and we'll circle the factors that we already know: 3, 4, 6, and 8. We can also cross out the 7 since we already tested it and found out it wasnt a factor. Okay, now for the numbers we havent tested yet.  Lets start with 1. Well of course 1 is a factor, because 1 will divide evenly into ANY whole number. So 1 is always a factor. And since 1 is a factor, then that means 24 is also a factor because 1  24 = 24. It might seem weird that a number is always a factor of itself, but its true. Knowing that helps you get started listing the factors, because you can ALWAYS include 1 and the number itself. Now lets move on and test 2. If we divide 24 by 2, we get 12. So yes, 2 is a factor because it divided evenly. You can factor 24 into 2  12. That means that we can ALSO circle 12 as a factor of 24. So, any time you do a divisibility test, and the number you are checking passes the test, then the answer you get from dividing will also pass the test it will ALSO be a "
,,"factor! That will speed things up because we know we dont have to test 12. Okay, lets move on to the next number we havent checked: 5 24 divided by 5 equals 4.8 Well that didnt divide evenly because our answer is a decimal number. That means that 5 is NOT a factor of 24. Next well try 9.  24 divided by 9 equals 2.66666 Thats definitely not a factor. Okay how about 10? 24 divided by 10 equals 2.4 Nope, thats a decimal number, so 10 is not a factor. It looks like the last one we have to try is 11. 24 divided by 11 equals 2.181818  Thats not a factor either. Alright, since weve tested all the numbers that are less than half of 24, weve found "
,,"ALL of its possible factors, and they are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. Now I know that might seem like a lot of work, but fortunately you probably wont have to do many of those problems. The important thing is just to know what factoring is, and how you can use testing for divisibility to help you find factors. Alright, that wraps up this lesson. But since actually doing math is the best way to learn it, be sure to try the exercise problems for this section. Thanks for watching and Ill see you next time. Learn more at www.mathantics.com"

Operations of While number,CdTUq5TTDEo,hello children today i'm here to teach you chapter 3 in your textbook that's operations on whole numbers in this lesson we are only considering whole numbers write down the four mathematical operations you know what are the basic four operations that you know addition subtraction multiplication and division so those are the four basic mathematical operations that you know now take a look at this one so same whole number with four different mathematical symbols operations 8 plus 4 we are adding 8 minus 4 means subtracting you get 4 8 times 4 multiplied by 4 you get 32 and here 8 divided by 4 you get 2. appearing above is how the four mathematical operations of addition subtraction multiplication and division are used only once look at this one you get three whole numbers so we'll add these two first three plus two 
,,you get five then add seven to that five plus seven twelve now we'll take the last two first and then edit 2 plus 7 what you get 9 3 plus 9 you get the same answer so no difference in the answer is experience even either 3 and 2 are first added or 2 and 7 added first so in addition order is not important simplify each expression appearing below and get the answer so here two plus eight ten ten plus seven seventy now we'll do the other way round eight plus seven first 15 and 15 plus 2 17. you get the same answer 5 plus 7 first that's 12. 12 plus 3 you get 15. now we'll take 7 plus 3 first that's 10 5 plus 10 that's 15. you get the same one we'll do first one 8 plus 2 you get 10 here 10 plus 7 you get 17. now the last two first 2 plus 7 you get 9. 8 plus 9 you get 70. so order is not important in addition 6 plus 4 10 10 plus 5 you get 15. now do the next one other way around 4 plus 5 first that's 9 6 plus 9 you get 15. first two numbers first 9 plus 3 12 12 plus 4 16. last two 
,,first 3 plus 4 7 9 plus 7 you get the same 16. 12 plus 4 16 plus 3 you get 90. 4 plus 3 7 7 plus 12 you get 90. here also we see order is not important in addition eleven plus nine you get twenty twenty plus eight twenty eight last two first eight plus nine seventeen seventeen plus eleven you get twenty eight fifteen plus four you get ninety nineteen plus three 20 2 4 plus 3 7 7 plus 15 you get the same answer 22 6 plus 6 12 12 plus six you get eighteen here six plus six twelve six plus twelve again eighty seven plus zero 7 7 plus 3 you get 10 here when you add the last 2 0 plus 3 3 7 plus 3 again you get 10 same answer write the answer of the expressions with only the addition at once so we found out you can either add from the left side or any two first and then add the other number so we'll add from left to right 6 plus 3 9 9 plus 8 17 2 plus 9 eleven plus five sixteen six plus four ten ten plus three thirty seven plus seven fourteen fourteen plus seven 21 8 plus 2 10 10 plus 4 14 3 plus 7 10 10 plus 2 12 7 plus 4 11 11 plus 3 14 9 plus 9 18 18 plus 9 20 7 six plus eight fourteen fourteen plus eight what's fourteen plus eight twenty two four plus four eight eight plus zero that's it now we'll look at this one this is multiplication first we'll multiply the first two three times two you get six then six with four you get twenty four now we'll do the last two numbers multiplication two times four eight three times eight you get the same answer as addition so when there is only the multiplication both above method give the same answer so order of operation is not important in multiplication as well get the answer by multiplying each of the following expressions two times three six six times four you get 24. now we'll do last two first three into four twelve two times twelve you get the same answer five times two ten ten times three thirty then last two three times two six five times six you get the same answer this one seven times two fourteen fourteen times two you get 28 2 times 2 4 7 times 4 you get 28 as well look at this one 8 times 3 24 24 times 4 what you get 4 times 4 16 1 remaining 4 times 2 8 plus 
,,1 9 here 3 times 4 12. eight times twelve eight times two sixteen one remaining eight times one eight plus one nine so you get the same answer ninety six this one first two numbers six times two twelve twelve times two you get twenty four now last two first two times two four here six times four twenty-four seven times three twenty-one twenty-one times three you get sixty three three times three nine times 9 you get 63 as well so here what we can see for multiplication is also odd is not important eleven times three thirty-three thirty-three times two you get sixty six three times two six here eleven eleven times six also you get sixty-six six times five thirty thirty times three you get ninety and here five times three fifteen six times fifty multiply separately 6 times 5 30 3 remaining 6 times 1 6 plus 3 9. so 90 find the answer of the expressions with only multiplication now odd is not important so we'll start from left 2 times 2 4 4 times 3 12 7 times 2 14 14 times 2 20 8. 5 times 3 15 15 times 2 you get 30. 8 times 1 8 8 times three twenty-four eleven times two twenty-two twenty-two times three you get sixty six eight times one eight eight times two sixteen nine times two eighteen eighteen times three three times eight twenty-four two remaining three times one three plus two five four times four sixteen sixteen times one that's sixteen eleven times one eleven eleven times two 22 2 x 1 2 2 x 11 22 the answers of expression with either addition or multiplication do not change however they are simplified so order is not important now the combination of addition and multiplication look at this one 3 plus two when you add 
,,it you get five then five times five you get 25 here if you do last two first two times five ten and three plus ten thirteen now what happens answers are not the same so what's the mistake there shall not be two answers when the same expression is simplified the above expression consists of the mathematical operations plus and multiplication so what's the correct way of doing when you get addition and multiplication at once here plus has been used first and multiplication did however multiplication should be done first according to the stand so remember that even though when you start from left you get plus sign you can't do plus first you have to first do multiplication and then do addition so what's the correct way of doing so this is actually wrong and here this one is correct because first multiplication and then consider addition so here what's the multiplication here 3 times 2 6 and then add 5 to that you get 11. so that's the correct way of adding and multiplying at once simplify the following expressions use only additional subtraction now now some questions addition sum with subtraction so what you do so we can add these two 10 
,,plus 2 you get 12 12 plus 5 70. what can you do here you can do subtraction and see 7 minus 4 you get 3 3 plus 5 so here three three plus five you get eight six plus four ten ten minus three you get seven eight plus 7 15 15 minus 5 you get 10 9 plus 11 that's 20 20 minus 3 17. seven minus three four four plus nine thirteen this 
,,one eight minus six you get two two plus two four six minus five one one plus nine ten three plus seven ten ten minus eight you get two 6 minus 5 1 1 plus 9 10. parts only with division and multiplication should be simplified from left to right as the first step and then the paths only with addition subtraction should be simplified from left to right so it's easy to follow from left to right so when you get an expression with combination of operations you first check what's the first symbol if it is multiplication or division you have to do that first compared to addition and subtraction simplify the following expressions used only multiplication and division now we start from left 24 divided by 4 6 six times three eighteen twenty-four times two forty-eight forty-eight divided by three three times one three for eighteen that's 6. now left to right first multiplication 9 times 2 18. 18 divided by 6 that's 3. 10 times 550 50 divided by 25 how many 25s are there for 50 you get 2. now the division first 9 divided by three that's three three times eight twenty-four twenty-two divided by eleven you get two two times seven fourteen 24 times 2 48 48 divided by 16 that's 3 next one 33 multiplied by 2 66 divide by 11 you get 6 there starting from left 15 divided by 5 that's 3. 3 times 3 9 16 divided by 4 you 
,,get 4 4 times 2 8. simplify from left to right even when mathematical operation subtraction or division is applied twice so always start from left what we can do 12 
,,minus 5 that's 7. so 1 minus 3 4. starting from left 18 minus 7 you get 11 11 minus 6 5. look at this one starting from left 48 divided by 6 you get eight eight divide by two that's four eighty divided by ten is eight eight divided by four you get two simplify the following expressions now we'll do starting from left seven minus three four four plus four you get eight eight minus two six 6 plus 6 12 9 plus 5 14 14 minus 2 you get 12 11 plus three fourteen fourteen minus seven answer is seven eleven minus three four four minus three you get 1 15 minus 3 that's 12 12 minus 2 that's 10. 12 plus 8 20. 20 minus fifteen answer is five twenty three minus twenty that's three three plus seven answer is ten simplify the following expressions so start from left 40 divided by 10 that's 4. 4 times 2 you get 8. 80 divided by 8 
,,that's ten ten times three you get thirty fifty times two hundred hundred divided by twenty five how many twenty fives four hundred you get 4 40 times 2 80. 80 divided by 16. you get 5. 5 times 6 30 3 remaining 5 times 1 5 plus 3 you get 80. this one 9 times 2 18. 18 divided by 6 get 3 24 divided by 3 you get 8 8 times 4 32 21 divided by 3 you get 7 7 divided by 7 answer is 1. 32 divided by 2 16 16 divide by 8 you get 2. so when you get any operation start from left this one 15 times 2 30. 
,,30 divided by 10 you get 3 21 times 2 42 42 divided by 7 you get 6 here simplify the following expressions start from left 15 divided by 5 and also remember multiplication of division comes you have to do that one first compared to addition or subtraction so division comes first 15 divided by 5 that's 3 3 minus 3 0 division first 20 divided by 2 10 10 minus 8 you get 2 division first here also 32 divided by 8 is 4 4 minus 3 answer is 1. 24 divided by 12 is 2 2 minus 2 answers 0. now this one don't do 50 minus 8 that's you have to multiply first 8 times 2 16 now subtraction 50 minus 16 so you get 4 here 10 so 2 remaining so 2 there so 3 is the answer 34 which one we need to do first division first 16 divided by 2 8 20 minus 8 you get 12. now division first not the subtraction 10 divided by 10 is 1 40 minus 1 that's 39 this one first division 24 divided by 8 is 3 3 minus 2 that's 1. which one first the division so 8 divided by 2 4 then you do the addition from left to right 5 plus 4 9 9 plus 3 12 this one the division first 15 divided by 5 is 3 then 30 plus 3 33 33 plus 3 36 write correct mark for true expressions and wrong mark for false 
,,expressions now subtraction addition there's no order 8 minus four four four plus three seven that's correct this one division first nine divided by three three three plus one you are getting 4 not 10. this one multiplication first 16 times 8 8 times 6 48 4 remaining 8 times 1 8 plus 4 12 128 minus 10 that's the answer 118 but the answer is given 38 that's wrong division first here fifteen divided by five that's three three plus four seven this is wrong which one first you have to do division first 8 divided by 16 when you write like this you get 8 times 1 8 times 2 half 24 plus half or 24.5 this one you can write in decimal 0.5 so you are not getting 
,,2 that's wrong this one you can start from left to right 6 times 9 54. 54 divided by 3 you get 1 there 3 times 1 3 for 24 that's 8 so this is correct 32 divided by eight you do this one first four four divide by four you get one that's also correct this one that's addition and subtraction you can start from left 23 minus 5 you get 18. 18 plus 7. 25 but 11 is given that's wrong you have to do division first 4 divided by 2 that's 2 then 20 plus 2 22 that's correct 4 times 2 8 8 plus 8 16. here you can start from left 6 plus 6 12 12 minus 4 8 that's also correct multiplication first 9 times 9 81 81 minus 40. you get 41 that's correct 20 divided by 4 you get 5. 5 divided by 20 you are getting one over four not four so that's wrong nine divided by three is three three divide by three that's one this answer is wrong 25 
,,times 2 50 50 minus 40 that's 10. that one is correct simplify the following expressions multiplication first 20 times 240 40 plus 7 47 division first here 14 divided by 2 is 7 7 times 3 21. here multiplication 300 plus 7 three hundred and seven we'll do multiplication first eight times fifty four hundred four hundred divided by hundred answer is 4 division first 900 divided by 100 you get 9 9 plus 5 14. this one division first 24 divided by 24 is 1 1 plus 9 you get 10. starting from left 8 divided by 8 is 1 1 divided by 1 the answer is 1 this is addition subtraction you can start from left 7 plus 0 7 7 minus 5 you get 2. this one division first 23 plus 2 divided by 2 is 1. so you get 24 there's one division first 35 divided by seven that's five five minus five that's zero multiplication first 4 times 2 that's 8 32 plus 8 answer is 40. addition subtraction odd is not important 12 plus 3 15 15 minus 7 answer is 8. simplify which one we need to do first multiplication three there two times eight sixteen now now you can edit three plus sixteen eighteen three plus sixteen that's nineteen nineteen plus five 20 4 this one you have to do division first 25 divided by 5 you get 5. 5 plus 3 minus 2. so 5 plus 3 8 8 minus 2 6. this one starting from left multiplication first 8 times 4 32 32 plus 3 and minus 30. 32 plus 3 35 35 minus 30 you get 5. this one addition and subtraction there's no order 7 minus 2 5 5 plus 10 minus 3 15 minus 3 you get 12. this one starting from 
,,left multiplication you can do 8 times 2 16. now division 16 divided by 4 that's 4 4 minus 1 you get 3 starting from left 56 divided by 7 that's 8 8 now divide by 8 
,,what's 8 divided by 8 1 now addition 1 plus 5 answer is 6 starting from left we can do multiplication 9 times 7 63 then we can do division so what's the division here 63 divided by 21 that's 3. so 3 plus 5 you get eight starting from left again 24 divided by eight that's three three plus seven minus one so what's three plus seven ten ten minus one is nine we'll do this one first 81 divided by nine that's nine now we'll look at divisions 9 divided by 3 you get 3 3 plus 5 answer is 8. now we'll see when you get brackets how you do the operations look at this one 2 plus 7 add 2 and 7 that's 9. now if you want to subtract 9 from 12 so what's the answer 12 
,,minus 9 you get 3. so this can be written as can write 2 plus 7 add it and subtract from 12. so 12 minus this so here we have written like that 12 minus 2 plus 7. when you get brackets what you do 2 plus 7 that's 9 12 minus 9. so what's the answer you get 3. now do these questions so what you have to do when you get brackets simplify inside the brackets first so 30 divided by 7 plus 3 you get 10. now do the division 30 divide by 10 you get 3. this one 20 plus 4 what's 20 plus 4 24 24 divided by 6 what's the answer you get 4. now this bracket first 28 plus 2 30 12 plus 3 you get 15. now you can divide 30 divided by 15 you get 2 here also two brackets you have to simplify separately these two brackets nine plus seven sixteen eight into one multiply by one you get eight now 16 divided by 8 you get 2. this one brackets first 4 plus 3 7 21 divided by 7 you get 3 here in this one this bracket first 12 minus 5 you get 7 7 divided by 7 that's 1. now look at this one brackets first so you take this one first five plus two seven now you can write the question again nine times three minus seven then what you do you have to do the multiplication first starting from left you get multiplication so 9 times 3 27 27 minus 7 you get 20. look at this one brackets first three times five fifteen so you write two plus fifteen plus three addition here you can do from left to right 2 plus 15 17 17 plus 3 20. this one brackets first 12 plus 2 14. 5 times 14 divided by 10 so you can start from left multiplication comes so you have to do that 5 times 4 20 2 remaining 5 times 1 5 plus 2 7 so 70 divided by 10 you get 7 this one 3 times 4 that's 12. 20 minus 12 plus 7. now start from left 20 minus 12 that's 8. 8 plus 7 you get 15. look at this one brackets first 12 divided by 6 you get 2. now what's the next step 
,,multiplication three times two six eight plus six minus five eight plus six fourteen fourteen minus five you get 9 this one brackets first so what you do 10 plus 7 multiplied by 4 minus 2 you get 2 and this is multiplication 3 plus 4. what's the next one you need to start from left and c multiplication is there 10 plus 7 times 2 14 into 3 plus 4 again from left you get this multiplication 10 plus 3 times 4 12 1 remaining 3 times 1 3 plus 1 4 plus 4 what you get 10 plus 42 you get 52 52 plus 4 56 this one first brackets 7 minus 2 plus 5 times 6 30 30 plus 4. now you can do starting from left or any order so i'll start from left 7 minus 2 5 5 30 35 35 plus 4 3 9 this one brackets first 8 times 2 60. this brackets these two brackets next 24 divided by 3 8 30 divided by 15 you get 2. now you can do addition and subtraction 16 plus 8 24 24 minus 2 you get 20 2 this one these three brackets first 12 divided by 3 that's 4. 24 divided by 3 8 30 divided by 15 that's 2 addition and subtraction so 8 plus 4 12 12 minus 2 you get 10 this one brackets first these two we can do 12 minus 3 9 3 minus 1 2 now starting from left 9 times 2 18 18 divide by 9 you get 2. this question we can do brackets first three hundred minus twelve times eight sixteen one remaining eight times one eight plus one ninety six twelve times five you get hundred now what we do we can do this subtraction 300 minus 96 what's that when you subtract you get 200 so 204 minus 100 you get 104. so the answer is 104. this one this bracket first 24 plus 3 27 now division first 27 divided by 9 you get 3 3 plus 5 that's 8. now worded problem there are six boxes of eggs with 12 eggs in each equally distribute them all among eight housewives how much eggs would one housewife get so how many eggs in six boxes twelve times six and then number of eggs one would get so how many housewives are there eight so this is equally divided so you can divide this by eight so we'll do first one six times two 12 1 remaining 6 times 1 6 plus 1 7 now 72 you have to do divide equally by 8 housewives so 72 divided by 8. you get 9 so how many eggs one would get 9 eggs this question 18 out of 90 oranges bought by a merchant was rotten when the remaining good ones are distributed among 12 persons how much oranges would one person get total how many oranges brought 90 oranges all together how many rotten oranges are there 18 are rotten balance of good oranges so you have to subtract 19 minus 80. what's the value 2 here 10 1 is there so 2 plus 7 that's 90. so 72 then what we have to do we have to divide this equally with 12 persons so number of oranges one would get you take the total good ones divide by 12 persons so 72 divided by 12 you get 6. so 6 oranges one would get so we can write the same question at once how can we write we can write 20 minus 18 inside brackets and then divide this by 12. look at this question 400 rupees for the first 15 words and 20 rupees for each excessive word is charged for publishing a newspaper advertisement find how much would be charged for a newspaper advertisement containing 23 words so excessive number of words after the first 50 all together how many words are there 23 first 15 that's a different charge so we have to subtract 15 to get the excessive number of words so what's the value 23 minus 15 you get 8 here so 8 23 minus 15 is 8. price for extra 8 words so what's the charge 20 rupees for each excessive word so 8 times 20. that's 100 60 rupees first charge first 15 words the charge is 400 so what's the total so you have to add 400 plus 160 what's the total you get 560 rupees for an advertisement with 23 words look at this one 12 rupees for the first minute and 8 rupees for every next minute is charged for international direct dialing calls taken to a foreign country find out the total cost of a call of 12 minutes taken to that country so what's the extra number of minutes spent so all together 12 minutes extra is first minute that's 12. so 12 minutes minus 1 so 11 more minutes so this is minutes 11 minutes are there then what's the total amount payable first minute is 12 then 8 rupees for next minute is charge every one minute you need eight rupees so all together this is eight times eleven eighty eight plus twelve so what's the total amount payable 100 rupees for this call 8 plus 210 1 remaining 9 plus 1 so for 12 minute call the person has to pay 100 rupees write the simplifying order of whole number expressions so what is the first thing you have to do simplify inside brackets after that you look at left to right left to right then multiplication or division whatever comes first from left to right division from left to write then you can do addition and subtraction then you can do addition or subtraction whatever comes first from left to right look at this question the age of 38 boys in a grade 7 class is 12 years each two of the other two boys is 13 years old write a number expression for the total number of ages of all the 40 students and find out the total age of them so we try to write down an expression at once 38 boys in grade seven class is 12 years each so 38 into 12 and two boys with 13 years old so two boys with 30. so you have to do separately and at so 38 times 12 38 times 12 10 and 2 so you multiply by 1 and multiply by 2 you get 456 now do this multiplication 2 times 13 you get 26 now add 26 to that 400 years old the total is 482. look at this one a cyclist spends 
,,five minutes per each kilometer to cycle the first five kilometers while they spend eight minutes per each kilometer of the second five kilometers then ten minutes per each of the next five kilometers and 12 minutes per each of the final five kilometers calculate the time he would spend to cycle 17 kilometers so we'll try to write an expression at once total time spent five minutes per each kilometer to cycle the first five so first five five minutes then why we spend eight minutes per each kilometer of the second five kilometers so eight times the next five kilometers then the third one ten minutes per each of the next five ten into five now all together 50 kilometers now the last 5 kilometers that's 12 minutes but how many kilometers are there this is 5 and 5 10 10 plus 5 15 but all together 2 so you have to multiply 2 into 12 that's the last one now we can add it separately first you have to multiply 5 times 5 25 8 times 5 40. 10 times five fifty two times twelve twenty four now add all together and get five plus 4 9 4 plus 2 6 6 plus 5 11 11 plus 2 13 139 minutes so how we find out number of hours and minutes what you do you have to 
,,divide by 60 because 60 minutes per hour so you get 120 so how many minutes are there 19 minutes so 2 hours and 19 19 minutes so i can write separately 2 hours and 19 minutes now we look at example 1 in your textbook write down the operations of the expression 12 into 2 minus 5 into 3 in the order in which they appear so from left to right so first you have to do multiplication another multiplication because before subtracting numbers we have to do either division or multiplication first so another multiplication and then only you can do subtraction exercise 3.1 for each of the following numerical expressions write down the mathematical operations in the order in which they appear so this is addition you can start from left so this is adding and adding this one multiplication first and then subtraction here first 
,,division then you have to do multiplication and then subtraction fourth one starting from left you have to do multiplication then from left that's addition and subtraction this one starting from left first do division and then this division next and then finally addition exercise 3.2 simplify each of the following expressions addition so 12 plus 5. 17 17 plus 8 20 5 multiplication so you can do first two 5 times 8 40. 40 times 3 you get 120 7 plus 3 10 2 plus 6 8 10 plus 8 eighteen two times five ten four times three twelve ten times twelve you get hundred twenty odd is not important in additions only and multiplication only example number one simplify so 7 minus 4 plus 5 subtraction and addition you can start from left 7 minus 4 you get 3 3 plus 5 8. this one 80 divided by 10 into five so starting from left 80 divided by 10 that's 8 then you do multiplication 8 times 5 40. this one you can start from left to right 4 times 6 24 then you do the division 24 divided by 3 answer 
,,is 8 here 25 plus 10 minus 7 starting from left you can add first 25 plus 10 that's 35 minus 7 you get 20 8. example number 5 28 divided by 2 minus 3 division first 
,,from left to right 28 divided by 2 you get 14. 14 minus 3 that's 11. here 50 minus 10 into 3 which one we have to do first multiplication 10 times 3 30. now we can subtract 50 minus 30 that's 20. 18 into 5 minus 62 18 times 5 so here 8 times 5 you get 40 4 remaining 5 times 1 5 5 plus 4 90. so 90 minus 62. you get 8 here and 2 so 20 8 this one 50 minus 10 divide by 2. now you have to do division first 10 divided by 2 you get 5 50 minus 5 answer is 45 example number 9 5 plus 6 divided by 3 plus 2 left to right first division so 5 plus 6 divided by 3 that's 2. now you can add 5 plus 2 7 7 plus 2 9 this one simplify 2 times 12 divided by 3 multiplied by 5 first these two you get 24. now what's next from left to right 24 divided by 3 that's 8 8 times 5 answer is 40. exercise 3.3 place a tick mark next to the correct statement and wrong sign next to incorrect statement so this is subtraction addition you can do in any order 8 minus 5 3 3 plus 2 you get 5 so this is not 1 so this is wrong 12 times 3 multiplication first you get 36 36 minus 11 that's 25 that's correct this one which one we do first 18 divided by 6 that's 3 7 plus 3 you get 10. 
,,from left multiplication 30 then 30 divided by 3 you get 10 10 plus 7 17 this is wrong simplify the following expressions so what's the order when you get multiplication or division from left to right you have to do that first before addition and subtraction so 10 times 4 first 40 40 plus 17 you get 57. times 3 24 24 plus 5 29 this one division first 14 divided by 7 is 2 then multiplication 2 times 5 10 division first 12 divided by 3 is 4. 448 plus 4 you get 452 this one multiplication first seven times two hundred thousand four hundred now add hundred and eight to that you get eight zero five and one thousand five hundred and eight eight times nine seventy two seventy two minus sixty one you get 11. this multiplication first 100 minus 8 times 7 56 now subtract you get 4 here 6 plus 4 10 so 44 from left to right multiplication first 195 minus 12 times 10 120. now division 120 divided by 5 you get 5 times 2 10 for 20 that's 4. so 5 times 2 10 2 remaining so that's 24 now do the subtraction 195 minus 24 what's the subtraction 7 and 1. so you get 171 as the answer this one starting from left to right multiplication 7 plus what's 37 times 5 
,,5 times 7 35 3 remaining 5 times 3 15 plus 3 80. now you can do the addition 185 plus 7 192 now add 278 to that you get 8 plus 2 10 17 1 remaining so 470 example number one now you get brackets so what we do brackets first 12 minus 7 you get 5. so you can rewrite the question 20 divided by 5 now 20 divided by 5 is 4. here from left first brackets 10 plus 12 22. now rewrite the question 5 times 22 divide by 11 now left to right whatever comes first multiplication or division so you can multiply first 5 times 2 10 1 remaining 10 plus 1 11. so 110 divided by 11. so you get 10. example number three brackets first 10 plus 2 12. now rewrite the question 8 plus 5 times this is division 3 minus 4. now from left to right multiplication 8 plus 12 times 5 60. next from left to right division 8 plus 60 divided by 3 you get 20. now you can do addition and subtraction 8 plus 20 28 28 minus 4 you get 24. example number four the pencils in five boxes each of which contains 12 pencils are divided equally among four students write down an expression for the number of pencils a single student receives and simplify it so number of then six how do we find out what's the total five boxes each twelve pencils so all together five times twelve are equally divided among four students so i'll write other way around divide by 
,,four now left to right first multiplication twelve times five sixty sixty divide by four four times one four and for 20 that's five so each person get 15 pencils example number 5 nimal plucked 47 mangoes from a tree in his garden he kept 18 in his position and sold the rest to his neighbor at nine rupees per fruit write down an 
,,expression for the total amount of money nima learned in rupees by selling the mangoes and simplify it so total amount is this is in rupees he plucked 47 mangoes from a tree in his garden he kept 80. so what's the remaining part 47 minus 80. that one each mango for 9 rupees so multiply by 9 so that's the total amount here so what we do first brackets what's the subtraction you get 9 and 2 so 29 47 minus 18 is 29 now multiply by 9 9 times 9 81 8 remaining 9 times 2 18 18 plus 8 2 26 so 261 rupees example six the taxi fare for the first kilometer is 50 rupees it is 42 rupees for each kilometer above the first write down an expression for the amount paid 
,,by a passenger who enjoyed a ride of 12 kilometers and simplify your answer so you need to find out the amount paid first kilometer 50 rupees so 50 plus so how many 
,,kilometers extra all together 12. so you need to subtract 1 that value multiplied by 42 because after the first kilometer you have to pay 40 rupees each per kilometer so how you do this so this is in rupees first brackets so 50 12 minus 1 is 11 times 42. now multiplication second 50 plus multiply this by 11 42 times 11 10 and 1 
,,you get here 264 462. now add 50 to that you get 2 and 5 plus 6 11 1 remaining and this is 5 512 rupees exercise 3.4 simplify the following expressions so first you 
,,have to do brackets 12 plus 8 20. now subtraction 12 20 minus 15 that's 5 brackets first 35 minus add these two get 23. so subtract you get 2 here and 1. so the answer is 12. here brackets first 5. here there's no multiplication sign because there's a bracket brackets means multiply so 7 times 5 you get 35. here 27 minus 13 first so you get fourteen three times that and add hundred and eight so first multiplication three times four twelve one remaining three times one three plus one four now add hundred and eight and forty two five what hundred and fifty this one brackets first 17 minus 5 you get 12. 24 divided by 12 you get 2. this one first brackets 
,,five plus two seven now three times seven into eight you can do multiplication here three times seven twenty-one twenty-one times 8 168. 16 divided by 4 you get 4. so 31 plus 4 you get 35. 8 times 9 72 73 minus 72 you get 1. 19 times 10 190 plus 38 you get 228 again at 8 12 and 1 remaining 228 this one 30 divided by 6 you get 5 
,,475 minus 5 you get 470 an international call to a certain country cost seven rupees for the first minute and four rupees per minute thereafter write down an expression in rupees for the cost of a 10 minutes long international call simplify your expression so you need to find out the total cost cost for the call first minute that's seven rupees plus so how many extra minutes are there this is 10 minute so you have to subtract one for those number of means you need to pay four rupees each so what you do first 10 minus 9 first 10 minus 1 first that's 9 7 plus 9 into 4 then multiplication you get 9 times 4 36 36 plus 7 43 rupees for the 10 minutes call write down an expression for the number of 2 litre bottles that can be filled with a fruit drink made from eight liters of water and four liters of fruit juice so number of bottles what's the mixture eight liters of water and four liters of fruit juice that's the total number of liters but dividing into two liter bottles you have 
,,to divide this by 2 now here first do addition 12 12 divided by 2 you can get 6 bottles with 2 liters simplify the following expressions when you get an expression first start from left brackets first then multiplication or division and finally addition of subtraction so starting from here 30 divided by 10 you get 3 then 3 times 5 15 starting from left 40 times 10 400 divide by five you get 80. this one multiplication first 400 minus 200 that's 200 brackets first 10 times 3 30. 30 divided by 30 you get 1 brackets first 40 divided by 10 that's 4. now multiply 8 times 4 32 multiplication first 7 times 5 35 35 plus 3 38 division first 6 divided by 2 you get 3 three plus seven that's ten here brackets first 24 times three seventy two now divide by eight you get 9 brackets 4 times 3 12 24 divided by 12 you get 2 here now this one first brackets you get 9. now rewrite the question again then starting from left you can do multiplication 6 times 9 54. now rewrite again do division 3 
,,plus 54 divide by 3 1 and for 24 that's 8. now you can do addition and subtraction from left to right 18 plus 3 21 21 minus 7 you get 14. this one brackets first 10 
,,plus 8 this is multiplication 11 minus 3 you get 8 multiplied by 4 minus 4 from left to right then you have to do this multiplication 10 plus 8 times 8 64 times 4 minus 4 again multiplication 10 plus 4 times 4 16 1 remaining 4 times 6 24 plus 1 25 now you can do addition and subtraction 256 plus 10 266 266 minus 4 you get 262. so all these expressions first brackets then multiplication or division and finally addition or subtraction so we covered all theory in this lesson so you need to remember first perform any calculations inside brackets then perform all multiplication or division working from left to right finally perform all additions and subtractions working from left to right so practice all exercise and examples and thorough with the basic operations in whole numbers

Operations of While number,mqPqfR6UgqM,we know that four and five are whole numbers what is four plus five it's nine nine is also a whole number even the numbers 22 and 33 are whole numbers what is 22 plus 33 you're correct it's 55 and 55 is also a whole number are you getting a gist of what I'm trying to say also if I add two whole numbers 350 and 620 the answer to 
,,"that is again a whole number similarly 28,000 plus 50 9,000 also result in a whole number whenever we add any two whole numbers the resultant number that we get is also a whole number and this is the first property of a whole number however instead of this we say that whole numbers are closed under addition this is just a mathematical way of saying it this statement is actually the same as this if I add any two whole numbers the number that I get will also be a whole number now here is a question for you to answer our whole numbers closed under subtraction pause the video and give it a thought first of all let's understand what the question means what "
,,do we mean by closed under subtraction it means that if we take any two whole numbers and subtract them then we will always get whole number will this way always happen let's try to find this out by subtracting any two random whole numbers 35 minus 20 is equal to 15 we subtracted two whole numbers and we got whole number again similarly one thousand minus 999 will give us one a whole number again what about five minus eight what will we get when we subtract eight from five wait a moment can we even subtract eight from five no we can't do that even if we try to subtract them here's what we get a negative number we are not talking about negative numbers 
,,"now you will learn that in the future lessons but we know that this is certainly not a whole number hence we will term this subtraction as invalid similarly if you subtract 100 from 50 the answer that you will get is a negative number both numbers are not whole numbers so we can say whole numbers are not closed under subtraction what about multiplication our whole numbers closed under multiplication yes they are closed under multiplication when you multiply any two whole numbers you will always get a whole number here are a few examples to support this argument 5 times 5 is 25 a whole number 1 times 1,000 is 1,000 a whole number again let's involve the whole numbers 0 0 times 10 is what when you multiply any number with 0 we get 0 again so it's 0 we take any two whole numbers and multiply them the answer that we get will always be a whole number here's a quick recap of what we studied so far in this video we learned that whole numbers are closed under addition not closed under and closed under multiplication these three are arithmetic operations that we commonly use is there another one which is the fourth most common operation that you "
,,know of its division I'm sure that you must have already guessed the next question that I'm going to ask you our whole numbers closed under division four and two are whole numbers and if we divide 4 by 2 we get a whole number again but if we divide 6 by 5 the answer we will get will be in decimals which is not a whole number similarly examples such as 3 divided by 12 4/9 will not result in whole numbers hence we say that whole numbers are not closed under division what is 0 divided by 4 it's 0 and what is 4 divided by 0 is it also 0 or perhaps some other number in order to understand this we first need to be sure that we know the meaning of division we have studied arithmetic operations and the fact is that among all the arithmetic operations students find division to be the most difficult one what is division when we divide a number 8 but therefore what actually are we doing imagine the scenario there are 8 chocolates and 4 people and we want to distribute these 8 chocolates to 4 people such that everyone gets equal number of chocolates how many chocolates will a single person get each person will get 2 chocolates how did we get this to yes we divided 8 by 4 and that gave us 2 or in other words we divided the number of chocolates available equally among all the people now let's say instead of 4 there are two people now how will we divide ate chocolates between two people how many chocolates will each person get you're absolutely correct each one will get 4 chocolates let's act a bit crazy now let us divide eight chocolates equally among zero people that is 8 divided by zero does it even makes sense to divide eight chocolates amongst no one no it doesn't hence we say this is undefined or in other words any whole number divided by zero is undefined on the same lines these are all undefined quantities we will see another property of whole numbers in the next video

Operations of While number,HAhg0uXn9GA,"welcome to math with mr. J in this video I'm going to be doing a review of how to add subtract multiply and divide whole numbers so a quick refresher on those four things now if you're looking for more examples or a more in-depth explanation of these things I drop the link down to my whole number videos down in the description if you're ready for this review let's jump right into number one here where we have addition now for addition and subtraction one of the most important things is getting your problem lined up properly and we need to line up our places so the ones place the tens place hundreds so on and so forth so for this one we have five thousand eighty two plus nine hundred fifty-seven so again I have my ones place my tens place my hundreds and thousands place here everything's lined up now I'm ready to add so 2 plus 7 is 9 8 plus 5 is 13 1 plus 9 is 10 and 1 plus 5 is 6 so the answer would be 6,000 39 number two subtraction same thing as addition we need to make sure our places are lined up then we can subtract so 813 minus 298 now this is a borrowing subtraction problem because we cannot do 3 minus 8 that would get us into the negatives which we're we are not going to deal with for this problem so we need to borrow so we borrow from the 1 and it's now a zero this 3 is now a 13 so 13 minus 8 is 5 I cannot do 0-9 so I need to borrow from the 8 the 8 is now a 7 and that 0 is a 10 10 minus 9 is 1 now 7 minus 2 will wrap the problem up and give us 5 so our difference or solution to that subtraction problem is 515 on to multiplication so we have 452 times 72 so again let's line our places up and for multiplication we "
,,need to take our 2 to the 2 5 & 4 and then the 7 to the 2 5 & 4 so 2 times 2 is 4 2 times 5 is 10 2 times 4 is 8 plus that one is 9 I'm done with this - and I'm done with that regrouped 1 I'm moving on to the tens place now so that 7 has a value of 70 so I need a 0 here for my second partial product because again that 7 has a value of 70 so now I need to do 7 times 2 is 14 7 times 5 is 35 Plus that one is 36 7 times 4 is 28 plus that 3 is 31 now I'm ready to add my these are called partial 
,,products here partial products I can add them up to get my product or answer so 4 plus 0 is 4 0 plus 4 is 4 9 plus 6 is 15 regroup my 1 1 plus 1 is 2 and then bring 
,,"down my 3 here so my answer or product to a multiple product which is an answer to a multiplication problem 32,500 forty-four and lastly we have division so 918 918 "
,,divided by 34 so the first thing I need to do 9 divided by 34 which I cannot do and get a whole number so I need to move to my 91 here and do 91/30 4 so how many whole groups of 34 can I pull out of 91 well only two that gives me 268 that is as close as I can get so I need a 2 above the 91 do not put it above the 9 because that 
,,is going to mess up the alignment with how our places and where the numbers need to be and it's going to give us an incorrect answer and kind of throw us off so it needs to go above the 91 now we do 2 times 34 is 68 we subtract and we get 23 bring down our 8 now we have 238 divided by 34 now you might not know off the top of your head how many whole 34s can I pull out it 238 so it might take some estimating and checking so for example I know 34 times 10 is 340 well 238 is pretty well below 
,,that so maybe we start with trying 34 times 6 and seeing how close we get well that gives us 204 which hmm let's see if we can get any closer let's try 7 just in case we can get any closer 34 times 7 actually hits 238 exactly so we put a 7 up here because 238 divided by 34 is 7 now we multiply 7 times 34 is 238 subtract and we did a remainder of zero so our quotient or answer to a division problem is 27 so there you have it there's the whole number review now I went kind of fast through those because this is meant to be a review or a refresher just in case you needed a little help or reminder with any of those and like I said at the beginning if you need a more in-depth or slower explanation more examples of any of those I put the links to my whole number videos in the description hopefully that helped thanks so much for watching until next time peace

Operations of While number,k6G-MBQQ_co,today let us learn rounding numbers in many instances exact numbers are not necessary or even desirable at such times approximations are given this is when rounding 
,,a number helps us let us look at an example to understand it in a better way 19600 18 students from Delhi attended a football coaching camp while 17300 students from Mumbai attended the camp now here we can round these figures to the nearest thousand and see twenty thousand students from Delhi attended the camp while seventeen thousand students from Mumbai attended the camp we round up numbers to get the estimated length expenses distance etc and even to find the estimated sum difference product and quotient first let me teach you rounding numbers to the nearest thousand look at the given number to round this number to the nearest thousand we need to follow two simple steps step one look at the digit to the right of the thousands place if this digit is five or more than five then add one to the digit in the thousands place here the digit is 7 which we know is greater than five therefore eight changes to nine step to change all the digits to the right of the thousands place to zero so the rounded up number is four lakh thirty-nine thousand now let us look at another example round 35 lack 30 1461 to the nearest thousand first look at the digit to the right of the thousands place which is four here now as for is smaller than five we leave the digit in the thousands place as it is therefore one remains 
,,as one itself next change all the digits to the right of the thousands place to zero yes we got the answer 35 lakh thirty one thousand now let us see rounding a number to any given place we can round a number to any given place that is tens hundredths ten thousands and so on by following the same steps as mentioned for the thousands place let us take 14 lakh fifty four thousand six hundred fifty-eight and then round this number to different given places let us start with the tenth place here the digit to the right of five is eight which is greater than five so we add one to five change all the digits to the right of the tens place to zero so the rounded up number is 14 lakh fifty four thousand six hundred sixty next is the hundredths place here the digit to the right of six is five as the rule is that if the digit is 5 or more than 5 we have to add 1 to the digit in the place being rounded up hence we add 1 to 6 change all the digits to the right of the hundredths place to 0 
,,"so the rounded up number is 14 lakh 50 4,700 when the number is rounded to the nearest thousand we get 14 lakh 55,000 when the number is rounded to the nearest 10,000 we get 14 lakh 50,000 when the number is rounded to the nearest lakh we get 15 lakh and finally when it is rounded to the nearest 10 lakh we get 10 lakh so kids remember these two points and it would be easy for you to get the estimated values if the digit to the right of the given place is 5 or more than 5 then add 1 to the digit in the given place and if the digit is less than five leave the digit in the given place as it is"

Operations of While number,S29LVPMKw48,today let us learn about the place value of a number each digit in a number has its own value depending upon its position in the place value chart let us understand 
,,this by following few examples what is the place value of each of the nine in the number shown in both the systems of numbering let us start with the Indian system here the place value of the nine on the right is nine into 100 is equal to nine hundred the place value of the nine in the middle is nine into ten lakh is equal to ninety lakh lastly the place value of the nine on the left is 9 into 10 crore is equal to 90 crore now let us see the place values of nine in the International System 
,,we will start from the right nine into 100 is equal to 900 9 into 1 million is equal to 9 million and 9 into 100 million is equal to 900 million now let us look at another example what is the place value of five in the number shown in both the systems of numbering in the indian system the place value of 5 is 5 into 1 crore is equal to 5 crore and in the international system the place value of five is five into ten million is equal to fifty million wasn't it easy to find out the place values in both the systems

Operations of While number,HKjKhuVAVKs,today let us learn the special mathematical rule called the order of operations DM es let us understand what we mean by order of operations when we have two or more 
,,operations in a problem we carry out these operations in a certain order the order is to move from left to right and carry out division or multiplication whichever comes first and then again move from left to right and carry out addition or subtraction whichever comes first we remember the rule as d mas where D stands for divide M for multiply a for add and s for subtract now by using the DMAs rule let us solve an example simplify 6 plus 54 divided by 2 minus 4 into 5 as per the rule we begin with division or multiplication whichever comes first in order from left to right so here we divide first so 54 divided by 2 is equal to 27 now we have 6 plus 27 
,,"minus 4 into 5 next we multiply the numbers multiply 4 into 5 which is equal to 20 so we get 6 plus 27 minus 20 now we add or subtract whichever comes first in order from left to right so the next step is to add that is 6 plus 27 which is equal to 33 so we are left with 33 minus 20 finally we would be subtracting the numbers that is 33 minus 20 which is equal to 13 here we found the answer as 13 let us solve one more example 70 into 30 minus 10 plus 150 divided by 3 multiply 70 by 30 to get 2,100 now divide 150 by 3 which is equal to 50 now subtract 10 from 2100 which is equal to 2,000 90 lastly add 2,000 90 and 50 which is equal to 2,100 40 wasn't it "

Operations of While number,zIwF6xQ3L_c,rounding decimals good morning children today let's learn a new topic called rounding decimals firstly let's learn how to round decimals to the nearest whole number 
,,look at the given number step 1 look at their digit in the tens place if it is less than 5 write the whole number as it is if it is 5 or more than 5 add one to the whole number here the digit in the tens place is 1 which we know is less than 5 so we write the whole number 14 as it is step 2 change all the digits after the decimal point to zero so the rounded up number is 14 point 0 now let's solve one more example look at the digit in the tens place which is five here as the rule is that if the digit is five or more than five we have to add one to the whole number hence we add one to ninety two and change all the digits after the decimal point to zero 
,,thus we get the answer as 93.0 now let's see rounding decimals to the nearest tenth look at the given number step 1 look at the digit to the right of the tens place 
,,if it is less than five write the digit in the tens place as it is if it is 5 or more than 5 add one to the digit in the tens place here we have 4 to the right of the tens place which is less than 5 so we keep the digit in the tens place seven as it is step two change all the digits to the right of the tens place to zero so the 
,,rounded-up number is 21 point seven zero now let's solve one more example round 94.1 7 to the nearest tenth here we have 7 to the right of the tens place as 7 is greater than 5 we add 1 to the digit one in the tens place and change all the digits to the right of the tens place to 0 thus we get the answer as 90 4.20 kids wasn't it easy rounding decimals

Operations of While number,41eVMYPCWTQ,today let us learn prime and composite numbers before we begin let us understand what do we mean by natural numbers the set of numbers 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and so on are 
,,called natural numbers natural numbers can be divided into prime numbers and composite numbers before we proceed ahead remember that any given number will always have one and itself as its factors now let us start with prime numbers look at the examples the factors of 3 are 1 and 3 the factors of 11 are 1 and 11 the factors of 17 are 1 and 17 all these numbers have only two factors one and the number itself such numbers are called prime numbers thus prime numbers are natural numbers that have only two factors one and the number itself composite numbers look at the examples the factors of 6 are 1 2 3 & 6 the factors of 14 are 1 2 7 and 14 the factors of 20 are 1 2 5 10 and 20 all the above numbers have more than two factors these numbers are called composite numbers thus composite numbers are natural numbers that have more than two factors remember these points one is neither prime nor composite as it has only one factor two is the smallest and the only even prime number three is the smallest odd prime number now why don't you list all the prime and composite numbers from 1 to 100

Operations of While number,Ts5nn5EQKF4,hello kids we have already learned that there are two types of number systems one the hindu-arabic system of numeration and to the international number system today 
,,let us learn more about them let us begin with the hindu-arabic system of numeration look at this table it shows the periods the places and the digits the six and seven digit numbers are placed in the ones period the thousands period and the lacs period the eight and nine digit numbers are placed in the ones period the thousands period relax period and the crores period according to the Indian place value system the ones period consists of the places ones tens and hundreds the thousands period comprises of two places thousands and ten thousands the lakhs period comprises of two places lakhs and ten lakhs and the crores period also has two places crores and ten crores the greatest seven digit number is 99 lakh 99999 and when one is added to it we obtain the smallest eight digit number we write it as 1 comma 0 0 comma 0 0 comma 0 0 0 and we read it as 1 crore similarly the greatest 8 digit number is 9 crore 99 lakh 99999 and when one is added to it we obtain the smallest nine digit number we write it as 1 0 comma 0 0 comma 0 0 comma 0 0 0 and we read it as 10 crore now let us learn to read and write the numbers using hindu-arabic system remember commas are inserted from the right after three digits first then after every two digits look at the given eight digit number 3 6 7 2 1 3 9 4 we write it as 3 
,,"comma 6 7 comma 2 1 comma 3 9 4 it is read as 3 crore 67 lakh 20 1394 let us try one more exam we write this number as one nine comma zero zero comma 6 3 comma 1 0 8 we read this number as 19 crore 63,000 108 did you notice here we did not read the zeroes but we did write them to show the place value now let us look at the International number system look at this table it shows the periods the places and the digits we know that seven digit numbers are placed in the ones the thousands and the millions periods these periods to comprise of places the ones period comprises of ones tens and hundreds the thousandth period comprises of thousands ten thousands and hundred thousands the millions period comprises of millions ten millions and hundred millions one added to the greatest seven digit number nine million nine hundred ninety nine thousand nine hundred ninety nine gives the smallest eight digit number we write it as one zero comma zero zero zero comma zero zero zero and we read it as 10 million similarly one added to the greatest 8 digit number 99 million 999,999 gives the smallest nine digit number we write it as one zero zero comma zero zero zero comma zero zero zero and we read it as 100 million now let us learn to read and write numbers using the International number system remember commas are inserted from the right after every three digits look at the example on the board we write it as 3 6 comma 7 2 1 comma 3 9 4 the number is read as 36 million 720 1394 "
,,"let us try one more example we write this number as 1 9 0 comma 0 6 3 comma 1 0 8 we read this number as 190 million 63,000 108 did you notice here we did not read the place value of the zeros but we did write them to show the place value it was easy to know more about the number system"

Operations of While number,3i2i9nmkG24,in our daily life we count various things for various purposes we count things using counting numbers the numbers 1 2 3 4 5 and so on are called counting numbers or 
,,natural numbers the numbers zero one two three four five and so on are called whole numbers zero has no value if placed before a natural number but it has a significant value and placed after a natural number although zero is the first whole number the first counting number is one but numbers like 1 upon to 1.8 and 2.2 are not whole numbers whole numbers on a number line on a number line numbers are represented as points and distances to represent whole numbers on a number line draw a straight horizontal ray label one end of the line as zero mark another point to the right of zero and label it as 1 the distance between 0 & 1 is the unit distance now mark points two three four and so on to the right side of 0.1 at unit distance this is how the number line will look like when we represent the whole numbers starting 
,,from the point zero negative numbers let us first understand what negative numbers are we know that zero means nothing but there are instances in real life when we use numbers that are less than zero for example in a few cold regions in the world the temperature goes below zero degrees Celsius that is negative 4 degrees Celsius 
,,or even below negative 40 degrees Celsius the numbers negative 4 and negative 40 are less than zero and are called negative numbers a negative number is any number that is less than zero for example negative eight is a number that is eight less than zero a negative number is represented with a negative sign any number without a 
,,negative sign is called a positive number which means a number that is greater than zero so while negative eight is negative eight seven is positive 7 or simply 7 integers the numbers one two three and so on the opposites negative one negative two negative three and so on and the number zero together form a different set of numbers let us understand the set of integers with the help of the following diagram in this combination each shape represents a particular number or set of numbers the 
,,circle represents zero this shape represents natural numbers the rectangle represents whole numbers the triangle represents negative numbers and this ship represents integers representation of integers on a number line integers can be represented on a number line that extends to the left to the right it is indicated by arrows and the positive integers are represented to the right of 0 and the negative integers are represented to the left of 0 positive 1 positive 2 positive 3 and so on are called positive integers the number value increases as they move away from zero negative one negative two negative three and so on are called negative integers the number value decreases as they move away from zero the integer zero is neutral it is neither positive nor negative positive integers do not need the positive sign before the number for example positive 2 can be written as just two negative integers need the negative sign before the number in the sign is not included that number is considered as positive two integers are opposites if they are each the same distance away from zero but on opposite sides of the number line one will have a positive sign the other a negative sign in the number line shown here positive three and negative three are opposite numbers now let us look at different situations where we mark our number either as positive or negative money earned or deposited is marked as positive whereas money owed or spent or withdrawn is marked as negative height above sea level is marked as positive whereas depth below sea level is marked as negative climbing up is marked as positive whereas coming down is marked as negative

Operations of While number,Paza3CbdamI,hello friends I am Miss Honey would you like to learn about the place value and face value of a digit in a number today yeah so let's begin first let me tell you what we mean by the place value of a digit place value is the value of the digit according to its position in the number such as ones tens hundreds et cetera let us understand this with the help of a number mmm let us take the number 346 we write the number 346 in the place value chart as number three in the hundreds : number four 
,,in the tens column and number six in the ones column now let us look at the place value of each digit as the number three is in the hundredths column it means that there are three hundredths and so its place value is three into 100 that is three hundred as the number four is in the tens column it means that there are four tens and so its place value is 4 into 10 that is 40 as the number six is in the ones column it means that there are six ones and so its place value is 6 into one that is six now let's try to solve one more example number 605 let us place each number in its respective column so number six goes in the hundreds column number zero in tens column and number five in the ones column the place value of number six is six into 100 that is 600 the place value of number zero is zero as there are zero tens the place value of number five is 5 into 1 that is 5 now let us learn what the face value of a digit is the face value of each digit in a number is seen as the digit itself let us look at the number 346 again to understand this as you know already number three is placed in the hundreds column number four in the tens column and number six in the ones column but the face value of a digit is the same as the digit itself irrespective of where it comes in the place value chart so the face value of digit three is three only the face value of digit four is four only and the face value of digit 6 is 6 now let us solve one more example look at the number 890 here the face value of digit 8 is 8 the face value of digit 9 is 9 the face value of digit 0 is 0 Wow wasn't it easy to understand the place value and face value of a digit

Operations of While number,EVnrsoyfRFU,today we will learn to identify the number of hundred ten and one that make up a three-digit number let's see you how we model two-digit numbers using place value blocks how many tens are in this number three how many wondering if number six let's show 36 is place value blocks how many pins should we use to model 36 3 10 1 2 3 how many one should we use the model 3 6 6 months 1 2 3 4 5 6 this is what 36 looks like with place value blocks think of another two-digit number what number did you think of 43 how are you so 43 with place value block I will have 4 tens and 3 1 1 2 3 4 10 1 2 3 1 that's right what is the number that is shown now 1 2 3 six seven one two three four five six seven eight seventy-eight I can line up ten ones in a row now I put one side next to my row can one hour ten one like one could they have the same value I can place ten times together and it will make a hundred flock ten ten equals one hundred hour ten ten is like 100 they have the same value that's 
,,right this shows that ten tens have the same value as one hundred let's count the hundred 100 200 300 400 how many hundreds are there for how many tens are there zero how many ones are there zero what number does this model show 400 what number does this model show how many hundreds of it - how many tens are there three how many ones are there six what number does this model show 236 that's it place value is so easy now you know hundreds tens and once

Operations of While number,Hwr4gEHepOo,you look at the farm of green chillies today let's learn how many tens with these green chillies we know that 1 1 means one chilly hence 10 ones mean 10 chilies so when we grew 10 chilies together we get 110 chilies look the farmer has made groups of ten chiles let's count by tens and learn some numbers and number names with the help of these groups 110 chilies means 10 chilies look now there are two groups of tends to tens chilies mean 20 chilies three tens mean 30 Chili's for tens mean 40 Chili's five tens mean 50 Chili's six tens mean sixty chilies seven dens mean seventy chilies eight tens mean eighty Chili's nine tens mean 90 Chili's denne denne mean hundred chilies hope you enjoyed learning the tens in the farm

Operations of While number,WF4aM0gmPas,okay patala today i'm going to start from your grade 7 health book the first lesson is let us build a healthy family and norma now we all know how to create a healthy family environment most of our lives are spent with our family members now we all know you have to spend uh that meaning school at least uh six hours but other time you have to spend when spend with your family members we learn of health habits and eating habits also from our family now just think about your classmates okay many people most of the students they are coming from various backgrounds okay so each and every student is differ from the other your eating habits also differ from your uh differ from the other that means those are related to your family likewise most of our leisure time also spent with the family members of members of the family so likewise most of the leisure time is also spent with the members of the family nowadays people they don't have leisure time actually people they are they don't 
,,have little time lack of pleasure time so anyway their most of our leisure time is also spent with the family members therefore family has a great impact on our health so our family has a great impact on our health physical health mental health so all those are coming from our family okay so family we our family contributes us to create a good physical and mental health in grade six you learnt about the concept of health and the importance of physical mental social and spiritual well-being 
,,for a healthy life so can you all remember we learn learnt about these things in your grade 6 book in this lesson you will learn about the promotion of family health and the features of a family environment the main thing okay and the main objective of this lesson is learn about the promotion of family hair and the features of a healthy family environment so all these things you can study from this lesson okay so health promotion here promotion is the process of enabling people to improve their health by gaining control over factors affecting health okay but what do you mean by hair promotion it is the process that means it is the way of enabling people to improve their health for what improve their health by gaining improving control over factors affecting health health promotion means which is which helps you to create a healthy environment so that's what we call a health promotion so promotion of family health most often all the members of family live together but sometimes either the father or mother may live separately due to their employment okay some students they have they have to face this because their fathers also they are they are doing their job in separate areas okay parents or some person parents are in abroad so they have to spend uh with their grandparents as well so say they have to live separately children may stay in hostels or in children's homes either for educational purposes or for other reasons okay some people they don't have parents so they have to stay in children's homes and while others students they have to stay in hostels who are the people who are staying in hostels especially those who are not close to their schools okay they have to choose the host because why for the educational purposes although staying at such places in temporary children will have to live according to the rules and regulation of such institution in such places children may not be able to make changes okay so they are in even though that is a hostel so the children they should have to remove those places okay they have to uh that mean uh it may not be able to make changes in in a family parents and children live together but not like that those who are living in the hostel they have to obey the role of the matrons and virgins and each and every people of that host they don't have leisure time that means they have to eat in a proper time but those who are living in a family with their parents they have many more freedom than the people who are living in hostels they have the freedom to take their own decisions and have more freedom to act on their own therefore there's a both the possibility as well as a responsibility to promote good health within the family so therefore there's a both possibility as well as the responsibility for what to promote good health within the family so you can make the changes to promote that mean uh you have health of the family you can create a healthy family environment a family environment must be a place where everyone can be happy a health a healthy physical mental social environment is vital for healthy family environment a healthy physical 
,,mental social environment is vital for a healthy family environment okay so if it is healthy family environment so we can see healthy physical people mentally and social environment so all these three things can be seen in a healthy family environment let us learn about the features that are necessary for the promotion of healthy physical maintenance social environment okay features of a healthy family environment so these are the features of healthy family environment physical environment 
,,okay okay under physical environment there are mainly 8 things we have to study the following features should exist in a good physical environment fresh air clean water healthy food sanitary facilities clean environment sufficient space tranquility being free of danger of accidents okay now we are going to explain what are those eight parts now fresh air so when building a house the compound and the doors and windows should be so design has to allow fresh air into the house drawing trays in the compound will provide fresh air and maintain temperature always we should make that mean grow trees around our home then only we can get fresh air into the home and especially we can maintain the temperature we can have the cold temperature if we have trees around our home burning of substances such as polleting plastic should be avoided as it produces grass gases harmful to health when we are made burning polluting and plastic so those air is not good for our respiratory system so we 
,,have to avoid get rid of those things so that therefore it is important that we have fresh air into our homes and the second one is clean water by drinking clean water infection diseases such as diarrhea can be avoided boiled and cold water should be used for drinking some toxic chemicals and germs can be removed by using filters always we have to use we should use boiled and cleaned or clean water because there are some infection diseases such as diarrhea cholera so those things can be um 
,,can be have from uh if when we are drinking dirty water so always we have to uh drink clean water we should drink clean and boiled water and the next one is healthy 
,,food food containing excessive amount of sugar salt oil should be avoided as far as possible what are the three things excessive amount of sugar salt and oil three three things we should we always we have to get this in a limited amount greens food and vegetables should be included in our daily meals usually always we should add greens fruits and vegetables especially cereals grains those things are compulsory things in our meal in the case of pregnant mothers and the children will with special requirements should be taken to prepare food rich in protein and minerals now we all know what which food contains protein and minerals you who are now growing 
,,through your adolescence should be particularly mindful to eat food containing more iron than protein always as a teenager you always should use iron which food contain which iron and protein nevertheless a balanced healthy diet is important for every family member and you all have always you should select a balanced health diet okay sanitary facilities the environment can be kept clean by having good drainage system proper sanitary facilities and good garbage disposal system cleaning the toilet daily using and antiseptic will help in preventing diseases always you have to use good sanitary facilities after uh you are going to the toilet unless you have to wash your hand with soap and not only that you have to maintain good drainage system and garbage disposal system then only you can make you can create the healthy and good physical environment clean environment and clean environment breeding sites of dengue mosquitoes can be minimized by cleaning the house and the compound 
,,at least once a week and destroying sites of water collection we can also prevent the propagation of rats and destroy places where reptiles could live in a tiny environment will minimize accident a pleasant environment will bring mental satisfaction usually if you maintain a clean environment so it avoid to breed insides of dengue mosquitoes if you have good clean environment and so we also can prevent of propagation of rats not only dengue mosquitoes rats also destroy places where reptiles not only them reptiles these are the dangerous animals around you a tiny environment will minimize accident a pleasant environment will bring mental satisfaction if you have a clean environment it gives you a mental satisfaction and the next factor is surface and space there should be a sufficient number of bedrooms and other necessary facilities adequate for the size of the panel this will help to get fresh air and create plus hunter environment always there should be a sufficient space in homes because that number of bedrooms all can't sleep that mean all can't stay in one bedroom each and every person they have to have separate bedrooms in one home in their home that's the thing so that's what we call surface and space and the other one is tranquility it is always good to maintain tranquil environment at home 
,,free of unnecessary noise when listening to the radio and watching television one can should maintain the volume of sound at suitable level being mindful not to disturb the neighbors that means but allah tranquility means it is always good to maintain tranquil environment that means free of unnecessary noise we are calling as tranquility environment so when you are when you are studying something or else when you are doing something so you don't like to go for another noise right you have to pay your attention on studies so on that time if your sister or any other that mean neighbor if they are listening to a delusion or else radio so it makes you very disturbed right you will make angry so being mindful not to disturb the neighbors so you have to make the environment being free of unnecessary noise that's what we are calling as tranquility last one is last factor is being free of the danger of the accidents most domestic accident results due to ignorance carelessness and mistakes usually we knew uh when you are suffering that means when you are facing an accident also because of why because of the ignorance carelessness and it can be made mistakes therefore such accidents can be prevented by acting with awareness and taking proper care following us are make samples of minimizing such accidents so these are the things for minimizing such accidents maintaining electric wires and plugs base just with proper covering specially if you have little sister or else little brother at your home always you have to cover the electric wires and plugs because it will make danger accident construction safety walls of fences around the dangerous places like wells keep in the home environment clean so we discussed each and everything in uh the lesson and there are eight factor factors if we want to make grief we want to create a good healthy physical environment so we have to consider about these eight factors okay now the second factor is mental environment now 
,,we discussed about physical environment how to create a physical environment and we are going to discuss about how to create a mental environment in your home creating a pleasant environment free of harassment and exploitation where one can recognize one's talents and face challenges successfully as important for health promotion the following factors are necessary for this there are three things we have to consider to make mental environment those three things are love protection and relaxation love loving strong bones should exist among the members of the family wherever you live even in hostel or children's home it is important to maintain strong bonds and love with the fellow members and guardians always you have to make if you want to good if we want to maintain a good relationship with your family members there should be love strong love bonds among your family members family bonds create an environment where every member of the family treats one another with love inquires about the needs of other members and trades problems of other members as their own just think like this if you are if you don't have that mean if you if you're an isolated person if you don't have parents or else if you don't have any siblings if you don't have any grandparents or else neighbors so you have to have you have 
,,to be an isolated person in the world so when you're suffering with any problem so you wanted to tell those things you want to share your emotions with another person so each and every that's what they you want to maintain allow with your family members then only you can share your problems you can solve the other problems in family so love is the strong bond in the family the next one is protection love protection and security are received by all members of a family living together so love protection and security are received by all members of a family living together so these things are combined together law protection and security three things are connected which is each other received by all members of a family living together now if you think children like this if you have a sister or brother at your home you are caring about herself you are caring about himself if your mother is not well so you have to care about herself and father also you have to care about himself grandparents also so you need the protection and then security of your parents or guardians during your childhood especially as a child you have to have the protection and the security of your parents or guardians during your childhood as a child relaxation when lecture is spent in a productive manner many things such as knowledge creativity enjoyment and physical fitness improves significantly reading building a small library at home watching or listening to selected television radio programs and discussing about them participating in games and engaging in activities with members of the family some productive activities which you can engage in during your lesson when there is love protection and relaxation what are the things love protection and relaxation one will not experience stress such an environment will not leave room for harassment and here what are the three things which are needed to create a mental environment love protection and relaxation now we discuss about love protection and relaxation so if there is a love and protection in the family surely you can do many things because why you have good mental condition with you so you can make anything and without free of harassment you free of harassment so you can do you can face the challenges as a family member that means you can create a good family environment with those things you will learn more about love and protection in the next chapter now we have to discuss social environment the different groups in our society can be collectively identified as social environment different groups of our society can be collectively identified as social environment some of these groups are family hostel school friends workplace and village society is collections of families what's the minimum unit of a society a family an environment 
,,where people mutually help each other exchange ideas and have recreational facilities is important for the promotion of good health mentioned below are a few features of good social environment now say are many groups in the society the these are the few groups in a society those are family hostel school friends and workplace and village so these are people mutual help each other okay exchange ideas in school also you can exchange your ideas in a family in which you with your friends work place village so you can have recreational facilities with others so that one also important for promotion of good health mentioned below are a few features of good social environment these are the few features of good social environment they are good interpersonal relationship if you have a good social environment there can be good interpersonal relationship with the society as a member we have to do duties and responsibilities to the society productive communication now these days we have

,,unity and respect okay spiritual environment a healthy spiritual environment will promote physical and mental health the following can be observed in the conduct of 
,,the people in such society a healthy spiritual environment will promote physical and mental health okay so these things we can do these things to maintain a good spiritual environment engaging in religious activities both at home and at religious institutions such as yoga exercises meditations these things we can do help in the 
,,need okay now if there is a needy person in the pavement also you can help the needy people you can help that needy people here needy man or woman even a child charming kindness to animals okay uh engaging in suitable meditation engaging in yoga exercises protecting nature so these things are really important to maintain a spiritual environment steps taken to promote family health so these are the steps which you can take to promote your family family health promotion can be done under five main teams estimation policies regarding health developing skills and knowledge on good health creating a healthy environment obtaining the support of the community making proper use of the health services provider these things are the steps we can which we can take to promote family health establishing policies regarding health we can make policies regarding health developing skills and knowledge on good health we can develop skills and knowledge on good health creating a healthy environment we can create a healthy environment obtaining the support of the committee community so we can get the support of the community making proper use of the health services provider now we are going to describe each and every fact establishing policies regarding here all the members of the family should discuss and agree upon establishing policies to promote the family health okay so now all the members of the family should discuss and agree upon establishing policies to promote the family 
,,health these things we have to ask a family member we have to do these things then only we can have a good time good environment okay these policies we should create as a family member use three concepts to make manage use 3r concept to manage waste 3r system reduce reuse recycle reduce mean the amount of waste we have to reduce the amount of waste we reuse recycle so categorizing and disposal of waste according to its nature okay now disposal things and permanent things so we have to categorize those things so garbage also we can categorize that mean polythenes pla and plastics in one bin and the disposal things that mean vegetables and other disposal things in the another bit so you can categorize them minimizing the use of polythene if we use more polythene if you if we addictively use polythene then only we should use and we should uh destroy them okay if you are return to polity use the polythene so we should burn them we should destroy them so those air is not good for 
,,our respiratory system so always we have to minimize the use of quality limiting the intake of sugar and salt this is really essential a 400 gram packet of salt for 
,,a family of four for 20 days that means five grams per person per day person how many gram five grams per person per day instead of carbonated bubbling drinks what are they nowadays you all know about these things uh coca-cola and many other there are many other carbonated drinks now so instead that we can use fresh fruit juice 
,,tea coffee or herbal drinks so instead of carbonated drinks we can use these things washing clothes every other day and iron clothes all together once or twice a week in order to save water and electricity okay washing clothes every other day and ironing clothes all together once or twice a week okay just think like this if there are five members at your home so if they used to iron their clothes one at a time so you have to spend more electricity for your iron also it should burn right it 
,,should heat right so don't do like that iron clothes all together at once or else twice a week in order to save water and electricity then only you can save water and electricity engaging it an outdoor game with all the members of the family but that engaging in and out doing with all the members of your family you can play with your grandmother grandfather even your parents siblings so these things will create a good mental and physical satisfaction okay and the other one is developing skills and knowledge on good health the knowledge gained at school and from books magazines papers etc so you can take the knowledge from your books magazines papers should be shared with the members of your family or living place or else if there are grandparents if you're at your home so you can get the knowledge from them you can know about the folk stories from them many more knowledge you can get from them by getting information from the public health inspector not only from that phi public health inspector that's the short form of this public health inspector phi and the public help me drive phm of your area and listening to health programs you can 
,,take the advice from them you can develop your knowledge and skills on health and you can develop your knowledge and skills on health you can get the knowledge from 
,,them okay creating a healthy environment recall what you have already learned about the features of a healthy form environment by organizing the home environment accordingly you can create healthy family environment so all these things will help you to how to create the good healthy family environment obtaining the support of the community community support is getting the support of various people in the society we have to maintain a good relationship with the society this support is essential to maintain good health of a family and the society participating in community programs sharing joy and grief with neighbors and helping neighbors when they are 
,,in distress are very important just think like this there are many people who are suffering with stress okay if you have a good relationship with those members so you can create the distress among those people you can so you can give some solution you can listen you can talk with them it's also important to make contact with religious places the school and the grammar illidari that mean village officer you can organize ramadan campaigns and public kavyana's programs on prevention of alcohol narcotic drugs and smoking these three things prevention of alcohol narcotic drugs and smoking these are really unnecessary that means bad things which we can see around us so you can maintain awareness programs on them and especially you can organize ramadan campaigns so all those things you can create by obtaining the support of the community making proper use of health services the community health services are useful in improving the health of the family the service of the public health midwife p h m these short form service compulsory really compulsory because in the term test also you have to mention about these people phm if they ask you to write the full form of phm then you should write public health midwife the public health inspector was the short form of this phi and the medical officer of health mmoh are useful in this regard there are tea tree people public health midwife public health inspector and the medical officer of health so other than these people hospital facilities are available to get treatment for various diseases so other than these people hospital facilities are available to get treatment for various diseases there are government hospitals around us to make the best use of the health services available to you follow the instructions given below okay if a member of a family has an infection disease if a member of a family has an infections disease inform the phi that means these days we have to face a pandemic this is called covet 19 so so we won't if a member of your family is suffering with that so surely you have to inform to period check then only we can protect the environment and the diarrhea not that mean cholera dengue and especially rabies so all those things infection disease you have to inform to bhi if a member of your family is pregnant inform 
,,the phm and get to assistance public health midwife okay so if the member of a of your family is pregnant you have to get the advice from phn remember to get vaccination on time and get information from phm vaccination tetanus and many other vaccination even the small kid also they should get the vaccination okay and only six months okay there are many more vaccination those vaccinations should get from phm provide a system to organize programs to solve health problems in the village prediction the ego prevention of smoking obtaining clean drinking water so all these things you have to provide assistance being screened for common learners and attending clinics regularly school medical inspection that means being screened for common illness these are the common illness and attending clinics regularly you have to go to clinic regularly school medical inspection you can't omit these things well woman clinics diabetes and high blood pressure clinics and the next one is obtaining 
,,correct health advice you have to get the correct health advice if there is a pandemic situation you have to get the correct health advice what should you do and what you do get rid of you have to get the correct health advice getting advice on nutrition reproductive health life skills etc now things you can do as a student to maintain healthy family environment fulfill your responsibilities towards the family as a student there are many responsibilities you can do towards your family share the day-to-day work of your household sweep the compound arrange your room help to prepare food all those things you can do as a student of you that mean as a child of your family you can do these things actively participating functions functions mean what are they activities maintain good relationship with parents always you have to have to maintain a good relationship with your parents siblings relations friends and closest okay close as it gives me closer sadie is me let me close people discuss problems with parents openly you can't hide anything to your parents follow correct food habits avoid skipping breakfast if you skip your breakfast sure you will have the strategies in future get into the habit of eating homemade food i forgot to tell this if you skip back first you will have gastritis right but if you're addicted to eat junk food that means homemade food without homemade food surely you will have any other diseases like the that mean diabetes cholesterol and many 
,,other diseases okay so because why we have to use we should eat homemade food unless we will get illness avoid smoking consumer liquor and narcotic drugs make family members aware of the ill effects of these so if you are addicted to smoking consuming liquor and narcotic drugs surely you have to face ill effects of these cancers high blood pressure somehow you will miss your life even guard yourself against attempt by others to get you involved in such acts and if it happens inform your parents and teachers if uh if someone is addicted for these things especially your sibling or any other friend you have to inform your parents or teachers protect your 
,,siblings from getting involved in these types of activities as the family member you can do these are your responsibilities spend your leisure time constructively engaging aesthetic activities singing dancing playing a musical instrument and drawing so then only you can spend your leisure time in a meaningful manner meaningful way engaging in literary activities such as writing and reading short stories poetry etc so these things engaging in literary activities so if you are engaging with this thing you can use your lesser time in a meaningful way engaging in gardening exercising or engaging in sports all those are really important convey health message to the family share the latest knowledge with the family now you can share the latest knowledge with the family dispel the wrong ideas minds maintained by the family members you can dispel wrong ideas and might there can be wrong ideas and might interrain by the family members you can dispel the wrong ideas okay now we learnt 
,,many things from this lesson so now we know promotion of uh formation of health is important to build a healthy society now we know we discuss many things so now we 
,,all know the smallest unit in the society is your family so collection of families forms a society i don't want to explain it further so promotion of family health is important to build a healthy society the features of a healthy family environment can be classified under physical social and mental environment so these are the features of healthy family environments so those those things can be classified under physical social and mental environments measures to promote family health can be discussed under five main themes you have to underline these things you can measures to promote family health so discussed under how many themes five teams of establishing policies regarding health developing knowledge and skills on good health creating a healthy environment obtaining the support of the community and making proper use of health services as a student you must contribute in various ways to build healthy families why just tell me now just tell me what's the purpose of this lesson so as a family member there are many responsibilities and duties we have to do which we have to do as a family member not only that we can get we can make some 
,,policies regarding our family health so all those things we can make as a good family member so from this lesson we learn how to create a good family environment especially physical environment how to create a mental environment good social environment and especially good spiritual environment so all those things we learned from this lesson now we all know how to create a good family environment and how to spend dualish your time in a meaningful manner now you can draw answer for these questions and see you soon from let us experience love and protection that means your second lesson of your health book thank you for watching

Operations of While number,CqrYYiffPr0,good morning students today let us study the rules of divisibility these rules will help us determine whether a number is divisible by another number without actually carrying out the division process let us have a look at different divisibility tests divisibility by two if the number is even that is it ends in two four six eight or zero we say that the given number is divisible by two for example 26 ends in 6 thus it is divisible by 2 divisibility by 3 if the sum of the digits of the number is divisible by three we say that the given number is divisible by three for example look at the number 384 when we add up all the digits that is three plus eight 
,,plus four we get the sum as fifteen we know that 15 is divisible by three thus we conclude that 384 is divisible by three divisibility by 4 if the number formed by the last two digits of the given number is divisible by four we see that the given number is divisible by four for example look at the number 164 its last two digits 
,,"form the number 64 which is divisible by 4 thus the whole number 164 is divisible by 4 divisibility by 5 if the number ends in 5 or 0 we say that the given number is divisible by 5 for example 525 ends in 5 thus it is divisible by 5 look at this another example 330 ends in 0 hence it is also divisible by 5 divisibility by 6 if the number is divisible by both 2 and 3 we see that the given number is divisible by 6 for example look at the number 408 is it divisible by 2 the number ends in 8 thus it is divisible by 2 is it divisible by 3 4 plus 0 plus 8 is equal to 12 which is divisible by 3 which makes the number 408 divisible by 3 as well hence 408 is divisible by 6 divisibility by 8 if the number formed by the last three digits of the given number is divisible by 8 we see that the given number is divisible by 8 for example look at the number 50 3888 its last three digits form the number 8 on eighty-eight which is divisible by 8 thus 53,000 888 is divisible by 8 divisibility by nine if the sum of the digits of the number is divisible by nine we see that the given number is divisible by nine for example look at the number seven lakh twenty "
,,nine thousand six hundred thirty-nine here on adding the digits seven two nine six three and nine we get the sum as 36 which is divisible by nine thus seven lakh twenty nine thousand six hundred thirty-nine is also divisible by nine finally let us look at divisibility by ten if the number ends in a zero we say that the given number is divisible by ten for example 8620 ends in zero thus it is divisible by ten kids now it is time for you to remember all these divisibility tests and find out the answer

Operations of While number,ftB5VU64yGA,let's understand what length is and how to measure it the word length is used to measure how long an object is for example length of the classroom floor length of the blackboard length of a pencil etc it is also used to measure distances for example distance from your home to school distance between two cities or countries measuring length we can use the hand span the foot span or the cubit to measure smaller lengths what do you mean by hand span hand span is a distance from the tip of the 
,,thumb to the tip of the little finger on an outstretched hand Lisa is measuring her max textbook with the help of hand span let's measure one two so the length of her math textbook is two hand spans now let's see what you mean by foot span foot span is the distance from the tip of the toe to the heel of the foot look Lisa is measuring the length of the classroom with her foot span let's measure one two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 and 20 so the length of the classroom is 20 foot spans now let's see how to measure with cubit cubit is the length from the elbow to the end of the fingers now Lisa is measuring the side 
,,of the table with her cubit 1 2 3 4 so the length of the side of the table is 4 cubed you two can measure the length with your body parts and have fun

Operations of While number,SQ4cB9yXkHM,All of us know what a number line is. And the numbers we see here on the number line are called integers. On the right side of zero we have positive integers and on 
,,"its left we have negative integers. Integers, we are familiar with. But what about numbers like these? 1 by 3, 5 by 6 or 'minus 7' by 12. Each of these are numbers, "
,,but we don't use them as often as we use counting numbers. Such numbers are called Rational numbers. But we need to define them well! We cannot say numbers like these are rational numbers. We say that they are of the form 'p' by 'q'. One number in the numerator and one in the denominator. But there are a few conditions we need to know. 'p' and 'q' should be integers. We can have only integers in place of 'p' and 'q'. And there is another important condition 'q' should not be equal to 'zero'. Why do we have the second condition? Say I asked you to calculate 3 divided by 0. What would be the quotient? '0' multiplied by what will give you 3? There is no such number. This value is undefined. So this is the basic definition of rational numbers. It is a number of the form 'p' by 'q' where 'p' and 'q' are integers. And 'q' is not equal to '0'? There are many questions that should pop up in your head when you see this definition. What is the difference between rational numbers and fractions? Are integers classified as rational numbers? What about '0'? How do we plot such numbers on a number line? And how do we compare two rational numbers? For example if you are asked to compare 1 and 5 you could easily say that 5 is greater of the two. But what if you are asked to compare numbers like 6 by 7 and 13 by 15? 
,,How would you find out which one is greater? Don't worry about it! All these questions will be answered in our videos on Rational numbers.

Operations of While number,r1HfqcyDP2s,look where are we yes it is a cake shop why not have some fun here and also learn how to solve division story problems look there are 64 Tuffy's for Tuffy's are to be packed in each box how many boxes do we need what is given here there are 64 tow fees for tow fees are to be packed in each box what is asked to find the number of boxes needed to pack 64 trophies so we have to divide 64 with 4 to find the total number of boxes needed to pack the 64 trophies let us start we start with comparing the digit in the tens place that is 6 with poor yes 6 is greater than fall and therefore we can divide 6 by 4 as we know 1 into 4 is equal to 4 so the nearest product is poor hence we write 1 above 6 and the number four in the tens column under 6 subtract 4 from 6 the remainder 2 is written in the tens column now bring down the next digit that is 4 and write it beside to what do we do next back to comparison 24 is greater than poor so we can divide 24 by 4 how many times can fall go into 
,,24 yes 6 so we write 6 above the 4 and the number 24 under 24 finally subtract 24 from 24 which gives us 0 the remainder right 0 in the ones column here we got the answer the quotient is our answer so 16 boxes are needed to pack 64 Toffees let us help the shopkeeper in packing them Hey look there are 96 cupcakes they are equally packed in 8 boxes so how many cupcakes are there in each box what is given here there are 96 cupcakes they are equally packed in 8 boxes what is asked to find the number of cupcakes in each box we have to divide 96 with 8 to find the number of cupcakes in each box let us quickly start with the division we start with comparing the digit in the tens place that is 9 with 8 yes 9 is greater than 8 and therefore we can divide 9 by 8 as 1 into 8 is equal to 8 we write 1 above the 9 and the number 8 in the tens column under 9 subtract 8 from 9 the remainder 1 is written in the tens column now bring down the next digit that is 6 and write it beside 1 now compare again 16 is greater than 8 so we can divide 16 by 8 as 2 into 8 is equal to 16 rewrite 2 above the 6 and the number 16 under 16 finally subtract 16 from 16 to get the remainder 0 right 0 in the ones column here we got the answer as 12 there are 12 cupcakes in each box it was a mouth-watering experience to learn at the cake shop

Operations of While number,Jd0Hzyc1SMk,today let us revise and understand more about Roman numerals we know that the ancient Romans used letters to write numbers even today the building date on monuments 
,,and public buildings is marked in Roman numerals and we also use Roman numerals in clocks and watches here are the letters used to write the numbers the symbol I is 
,,"equal to 1 V is equal to 5 X is equal to 10 n is equal to 50 C is equal to 100 D is equal to 500 and M is equal to 1000 we need to remember three rules while writing the Roman numerals one rule of repetition - rule of addition 3 rule of subtraction let us learn each rule one by one rule one rule of repetition one when a symbol is repeated twice or thrice its value is multiplied by two or three respectively for example M is equal to 1000 M M is equal to 1000 multiplied by 2 is equal to 2,000 m m M is equal to 1,000 multiplied by three is equal to 3000 to symbol I X C and M can be repeated three times at maximum for example we can write 1 as I - as I I and 3 as i i i in roman system but we cannot write 4 as i i i i 3 the symbols v l and d are never repeated that is symbols for 550 and 510 not be repeated this means "
,,that we do not write the number 10 by repeating v but as x now let us look at the second rule rule 2 rule of addition if a symbol of smaller value is written to the 
,,right of a symbol of higher value we add the smaller value to the greater value let us consider X I X has a value of 10 I has a value of 1 so the hindu-arabic number for this Roman number is 11 finally we have the third rule rule 3 rule of subtraction 1 if a symbol of smaller value is to the left of a symbol of higher value we subtract the smaller value from the higher value for example let us take the number X see X has the value of 10 and 3 has a value of 100 so X C will be 100 minus 10 is equal to 92 the symbols V L and D cannot be subtracted from any number for example 95 cannot be written as 100 minus 5 is equal to V CE 95 should be written as 90 
,,"plus 5 is equal to X C v 3i x and C are used to subtract there are just six combinations IV is equal to 5 minus 1 is equal to 4 I X is equal to 10 minus 1 is equal to 9 X L is equal to 50 minus 10 is equal to 40 X C is equal to 100 minus 10 is equal to 90 C D is equal to 500 minus 100 is equal to 400 C M is equal to 1,000 minus "
,,100 is equal to 900 now if larger Roman numerals are given how do we read and write them look at example 1 what is M cm x XX i equal to keeping in mind the rules explained earlier we first write this number in two thousands hundreds tens and ones as M plus cm plus X xx plus I in order to solve it further now let us write down the values of the respective numerals the value of M is equal to one thousand cm is 1000 minus 100 which is equal to 900 X X X is 10 plus 10 plus 10 which is equal to 
,,30 and lastly the value of I is equal to one on adding one thousand plus 900 plus 30 plus one we get the answer as 1931 now let us look at another example right 3817 in Roman numeral we first write the number 3817 in expanded notation as three thousand plus 800 plus ten plus seven now write the Roman numeral values of each that 
,,is 3000 as mmm 800 as d si si si 10 as X and 7 as V I I which is equal to M mm d si si si x/v aye aye Wow it was so much fun to learn Roman numerals

Operations of While number,tER-YslAY-8,hello friends I am Ola today I will teach you the relation between multiplication and division before we start let us revise the terms used in multiplication and division look at the example 5 into 4 is equal to 20 here the numbers which are multiplied are called the factors so in this example the numbers 5 & 4 are the factors the number obtained by multiplying the two factors is called the product and number 20 is the product here now look at the division example 20 divided by 4 is equal to 5 here the number to be divided is called the dividend here number 20 is the dividend the number that divides another number is called the divisor the divisor here is number 4 finally the answer we get on dividing the numbers is called the quotient which is number 5 here now when we are clear about the terms studying the relation between the two operations multiplication and division will become simpler multiplication and division are very closely related let see how there are five boxes 
,,and each box has three pencils in all how many pencils are there in five boxes to get the product we multiply the numbers 5 & 3 5 into 3 is equal to 15 now let us look at it in another way there are 15 pencils if each box can accommodate 3 pencils then how many boxes are needed for 15 pencils so here we need to divide 15 by 3 to find the quotient therefore 15 divided by 3 is equal to 5 given that there are 5 boxes and 15 pencils how many pencils are there in each box here we divide 15 by 5 
,,to find the quotient so 15 divided by 5 is equal to 3 from the same example used we got to know an interesting fact about multiplication and division which is division is the inverse of multiplication that is when we divide the product with one of its factors the quotient that we get is the other factor now let us take another example look there are five kids each kid has nine balloons how many balloons are there in all with the five kids so here we multiply the numbers five and nine to get the answer so five into nine is equal to 45 if we look at the same example in a different way there are 45 balloons if each kid has nine balloons then find the number of kids such that the balloons are distributed equally here we need to divide 45 by nine to find the quotient we get 45 divided by 9 is equal to five now if there are five kids and forty five balloons in all how many balloons does each kid get here we divide 45 by five to find the quotient 45 divided by five is equal to nine 
,,look here we got both multiplication and division facts from the same example woohoo Ola is great company to learn with

Operations of While number,CdTUq5TTDEo,hello children today i'm here to teach you chapter 3 in your textbook that's operations on whole numbers in this lesson we are only considering whole numbers write down the four mathematical operations you know what are the basic four operations that you know addition subtraction multiplication and division so those are the four basic mathematical operations that you know now take a look at this one so same whole number with four different mathematical symbols operations 8 plus 4 we are adding 8 minus 4 means subtracting you get 4 8 times 4 multiplied by 4 you get 32 and here 8 divided by 4 you get 2. appearing above is how the four mathematical operations of addition subtraction multiplication and division are used only once look at this one you get three whole numbers so we'll add these two first three plus two 
,,you get five then add seven to that five plus seven twelve now we'll take the last two first and then edit 2 plus 7 what you get 9 3 plus 9 you get the same answer so no difference in the answer is experience even either 3 and 2 are first added or 2 and 7 added first so in addition order is not important simplify each expression appearing below and get the answer so here two plus eight ten ten plus seven seventy now we'll do the other way round eight plus seven first 15 and 15 plus 2 17. you get the same answer 5 plus 7 first that's 12. 12 plus 3 you get 15. now we'll take 7 plus 3 first that's 10 5 plus 10 that's 15. you get the same one we'll do first one 8 plus 2 you get 10 here 10 plus 7 you get 17. now the last two first 2 plus 7 you get 9. 8 plus 9 you get 70. so order is not important in addition 6 plus 4 10 10 plus 5 you get 15. now do the next one other way around 4 plus 5 first that's 9 6 plus 9 you get 15. first two numbers first 9 plus 3 12 12 plus 4 16. last two 
,,first 3 plus 4 7 9 plus 7 you get the same 16. 12 plus 4 16 plus 3 you get 90. 4 plus 3 7 7 plus 12 you get 90. here also we see order is not important in addition eleven plus nine you get twenty twenty plus eight twenty eight last two first eight plus nine seventeen seventeen plus eleven you get twenty eight fifteen plus four you get ninety nineteen plus three 20 2 4 plus 3 7 7 plus 15 you get the same answer 22 6 plus 6 12 12 plus six you get eighteen here six plus six twelve six plus twelve again eighty seven plus zero 7 7 plus 3 you get 10 here when you add the last 2 0 plus 3 3 7 plus 3 again you get 10 same answer write the answer of the expressions with only the addition at once so we found out you can either add from the left side or any two first and then add the other number so we'll add from left to right 6 plus 3 9 9 plus 8 17 2 plus 9 eleven plus five sixteen six plus four ten ten plus three thirty seven plus seven fourteen fourteen plus seven 21 8 plus 2 10 10 plus 4 14 3 plus 7 10 10 plus 2 12 7 plus 4 11 11 plus 3 14 9 plus 9 18 18 plus 9 20 7 six plus eight fourteen fourteen plus eight what's fourteen plus eight twenty two four plus four eight eight plus zero that's it now we'll look at this one this is multiplication first we'll multiply the first two three times two you get six then six with four you get twenty four now we'll do the last two numbers multiplication two times four eight three times eight you get the same answer as addition so when there is only the multiplication both above method give the same answer so order of operation is not important in multiplication as well get the answer by multiplying each of the following expressions two times three six six times four you get 24. now we'll do last two first three into four twelve two times twelve you get the same answer five times two ten ten times three thirty then last two three times two six five times six you get the same answer this one seven times two fourteen fourteen times two you get 28 2 times 2 4 7 times 4 you get 28 as well look at this one 8 times 3 24 24 times 4 what you get 4 times 4 16 1 remaining 4 times 2 8 plus 
,,1 9 here 3 times 4 12. eight times twelve eight times two sixteen one remaining eight times one eight plus one nine so you get the same answer ninety six this one first two numbers six times two twelve twelve times two you get twenty four now last two first two times two four here six times four twenty-four seven times three twenty-one twenty-one times three you get sixty three three times three nine times 9 you get 63 as well so here what we can see for multiplication is also odd is not important eleven times three thirty-three thirty-three times two you get sixty six three times two six here eleven eleven times six also you get sixty-six six times five thirty thirty times three you get ninety and here five times three fifteen six times fifty multiply separately 6 times 5 30 3 remaining 6 times 1 6 plus 3 9. so 90 find the answer of the expressions with only multiplication now odd is not important so we'll start from left 2 times 2 4 4 times 3 12 7 times 2 14 14 times 2 20 8. 5 times 3 15 15 times 2 you get 30. 8 times 1 8 8 times three twenty-four eleven times two twenty-two twenty-two times three you get sixty six eight times one eight eight times two sixteen nine times two eighteen eighteen times three three times eight twenty-four two remaining three times one three plus two five four times four sixteen sixteen times one that's sixteen eleven times one eleven eleven times two 22 2 x 1 2 2 x 11 22 the answers of expression with either addition or multiplication do not change however they are simplified so order is not important now the combination of addition and multiplication look at this one 3 plus two when you add 
,,it you get five then five times five you get 25 here if you do last two first two times five ten and three plus ten thirteen now what happens answers are not the same so what's the mistake there shall not be two answers when the same expression is simplified the above expression consists of the mathematical operations plus and multiplication so what's the correct way of doing when you get addition and multiplication at once here plus has been used first and multiplication did however multiplication should be done first according to the stand so remember that even though when you start from left you get plus sign you can't do plus first you have to first do multiplication and then do addition so what's the correct way of doing so this is actually wrong and here this one is correct because first multiplication and then consider addition so here what's the multiplication here 3 times 2 6 and then add 5 to that you get 11. so that's the correct way of adding and multiplying at once simplify the following expressions use only additional subtraction now now some questions addition sum with subtraction so what you do so we can add these two 10 
,,plus 2 you get 12 12 plus 5 70. what can you do here you can do subtraction and see 7 minus 4 you get 3 3 plus 5 so here three three plus five you get eight six plus four ten ten minus three you get seven eight plus 7 15 15 minus 5 you get 10 9 plus 11 that's 20 20 minus 3 17. seven minus three four four plus nine thirteen this 
,,one eight minus six you get two two plus two four six minus five one one plus nine ten three plus seven ten ten minus eight you get two 6 minus 5 1 1 plus 9 10. parts only with division and multiplication should be simplified from left to right as the first step and then the paths only with addition subtraction should be simplified from left to right so it's easy to follow from left to right so when you get an expression with combination of operations you first check what's the first symbol if it is multiplication or division you have to do that first compared to addition and subtraction simplify the following expressions used only multiplication and division now we start from left 24 divided by 4 6 six times three eighteen twenty-four times two forty-eight forty-eight divided by three three times one three for eighteen that's 6. now left to right first multiplication 9 times 2 18. 18 divided by 6 that's 3. 10 times 550 50 divided by 25 how many 25s are there for 50 you get 2. now the division first 9 divided by three that's three three times eight twenty-four twenty-two divided by eleven you get two two times seven fourteen 24 times 2 48 48 divided by 16 that's 3 next one 33 multiplied by 2 66 divide by 11 you get 6 there starting from left 15 divided by 5 that's 3. 3 times 3 9 16 divided by 4 you 
,,get 4 4 times 2 8. simplify from left to right even when mathematical operation subtraction or division is applied twice so always start from left what we can do 12 
,,minus 5 that's 7. so 1 minus 3 4. starting from left 18 minus 7 you get 11 11 minus 6 5. look at this one starting from left 48 divided by 6 you get eight eight divide by two that's four eighty divided by ten is eight eight divided by four you get two simplify the following expressions now we'll do starting from left seven minus three four four plus four you get eight eight minus two six 6 plus 6 12 9 plus 5 14 14 minus 2 you get 12 11 plus three fourteen fourteen minus seven answer is seven eleven minus three four four minus three you get 1 15 minus 3 that's 12 12 minus 2 that's 10. 12 plus 8 20. 20 minus fifteen answer is five twenty three minus twenty that's three three plus seven answer is ten simplify the following expressions so start from left 40 divided by 10 that's 4. 4 times 2 you get 8. 80 divided by 8 
,,that's ten ten times three you get thirty fifty times two hundred hundred divided by twenty five how many twenty fives four hundred you get 4 40 times 2 80. 80 divided by 16. you get 5. 5 times 6 30 3 remaining 5 times 1 5 plus 3 you get 80. this one 9 times 2 18. 18 divided by 6 get 3 24 divided by 3 you get 8 8 times 4 32 21 divided by 3 you get 7 7 divided by 7 answer is 1. 32 divided by 2 16 16 divide by 8 you get 2. so when you get any operation start from left this one 15 times 2 30. 
,,30 divided by 10 you get 3 21 times 2 42 42 divided by 7 you get 6 here simplify the following expressions start from left 15 divided by 5 and also remember multiplication of division comes you have to do that one first compared to addition or subtraction so division comes first 15 divided by 5 that's 3 3 minus 3 0 division first 20 divided by 2 10 10 minus 8 you get 2 division first here also 32 divided by 8 is 4 4 minus 3 answer is 1. 24 divided by 12 is 2 2 minus 2 answers 0. now this one don't do 50 minus 8 that's you have to multiply first 8 times 2 16 now subtraction 50 minus 16 so you get 4 here 10 so 2 remaining so 2 there so 3 is the answer 34 which one we need to do first division first 16 divided by 2 8 20 minus 8 you get 12. now division first not the subtraction 10 divided by 10 is 1 40 minus 1 that's 39 this one first division 24 divided by 8 is 3 3 minus 2 that's 1. which one first the division so 8 divided by 2 4 then you do the addition from left to right 5 plus 4 9 9 plus 3 12 this one the division first 15 divided by 5 is 3 then 30 plus 3 33 33 plus 3 36 write correct mark for true expressions and wrong mark for false 
,,expressions now subtraction addition there's no order 8 minus four four four plus three seven that's correct this one division first nine divided by three three three plus one you are getting 4 not 10. this one multiplication first 16 times 8 8 times 6 48 4 remaining 8 times 1 8 plus 4 12 128 minus 10 that's the answer 118 but the answer is given 38 that's wrong division first here fifteen divided by five that's three three plus four seven this is wrong which one first you have to do division first 8 divided by 16 when you write like this you get 8 times 1 8 times 2 half 24 plus half or 24.5 this one you can write in decimal 0.5 so you are not getting 
,,2 that's wrong this one you can start from left to right 6 times 9 54. 54 divided by 3 you get 1 there 3 times 1 3 for 24 that's 8 so this is correct 32 divided by eight you do this one first four four divide by four you get one that's also correct this one that's addition and subtraction you can start from left 23 minus 5 you get 18. 18 plus 7. 25 but 11 is given that's wrong you have to do division first 4 divided by 2 that's 2 then 20 plus 2 22 that's correct 4 times 2 8 8 plus 8 16. here you can start from left 6 plus 6 12 12 minus 4 8 that's also correct multiplication first 9 times 9 81 81 minus 40. you get 41 that's correct 20 divided by 4 you get 5. 5 divided by 20 you are getting one over four not four so that's wrong nine divided by three is three three divide by three that's one this answer is wrong 25 
,,times 2 50 50 minus 40 that's 10. that one is correct simplify the following expressions multiplication first 20 times 240 40 plus 7 47 division first here 14 divided by 2 is 7 7 times 3 21. here multiplication 300 plus 7 three hundred and seven we'll do multiplication first eight times fifty four hundred four hundred divided by hundred answer is 4 division first 900 divided by 100 you get 9 9 plus 5 14. this one division first 24 divided by 24 is 1 1 plus 9 you get 10. starting from left 8 divided by 8 is 1 1 divided by 1 the answer is 1 this is addition subtraction you can start from left 7 plus 0 7 7 minus 5 you get 2. this one division first 23 plus 2 divided by 2 is 1. so you get 24 there's one division first 35 divided by seven that's five five minus five that's zero multiplication first 4 times 2 that's 8 32 plus 8 answer is 40. addition subtraction odd is not important 12 plus 3 15 15 minus 7 answer is 8. simplify which one we need to do first multiplication three there two times eight sixteen now now you can edit three plus sixteen eighteen three plus sixteen that's nineteen nineteen plus five 20 4 this one you have to do division first 25 divided by 5 you get 5. 5 plus 3 minus 2. so 5 plus 3 8 8 minus 2 6. this one starting from left multiplication first 8 times 4 32 32 plus 3 and minus 30. 32 plus 3 35 35 minus 30 you get 5. this one addition and subtraction there's no order 7 minus 2 5 5 plus 10 minus 3 15 minus 3 you get 12. this one starting from 
,,left multiplication you can do 8 times 2 16. now division 16 divided by 4 that's 4 4 minus 1 you get 3 starting from left 56 divided by 7 that's 8 8 now divide by 8 
,,what's 8 divided by 8 1 now addition 1 plus 5 answer is 6 starting from left we can do multiplication 9 times 7 63 then we can do division so what's the division here 63 divided by 21 that's 3. so 3 plus 5 you get eight starting from left again 24 divided by eight that's three three plus seven minus one so what's three plus seven ten ten minus one is nine we'll do this one first 81 divided by nine that's nine now we'll look at divisions 9 divided by 3 you get 3 3 plus 5 answer is 8. now we'll see when you get brackets how you do the operations look at this one 2 plus 7 add 2 and 7 that's 9. now if you want to subtract 9 from 12 so what's the answer 12 
,,minus 9 you get 3. so this can be written as can write 2 plus 7 add it and subtract from 12. so 12 minus this so here we have written like that 12 minus 2 plus 7. when you get brackets what you do 2 plus 7 that's 9 12 minus 9. so what's the answer you get 3. now do these questions so what you have to do when you get brackets simplify inside the brackets first so 30 divided by 7 plus 3 you get 10. now do the division 30 divide by 10 you get 3. this one 20 plus 4 what's 20 plus 4 24 24 divided by 6 what's the answer you get 4. now this bracket first 28 plus 2 30 12 plus 3 you get 15. now you can divide 30 divided by 15 you get 2 here also two brackets you have to simplify separately these two brackets nine plus seven sixteen eight into one multiply by one you get eight now 16 divided by 8 you get 2. this one brackets first 4 plus 3 7 21 divided by 7 you get 3 here in this one this bracket first 12 minus 5 you get 7 7 divided by 7 that's 1. now look at this one brackets first so you take this one first five plus two seven now you can write the question again nine times three minus seven then what you do you have to do the multiplication first starting from left you get multiplication so 9 times 3 27 27 minus 7 you get 20. look at this one brackets first three times five fifteen so you write two plus fifteen plus three addition here you can do from left to right 2 plus 15 17 17 plus 3 20. this one brackets first 12 plus 2 14. 5 times 14 divided by 10 so you can start from left multiplication comes so you have to do that 5 times 4 20 2 remaining 5 times 1 5 plus 2 7 so 70 divided by 10 you get 7 this one 3 times 4 that's 12. 20 minus 12 plus 7. now start from left 20 minus 12 that's 8. 8 plus 7 you get 15. look at this one brackets first 12 divided by 6 you get 2. now what's the next step 
,,multiplication three times two six eight plus six minus five eight plus six fourteen fourteen minus five you get 9 this one brackets first so what you do 10 plus 7 multiplied by 4 minus 2 you get 2 and this is multiplication 3 plus 4. what's the next one you need to start from left and c multiplication is there 10 plus 7 times 2 14 into 3 plus 4 again from left you get this multiplication 10 plus 3 times 4 12 1 remaining 3 times 1 3 plus 1 4 plus 4 what you get 10 plus 42 you get 52 52 plus 4 56 this one first brackets 7 minus 2 plus 5 times 6 30 30 plus 4. now you can do starting from left or any order so i'll start from left 7 minus 2 5 5 30 35 35 plus 4 3 9 this one brackets first 8 times 2 60. this brackets these two brackets next 24 divided by 3 8 30 divided by 15 you get 2. now you can do addition and subtraction 16 plus 8 24 24 minus 2 you get 20 2 this one these three brackets first 12 divided by 3 that's 4. 24 divided by 3 8 30 divided by 15 that's 2 addition and subtraction so 8 plus 4 12 12 minus 2 you get 10 this one brackets first these two we can do 12 minus 3 9 3 minus 1 2 now starting from left 9 times 2 18 18 divide by 9 you get 2. this question we can do brackets first three hundred minus twelve times eight sixteen one remaining eight times one eight plus one ninety six twelve times five you get hundred now what we do we can do this subtraction 300 minus 96 what's that when you subtract you get 200 so 204 minus 100 you get 104. so the answer is 104. this one this bracket first 24 plus 3 27 now division first 27 divided by 9 you get 3 3 plus 5 that's 8. now worded problem there are six boxes of eggs with 12 eggs in each equally distribute them all among eight housewives how much eggs would one housewife get so how many eggs in six boxes twelve times six and then number of eggs one would get so how many housewives are there eight so this is equally divided so you can divide this by eight so we'll do first one six times two 12 1 remaining 6 times 1 6 plus 1 7 now 72 you have to do divide equally by 8 housewives so 72 divided by 8. you get 9 so how many eggs one would get 9 eggs this question 18 out of 90 oranges bought by a merchant was rotten when the remaining good ones are distributed among 12 persons how much oranges would one person get total how many oranges brought 90 oranges all together how many rotten oranges are there 18 are rotten balance of good oranges so you have to subtract 19 minus 80. what's the value 2 here 10 1 is there so 2 plus 7 that's 90. so 72 then what we have to do we have to divide this equally with 12 persons so number of oranges one would get you take the total good ones divide by 12 persons so 72 divided by 12 you get 6. so 6 oranges one would get so we can write the same question at once how can we write we can write 20 minus 18 inside brackets and then divide this by 12. look at this question 400 rupees for the first 15 words and 20 rupees for each excessive word is charged for publishing a newspaper advertisement find how much would be charged for a newspaper advertisement containing 23 words so excessive number of words after the first 50 all together how many words are there 23 first 15 that's a different charge so we have to subtract 15 to get the excessive number of words so what's the value 23 minus 15 you get 8 here so 8 23 minus 15 is 8. price for extra 8 words so what's the charge 20 rupees for each excessive word so 8 times 20. that's 100 60 rupees first charge first 15 words the charge is 400 so what's the total so you have to add 400 plus 160 what's the total you get 560 rupees for an advertisement with 23 words look at this one 12 rupees for the first minute and 8 rupees for every next minute is charged for international direct dialing calls taken to a foreign country find out the total cost of a call of 12 minutes taken to that country so what's the extra number of minutes spent so all together 12 minutes extra is first minute that's 12. so 12 minutes minus 1 so 11 more minutes so this is minutes 11 minutes are there then what's the total amount payable first minute is 12 then 8 rupees for next minute is charge every one minute you need eight rupees so all together this is eight times eleven eighty eight plus twelve so what's the total amount payable 100 rupees for this call 8 plus 210 1 remaining 9 plus 1 so for 12 minute call the person has to pay 100 rupees write the simplifying order of whole number expressions so what is the first thing you have to do simplify inside brackets after that you look at left to right left to right then multiplication or division whatever comes first from left to right division from left to write then you can do addition and subtraction then you can do addition or subtraction whatever comes first from left to right look at this question the age of 38 boys in a grade 7 class is 12 years each two of the other two boys is 13 years old write a number expression for the total number of ages of all the 40 students and find out the total age of them so we try to write down an expression at once 38 boys in grade seven class is 12 years each so 38 into 12 and two boys with 13 years old so two boys with 30. so you have to do separately and at so 38 times 12 38 times 12 10 and 2 so you multiply by 1 and multiply by 2 you get 456 now do this multiplication 2 times 13 you get 26 now add 26 to that 400 years old the total is 482. look at this one a cyclist spends 
,,five minutes per each kilometer to cycle the first five kilometers while they spend eight minutes per each kilometer of the second five kilometers then ten minutes per each of the next five kilometers and 12 minutes per each of the final five kilometers calculate the time he would spend to cycle 17 kilometers so we'll try to write an expression at once total time spent five minutes per each kilometer to cycle the first five so first five five minutes then why we spend eight minutes per each kilometer of the second five kilometers so eight times the next five kilometers then the third one ten minutes per each of the next five ten into five now all together 50 kilometers now the last 5 kilometers that's 12 minutes but how many kilometers are there this is 5 and 5 10 10 plus 5 15 but all together 2 so you have to multiply 2 into 12 that's the last one now we can add it separately first you have to multiply 5 times 5 25 8 times 5 40. 10 times five fifty two times twelve twenty four now add all together and get five plus 4 9 4 plus 2 6 6 plus 5 11 11 plus 2 13 139 minutes so how we find out number of hours and minutes what you do you have to 
,,divide by 60 because 60 minutes per hour so you get 120 so how many minutes are there 19 minutes so 2 hours and 19 19 minutes so i can write separately 2 hours and 19 minutes now we look at example 1 in your textbook write down the operations of the expression 12 into 2 minus 5 into 3 in the order in which they appear so from left to right so first you have to do multiplication another multiplication because before subtracting numbers we have to do either division or multiplication first so another multiplication and then only you can do subtraction exercise 3.1 for each of the following numerical expressions write down the mathematical operations in the order in which they appear so this is addition you can start from left so this is adding and adding this one multiplication first and then subtraction here first 
,,division then you have to do multiplication and then subtraction fourth one starting from left you have to do multiplication then from left that's addition and subtraction this one starting from left first do division and then this division next and then finally addition exercise 3.2 simplify each of the following expressions addition so 12 plus 5. 17 17 plus 8 20 5 multiplication so you can do first two 5 times 8 40. 40 times 3 you get 120 7 plus 3 10 2 plus 6 8 10 plus 8 eighteen two times five ten four times three twelve ten times twelve you get hundred twenty odd is not important in additions only and multiplication only example number one simplify so 7 minus 4 plus 5 subtraction and addition you can start from left 7 minus 4 you get 3 3 plus 5 8. this one 80 divided by 10 into five so starting from left 80 divided by 10 that's 8 then you do multiplication 8 times 5 40. this one you can start from left to right 4 times 6 24 then you do the division 24 divided by 3 answer 
,,is 8 here 25 plus 10 minus 7 starting from left you can add first 25 plus 10 that's 35 minus 7 you get 20 8. example number 5 28 divided by 2 minus 3 division first 
,,from left to right 28 divided by 2 you get 14. 14 minus 3 that's 11. here 50 minus 10 into 3 which one we have to do first multiplication 10 times 3 30. now we can subtract 50 minus 30 that's 20. 18 into 5 minus 62 18 times 5 so here 8 times 5 you get 40 4 remaining 5 times 1 5 5 plus 4 90. so 90 minus 62. you get 8 here and 2 so 20 8 this one 50 minus 10 divide by 2. now you have to do division first 10 divided by 2 you get 5 50 minus 5 answer is 45 example number 9 5 plus 6 divided by 3 plus 2 left to right first division so 5 plus 6 divided by 3 that's 2. now you can add 5 plus 2 7 7 plus 2 9 this one simplify 2 times 12 divided by 3 multiplied by 5 first these two you get 24. now what's next from left to right 24 divided by 3 that's 8 8 times 5 answer is 40. exercise 3.3 place a tick mark next to the correct statement and wrong sign next to incorrect statement so this is subtraction addition you can do in any order 8 minus 5 3 3 plus 2 you get 5 so this is not 1 so this is wrong 12 times 3 multiplication first you get 36 36 minus 11 that's 25 that's correct this one which one we do first 18 divided by 6 that's 3 7 plus 3 you get 10. 
,,from left multiplication 30 then 30 divided by 3 you get 10 10 plus 7 17 this is wrong simplify the following expressions so what's the order when you get multiplication or division from left to right you have to do that first before addition and subtraction so 10 times 4 first 40 40 plus 17 you get 57. times 3 24 24 plus 5 29 this one division first 14 divided by 7 is 2 then multiplication 2 times 5 10 division first 12 divided by 3 is 4. 448 plus 4 you get 452 this one multiplication first seven times two hundred thousand four hundred now add hundred and eight to that you get eight zero five and one thousand five hundred and eight eight times nine seventy two seventy two minus sixty one you get 11. this multiplication first 100 minus 8 times 7 56 now subtract you get 4 here 6 plus 4 10 so 44 from left to right multiplication first 195 minus 12 times 10 120. now division 120 divided by 5 you get 5 times 2 10 for 20 that's 4. so 5 times 2 10 2 remaining so that's 24 now do the subtraction 195 minus 24 what's the subtraction 7 and 1. so you get 171 as the answer this one starting from left to right multiplication 7 plus what's 37 times 5 
,,5 times 7 35 3 remaining 5 times 3 15 plus 3 80. now you can do the addition 185 plus 7 192 now add 278 to that you get 8 plus 2 10 17 1 remaining so 470 example number one now you get brackets so what we do brackets first 12 minus 7 you get 5. so you can rewrite the question 20 divided by 5 now 20 divided by 5 is 4. here from left first brackets 10 plus 12 22. now rewrite the question 5 times 22 divide by 11 now left to right whatever comes first multiplication or division so you can multiply first 5 times 2 10 1 remaining 10 plus 1 11. so 110 divided by 11. so you get 10. example number three brackets first 10 plus 2 12. now rewrite the question 8 plus 5 times this is division 3 minus 4. now from left to right multiplication 8 plus 12 times 5 60. next from left to right division 8 plus 60 divided by 3 you get 20. now you can do addition and subtraction 8 plus 20 28 28 minus 4 you get 24. example number four the pencils in five boxes each of which contains 12 pencils are divided equally among four students write down an expression for the number of pencils a single student receives and simplify it so number of then six how do we find out what's the total five boxes each twelve pencils so all together five times twelve are equally divided among four students so i'll write other way around divide by 
,,four now left to right first multiplication twelve times five sixty sixty divide by four four times one four and for 20 that's five so each person get 15 pencils example number 5 nimal plucked 47 mangoes from a tree in his garden he kept 18 in his position and sold the rest to his neighbor at nine rupees per fruit write down an 
,,expression for the total amount of money nima learned in rupees by selling the mangoes and simplify it so total amount is this is in rupees he plucked 47 mangoes from a tree in his garden he kept 80. so what's the remaining part 47 minus 80. that one each mango for 9 rupees so multiply by 9 so that's the total amount here so what we do first brackets what's the subtraction you get 9 and 2 so 29 47 minus 18 is 29 now multiply by 9 9 times 9 81 8 remaining 9 times 2 18 18 plus 8 2 26 so 261 rupees example six the taxi fare for the first kilometer is 50 rupees it is 42 rupees for each kilometer above the first write down an expression for the amount paid 
,,by a passenger who enjoyed a ride of 12 kilometers and simplify your answer so you need to find out the amount paid first kilometer 50 rupees so 50 plus so how many 
,,kilometers extra all together 12. so you need to subtract 1 that value multiplied by 42 because after the first kilometer you have to pay 40 rupees each per kilometer so how you do this so this is in rupees first brackets so 50 12 minus 1 is 11 times 42. now multiplication second 50 plus multiply this by 11 42 times 11 10 and 1 
,,you get here 264 462. now add 50 to that you get 2 and 5 plus 6 11 1 remaining and this is 5 512 rupees exercise 3.4 simplify the following expressions so first you 
,,have to do brackets 12 plus 8 20. now subtraction 12 20 minus 15 that's 5 brackets first 35 minus add these two get 23. so subtract you get 2 here and 1. so the answer is 12. here brackets first 5. here there's no multiplication sign because there's a bracket brackets means multiply so 7 times 5 you get 35. here 27 minus 13 first so you get fourteen three times that and add hundred and eight so first multiplication three times four twelve one remaining three times one three plus one four now add hundred and eight and forty two five what hundred and fifty this one brackets first 17 minus 5 you get 12. 24 divided by 12 you get 2. this one first brackets 
,,five plus two seven now three times seven into eight you can do multiplication here three times seven twenty-one twenty-one times 8 168. 16 divided by 4 you get 4. so 31 plus 4 you get 35. 8 times 9 72 73 minus 72 you get 1. 19 times 10 190 plus 38 you get 228 again at 8 12 and 1 remaining 228 this one 30 divided by 6 you get 5 
,,475 minus 5 you get 470 an international call to a certain country cost seven rupees for the first minute and four rupees per minute thereafter write down an expression in rupees for the cost of a 10 minutes long international call simplify your expression so you need to find out the total cost cost for the call first minute that's seven rupees plus so how many extra minutes are there this is 10 minute so you have to subtract one for those number of means you need to pay four rupees each so what you do first 10 minus 9 first 10 minus 1 first that's 9 7 plus 9 into 4 then multiplication you get 9 times 4 36 36 plus 7 43 rupees for the 10 minutes call write down an expression for the number of 2 litre bottles that can be filled with a fruit drink made from eight liters of water and four liters of fruit juice so number of bottles what's the mixture eight liters of water and four liters of fruit juice that's the total number of liters but dividing into two liter bottles you have 
,,to divide this by 2 now here first do addition 12 12 divided by 2 you can get 6 bottles with 2 liters simplify the following expressions when you get an expression first start from left brackets first then multiplication or division and finally addition of subtraction so starting from here 30 divided by 10 you get 3 then 3 times 5 15 starting from left 40 times 10 400 divide by five you get 80. this one multiplication first 400 minus 200 that's 200 brackets first 10 times 3 30. 30 divided by 30 you get 1 brackets first 40 divided by 10 that's 4. now multiply 8 times 4 32 multiplication first 7 times 5 35 35 plus 3 38 division first 6 divided by 2 you get 3 three plus seven that's ten here brackets first 24 times three seventy two now divide by eight you get 9 brackets 4 times 3 12 24 divided by 12 you get 2 here now this one first brackets you get 9. now rewrite the question again then starting from left you can do multiplication 6 times 9 54. now rewrite again do division 3 
,,plus 54 divide by 3 1 and for 24 that's 8. now you can do addition and subtraction from left to right 18 plus 3 21 21 minus 7 you get 14. this one brackets first 10 
,,plus 8 this is multiplication 11 minus 3 you get 8 multiplied by 4 minus 4 from left to right then you have to do this multiplication 10 plus 8 times 8 64 times 4 minus 4 again multiplication 10 plus 4 times 4 16 1 remaining 4 times 6 24 plus 1 25 now you can do addition and subtraction 256 plus 10 266 266 minus 4 you get 262. so all these expressions first brackets then multiplication or division and finally addition or subtraction so we covered all theory in this lesson so you need to remember first perform any calculations inside brackets then perform all multiplication or division working from left to right finally perform all additions and subtractions working from left to right so practice all exercise and examples and thorough with the basic operations in whole numbers
,,
Operations of While number,tN9lN0hTLsY,whole numbers in our day-to-day life to count things we use numbers like 1 2 3 4 the collection of these kind of numbers like 1 2 3 4 and so on we call this collection of numbers as natural numbers and we represent the set of natural numbers with the letter n so n is natural numbers 1 2 3 4 and so on so every natural number has 
,,a successor see for example 3 has got a successor for if you see 2 it has got a successor 3 and in the same way the natural numbers except one are the natural numbers they have a predecessor 3 is having 2 as a predecessor and 4 is having 3 but whereas 1 is having a successor but it is not having the predecessor number now if we 
,,add 0 to the collection of natural numbers this is a collection of natural numbers if we add 0 to the collection we call this set the natural numbers at 0 with 0 we 
,,call it as whole numbers and we denote it with the letter W so this is a set of whole numbers 0 1 2 3 4 so on so whole numbers or the set of natural numbers with 0 including 0 we call it as whole numbers so in this chapter we are going to learn about these whole numbers representation of whole numbers or number line so first let us see how to draw a number line now first draw a line and mark a point as 0 on the line now mark some points with equal distances on to the right side of the line 
,,keep on marking till the end of the so we mark as one two three four five six seven eight nine ten and so on till aunt number so this is the number line we have made so now we observe a number line here every number on this number line has got a successor towards its right side so six is having its successor on right side that is seventh in the same way every number is having its predecessor on its left side so this is a number line drawn with whole numbers now we will see that addition of 
,,numbers on number line so here we are going to add some whole numbers using a number line here the addition given is 2 plus 3 so how to do this using a number line the first digit is 2 so let us start at to go to the number line and begin from 2 plus 3 so that is you have to move three positions now on which direction we have to move whether to right or left here we have to move towards right because we are doing addition 2 plus 3 so we have to move to right side from two how many positions we have to move to plus 3 so we have to move three positions towards right side from 2 starting at two three positions to right side so now we reach in a file that 
,,means 2 plus 3 equal to 5 so this way using a number line we can do additions let us see the subtraction on number line let us subtract some whole numbers using a number line 6 minus 2 subtraction of whole numbers on a number line so 6 minus 2 the first digit is 6 now go to 6 on the number line here we are - - we have to move two positions on which direction - right ha - left as this is subtraction we have to move to the left side if it is addition right side subtraction left side how many 
,,positions 2 because it is 6 minus 2 from 6 towards left 2 positions so we reached 4 so 6 minus 2 4 in this way we can subtract whole numbers on a number line multiplication on number like say for example 2 into 4 so how to do this multiplication of whole numbers on a number line 2 into 4 that means two positions four times these two positions to the right side how many times four times 1 2 3 4 so we reach 8 so we are moving right side every time to 2 positions how many times 4 times because it is 2 into 4 so we got 8 this is the multiplication of whole numbers on number line properties of whole numbers let us see 5 plus 7 equal to 12 so here 5 is a whole number 7 is a whole number and even 12 is a whole numbers 3 plus 4 equal to 7 this is the whole number and 4 is of whole numbers and even 7 is a whole number so here what do we understand from these examples we get that the sum of two whole numbers Gill's available so here the sum of any two whole numbers will be a four-level so this is the one of the property of the whole numbers now let us see another number 2 into 3 c2 is a whole number 3 is a whole number and 6 is a whole number 4 into 5 4 5 20 so here also all the 3 are whole numbers so here the product of the multiplication of any 2 whole numbers user is the whole number so here in the previous one we have seen that the sum of any two whole numbers gives rise to a whole number even here the multiplication of any 2 whole numbers gives rise to a whole number so what we can say from these two examples we can say that the collection of whole numbers is closed under addition and multiplication but this is not possible in 
,,subtraction and in division let us see let us verify let us see here a subtraction 5 minus 7 if you remove 5 minus 7 so from 5 if you remove 7 you will get minus 2 so these - numbers are not the whole numbers whole numbers are the collection of natural numbers and 0 so this is not a whole number so a whole number minus a whole number may not become a whole number look at the division 5 divided by 2 it becomes Phi by 2 so this Phi by 2 is not a whole number this is a fraction Phi by 2 it is 
,,not a whole number so here it doesn't apply to division and subtraction whereas in addition and in multiplication we find that the sum of two whole numbers become a 
,,whole number and the multiplication the product of two whole numbers always becomes the whole number now let us look at the commutative property of whole numbers say for example 3 plus 5 equal to 8 in the same way 5 plus 3 equal to 8 so here we have two examples 3 plus 5 equal to 8 and 5 plus 3 equal to 8 so what is the difference here the order of this whole number P is changed the rest is same because the numbers are same but the order is changed here 3 + 5 here 5 + 3 but the result is same so the sum of the whole numbers even though the ordering pain is changed the sum the value will be the same this property is known as commutative property so the 
,,whole numbers are commutative in case of an addition now let us see multiplication 2 into 3 equal to 6 3 into 2 equal to 6 here we have 2 whole numbers multiplied we got a result here product and here the same numbers but the order of the pair is changed even though the order of the pain is change the result is same so the whole numbers are commutative in case of multiplication also commutative property of whole numbers let us see the addition of two whole numbers 3 plus 5 equal to 8 5 plus 3 equal to 8 so here we have an addition of two whole numbers 3 plus 5 in both the cases the whole numbers are same but the payer order is changed here the same pair pre-filed even 5 3 the order is changed even though the order is changed in the addition of whole numbers the result will be the same so we say that this property 
,,is known as commutative property here we say that the addition is commutative in whole numbers so in whole numbers the addition is commutative now let us look at the multiplication 2 into 3 6 3 into 2 6 so here same value the product is same but here the numbers are changed so the pail are distinct in case of a multiplication even though the order of the peel is changed the result is same it is equal so in whole numbers the multiplication is also commutative multiplication of whole numbers 
,,is commit we do multiplication is commutative commutative so we can say that the addition and multiplication are commutative for whole numbers associativity of whole numbers now let us see 3 plus 4 plus 5 is equal to 3 plus 4 7 plus 5 is equal to 12 now the same thing by changing the arrangement 3 plus 4 plus 5 we have written like this so now 3 plus 4 plus 5 9 is equal to 12 so here in this addition the arrangement is different in this case in the first example we added 3 & 4 first then we added to 5 in the second case first 4 & 5 we added first and added it to 3 so we got 12 in both the cases that is 30 same even though here the arrangement and the order of addition is different so here we call this property as associative property so in addition the whole numbers are associative now let us see the associativity in multiplication now let us see the associativity of multiplication in whole numbers so here we have three dots in six cells so 3 into 2 columns and even the pattern is here like that so we have in every box we have 6 coins 3 in a column so 2 columns 3 coins into 2 columns three coins into 2 3 into 2 so this is the pattern so 
,,3 2 6 3 2 6 3 2 6 6 + 6 12 + 6 18 here if you look the same but in a different pattern 3 columns each 4 so we write 4 into 3 & 4 into 3 4 3 is 12 4 3 is 12 so 24th let us see the associativity of multiplication for whole numbers here we have some dots arranged in a box so this box is having 2 columns and the 3 dots in each column 3 into 2 3 into 2 3 into 2 3 into 2 and in the same here is the different arrangement 4 dots in each column 3 columns 4 into 3 so here total 4 boxes are there each one is having 3 into 2 into 4 in the same way here 2 boxes 4 into 3 into 2 3 2 6 into 4 24 + 4 3 is 12 into 2 24 so here in both the cases the answer is same the value is same but here the numbers that we are multiplying at the beginning are different so this property is called as associative property of multiplication for whole numbers so we find that addition and multiplication are associative over members now let us find this example find the product of 5 into 9 into 2 into 2 into 3 into 5 my applying commutative property we change the order of these numbers 5 into 2 into 9 into 2 into 5 into 3 so now this is that commutative property we applied the commutative property here so now we use the associative property 5 into 2 into 9 into 2 into 5 into 3 so this is associative property so this is the associative property Vitus 10 into 9 2 5 10 into 3 so 10 9 90 into 10 threes 30 so 90 into 30 is equal to 2700 so in this way by applying this commutative property and associative property we could do this multiplication even simple and easily to directly find out the answer

Operations of While number,T5Qf0qSSJFI,"Hi, Im Rob.  Welcome to Math Antics. In this lesson, were going to learn how our basic number system works and were going to learn about an important concept called Place Value. The number system that we use in math is called base 10, because is uses ten different symbols for counting. Math could use other systems that are "
,,"based on a different number (like base 2 or base 8), but Ill give you ten guesses as to why the number ten is such a popular choice. The ten symbols that we use are called digits and they look like this: zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight and nine. At first glance, you might think thats only nine digits, but remember, the zero counts as one of the digits also. To see how our numbers system uses these digits to represent amounts, lets pretend that we have an apple "
,,"orchard full of apple trees, and each of these trees is loaded with big, juicy, red apples that we need to pick and then count for our records. Were going to use something called a number place to count. The best way to understand a number place is to imagine that its like a small box thats only big enough to hold one digit at a time. As we count, well change the digit thats in the number place to match how many apples weve picked. For example, if we start with no apples at all, we "
,,"put the digit 0 in the number place because zero means none. But then, as the apples start coming in from the orchard, we begin to count one, two, three, four, "
,,"five, six, seven, eight and nine. Okay, now weve got nine apples, but weve also got a problem. Weve already run out of digits to count with. The highest digit we "
,,"have is a 9,  but there are a LOT more apples left to count. What will we do? The solution is to use groups to help us count. If we pick just one more apple, well have ten, right? So lets combine those ten apples into a single group. So how many apples do we have? Ten! BUT how many GROUPS of ten apples do we have?  Ah just ONE! Does that help us with our lack of digits problem? It sure does, IF we use another number place! Instead of using this new number place to count up individual apples one at a time like we did with the first number place. Were going to use it to count apples TEN at a time. In other words, well use it to keep track of how many groups of ten apples that weve picked. For example, if weve picked only one group of ten, then well put the digit 1 in that number place. If weve picked "
,,"two groups of ten, then well put the digit 2 in that number place, and if weve picked three groups of ten, then well put the digit 3 in that number place. And so on. Do you see whats happening? Because the new number place is being used to count GROUPS of ten, its allowing us to re-use our original ten digits, but this "
,,"time they are able to count (or represent) bigger amounts. Since this new number place is for counting groups of ten, were going to name it the tens place. And well name our original number place, the ones place because we used it to count things one at a time. And heres the really important thing were not going to use "
,,"the new number place instead of the old one were going to use it along side of the old one so that we have one number place for counting by ones and another number place for counting by tens. Using these two number places together lets us represent amounts that are in-between the groups of ten. For example, if weve already picked thirty apples, then there will be a 3 in the tens place because we have three groups of ten. But there will be a 0 in the ones place, because there are no individual apples left over. But if we have picked thirty-two apples, then there will be a 3 in the tens place and a 2 in the ones place to represent the two individual apples that are not in the groups of ten. In fact, using only our ten digits and these two number places, we can count all the way from zero up to ninety-nine. At ninety-nine, both of our number places are maxed out with the highest digits and we wont be able to count any higher, UNLESS... we get another number place! If weve picked ninety-nine apples and then we pick just one more, well have exactly one-hundred apples. And if we make a group from those one-hundred apples, we can use this new number place to count how many groups of one-hundred weve picked. That means that we can re-use the same ten digits AGAIN in this new number place to "
,,count how many groups of one-hundred we have. And you guessed it its called the hundreds place because we use it to count groups of a hundred. Are you starting to see how our base 10 number system works? It uses different number places to represent the different sized groups that we use to count. And the digits in those number places tell us how many of each group we have. The digit in the ones place tells us how many ones we have. The digit in the tens place tells us how many groups 
,,"of ten we have. And the digit in the hundreds place tells us how many groups of one-hundred we have. And have you noticed that each time we got a new number place to count larger groups, we placed it to the LEFT of the previous number place. Thats important because number places are always arranged in the exact same order. Starting with the ones place, as you move to the left, the number places represent larger and larger amounts. And did you also noticed that each new number place represents groups that are exactly ten times bigger than the previous number place? Ten is ten times bigger than one"
,,and one-hundred is ten times bigger than ten. Thats really important because it helps us see the pattern for bigger number places. It helps us to see that the next 
,,"number place will count groups of ten times one-hundred, which is one-thousand. Thats why its called the thousands place. And the next number place will count groups ten times bigger than that!  Its the ten-thousands place! And the number places keep on going like that. Next is the hundred-thousands place. Then the millions place. Then ten-millions. Then one-hundred-millions. Then billions!  And so on Oh, and you may notice that when we get a lot of number places next to each other like this, its a little hard to quickly recognize which place is which. Thats why many countries use some kind of separator every three places to make them easier to keep track of. For example, in the U.S. we use a comma every three number places to make it easier to identify things like the thousands place, or the millions "
,,"place. Seeing all these number places together helps you understand what we mean by place value. In a multi-digit number, the number PLACE that a digit is in, determines its VALUE. Even though we only have ten digits, each digit can stand for different amounts depending on the place that it occupies. If the digit 5 is in the ones place, it just means five. But, if a 5 is in the tens place, then it means fifty, and if a 5 is in the hundreds place, it means five-hundred. And its the same for bigger number places. A 5 in the hundred-thousands place means five-hundred-thousand, and a 5 in the billions place means five-billion! See how a digits place effects its value? Of course, when we work with numbers in math, most of the time the number places are invisible. But the underlying pattern is always the "
,,"same. Oh, and because the number places are invisible, in certain cases youll need to use zeros to make it clear what number youre talking about. To see what I mean, imagine that this 5 is in the hundreds place to represent five-hundred, but if you make the number places invisible, then it just looks like five and not five-hundred. So to make sure people know you mean FIVE-HUNDRED, you need a 5 in the hundreds place, a 0 in the tens place, and a 0 in the ones place. Now you can tell that the 5 is in the hundreds place and it means five-hundred. Okay now a great way to see place value in action with some actual numbers is to expand them to show that theyre really combinations of different groups. When we do this, its called writing a number in Expanded Form. For example, we can expand 324 to be 300, 20 and 4, because the 3 is in the hundreds place and means three-hundred, the 2 is in the tens place and means twenty, and the 4 is in the ones place so it "
,,"just means four. So 324 in expanded form is the combination of those amounts: three-hundred plus twenty plus four. Lets try writing another number in expanded form:  6,715 We can expand this into six-thousand, (because the 6 is in the thousands place) plus seven-hundred, (because the 7 is in the hundreds place) plus ten, (because the 1 is in the tens place) and five, (because the 5 is in the ones place) So the expanded form is six-thousand plus seven-hundred plus ten plus five. Alright so do you see how our base 10 number system works? Number places are used to count different sized groups. Each group is ten times bigger than the next, and "
,,"the digits in the number places tell us how many of each group we have. The tricky part is that the number places are invisible, so you have to know how they work behind the scenes in order to make sense of multi-digit numbers. How do you like them apples? The exercises for this section will help you practice so that you get used to how place value works, which is super important if you want to be successful in math.

Operations of While number,Slw5SCy9P14,hi friends if you watch this whole video you'll find the topic real easy the topic will seem natural to you so what's the topic for today that's right this video is 
,,about numbers in this video we'll explore the different type of real numbers such as natural numbers whole numbers integers rational and irrational numbers and then 
,,we'll finish off with our top three test oriented questions on this topic let's go back to the kindergarten days and start with counting numbers remember the Rhine one two three four five once I caught a fish alive well these numbers such as 1 2 3 and so on are called natural numbers and they are denoted by the letter M let's draw a circle to represent the set of natural numbers now whole numbers includes all the natural numbers and zero so we can draw the whole number circle around the natural numbers integers include all the whole numbers and negative numbers such as minus 1 minus 2 minus 3 and so on so we can draw the integer circle around the whole numbers one important thing for you to keep in mind is that zero is considered neither positive nor negative let's place the diagram we just did on our concept board now the question is are there any numbers between any two integers let's say between 0 & 1 yes and we use them all the time for example half one-third point seven 
,,point eight so between any two integers you have these non integer numbers which are known as fractions or decimals and this entire set of integers and fractions and decimals are called rational numbers and they are denoted by the letter Q any rational number can be written as a fraction P by Q where P and Q are integers the only restriction is that Q should not be 0 since division by zero is undefined now is the natural number 3 also a rational number what do you think so 3 can be written 
,,as 3 by 1 it can be written as a fraction you know P by Q form so 3 is also a rational number now what about 2.5 so we can write it as 25 by 10 and if you simplify the fraction you get 5 by 2 so 2.5 is also a rational number so any rational number can be expressed in a P by Q form that is in this fraction form the only restriction is Q should not be equal to 0 and typically P and Q don't have any common factor except 1 so we write the fraction in its simplified form let's add the non integers to our set diagram the integers and non integers that is fractions and decimals together are called rational numbers let's talk more about rational numbers that are not integers as we learned rational numbers are fractions represented by the P by Q form you can calculate the fraction by dividing and we end up with a decimal number for example 7 by 10 is 0.75 by 2 is 2.5 7 by 4 is 1.75 these are all examples apples of terminating decimal numbers that is the decimal digits stop or terminate after a point because on dividing by the denominator the remainder is zero but there are other fractions which on dividing don't terminate for example two by three is zero point six six six six and it just goes on so we write it as zero point six with a dot or a line on top to represent that the digit six is recurring which means repeating let's take another example one by seven so if you look at the answer here can you see the repeating pattern that's right it's zero point one four two eight five seven recurring let's take a look at another example one by six so that's going to be zero point one six six six six and it just keeps repeating but notice that we write it with a dot or a bar only on top of six because only the six is repeating so these are called recurring decimal numbers well on dividing by the denominator the remainder is never zero and the digits in the quotient keep repeating if you take any fraction how do you determine that on division you're going to get 
,,a terminating decimal number or a recurring decimal number of course one simple way is to actually do the division but there's another trick where you don't need to 
,,divide now what's the trick you need to take a look at the denominator and if the denominator has factors of two and five only then you're going to get a terminating decimal number otherwise it's going to be a recurring decimal number let me pull up some examples to illustrate this let's start with the example of seven by for now what are the factors of the denominator for its two into two now our goal is to convert the denominator into multiples of tens so I'm going to multiply 5 into 5 in the numerator and in the denominator so I get 175 by 100 that's 1.75 so this is a terminating decimal number but if we take 37 by 150 so what are the factors of the denominator they are 2 into 3 into 5 into 5 and if you divide we get zero point 2 4 6 6 6 and so on so this is a recurring decimal number and why is that because if you carefully look at the factors in the denominator you can see that there's a three there for it to be a terminating decimal number you need factors of two and five only now our rational question is are there numbers that are not rational the answers yes these are called irrational numbers for example root 2 root 3 cube root 
,,of 10 these are all irrational numbers but we look at these in a separate video let's try to place the different numbers that we've learnt on a number line are you familiar with the number line an everyday example is a ruler or a measuring tape like this with numbers marked on it unlike the measuring tape the number line has both positive and negative numbers so let's draw a number line and try to place the different numbers on it so here's our number line let's mark the natural numbers on 
,,it 1 2 3 and so on let's draw another number line and Mark the whole numbers on it so it's going to be the natural numbers and 0 in our third number line let's mark 
,,the integers so it's going to be all the whole numbers and the negative numbers minus 1 minus 2 minus 3 and so on in the next number line let's mark the rational numbers so it's going to be all the integers and decimals and fractions for example one point five is here midway between one and two two point eight is here and it's closer to three and minus half is midway between 0 and minus 1 we can also visualize the number system by starting from the top that is from the real numbers let me pull up the concept board for you real numbers can be divided into rational and irrational numbers rational numbers can be divided into integers and non integers now 
,,integers can be divided into negative integers and whole numbers whole numbers can be split into zero and positive integers which are natural numbers coming back to 
,,the non integers fractions and decimals these can be divided into terminating decimals and non terminating or recurring decimals now let's say you want to find rational numbers between any two given rational numbers for example between 3 & 5 one simple answer is 4 we can get it by finding the average 3 plus 5 by 2 which is equal to 4 if you want to find more rational numbers then you can do 3 plus 4 by 2 that's 3 point 5 & 4 plus 5 by 2 which is 4 point 5 now let me pull up some more interesting examples for you if you want to find two rational numbers between two fractions for example 1 by 7 & 4 bytes since the denominators here are equal and the numerators have a gap we can fill in the fractions in the gap so our answer is going to be 2 by 7 and 3 by 7 but what if there's no gap for example if we have to find two rational numbers between 1 by 7 and 2 by 7 then what do you do we can create a gap by multiplying the numerator and denominator with a number since we need two rational numbers we will multiply by 2 plus 1 which is 3 multiplying the numerator and denominator of the two fractions by 3 we get 3 by 21 and 6 by 21 again the denominators are the same but can you see that we've got a gap in the numerator so the two fractions we can insert our 4 by 21 and 5 by 21 now let's look at the case where the denominators of the two fractions are not the same for example if we want to insert six rational numbers between 1/2 and 2/3 as you can see the denominators are not equal so the first step is to make the denominators equal so our two fractions become 3 by 6 and 4 by 6 similar to our previous case now the two denominators are equal but there's no gap in the numerators so what should we do that's right we need to multiply by a number and since we need to insert six rational numbers our number is going to be 6 plus 1 which is 7 so let's multiply the numerator and denominator of the two fractions by 7 so here we have 21 by 42 and 28 by 42 so here are 
,,the six rational numbers that we can insert between these two fractions and on simplifying the six rational numbers and that's our answer let's talk about fractions 
,,and decimals how to convert fractions to decimals and decimals to fractions converting fractions to decimals is easy you just need to divide for example 3 by 4 is 0.75 a terminating decimal number 1 by 3 is 0.33 3 recurring a recurring decimal number now if you want to convert 0.75 to a fraction then we can write it as 75 by 100 simplifying we get 3 by 4 so these are simple but a more interesting question is how do you convert a recurring decimal number to a fraction for example 0.333 recurring now we know that 0.3 is 3 by 10 0.33 is 33 by 100 0.333 is 333 by thousand but we are looking for zero point 3 3 3 3 recurring so let me show you the technique 
,,how to convert a recurring decimal number to a fraction coming up for you right now let X be the recurring decimal number which is 0.3 recurring in this case so let's write it as X equal to 0.33 3 3 and so on now we need another number where the part after the decimal is the same so let's multiply X by 10 and we have 10 X equal 
,,to 3 point 3 3 3 and so on so as you can see here X and 10x have the same part after the decimal now let's subtract X from 10x so I'm going to copy the first line here on subtracting we get 9x equal to 3 so X is 3 by 9 and if we simplify we get 1 by 3 so we have converted our recurring decimal number 0.3 recurring to a fraction 
,,1 by 3 let's look at another example again let X be the recurring decimal number which is one point two seven recurring to find another number with the decimal part 
,,matching this time we can't multiply by 10 we need to multiply by 100 and as you can see in hundred X the decimal part matches so once again subtracting X from 100 X we get 99 X equal to 126 and on simplifying we get 14 by 11 so we've converted our recurring decimal number to a fraction now that we are done with the topic of rational numbers let's take a look at the top three questions on this topic coming up for you right now I would like you to pause the video right here and try solving these questions let's make this more interactive than just watching the video so do post your answers in the comments below or if you have any doubts questions feel free to write it in the comments below and I'm going to make a commitment to answer all of them promptly so I'm going to move off and let you solve these questions thanks for watching the whole video I hope the number system is really easy for you now and the numbers seem more rational and natural to you all puns intended in that sentence and do remember to Like comment and share out this video and go and hit the subscribe button for my channel right now you

Operations of While number,Paza3CbdamI,hello friends I am Miss Honey would you like to learn about the place value and face value of a digit in a number today yeah so let's begin first let me tell you what we mean by the place value of a digit place value is the value of the digit according to its position in the number such as ones tens hundreds et cetera let us understand this with the help of a number mmm let us take the number 346 we write the number 346 in the place value chart as number three in the hundreds : number four 
,,in the tens column and number six in the ones column now let us look at the place value of each digit as the number three is in the hundredths column it means that there are three hundredths and so its place value is three into 100 that is three hundred as the number four is in the tens column it means that there are four tens and so its place value is 4 into 10 that is 40 as the number six is in the ones column it means that there are six ones and so its place value is 6 into one that is six now let's try to solve one more example number 605 let us place each number in its respective column so number six goes in the hundreds column number zero in tens column and number five in the ones column the place value of number six is six into 100 that is 600 the place value of number zero is zero as there are zero tens the place value of number five is 5 into 1 that is 5 now let us learn what the face value of a digit is the face value of each digit in a number is seen as the digit itself let us look at the number 346 again to understand this as you know already number three is placed in the hundreds column number four in the tens column and number six in the ones column but the face value of a digit is the same as the digit itself irrespective of where it comes in the place value chart so the face value of digit three is three only the face value of digit four is four only and the face value of digit 6 is 6 now let us solve one more example look at the number 890 here the face value of digit 8 is 8 the face value of digit 9 is 9 the face value of digit 0 is 0 Wow wasn't it easy to understand the place value and face value of a digit

Operations of While number,Y-c25-JBQOg,in our day to day life we measure lengths of various objects like cloth rope electric wires etc length tells us how long an object is measurement of length in olden 
,,days next were measured using hand span finger work our length or qubit and step length also called pace but none of these is a standard unit as they differ from person to person how do we measure length students for accurate and convenient measurement we use standard units and devices for measuring length of an object we use a 
,,ruler meter in the standard unit for length for measuring small lengths we use centimeters meter is denoted by M centimeters is denoted by C n how to measure length 
,,of an object using a ruler to measure the length of an object with the ruler is very simple next measure the length of this marker using this ruler for this place one end of this marker on the zero mark you now observe the reading on the other end that is 14 centimeters so this gives the length of an object so the length of this marker is 14 centimeters students now let's measure some objects using a ruler pen this is a pen now let's measure this pen using a ruler let's keep one end of this pen at the zero mark and 14 so length of this pen is 14 centimeters so let's write 14 centimeter now let's measure the length of mobile Mumbai let's keep one end of this mobile at the zero mark and 11 so length off this mobile phone is 11 centimeters so let's write 11 now let's measure a candle this is above candle next measure length of this candle with the help of this ruler 14 again so length of this scandal is 14 centimeters so pen was put in centimeter long mobile 11 centimeter and the work angle is 14 centimeter students listen homework for you you have to measure length of five objects using a ruler objects like a pencil compass box notebook Tiffin box and water bottles like the length of these objects and you're not go students a bigger unit of length is kilometre kilometers are denoted a here generally we use kilometers for measuring long distance such as roads students or so remember this one meter is equal to 100 centimeters and one kilometer is equal to thousand 
,,metres

Operations of While number,wQeU4Wsjn4Y,now one more part of the basics for suppression that is being Coulomb so so vinculum what is the use of this fing column and how it can be established now see here suppose a member is like this 3 1 bar 3 1 bar okay actually this is not a normal number okay and the bar which is about the number I said 1 bar right the bar which I 
,,which is I am writing about the number this symbol is known as vinculum this symbol is known as vinculum and in subtraction this ring column bar represents the Niki 
,,to thing that means the 1 is not a positive 1 here that is a negative 1 and the part which does not have the bar that is a positive 1 so what is the purpose of this 
,,number now let us see suppose 33 1 bar means 3 is in tenths place so 31 bar is nothing but minus 1 so what is 30 minus 1 29 that means the actual number is 29 but we are representing this number in the form of wing column like this suppose we'll take one more example for 3 bar 6 bar for 3 / 6 / now what is this mean how do I want to convert this wing column number into the normal number okay how to convert first see here I just say just like I said okay 400 minus 36 so what is 400 minus 36 
,,"364 so 364 but suppose if I read some big number like this 5 3 4 5 3 bar 4 bar a bar 2 okay so writing again some 50,000 - 3000 482 it is a lengthy one how can we write this wing column number how can we convert this V column number or how can we convert this negative number negative compliment number into the normal number okay within a single step see here to convert the wing column number into the normal number okay you have to reduce the bar number before number that means the bar number is how much three four eight - this is the bar number okay before number is fine so you have to reduce this five by one every time what are we the digit what are we the digit that is before vinculum number you have to reduce by one so Phi becomes how much now it becomes four so what are the numbers here three four eight - all "
,,the numbers are having niccola or all the numbers having bar on the numbers that means you have to convert this one into normal numbers by applying the previous just now we discussed previous ultra that is Nicola of the hot German desta all from my love from ten so for these numbers you have to apply that Sutra so apply all from nine law from pen nine minus three six nine minus four five nine minus eight one but last from 10 exactly so 10 minus 2 8 this is your answer in the meanwhile you may get some doubt while you are discussing this all from line LaFontaine and this vinculum okay all these things so these are very very important for the coming subtraction methods that's why I am discussing here anyhow you should be thorough you should be perfect with this main column as well as are for men laughing them so that it will be easy for you in the further suppression methods any one more example suppose if a number is like this three six bar for bar - I want to convert this number into normal way right just now I said watch the bar before number should be registered by one so here what is the bar before number three so three is reduced by 
,,one how much it will become - as in but here only bar is only for two numbers that is two digits that is six and four so apply all from my last one ten for these two numbers there are only two numbers so for the first number it will be 9 - 6 but second number it will be 10 minus 4 so how much it will be 3 6 and drop this - as it is why because it has it doesn't have any bar of the timber right it is not a vehicle of number please Ann Arbor number only it is a novel digit only so just drop it as it is so your answer is this one one more example 5 3 bar 2 1 bar 6 I want to convert this one how much would become 5 becomes 4 by because it's next number it's part number that's why I'm reducing them before number pi 1 now this is only one digit which is having a bar on it if only one digit having bar on it we just apply the complement nothing but tens complement so what is the tenth compliment for this 3 7 ok now again - so do I have to reduce it by 1 again why because it's next number is complement that is a in column number so 2 becomes 1 here also only one number which is only one digit which is having it borrowed which is having Mikula monic so you can directly go with the complement that is nine six so four seven one nine six and finally one example I will tell you suppose for double 0 7 now five for double 0 7 6 4 ba + 7 bar so now what will you think so the answer is 4 6 0 0 3 6 is it the answer you got but it is actually wrong if you observe ok there are zeros two zeros which are in between two nonzero numbers two nonzero digits okay whenever zeros are coming whenever even one zero to Jerry doesn't matter but whenever gos are coming in between two nonzero digits further zeros also the complement will apply that is the v-club reapply that means the number this number is same like five four zero zero seven total bar 6 so the Vikram is also great for these two zeros also why because they are in between two non zero digits which are having them in 
,,column okay so now what is the answer for this one Phi becomes four and this number you can directly apply all from my love from 10 so how much five nine nine three 
,,and six as it is six so this will be your answer right so this is what about vinculum now we go into actual subtractions okay with it with the help of which we can do the math especially suppressants very easier way by following the method solve all from nine now some time that is nicola maha charmander's aha and winkler now so 
,,we got the basics of subtraction before starting suppressions actually okay I will give one more basic one that is suppose if you are subtracting seven minus four if you are surprising seven minus R of course I know the answer is three I think I know that you also know the answer is three but you know there are some specific terms for this subtraction suppose the above nimbu below nimble and the answer there are specific terms for this numbers or digits so the abou number that is seven okay which we are subtracting from is known as my new end is known as my new n that means the number which we are subtracting from is known as binary and the number which we are subtracting that is a below one we call it as subtrahend we call it as sub claw and once again I repeat the number which you are subtracting from that is the bone import we call it as my new it and the number which you are subtracting is known as supplying anyhow the number the answer which we got is known as difference or we can call it as remainder also difference or remainder okay now suppose 7-4 yes it is possible without the answer directly three suppose if I write like this 4 - 7 4 - 7 this time is the subtraction practically possible suppose for example you have 4 rupees okay and your friend came and asked you to q 7 rupees so you don't have seven rupees with you so some giving is not possible surprising is not possible practically okay so in such type of conditions okay what we are going to do we 
,,are going to subtract the abbu number from the below number that means we are going to subtract the 4 from 7 which is a subprime and we are going to write the answer as 3 but for three along we are going to put a bar on it why because we did the negative one we did the negative subtraction so 7 minus 4 minus 7 and 4 the result is 3 but with a bar on it that is 3 bar right fact so we are done with the basics now we will start the actual subtractions in an easier way first we will start with 
,,double digit - double digit - single digit okay by applying vinculum sutra so we will take one example 24-7 no just like I said okay we are going Vedic mass especially addition source of crisis we are not going to do from right to left which is the conventional way but here we are going to do from left to right now Lucy is there any digit below - there is nothing so we will just drop to as it is okay now you tell me four - seven is it possible to subtract seven from four no it is not possible so what I say when suppression is not possible for the digits just like four - seven okay you go for the reverse subtraction that is subtract four from seven yes 
,,you are listening in a right way only okay you subtract four from seven right how much will you get three but with a bar on it why because we did the reverse operation it is a negative one okay so no we did the reverse surprised we did not for - event we did seven minus four but putting a bar on it that means it is a negative one it's raining is a negative one now it is two three bar okay previously we discussed how to convert a vehicle of number into a normal number now we got one wing club number with the subtraction okay now you convert into this one this number into the normal number how much will you get just make I said the bar before number should be registered by one always always so 2 becomes 1 so bar is having only for one digit if bar is having or if the club is having only for one digit what we will do we will take the compliment of the point so what is the compliment of three seven so your answer is 17 now we'll take one more exam suppose 36 minus 4 I want to subtract 36 minus 4 just like the same way start from left to right so drop 3 as it is since it is no digit in below that one I am dropping 3 now 6 minus 4 yes it is possible so directly we can write 2 so answer is 32 when the suppression is not possible then only we have to subtract the above-named work from the balloon in book by putting a bar on it ok just like this example but if the separation is practically directly possible okay you can directly subtract it so that you will get the answer directly no need of event converting the number one more example suppose you tell me no 47 minus 9 I want to subtract so Rob this 4 as it is okay and 7-9 not possible so go reverse 9 minus 7 how much to but yes with a bar on it now what is a normal number convert this number 4 becomes 3 what is the to complement 8 so your answer is 38 ok so like this we can do double is it - single-digit so we have seen the double digit - single is the suppression now we are going to do double - double so double is it - double is it suppose for example let us take 43 - 27 I want to do 43 - 27 again the same way we have to start from the left to right so what is 4 minus 2 yes - just drop the 2 as it is now 3 minus 7 is it possible 3 minus 7 no it is not possible so what we are going u to crash suppression is not possible what we are going to do we are going to subtract in the reverse manner that is 7 minus 3 we are going to subtract the mine rain from prime so our children at the result for but yes with a bar on it now we got the answer as two to four bar know what is the actual normal number for this one convert the win column number into normal number how much will you get anyway we know that bar before number should be registered by one so two becomes one now if the bar is only for the one digit we are going to write the complement for that one that is for bar comma converting after converting it will come six so what is our answer sixteen one more example suppose 67 minus 19 so say we will do a little fast for this one so what is explained this one 5s will write Phi here now 7 minus sign not possible so not do 9 minus 7 so how much will get 2 but with a bar on it so Phi becomes 4 now to complement is 8 so what is our answer 48 similarly 37-14 so 3 minus 1 is 2 but okay we will write 2 here now what is 7 minus 4/3 so directive subtraction is possible so we are going to write the answer directly no need of even converting the number why because it is not a wrinkled um number we have got the answer directly so such in a such a easy way we can do the double digit - the operation lasted one more example I will tell you for 
,,this one what is that example suppose we take 46 minus 60 so what is 4 minus 1 3 will be 3 only 6 minus 6 yes it is practically possible so simply directly put is 0 
,,that will be 1 sir right like this we can do the double digit - double is it so now we will see triple is it - wzj suppose 348 minus 26 I want to subtract 3 48 minus 26 now same way start from left to right drop 3 as it is so what is 4 minus 2 so directly tell subtract - what is it - two 3:22 for 36 - 47 i want to submit for that is - 47 start from left to right drop for as it is by because there is nothing there is no digit below for that's why I'm dropping simply for as it is now 3 - 4 is it possible now it is not possible so go reverse what is 4 - 3 1 but don't forget every time when you are doing the reverse subtraction don't forget to put a bar on it if you forget to put the bar on it you are going to get the wrong answer so be cautious okay now so 6-7 not possible so two silver subtraction 7 - 6 1 but with a bar on it now I got 4 1 1 bar now how to convert this one into the normal number I just like beside the bar before number should be reduced by but so 4 becomes 3 now there are two numbers which are two numbers continuously which are having bars on it okay just like we discussed whenever the vinculum or whenever the bars are having the numbers in the continuous numbers whenever the numbers are having continuously with a bars on it we will apply them all from 9 last from 10 okay once again obtaining whenever the numbers are getting continuously bars on them applied are from time or from 9 and last from 10 now there are two numbers continuously which are having bars on it that is which is having Vikram on it so just apply are from - in red for these two numbers so first first number will be subtracted from mine now 
,,what is 9 - 1 8 and the second number will be subtracted from 10 so what is 10 - 1 9 so your answer is 3 89 one more example 572 - 81 so fine we will drop as it is 7 - 8 not possible so with a 1 bar on it why because by reversing the subtraction 8 - 7 now what is 2 minus 1 yes practically possible directly now we got to answer file 1 bar 1 now how to convert this one anyway the same way 1 bar this bar before number should be registered by man that is for one bar complement is 9 and 1 as it 
,,is you can rub so what is the answer for 91 and one more example 7 62-39 I want to subtract 7 62-39 so drop 7 as it is 6 minus 3 yes directly adopt 3 now do minus 9 
,,not possible so do they were subtraction that is 9 minus 2 so what is it 7 but with a bar on it so what is also no you are going to get 73 the bar before number is how much 73 subtract so bar before number we will reduce by 1 so 73 becomes 72 now so bar number 7 so what is the compliment 3 so what is your answer 723 so like that we can do double digit - sorry triple is it - double is it now we are going to discuss triple digit - triple digit now coming to triple is it - triple digit the same way we can go through suppose 4 3 6 - 2 1 8 I want to subtract this one for 36 - 280 so start from left what is 4 - 2 - drop it as it is 3 - 1 directly you can do 
,,- now 6 minus 8 it is not possible so we'll go reverse 8 - 6 2 with a bar on it now I want to convert the Queen column number into the normal number so how we will convert in the same way just like we did the bar before number but before number is how much 22 so reduce 22 by 1 how much it will become 21 now what is the complement of to 8 so what is our answer 218 1 for example 7 49 - 283 so 7 minus 2 5 okay 4 minus 8 not possible so do 8 minus 4 that will be 4 by reverse subtraction so 9 minus 3 Lincoln 9 6 if the subtraction is possible we will write directly the subtraction is not possible then only we will go for the river subtraction and we are going to write down with a bar on it that is nothing but we in column now 5 4 1 6 now you tell me so 5 you can okay the bar before number will become reduced by 1 and this is the compliment 6 & 6 as is so what is our answer for 66 same way suppose 534 - 238 okay 5 minus 2 3 but 3 only 3 minus 3 will be 0 no problem so 4 minus 8 not possible so 8 minus 4 is 4 bar so we got 3 0 4 bar right now anyway bar before number is 30 register by 1 how much will come 29 so for complement is 6 so it is our 
,,answer tow 96 758 minus 254 so 7 minus 2 5 will be fine 5 minus 5 0 8 minus 4 for DirecTV Gorgons Phi 0 4 so like this we can do triple - triple next we will see any the number minus any number or any digit number - any digit number even the ten digits or entities it does not matter to us ok now we are going to see any digits supplier - any digit so what tell me the number you take it is not matter to me how many digits it is it doesn't matter to me you can subtract any big number - any big number and we can get the answer okay in an easy and very interesting manner right Jesse will say something because of a randomly I didn't remember the humidity's also so five two three four one six seven two eight five so I have taken some 10 digit number like this in the same way - 2 3 8 9 okay one seven two one three nine so I want to subtract okay this problem I want to subtract the this number from this number right so you may think so if you do in the normal conventional way it will 
,,take a lot of time and you're going to get a strain a lot why because every time you have to check whether it didn't go or not if it is not going we have to borrow from the next number so we are we have to approve the numbers we have to go over that one okay so it will take a lot of strain to you but here we are simply going to 
,,do the subtraction within a single line like this see okay so start from the left in the same way we just wait we did five minutes - there will be three here - and is Reno so 3 minus 2 1 bar here Phi bar here Phi bar here 0 and the year 1 bar ok 7 minus 2 5 ok and 2 minus 1 1 8 minus 3 5 5 - ok famous in Napa so 9 minus 5 for body so this is the number which we caught with the win column bars on them now we have to convert fastly these numbers okay how no see here just like we did and yeah 
,,if you see a 0 came between two wing column numbers it just like we discuss in the bond discussion in the concepts basic concepts whenever 0 comes in between two not two non zero wing column digits okay the wing column is applied to 0 also so you have to remember this one whenever zero computing to win column numbers okay so further geno also winkler will be applied okay now so this is the number which we got now see see because this complete number are going to have the boss on them so just like in the same way the bar before number is how much three so that should be registered by one two now the numbers are continuously having the powers on them so 
,,apply our from line loss from pen so all showing it nine one eight - five four - five four - zero nine but lastly ten minus one so nine next five one five four bar anyhow so the bar before number is how much five one five so this should be registered by one so Phi one Phi becomes Phi 1 4 okay and for bar its complement is so your answer is how much - a double four double nine 504 six so like this in an easy way we can do the subtractions so thank you now we will see the next way of subtraction okay which is which we call it as match and mismatch method okay

Operations of While number,k6G-MBQQ_co,today let us learn rounding numbers in many instances exact numbers are not necessary or even desirable at such times approximations are given this is when rounding 
,,a number helps us let us look at an example to understand it in a better way 19600 18 students from Delhi attended a football coaching camp while 17300 students from Mumbai attended the camp now here we can round these figures to the nearest thousand and see twenty thousand students from Delhi attended the camp while seventeen thousand students from Mumbai attended the camp we round up numbers to get the estimated length expenses distance etc and even to find the estimated sum difference product and quotient first let me teach you rounding numbers to the nearest thousand look at the given number to round this number to the nearest thousand we need to follow two simple steps step one look at the digit to the right of the thousands place if this digit is five or more than five then add one to the digit in the thousands place here the digit is 7 which we know is greater than five therefore eight changes to nine step to change all the digits to the right of the thousands place to zero so the rounded up number is four lakh thirty-nine thousand now let us look at another example round 35 lack 30 1461 to the nearest thousand first look at the digit to the right of the thousands place which is four here now as for is smaller than five we leave the digit in the thousands place as it is therefore one remains 
,,as one itself next change all the digits to the right of the thousands place to zero yes we got the answer 35 lakh thirty one thousand now let us see rounding a number to any given place we can round a number to any given place that is tens hundredths ten thousands and so on by following the same steps as mentioned for the thousands place let us take 14 lakh fifty four thousand six hundred fifty-eight and then round this number to different given places let us start with the tenth place here the digit to the right of five is eight which is greater than five so we add one to five change all the digits to the right of the tens place to zero so the rounded up number is 14 lakh fifty four thousand six hundred sixty next is the hundredths place here the digit to the right of six is five as the rule is that if the digit is 5 or more than 5 we have to add 1 to the digit in the place being rounded up hence we add 1 to 6 change all the digits to the right of the hundredths place to 0 
,,"so the rounded up number is 14 lakh 50 4,700 when the number is rounded to the nearest thousand we get 14 lakh 55,000 when the number is rounded to the nearest 10,000 we get 14 lakh 50,000 when the number is rounded to the nearest lakh we get 15 lakh and finally when it is rounded to the nearest 10 lakh we get 10 lakh so kids remember these two points and it would be easy for you to get the estimated values if the digit to the right of the given place is 5 or more than 5 then add 1 to the digit in the given place and if the digit is less than five leave the digit in the given place as it is"

Operations of While number,SX2NE0haQls,oh there's nothing to be embarrassed about it's just a fart or you just pass the gas what it's surely very funny come back kitty we won't make fun of you anymore hey friends I'm sure lot of us must have faced such moments when we passed gas in front of others but the fact is we all fought some are silent some allowed whereas some are as noisy as an atomic bomb so today let us enter into the stinky Winky world of gas and try to answer the awkward question why do we  you n so what is a fart flat as we popularly know is also known as blackulas it is intestinal gas that we pass every day almost 10 to 20 times to be more specific but where does this gas come from well there are multiple sources of it a tiny proportion comes from solving air while we are sleeping whereas some portion enters our body while eating yes when we eat we are not only consuming food but also giving the gas like nitrogen and oxygen a free pass to enter our body and into our stomach these gases then build up over there and ultimately have to find a way to get out so some of them go upward and comes out in the form of a bird whereas the mischievous ones go down and come 
,,out in the form of all four but the most stinky question is why does the fart smell so bad well blame the bacterias for that our intestines are home to trillions of 
,,bacteria living without giving any rent but we are essentially as they help us to break down our food this process releases gases such as nitrogen carbon dioxide hydrogen and methane but all of them are odorless so who is the real culprit for making us suffocate well it's the sulfur compounds such as hydrogen sulfide methane ATL and ammonia that gives the gas that infamous stinky smell but why are some silent and some loud well it all depends upon how relaxed your muscles are in a relaxed condition you are most likely to pass the silent fart that often stinks pretty badly but it also saves you from the embarrassment as you blame the neighbor or the fart attack but at time when you try to hold the gas for a long time the gas builds up and the sudden shooting causes vibration that makes it sound really loud which usually do not smell as bad as the silent one but unfortunately could not save you from the moment of embarrassment so what do you have to do to be less forty and stinky well one way is to try cutting down on foods like beans onions and fried foods as these items release massive amounts of gas during the process of breaking down the food and if you find yourself farting more than usual after you eat ice cream yogurt only it is small likely that your body may have a difficult time digesting the natural sugar called lactose which is found in dairy foods so it's better to talk to your parents and doctor about it and don't forget that farting can sometimes be a body sight that it's time to take a trip to the bathroom it's trivia time did you know the word fart was coined in the year 1632 and comes from the old english word futures meaning to break wind also did you know that the most prolific quarters in the animal kingdom are termites yes you too are heavy tired of wood termites eject ungodly volumes of gas it is estimated that they are responsible for 11 percent of global methane emissions that's more than every car on the planet the second 
,,spot goes to camels and zebras stand proudly on the third spot it's question time today's question is in which ear was the word fart coined to write your answer in the comment section below and hit the like and subscribe button if you haven't yet to be a part of the peekaboo kids youtube you'll see family and get a chance to get it featured by the end of our videos so here are the winners of the previous episode hope you enjoyed today's episode and remember even though a fart is a normal natural phenomenon it's not polite to fart in social settings like in a class or at the dinner table but don't worry if this happens accidentally just remember to say

Operations of While number,XqF0Z7n1KEM,they let's go shopping with Miss Honey she will also explain us the unitary method while shopping hello kids in problems related to unitary method the cost of many things would be given we have to find the cost of many more or less things for doing this we first go from many to one and then from one to many which we have already learnt so let's begin shopping and learning together I have to buy some books there are 8 books here these 8 books cost 80 rupees but I need only 5 books so let's find out what will be the cost of 5 books first let's see what information we have there are 8 books 8 books cost 80 rupees now let us see what we have to find out what will be the cost of 5 books so here we first need to find out the value of 1 book now to get the value of 1 book we have to divide the total value of books with the total number of books so here we divide 80 by 8 to get the cost of one book we know 10 into 8 is equal to 80 so we will write 10 the quotient now right eighty below the dividend here let's subtract 80 from the dividend we get zero as the remainder therefore cost of one book is equal to rupees eighty divided by eight is equal 
,,to ten rupees now to find out the cost of five books we multiplied the cost of one book into number of books therefore cost of five books is equal to rupees 10 into 
,,5 which is equal to rupees fifty we cut the answer cost of five books is rupees fifty yippee let me pay for the books now let's buy some pencil boxes look six pencil boxes cost rupees seven hundred and eighty what will be the cost of four pencil boxes so here we need to first find out the value of one pencil box we divide seven 
,,hundred and eighty by six to get the cost of one pencil box we start with comparing the digit in the hundreds place that is seven with the divisor that is six as 7 is greater than six we can divide 7 by 6 here we use the table of six such that the product is equal to or dan and nearest to seven so the nearest product is six hence we write one above the seven as we know one into six is equal to six write the number six in the hundreds column under seven subtract six from seven the remainder 
,,one is written in the hundreds column now bring down the next digit that is eight and write it beside one here eighteen is greater than six so we can divide 18 by six now find the nearest product to 18 we know three into six is equal to 18 we write three above the eight and the number 18 under 18 now subtract 18 from 18 which equals 0 which is the remainder write zero in the tens column now bring down zero from the ones column we know that any number multiplied by zero gives zero as the product so write zero above zero and zero minus zero is equal to zero thus we get the quotient as 130 so here we come to know that the cost of one pencil box is 130 rupees now to find the cost of four pencil boxes we multiply the cost of one pencil box into the number of pencil boxes so here we would be multiplying 130 by 4 0 into 
,,4 is equal to 0 3 into 4 is equal to 12 we carry 1 10 above 1 in the hundreds column and write 2 in the tens column now 1 into 4 is equal to 4 so 1 plus 4 is equal to 5 which we write in the hundreds column thus here we get the answer as 520 therefore the cost of 4 pencil boxes is rupees 520 let's buy them it was great fun shopping and learning something new

Operations of While number,0IZyGB1qQmM,today let us revise factors and multiples let us start with factors what do we mean by a factor a factor of a number divides that number exactly let us look at an example find the factors of 58 the first pair is 1 into 50 8 is equal to 58 here when we divide 58 by 1 we get the quotient as 58 and when we divide 58 by 58 we get the quotient as 1 in both the cases the remainder is 0 thus it means that 58 is divisible by 1 and 58 the second pair of numbers which gives the product 58 is 2 into 29 thus the factors of 58 are 1 to 29 and 58 let us solve one more example find the factors of 81 the pairs of numbers which give the product a t1r1 into 81 is equal 
,,to 81 3 into 27 is equal to 81 9 into 9 is equal to 81 thus the factors of 81 are 1 3 9 27 and 81 as each of these number divides 81 exactly did you notice we counted the repeated factor only once remember every number has 1 as a factor every number is a factor of itself thus every number except one has at least two factors one 
,,and the number itself the factor of a number is always equal to or less than the number now let us look at multiples a multiple of a number is the product obtained when the number is multiplied by the same or any other number let us find the multiples of 12 it is easy when we multiply 12 by zero one two three four five six seven eight nine ten and so on we get 0 12 24 36 48 60 70 to 80 for 96 108 120 and so on as the products so here the products obtained are nothing else but the multiples 
,,of 12 let us look at another example find the multiples of 19 when we multiply 19 by 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and so on we get 0 1938 5770 695 114 133 152 171 190 and 
,,so on thus the multiples of 19 are 0 1938 5770 695 114 133 152 171 190 and so on remember a number is a multiple of itself every number is a multiple of one every multiple of a given number is equal to or greater than the number itself every number has an infinite number of multiples zero is a multiple of every number but zero is not a factor of any number except zero revising factors and multiples was fun you

,,subtract don't worry sorry I'll teach you how whoa these cupcakes look awesome sorry what is it are you hungry come on don't be shy have one in one bite you're never full sorry do you know you've just done a subtraction without realizing it we subtract to know how many things we have left after taking away some of them just like you did with these cupcakes for example before there were three cupcakes on the table and you've eaten one so if we take one away from three there will be one and two cupcakes left three minus one equals two well done we have done our first subtraction see how easy it was yum yum these cupcakes are mouth-watering okay sorry you've subtracted again without realizing how many are there left this time there were five cupcakes and you've eaten three so if we take away three from five there will be one and two cupcakes left two five minus three equals two awesome are you still hungry there's nothing we can do with you sorry is there on the table there were seven cupcakes and you've eaten four of them if we take away four from seven one two three and four the result is one two and three three seven minus four equals three good job sorry do you like subtracting I told you sorry there were too many cupcakes well let's recap the subtractions we practiced today all right we can also do horizontal subtractions it's done in the same way pay attention three minus one equals one and two three minus one equals two awesome let's do the next one if I take away the three cupcakes from these five cupcakes one two and three I will be left with one and two cupcakes five minus three equals two excellent sorry shall we try the last one if I take away the four cupcakes from these seven cupcakes one two three and four I will be left with one two and three seven minus four equals three well done sorry now you know how to subtract are you feeling better sorry my mind there's nothing we can do with you sorry hi everyone this theme park is just awesome are you having a good time oopsie your balloon just bursted shall we go get you another one what are you playing you've got perfect aim that's a great way to learn how to do subtractions would you like to practice for a while let's find out how good my aim is there are 1 2 & 3 balloons and I'm going to see if I can burst one 
,,of them the subtraction we need to do is 3 minus 1 this means there are three balloons and I have to burst 1 I'm going to aim well to see how many I'll have left fantastic I aimed well let's see how many there are now one and two there are two balloons slap the result of subtracting three from one equals two my aim is truly good some balloons are flying away there are one two three and four balloons and I'm going to try to aim at two of them how many balloons will there be left we need to subtract four minus two this means that out of four balloons we need to take away two I'm going to aim well to see how many I'll have left 1 & 2 yes let's see how many balloons we've got left 1 & 2 there are 2 balloons left the result of subtracting 4 from 2 is 2 I'm so good at shooting the slingshot you've let more balloons fly 
,,away there are 1 2 3 4 & 5 balloons how many will there be left if I aim at two of them the subtraction we need to do is 5 minus 2 I'll aim at 2 out of 5 balloons what will the result be 1 & 2 amazing let's see how many we've got left 1 2 & 3 we've got 3 balloons left the result of subtracting 5 from 2 is 3 I love playing with my slingshot you've led more balloons fly away there are 1 2 3 4 5 & 6 balloons how many will there be if I aim at 3 of them the subtraction we need to do is 6 minus 
,,3 out of 6 balloons I'll aim at 3 what will the result be 1 2 & 3 yes let's see how many I've got left 1 2 & 3 there are 3 balloons left 6 minus 3 equals 3 doing subtractions is great fun you've led more balloons fly away there are 1 2 3 4 5 & 6 balloons how many will there be if I aim at 4 of them the subtraction we need to do 
,,is 6 minus 4 out of 6 balloons I'll aim at 4 what will the result be one two three and four swell let's see how many we've got left we've got one and two balloons left six minus four equals two I love doing subtractions you've run out of balloons friends well at least you've learned how to do subtractions and you still have all

Operations of While number,CqrYYiffPr0,good morning students today let us study the rules of divisibility these rules will help us determine whether a number is divisible by another number without actually carrying out the division process let us have a look at different divisibility tests divisibility by two if the number is even that is it ends in two four six eight or zero we say that the given number is divisible by two for example 26 ends in 6 thus it is divisible by 2 divisibility by 3 if the sum of the digits of the number is divisible by three we say that the given number is divisible by three for example look at the number 384 when we add up all the digits that is three plus eight 
,,plus four we get the sum as fifteen we know that 15 is divisible by three thus we conclude that 384 is divisible by three divisibility by 4 if the number formed by the last two digits of the given number is divisible by four we see that the given number is divisible by four for example look at the number 164 its last two digits 
,,"form the number 64 which is divisible by 4 thus the whole number 164 is divisible by 4 divisibility by 5 if the number ends in 5 or 0 we say that the given number is divisible by 5 for example 525 ends in 5 thus it is divisible by 5 look at this another example 330 ends in 0 hence it is also divisible by 5 divisibility by 6 if the number is divisible by both 2 and 3 we see that the given number is divisible by 6 for example look at the number 408 is it divisible by 2 the number ends in 8 thus it is divisible by 2 is it divisible by 3 4 plus 0 plus 8 is equal to 12 which is divisible by 3 which makes the number 408 divisible by 3 as well hence 408 is divisible by 6 divisibility by 8 if the number formed by the last three digits of the given number is divisible by 8 we see that the given number is divisible by 8 for example look at the number 50 3888 its last three digits form the number 8 on eighty-eight which is divisible by 8 thus 53,000 888 is divisible by 8 divisibility by nine if the sum of the digits of the number is divisible by nine we see that the given number is divisible by nine for example look at the number seven lakh twenty "
,,nine thousand six hundred thirty-nine here on adding the digits seven two nine six three and nine we get the sum as 36 which is divisible by nine thus seven lakh twenty nine thousand six hundred thirty-nine is also divisible by nine finally let us look at divisibility by ten if the number ends in a zero we say that the given number is divisible by ten for example 8620 ends in zero thus it is divisible by ten kids now it is time for you to remember all these divisibility tests and find out the answer

Operations of While number,CdTUq5TTDEo,hello children today i'm here to teach you chapter 3 in your textbook that's operations on whole numbers in this lesson we are only considering whole numbers write down the four mathematical operations you know what are the basic four operations that you know addition subtraction multiplication and division so those are the four basic mathematical operations that you know now take a look at this one so same whole number with four different mathematical symbols operations 8 plus 4 we are adding 8 minus 4 means subtracting you get 4 8 times 4 multiplied by 4 you get 32 and here 8 divided by 4 you get 2. appearing above is how the four mathematical operations of addition subtraction multiplication and division are used only once look at this one you get three whole numbers so we'll add these two first three plus two 
,,you get five then add seven to that five plus seven twelve now we'll take the last two first and then edit 2 plus 7 what you get 9 3 plus 9 you get the same answer so no difference in the answer is experience even either 3 and 2 are first added or 2 and 7 added first so in addition order is not important simplify each expression appearing below and get the answer so here two plus eight ten ten plus seven seventy now we'll do the other way round eight plus seven first 15 and 15 plus 2 17. you get the same answer 5 plus 7 first that's 12. 12 plus 3 you get 15. now we'll take 7 plus 3 first that's 10 5 plus 10 that's 15. you get the same one we'll do first one 8 plus 2 you get 10 here 10 plus 7 you get 17. now the last two first 2 plus 7 you get 9. 8 plus 9 you get 70. so order is not important in addition 6 plus 4 10 10 plus 5 you get 15. now do the next one other way around 4 plus 5 first that's 9 6 plus 9 you get 15. first two numbers first 9 plus 3 12 12 plus 4 16. last two 
,,first 3 plus 4 7 9 plus 7 you get the same 16. 12 plus 4 16 plus 3 you get 90. 4 plus 3 7 7 plus 12 you get 90. here also we see order is not important in addition eleven plus nine you get twenty twenty plus eight twenty eight last two first eight plus nine seventeen seventeen plus eleven you get twenty eight fifteen plus four you get ninety nineteen plus three 20 2 4 plus 3 7 7 plus 15 you get the same answer 22 6 plus 6 12 12 plus six you get eighteen here six plus six twelve six plus twelve again eighty seven plus zero 7 7 plus 3 you get 10 here when you add the last 2 0 plus 3 3 7 plus 3 again you get 10 same answer write the answer of the expressions with only the addition at once so we found out you can either add from the left side or any two first and then add the other number so we'll add from left to right 6 plus 3 9 9 plus 8 17 2 plus 9 eleven plus five sixteen six plus four ten ten plus three thirty seven plus seven fourteen fourteen plus seven 21 8 plus 2 10 10 plus 4 14 3 plus 7 10 10 plus 2 12 7 plus 4 11 11 plus 3 14 9 plus 9 18 18 plus 9 20 7 six plus eight fourteen fourteen plus eight what's fourteen plus eight twenty two four plus four eight eight plus zero that's it now we'll look at this one this is multiplication first we'll multiply the first two three times two you get six then six with four you get twenty four now we'll do the last two numbers multiplication two times four eight three times eight you get the same answer as addition so when there is only the multiplication both above method give the same answer so order of operation is not important in multiplication as well get the answer by multiplying each of the following expressions two times three six six times four you get 24. now we'll do last two first three into four twelve two times twelve you get the same answer five times two ten ten times three thirty then last two three times two six five times six you get the same answer this one seven times two fourteen fourteen times two you get 28 2 times 2 4 7 times 4 you get 28 as well look at this one 8 times 3 24 24 times 4 what you get 4 times 4 16 1 remaining 4 times 2 8 plus 
,,1 9 here 3 times 4 12. eight times twelve eight times two sixteen one remaining eight times one eight plus one nine so you get the same answer ninety six this one first two numbers six times two twelve twelve times two you get twenty four now last two first two times two four here six times four twenty-four seven times three twenty-one twenty-one times three you get sixty three three times three nine times 9 you get 63 as well so here what we can see for multiplication is also odd is not important eleven times three thirty-three thirty-three times two you get sixty six three times two six here eleven eleven times six also you get sixty-six six times five thirty thirty times three you get ninety and here five times three fifteen six times fifty multiply separately 6 times 5 30 3 remaining 6 times 1 6 plus 3 9. so 90 find the answer of the expressions with only multiplication now odd is not important so we'll start from left 2 times 2 4 4 times 3 12 7 times 2 14 14 times 2 20 8. 5 times 3 15 15 times 2 you get 30. 8 times 1 8 8 times three twenty-four eleven times two twenty-two twenty-two times three you get sixty six eight times one eight eight times two sixteen nine times two eighteen eighteen times three three times eight twenty-four two remaining three times one three plus two five four times four sixteen sixteen times one that's sixteen eleven times one eleven eleven times two 22 2 x 1 2 2 x 11 22 the answers of expression with either addition or multiplication do not change however they are simplified so order is not important now the combination of addition and multiplication look at this one 3 plus two when you add 
,,it you get five then five times five you get 25 here if you do last two first two times five ten and three plus ten thirteen now what happens answers are not the same so what's the mistake there shall not be two answers when the same expression is simplified the above expression consists of the mathematical operations plus and multiplication so what's the correct way of doing when you get addition and multiplication at once here plus has been used first and multiplication did however multiplication should be done first according to the stand so remember that even though when you start from left you get plus sign you can't do plus first you have to first do multiplication and then do addition so what's the correct way of doing so this is actually wrong and here this one is correct because first multiplication and then consider addition so here what's the multiplication here 3 times 2 6 and then add 5 to that you get 11. so that's the correct way of adding and multiplying at once simplify the following expressions use only additional subtraction now now some questions addition sum with subtraction so what you do so we can add these two 10 
,,plus 2 you get 12 12 plus 5 70. what can you do here you can do subtraction and see 7 minus 4 you get 3 3 plus 5 so here three three plus five you get eight six plus four ten ten minus three you get seven eight plus 7 15 15 minus 5 you get 10 9 plus 11 that's 20 20 minus 3 17. seven minus three four four plus nine thirteen this 
,,one eight minus six you get two two plus two four six minus five one one plus nine ten three plus seven ten ten minus eight you get two 6 minus 5 1 1 plus 9 10. parts only with division and multiplication should be simplified from left to right as the first step and then the paths only with addition subtraction should be simplified from left to right so it's easy to follow from left to right so when you get an expression with combination of operations you first check what's the first symbol if it is multiplication or division you have to do that first compared to addition and subtraction simplify the following expressions used only multiplication and division now we start from left 24 divided by 4 6 six times three eighteen twenty-four times two forty-eight forty-eight divided by three three times one three for eighteen that's 6. now left to right first multiplication 9 times 2 18. 18 divided by 6 that's 3. 10 times 550 50 divided by 25 how many 25s are there for 50 you get 2. now the division first 9 divided by three that's three three times eight twenty-four twenty-two divided by eleven you get two two times seven fourteen 24 times 2 48 48 divided by 16 that's 3 next one 33 multiplied by 2 66 divide by 11 you get 6 there starting from left 15 divided by 5 that's 3. 3 times 3 9 16 divided by 4 you 
,,get 4 4 times 2 8. simplify from left to right even when mathematical operation subtraction or division is applied twice so always start from left what we can do 12 
,,minus 5 that's 7. so 1 minus 3 4. starting from left 18 minus 7 you get 11 11 minus 6 5. look at this one starting from left 48 divided by 6 you get eight eight divide by two that's four eighty divided by ten is eight eight divided by four you get two simplify the following expressions now we'll do starting from left seven minus three four four plus four you get eight eight minus two six 6 plus 6 12 9 plus 5 14 14 minus 2 you get 12 11 plus three fourteen fourteen minus seven answer is seven eleven minus three four four minus three you get 1 15 minus 3 that's 12 12 minus 2 that's 10. 12 plus 8 20. 20 minus fifteen answer is five twenty three minus twenty that's three three plus seven answer is ten simplify the following expressions so start from left 40 divided by 10 that's 4. 4 times 2 you get 8. 80 divided by 8 
,,that's ten ten times three you get thirty fifty times two hundred hundred divided by twenty five how many twenty fives four hundred you get 4 40 times 2 80. 80 divided by 16. you get 5. 5 times 6 30 3 remaining 5 times 1 5 plus 3 you get 80. this one 9 times 2 18. 18 divided by 6 get 3 24 divided by 3 you get 8 8 times 4 32 21 divided by 3 you get 7 7 divided by 7 answer is 1. 32 divided by 2 16 16 divide by 8 you get 2. so when you get any operation start from left this one 15 times 2 30. 
,,30 divided by 10 you get 3 21 times 2 42 42 divided by 7 you get 6 here simplify the following expressions start from left 15 divided by 5 and also remember multiplication of division comes you have to do that one first compared to addition or subtraction so division comes first 15 divided by 5 that's 3 3 minus 3 0 division first 20 divided by 2 10 10 minus 8 you get 2 division first here also 32 divided by 8 is 4 4 minus 3 answer is 1. 24 divided by 12 is 2 2 minus 2 answers 0. now this one don't do 50 minus 8 that's you have to multiply first 8 times 2 16 now subtraction 50 minus 16 so you get 4 here 10 so 2 remaining so 2 there so 3 is the answer 34 which one we need to do first division first 16 divided by 2 8 20 minus 8 you get 12. now division first not the subtraction 10 divided by 10 is 1 40 minus 1 that's 39 this one first division 24 divided by 8 is 3 3 minus 2 that's 1. which one first the division so 8 divided by 2 4 then you do the addition from left to right 5 plus 4 9 9 plus 3 12 this one the division first 15 divided by 5 is 3 then 30 plus 3 33 33 plus 3 36 write correct mark for true expressions and wrong mark for false 
,,expressions now subtraction addition there's no order 8 minus four four four plus three seven that's correct this one division first nine divided by three three three plus one you are getting 4 not 10. this one multiplication first 16 times 8 8 times 6 48 4 remaining 8 times 1 8 plus 4 12 128 minus 10 that's the answer 118 but the answer is given 38 that's wrong division first here fifteen divided by five that's three three plus four seven this is wrong which one first you have to do division first 8 divided by 16 when you write like this you get 8 times 1 8 times 2 half 24 plus half or 24.5 this one you can write in decimal 0.5 so you are not getting 
,,2 that's wrong this one you can start from left to right 6 times 9 54. 54 divided by 3 you get 1 there 3 times 1 3 for 24 that's 8 so this is correct 32 divided by eight you do this one first four four divide by four you get one that's also correct this one that's addition and subtraction you can start from left 23 minus 5 you get 18. 18 plus 7. 25 but 11 is given that's wrong you have to do division first 4 divided by 2 that's 2 then 20 plus 2 22 that's correct 4 times 2 8 8 plus 8 16. here you can start from left 6 plus 6 12 12 minus 4 8 that's also correct multiplication first 9 times 9 81 81 minus 40. you get 41 that's correct 20 divided by 4 you get 5. 5 divided by 20 you are getting one over four not four so that's wrong nine divided by three is three three divide by three that's one this answer is wrong 25 
,,times 2 50 50 minus 40 that's 10. that one is correct simplify the following expressions multiplication first 20 times 240 40 plus 7 47 division first here 14 divided by 2 is 7 7 times 3 21. here multiplication 300 plus 7 three hundred and seven we'll do multiplication first eight times fifty four hundred four hundred divided by hundred answer is 4 division first 900 divided by 100 you get 9 9 plus 5 14. this one division first 24 divided by 24 is 1 1 plus 9 you get 10. starting from left 8 divided by 8 is 1 1 divided by 1 the answer is 1 this is addition subtraction you can start from left 7 plus 0 7 7 minus 5 you get 2. this one division first 23 plus 2 divided by 2 is 1. so you get 24 there's one division first 35 divided by seven that's five five minus five that's zero multiplication first 4 times 2 that's 8 32 plus 8 answer is 40. addition subtraction odd is not important 12 plus 3 15 15 minus 7 answer is 8. simplify which one we need to do first multiplication three there two times eight sixteen now now you can edit three plus sixteen eighteen three plus sixteen that's nineteen nineteen plus five 20 4 this one you have to do division first 25 divided by 5 you get 5. 5 plus 3 minus 2. so 5 plus 3 8 8 minus 2 6. this one starting from left multiplication first 8 times 4 32 32 plus 3 and minus 30. 32 plus 3 35 35 minus 30 you get 5. this one addition and subtraction there's no order 7 minus 2 5 5 plus 10 minus 3 15 minus 3 you get 12. this one starting from 
,,left multiplication you can do 8 times 2 16. now division 16 divided by 4 that's 4 4 minus 1 you get 3 starting from left 56 divided by 7 that's 8 8 now divide by 8 
,,what's 8 divided by 8 1 now addition 1 plus 5 answer is 6 starting from left we can do multiplication 9 times 7 63 then we can do division so what's the division here 63 divided by 21 that's 3. so 3 plus 5 you get eight starting from left again 24 divided by eight that's three three plus seven minus one so what's three plus seven ten ten minus one is nine we'll do this one first 81 divided by nine that's nine now we'll look at divisions 9 divided by 3 you get 3 3 plus 5 answer is 8. now we'll see when you get brackets how you do the operations look at this one 2 plus 7 add 2 and 7 that's 9. now if you want to subtract 9 from 12 so what's the answer 12 
,,minus 9 you get 3. so this can be written as can write 2 plus 7 add it and subtract from 12. so 12 minus this so here we have written like that 12 minus 2 plus 7. when you get brackets what you do 2 plus 7 that's 9 12 minus 9. so what's the answer you get 3. now do these questions so what you have to do when you get brackets simplify inside the brackets first so 30 divided by 7 plus 3 you get 10. now do the division 30 divide by 10 you get 3. this one 20 plus 4 what's 20 plus 4 24 24 divided by 6 what's the answer you get 4. now this bracket first 28 plus 2 30 12 plus 3 you get 15. now you can divide 30 divided by 15 you get 2 here also two brackets you have to simplify separately these two brackets nine plus seven sixteen eight into one multiply by one you get eight now 16 divided by 8 you get 2. this one brackets first 4 plus 3 7 21 divided by 7 you get 3 here in this one this bracket first 12 minus 5 you get 7 7 divided by 7 that's 1. now look at this one brackets first so you take this one first five plus two seven now you can write the question again nine times three minus seven then what you do you have to do the multiplication first starting from left you get multiplication so 9 times 3 27 27 minus 7 you get 20. look at this one brackets first three times five fifteen so you write two plus fifteen plus three addition here you can do from left to right 2 plus 15 17 17 plus 3 20. this one brackets first 12 plus 2 14. 5 times 14 divided by 10 so you can start from left multiplication comes so you have to do that 5 times 4 20 2 remaining 5 times 1 5 plus 2 7 so 70 divided by 10 you get 7 this one 3 times 4 that's 12. 20 minus 12 plus 7. now start from left 20 minus 12 that's 8. 8 plus 7 you get 15. look at this one brackets first 12 divided by 6 you get 2. now what's the next step 
,,multiplication three times two six eight plus six minus five eight plus six fourteen fourteen minus five you get 9 this one brackets first so what you do 10 plus 7 multiplied by 4 minus 2 you get 2 and this is multiplication 3 plus 4. what's the next one you need to start from left and c multiplication is there 10 plus 7 times 2 14 into 3 plus 4 again from left you get this multiplication 10 plus 3 times 4 12 1 remaining 3 times 1 3 plus 1 4 plus 4 what you get 10 plus 42 you get 52 52 plus 4 56 this one first brackets 7 minus 2 plus 5 times 6 30 30 plus 4. now you can do starting from left or any order so i'll start from left 7 minus 2 5 5 30 35 35 plus 4 3 9 this one brackets first 8 times 2 60. this brackets these two brackets next 24 divided by 3 8 30 divided by 15 you get 2. now you can do addition and subtraction 16 plus 8 24 24 minus 2 you get 20 2 this one these three brackets first 12 divided by 3 that's 4. 24 divided by 3 8 30 divided by 15 that's 2 addition and subtraction so 8 plus 4 12 12 minus 2 you get 10 this one brackets first these two we can do 12 minus 3 9 3 minus 1 2 now starting from left 9 times 2 18 18 divide by 9 you get 2. this question we can do brackets first three hundred minus twelve times eight sixteen one remaining eight times one eight plus one ninety six twelve times five you get hundred now what we do we can do this subtraction 300 minus 96 what's that when you subtract you get 200 so 204 minus 100 you get 104. so the answer is 104. this one this bracket first 24 plus 3 27 now division first 27 divided by 9 you get 3 3 plus 5 that's 8. now worded problem there are six boxes of eggs with 12 eggs in each equally distribute them all among eight housewives how much eggs would one housewife get so how many eggs in six boxes twelve times six and then number of eggs one would get so how many housewives are there eight so this is equally divided so you can divide this by eight so we'll do first one six times two 12 1 remaining 6 times 1 6 plus 1 7 now 72 you have to do divide equally by 8 housewives so 72 divided by 8. you get 9 so how many eggs one would get 9 eggs this question 18 out of 90 oranges bought by a merchant was rotten when the remaining good ones are distributed among 12 persons how much oranges would one person get total how many oranges brought 90 oranges all together how many rotten oranges are there 18 are rotten balance of good oranges so you have to subtract 19 minus 80. what's the value 2 here 10 1 is there so 2 plus 7 that's 90. so 72 then what we have to do we have to divide this equally with 12 persons so number of oranges one would get you take the total good ones divide by 12 persons so 72 divided by 12 you get 6. so 6 oranges one would get so we can write the same question at once how can we write we can write 20 minus 18 inside brackets and then divide this by 12. look at this question 400 rupees for the first 15 words and 20 rupees for each excessive word is charged for publishing a newspaper advertisement find how much would be charged for a newspaper advertisement containing 23 words so excessive number of words after the first 50 all together how many words are there 23 first 15 that's a different charge so we have to subtract 15 to get the excessive number of words so what's the value 23 minus 15 you get 8 here so 8 23 minus 15 is 8. price for extra 8 words so what's the charge 20 rupees for each excessive word so 8 times 20. that's 100 60 rupees first charge first 15 words the charge is 400 so what's the total so you have to add 400 plus 160 what's the total you get 560 rupees for an advertisement with 23 words look at this one 12 rupees for the first minute and 8 rupees for every next minute is charged for international direct dialing calls taken to a foreign country find out the total cost of a call of 12 minutes taken to that country so what's the extra number of minutes spent so all together 12 minutes extra is first minute that's 12. so 12 minutes minus 1 so 11 more minutes so this is minutes 11 minutes are there then what's the total amount payable first minute is 12 then 8 rupees for next minute is charge every one minute you need eight rupees so all together this is eight times eleven eighty eight plus twelve so what's the total amount payable 100 rupees for this call 8 plus 210 1 remaining 9 plus 1 so for 12 minute call the person has to pay 100 rupees write the simplifying order of whole number expressions so what is the first thing you have to do simplify inside brackets after that you look at left to right left to right then multiplication or division whatever comes first from left to right division from left to write then you can do addition and subtraction then you can do addition or subtraction whatever comes first from left to right look at this question the age of 38 boys in a grade 7 class is 12 years each two of the other two boys is 13 years old write a number expression for the total number of ages of all the 40 students and find out the total age of them so we try to write down an expression at once 38 boys in grade seven class is 12 years each so 38 into 12 and two boys with 13 years old so two boys with 30. so you have to do separately and at so 38 times 12 38 times 12 10 and 2 so you multiply by 1 and multiply by 2 you get 456 now do this multiplication 2 times 13 you get 26 now add 26 to that 400 years old the total is 482. look at this one a cyclist spends 
,,five minutes per each kilometer to cycle the first five kilometers while they spend eight minutes per each kilometer of the second five kilometers then ten minutes per each of the next five kilometers and 12 minutes per each of the final five kilometers calculate the time he would spend to cycle 17 kilometers so we'll try to write an expression at once total time spent five minutes per each kilometer to cycle the first five so first five five minutes then why we spend eight minutes per each kilometer of the second five kilometers so eight times the next five kilometers then the third one ten minutes per each of the next five ten into five now all together 50 kilometers now the last 5 kilometers that's 12 minutes but how many kilometers are there this is 5 and 5 10 10 plus 5 15 but all together 2 so you have to multiply 2 into 12 that's the last one now we can add it separately first you have to multiply 5 times 5 25 8 times 5 40. 10 times five fifty two times twelve twenty four now add all together and get five plus 4 9 4 plus 2 6 6 plus 5 11 11 plus 2 13 139 minutes so how we find out number of hours and minutes what you do you have to 
,,divide by 60 because 60 minutes per hour so you get 120 so how many minutes are there 19 minutes so 2 hours and 19 19 minutes so i can write separately 2 hours and 19 minutes now we look at example 1 in your textbook write down the operations of the expression 12 into 2 minus 5 into 3 in the order in which they appear so from left to right so first you have to do multiplication another multiplication because before subtracting numbers we have to do either division or multiplication first so another multiplication and then only you can do subtraction exercise 3.1 for each of the following numerical expressions write down the mathematical operations in the order in which they appear so this is addition you can start from left so this is adding and adding this one multiplication first and then subtraction here first 
,,division then you have to do multiplication and then subtraction fourth one starting from left you have to do multiplication then from left that's addition and subtraction this one starting from left first do division and then this division next and then finally addition exercise 3.2 simplify each of the following expressions addition so 12 plus 5. 17 17 plus 8 20 5 multiplication so you can do first two 5 times 8 40. 40 times 3 you get 120 7 plus 3 10 2 plus 6 8 10 plus 8 eighteen two times five ten four times three twelve ten times twelve you get hundred twenty odd is not important in additions only and multiplication only example number one simplify so 7 minus 4 plus 5 subtraction and addition you can start from left 7 minus 4 you get 3 3 plus 5 8. this one 80 divided by 10 into five so starting from left 80 divided by 10 that's 8 then you do multiplication 8 times 5 40. this one you can start from left to right 4 times 6 24 then you do the division 24 divided by 3 answer 
,,is 8 here 25 plus 10 minus 7 starting from left you can add first 25 plus 10 that's 35 minus 7 you get 20 8. example number 5 28 divided by 2 minus 3 division first 
,,from left to right 28 divided by 2 you get 14. 14 minus 3 that's 11. here 50 minus 10 into 3 which one we have to do first multiplication 10 times 3 30. now we can subtract 50 minus 30 that's 20. 18 into 5 minus 62 18 times 5 so here 8 times 5 you get 40 4 remaining 5 times 1 5 5 plus 4 90. so 90 minus 62. you get 8 here and 2 so 20 8 this one 50 minus 10 divide by 2. now you have to do division first 10 divided by 2 you get 5 50 minus 5 answer is 45 example number 9 5 plus 6 divided by 3 plus 2 left to right first division so 5 plus 6 divided by 3 that's 2. now you can add 5 plus 2 7 7 plus 2 9 this one simplify 2 times 12 divided by 3 multiplied by 5 first these two you get 24. now what's next from left to right 24 divided by 3 that's 8 8 times 5 answer is 40. exercise 3.3 place a tick mark next to the correct statement and wrong sign next to incorrect statement so this is subtraction addition you can do in any order 8 minus 5 3 3 plus 2 you get 5 so this is not 1 so this is wrong 12 times 3 multiplication first you get 36 36 minus 11 that's 25 that's correct this one which one we do first 18 divided by 6 that's 3 7 plus 3 you get 10. 
,,from left multiplication 30 then 30 divided by 3 you get 10 10 plus 7 17 this is wrong simplify the following expressions so what's the order when you get multiplication or division from left to right you have to do that first before addition and subtraction so 10 times 4 first 40 40 plus 17 you get 57. times 3 24 24 plus 5 29 this one division first 14 divided by 7 is 2 then multiplication 2 times 5 10 division first 12 divided by 3 is 4. 448 plus 4 you get 452 this one multiplication first seven times two hundred thousand four hundred now add hundred and eight to that you get eight zero five and one thousand five hundred and eight eight times nine seventy two seventy two minus sixty one you get 11. this multiplication first 100 minus 8 times 7 56 now subtract you get 4 here 6 plus 4 10 so 44 from left to right multiplication first 195 minus 12 times 10 120. now division 120 divided by 5 you get 5 times 2 10 for 20 that's 4. so 5 times 2 10 2 remaining so that's 24 now do the subtraction 195 minus 24 what's the subtraction 7 and 1. so you get 171 as the answer this one starting from left to right multiplication 7 plus what's 37 times 5 
,,5 times 7 35 3 remaining 5 times 3 15 plus 3 80. now you can do the addition 185 plus 7 192 now add 278 to that you get 8 plus 2 10 17 1 remaining so 470 example number one now you get brackets so what we do brackets first 12 minus 7 you get 5. so you can rewrite the question 20 divided by 5 now 20 divided by 5 is 4. here from left first brackets 10 plus 12 22. now rewrite the question 5 times 22 divide by 11 now left to right whatever comes first multiplication or division so you can multiply first 5 times 2 10 1 remaining 10 plus 1 11. so 110 divided by 11. so you get 10. example number three brackets first 10 plus 2 12. now rewrite the question 8 plus 5 times this is division 3 minus 4. now from left to right multiplication 8 plus 12 times 5 60. next from left to right division 8 plus 60 divided by 3 you get 20. now you can do addition and subtraction 8 plus 20 28 28 minus 4 you get 24. example number four the pencils in five boxes each of which contains 12 pencils are divided equally among four students write down an expression for the number of pencils a single student receives and simplify it so number of then six how do we find out what's the total five boxes each twelve pencils so all together five times twelve are equally divided among four students so i'll write other way around divide by 
,,four now left to right first multiplication twelve times five sixty sixty divide by four four times one four and for 20 that's five so each person get 15 pencils example number 5 nimal plucked 47 mangoes from a tree in his garden he kept 18 in his position and sold the rest to his neighbor at nine rupees per fruit write down an 
,,expression for the total amount of money nima learned in rupees by selling the mangoes and simplify it so total amount is this is in rupees he plucked 47 mangoes from a tree in his garden he kept 80. so what's the remaining part 47 minus 80. that one each mango for 9 rupees so multiply by 9 so that's the total amount here so what we do first brackets what's the subtraction you get 9 and 2 so 29 47 minus 18 is 29 now multiply by 9 9 times 9 81 8 remaining 9 times 2 18 18 plus 8 2 26 so 261 rupees example six the taxi fare for the first kilometer is 50 rupees it is 42 rupees for each kilometer above the first write down an expression for the amount paid 
,,by a passenger who enjoyed a ride of 12 kilometers and simplify your answer so you need to find out the amount paid first kilometer 50 rupees so 50 plus so how many 
,,kilometers extra all together 12. so you need to subtract 1 that value multiplied by 42 because after the first kilometer you have to pay 40 rupees each per kilometer so how you do this so this is in rupees first brackets so 50 12 minus 1 is 11 times 42. now multiplication second 50 plus multiply this by 11 42 times 11 10 and 1 
,,you get here 264 462. now add 50 to that you get 2 and 5 plus 6 11 1 remaining and this is 5 512 rupees exercise 3.4 simplify the following expressions so first you 
,,have to do brackets 12 plus 8 20. now subtraction 12 20 minus 15 that's 5 brackets first 35 minus add these two get 23. so subtract you get 2 here and 1. so the answer is 12. here brackets first 5. here there's no multiplication sign because there's a bracket brackets means multiply so 7 times 5 you get 35. here 27 minus 13 first so you get fourteen three times that and add hundred and eight so first multiplication three times four twelve one remaining three times one three plus one four now add hundred and eight and forty two five what hundred and fifty this one brackets first 17 minus 5 you get 12. 24 divided by 12 you get 2. this one first brackets 
,,five plus two seven now three times seven into eight you can do multiplication here three times seven twenty-one twenty-one times 8 168. 16 divided by 4 you get 4. so 31 plus 4 you get 35. 8 times 9 72 73 minus 72 you get 1. 19 times 10 190 plus 38 you get 228 again at 8 12 and 1 remaining 228 this one 30 divided by 6 you get 5 
,,475 minus 5 you get 470 an international call to a certain country cost seven rupees for the first minute and four rupees per minute thereafter write down an expression in rupees for the cost of a 10 minutes long international call simplify your expression so you need to find out the total cost cost for the call first minute that's seven rupees plus so how many extra minutes are there this is 10 minute so you have to subtract one for those number of means you need to pay four rupees each so what you do first 10 minus 9 first 10 minus 1 first that's 9 7 plus 9 into 4 then multiplication you get 9 times 4 36 36 plus 7 43 rupees for the 10 minutes call write down an expression for the number of 2 litre bottles that can be filled with a fruit drink made from eight liters of water and four liters of fruit juice so number of bottles what's the mixture eight liters of water and four liters of fruit juice that's the total number of liters but dividing into two liter bottles you have 
,,to divide this by 2 now here first do addition 12 12 divided by 2 you can get 6 bottles with 2 liters simplify the following expressions when you get an expression first start from left brackets first then multiplication or division and finally addition of subtraction so starting from here 30 divided by 10 you get 3 then 3 times 5 15 starting from left 40 times 10 400 divide by five you get 80. this one multiplication first 400 minus 200 that's 200 brackets first 10 times 3 30. 30 divided by 30 you get 1 brackets first 40 divided by 10 that's 4. now multiply 8 times 4 32 multiplication first 7 times 5 35 35 plus 3 38 division first 6 divided by 2 you get 3 three plus seven that's ten here brackets first 24 times three seventy two now divide by eight you get 9 brackets 4 times 3 12 24 divided by 12 you get 2 here now this one first brackets you get 9. now rewrite the question again then starting from left you can do multiplication 6 times 9 54. now rewrite again do division 3 
,,plus 54 divide by 3 1 and for 24 that's 8. now you can do addition and subtraction from left to right 18 plus 3 21 21 minus 7 you get 14. this one brackets first 10 
,,plus 8 this is multiplication 11 minus 3 you get 8 multiplied by 4 minus 4 from left to right then you have to do this multiplication 10 plus 8 times 8 64 times 4 minus 4 again multiplication 10 plus 4 times 4 16 1 remaining 4 times 6 24 plus 1 25 now you can do addition and subtraction 256 plus 10 266 266 minus 4 you get 262. so all these expressions first brackets then multiplication or division and finally addition or subtraction so we covered all theory in this lesson so you need to remember first perform any calculations inside brackets then perform all multiplication or division working from left to right finally perform all additions and subtractions working from left to right so practice all exercise and examples and thorough with the basic operations in whole numbers

Operations of While number,dAgfnK528RA,"Hi and welcome to Math Antics. Today were gonna talk about an important math concept called Order of Operations. Order of Operations is just a set of math rules that tell you which math operations (like addition or multiplication) to do first. Now you might be wondering (especially if youre a teenager), Why do I need RULES to tell me which operations to do first?  Cant I just do them in any order I want? Well, thats a really good questions! And to answer it, were going to give two TOTALLY different people the SAME math problem to solve. The problem is: 2 + 5  4 Hmmm I like addition better than multiplication, so Im gonna do that first! Lets "
,,"see 2 + 5 gives us 7.  And then I just multiply that 7 by the 4 and I get 28. That was easy!  But youd better not copy my answer! Uh, dont worry Im not gonna copy your answer, cuz I want the RIGHT answer! And I prefer multiplying, so Im going to do THAT first. Lets see 4  5 = 20, and THEN Ill add the 2 which gives me 22 for a final answer. What makes you think THATS the right answer?  All my calculations were correct. I even checked it with a calculator! Pfffff - the only calculator I need is right up here! And the correct answer is boop, boop, boop boop, boop. 22! Okay, so which one of these guys do you think is right?  Neither one made any mistakes with the calculations. They just did the operations in a different order and got DIFFERENT answers! Well since there were no mistakes, in a way, they were BOTH right! But math would be a VERY confusing subject if there were different answers to the same problem. And thats where Order of Operations can help us out. "
,,"The Order of Operations Rules are a way for us all to agree on the order that you should do math operations in. And if we always do operations in the same order, then well always get the same answer. So now that you know WHY we need Order of Operations rules, lets find out what those rules are. Therere basically four of them "
,,"and they go something like this: FIRST: do operation in parentheses and brackets NEXT: do exponents THEN: do multiplication and division LAST: do addition and subtraction Lets take a closer look at each one of these rules, and see some examples where they will help us. First on the list was:  do operations in parentheses and brackets. Now in case you havent seen parentheses or brackets used in math before, let me briefly explain how they work. Parentheses are just these symbols that curve forwards and backwards, and theyre used in pairs like this. And when we put numbers and operators in between them, it forms a group. Its almost like the parentheses form a package to hold whatever math stuff we put inside them. And brackets work exactly the same way as parentheses. They just have a different shape that looks "
,,"a little more boxy, but they mean exactly the same thing. So parentheses and brackets are used to group things together, and our rules tell us to do any operations inside these groups FIRST. For example, have a look at this problem: 10  (4 + 5) It has 3 numbers and 2 operations: multiplication and addition. But 2 of the numbers and the addition symbol are inside parentheses. That means that they form a group and we need to do that part of the problem first. 4 + 5 = 9, so the part inside the parentheses can just be replaced with the simplified value 9. Oh and once you do the math thats inside parentheses and get a single number like this, you usually dont need to show the parentheses anymore. Now that the parentheses are gone, we just have one operation left to do. We multiply 10  9 and that gives us 90 as our final answer. So parentheses can really help you know what part of a problem youre supposed to do first. But what if you get a problem that has more than one set of parentheses, like this:   (5 ? 3) + (6  2) Fortunately, it doesnt matter which set of parentheses you do first. You just need to do everything thats inside the "
,,"parentheses BEFORE you do anything that's NOT inside parentheses. In other words, we need to simplify BOTH of our parentheses groups before we can do this addition IN-BETWEEN them. The first group (5 ? 3) simplifies to 2, and the second group (6  2) simplifies to 12. Now we can do the last operation and add the values that we got from simplifying: 2 + 12 = 14 Okay, now that we know we always do operation in parentheses or brackets FIRST, lets take a closer look at the second rule that says the next thing we do is exponents. Now if you havent seen exponents before, theyre just a way of writing repeated multiplication. For example, the repeated multiplication 4  4 can be written in a shorter form as 4 multiplied twice. And 4  4  4 can be written as 4 multiplied 3 times, and 4  4  4  4 can be written as 4 multiplied 4 times.  get the idea? This small number is called an exponent (or power). It just tells you how many times to multiply the bigger number together. So after we take care of any parentheses, simplifying any exponents becomes the next highest priority. For example in this problem, we have to simplify the exponent BEFORE we can do the other multiplication. The exponent is telling us to multiply 5 together twice.  So 5 times 5 is 25. And after we do that, THEN we multiply the result by 3.  So 25 times 3 is 75. Oh, and one thing I should point out sometimes youll get a problem that has exponents inside of parentheses, like this problem. And you may wonder, How can I get rid of the parentheses BEFORE I do the exponent? You might think that if you simplify the exponent first, youre breaking the rules. But the truth is that by doing whatever operations are inside the parentheses, you ARE doing the parentheses first. The parentheses really just tell you where to start. So in this problem, first we do 3 to the power of 2, which means 3  3 which is 9. Then the part inside the parentheses is 9  4, which equals 36. And once the parentheses are gone, we add 36 + 6 and get 42 as our final answer. Alright, now were gonna look at the last two rules together. These two rules are really important because they deal with the most common math operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication & division. And the rules tell us that we need to do multiplication and "
,,"division BEFORE we do addition and subtraction. To see how these rules work, lets look at a few quick examples that use those basic operations. First lett try this "
,,"one:  2 + 5 + 4  Ah Ha! Does this look familiar? Yep, its the one we gave to my two friends earlier. And now that we have our rules, we see that we have to do the "
,,"multiplication before the addition. 5  4 = 20 and THEN we add the 2, which gives us 22 so the second guy WAS right! [Sarcastically] What a surprise! Now lets try "
,,"this one:  3  5 ? 1 Our rules tell us that multiplication is higher on the list than subtraction, so we do 3  5 first. That gives us 15, and THEN we subtract the 1 which leaves 14 as our final answer. Heres one with division and subtraction: 20 ? 10  5 And since division has a higher priority, we do the 10 divided by 5 first, which equals 2. And then we subtract 2 from 20 and get 18 as our final answer. And heres another problem: 12  6 + 5 Again, our rules say to do the division before addition, so 12 divided by 6 equals 2 and then we add the 5 to get 7. And heres one last problem: 40  4  5 Which do we do first? the multiplication or the division?  Our rules dont tell us. Well, thats because multiplication and division are TIED for priority or importance.  So are addition and subtraction. And THATS "
,,"the reason we need an extra part at the end of each of these rule that says from left to right If you have a problem that has BOTH multiplication AND division, then youre supposed to work it from left to right. Thats because in some cases, you can get a different answers if you go from right to left. For example, in this problem, if you work from right to left (the wrong way) you would do the 4  5 first and get 20. And then 40 divided by 20 equals 2. But if you go from left to right, you would do 40 divided by 4 first, which is 10, and then 10 times 5 equals 50. Wow! The direction we went made a BIG difference. So whenever you have a problem that "
,,"has a mixture of multiplication and division OR a mixture of addition and subtraction, you know to do the operations in order from left to right. Alright, were just about done, but lets have one more look at all four of our rules before you start practicing with the exercises. The Order of Operations rules say: FIRST: do operation in parentheses and brackets NEXT: do exponents THEN: do multiplication and division (from left to right) LAST: do addition and subtraction (from left to right) "

Operations of While number,Z757THlXLA8,hello welcome to this lesson of mastering fifth grade math my name is Jason I'll be your host and your teacher in this batch of lessons and what we're going to focus on now is primarily on how to multiply and divide fractions now you already have learned how to add subtract fractions we've been doing that we've also learned how 
,,to simplify fractions we've done that as previous material so if you're unsure how to add or subtract or simplify fractions go to the previous lessons to get that here we're going to start to learn how to multiply and divide fractions now the key to learning how to multiply fractions which is what we're basically starting in this lesson is that it's actually easier than adding or subtracting fractions to be truthful multiplying and dividing them is actually easier and that's because in order to multiply divide fractions you do not have to worry about a common denominator see that's what we had to do with adding and subtracting fractions I kept telling 
,,you common denominator common denominator but here when we multiply fractions or we multiplied whole numbers times fractions which is what we're doing here do not have to worry about common denominators makes it much simpler so let's just jump into that what if I asked you multiply 3 times the fraction 2/3 all right now you would look at this and you would probably say I have no idea how to do that but then you should remember something from a previous lesson that we have discussed and that is that any whole number that you have whether it's 3 or 5 or 7 or 10 or anything else you can always write it as the number divided by 1 or the number over 1 because fractions this is a fraction here is really also represented by division we talked about that many times before so if you want to represent the number 3 you can always write it as a fraction simply 3 over 1 because that's 3 divided by 1 which is just 3 so this the number 3 and this the fraction 3 over 1 is exactly the same thing because this is like division here 3 over 1 is 3 all right so we're still multiplying by 2/3 and we want to show you how do we calculate that so I said before when you multiply fractions together and also you'll learn later when you divide fractions you do not have to worry about a common did there so it's actually easier these denominators are different you have a 1 and you have a 3 but that's ok all you do to multiply fractions is you do 3 times 2 on the top we multiply the numerators and 1 times 3 on the bottom we just multiply the denominator so on the top you will get 6 and on the bottom you will get 3 that is the answer 6 thirds but you have 
,,to ask yourself is this simplified you always check your fraction when you're done to see if it's fully simplified and this one we have a 6 over 3 so we can try to simplify it but then we realize this is the same as 6 divided by 3 and 6 divided by 3 is 2 6 divided by 3 is 2 and 2 is the answer so you might ask yourself well how 
,,is it you take 3 times a fraction and what you get at the end is just a number well think of it this way we know that you can multiply regular old fractions by numbers and you can sometimes end up with numbers for instance if I have half of a pizza and I multiply that times 2 what do I get a whole pizza let's show you how that would work if we're actually going to do that problem if we have 2 times 1 half of a pizza how would we do that well you know the answer is one whole pizza but let's 
,,show how you do it with the math here and the way you do that is the two you just write it as 2 over 1 we're still multiplying 1 by 1/2 all right and then what you do is you multiply the numerators 2 times 1 and then the denominator is 1 times 2 so what you get over here on the top is 2 and on the bottom you also get 2 and if you remember 2 divided by 2 gives you 1 so you know from your experience that 2 times 1/2 of something should give you a whole pizza or a whole peanut butter and jelly sandwich or whatever it is you're talking about this is how you do it in terms of the math so that's how you can get this in this case if you measure 2/3 of the pizza out and you take 2/3 of the pizza from one box and then 2/3 of the pizza from a second box from 2nd pizza and then 2/3 of a pizza from another and you arrange all of the slices together you're going to end up with two whole pizzas it's the same exact concept the fundamental key thing here is to remember that when you are multiplying a fraction times a whole number you write the whole number over one and then you multiply the fractions by multiplying the tops multiplying the bottoms so let's get some more practice with this what if we have the number 12 times 1/3 12 times 1/3 well the first thing we want to do we cannot multiply these unless we're multiplying two fractions so we represent the 12 is 12 over 1 we're still multiplying by 1/3 all right now up here we end up with 12 times 1 on the top and on the bottom we end up with 1 times 3 and so on the top 12 times 1 gives you 12 on the bottom 1 times 3 gives you 3 and you try to simplify this but then you realize I can divide this 12 divided by 3 is going to give me 4 so the answer is just 4 so so far for every time we've multiplied a fraction by a whole number we've always gotten a whole number back but that's not always the case let's do one when that's not the case what if we have 2/5 times 5 now here we've had the whole number times the fraction whole number times the fraction here we have it backwards the fraction times the whole number but you do exactly the same thing I mean there's no difference you 
,,write it as 2/5 times and then the 5 becomes a 5 over 1 you always write whole numbers as fractions and then what you have is 2 times 5 on the top and here you have 
,,5 times 1 on the bottom you do not have to worry about getting any kind of common denominator to multiply fractions what you get on the top 2 times 5 is 10 on the bottom you would get 5 times 1 is 5 and this is one of those cases where you're going to get a whole number 10 divided by 5 is going to give you 2 10 divided by 5 is going to give you 2 now let's do one where when we do the multiplication we don't actually end up with a whole number at the end all right let's say we're doing the fraction 3/5 times 4 all right and we want to multiply this so the first thing we do is we write 3 it's times and we write the four as 4 over 1 so now we have a fraction times a fraction so then we multiply the tops 3 times 4 we multiply the bottoms 5 times 1 and what we get on the top 3 times 4 is 12 and on the bottom 5 times 1 
,,is 5 so that's the answer but we always try to simplify it the first thing we look for is we say can we say 12 divided by 5 well it doesn't really divide evenly so we can't get a whole number as we have for the other fractions secondly we try to simplify can we divide top and bottom by any single number to make this simpler and 
,,we can't do that either we can't divide by 2 or by 3 for both of these guys because we have that pesky 5 on the bottom that's not going to let us do that so basically you could Circle this as the answer but then we also realize that this is an improper fraction all right we can always convert improper fractions to mixed numbers 
,,how many times will 5 go into 12 well it'll go 2 times because 5 times 2 is 10 now the difference between 12 and 10 is only 2 so that's the remainder and we write it over the denominator which is 5 so the answer that we get from this multiplication can be written as an improper fraction 12 over 5 or you can write it as 2 and 2/5 they both represent exactly the same thing because you know mixed numbers and improper fractions we can always switch back and forth okay now what if we have 2/5 times 12 we want to do that one so we have the same sort of thing we take 2/5 times 12 over 1 we write the whole number is 12 over 1 2 times 12 on the top and 5 times 
,,1 on the bottom now if you remember from your multiplication tables 12 times 2 is 24 on the top and 5 times 1 is 5 on the bottom so you get 24 over 5 so we try to simplify this and we really can't divide it 24 over 5 evenly and we can't really pick a number to simplify the fraction so we could Circle it like this but then we also realize that this is also an improper action so we can convert to mixed numbers so six times five is thirty that's too many times five times five is twenty five that's too many times four times five is 20 so this can be divided into their 24/5 can go a whole four times it gives us 20 the difference between 24 and 20 is 4 and we always write it over the bottom number here so we get 4 and 4/5 if you're having problems converting from improper fraction to mixed numbers then go back to some of the previous lessons and the 5th grade series we have a lot of practice with how to go back and forth between mixed numbers and improper fractions so when I circle both of these answers basically you can write it either way you're getting exactly the same answer all right now I have a couple more just to get a little more practice what about the number 1/6 times 3 well the way we would write that is 1/6 times we write the 3 is 3 over 1 and then we multiply the numerators 1 times 3 and then 6 times 1 all right and so then if I switch colors here on the top I'm going to get 3 1 times 3 is 3 on the bottom I'm going to get 6 so you could say that that's 
,,the answer but then we realize right away we try to simplify it this is not not an improper fraction but I can simplify this by dividing the bottom the top by 3 and 
,,also the bottom by 3 so 3 divided by 3 gives us 1 on the top 6 divided by 3 gives us 2 on the bottom and so you get 1/2 so this is the final answer 1/2 if you take 1/6 of a pizza and you do that 3 times from 3 different pizzas and arrange them together what you actually have at the end of the day is half of a pizza if you arrange all the slices all right the final problem we're going to do in this set here is 2/7 times 2 2/7 times 2 so what you do is you keep the fraction 2/7 and you write 
,,the whole number as 2 over 1 and then you multiply the numerators 2 times 2 and then you multiply the denominator 7 times 1 and what you will get when you do both of those things over the top 2 times 2 is 4 and seven times one is seven and so you look at this and you say can I simplify it anymore and the answer is you really cannot 4/7 is the final answer I cannot divide top and bottom by anything to simplify that it's also not improper so I can't really do anything with that so this is the final answer if you have any problems simplifying a fraction to one half like we did here or converting to mixed numbers or something like that then you need to take a few minutes and go back to my previous lessons we learned how to simplify fractions and we learn how to convert to mixed numbers because those skills we're going to use in all of these problems every time we multiply fractions we get the answer we always check to see if we can simplify it so you have to know how to do this stuff so here is an introduction to the first concept here where we're multiplying a whole number times a fraction and you've seen that the way you do that is you always convert the whole number to a fraction by changing it from the number over to the number over one and then once you have it as fraction times fraction you always multiply the numerators you always multiply the denominators and you simplify the results very simple you do not have to worry about finding a common denominator when you multiply or divide fractions so keep that in mind make sure you understand this and these problems work the worksheet problems that we have for you and then follow me on to the next lesson where we'll gain some practice with with doing this and gaining additional practice solving problems in fifth grade math

Operations of While number,oY4EgyY12-s,hello children today i'm here to teach you chapter 3 in your textbook that's mathematical operations on whole numbers so in this lesson we are doing all four operations addition subtraction multiplication and division look at this one hindu arabic digits used in mathematics what are those so you already know that 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and 9. those are the digits in hindu arabic number system the four operations used in mathematics what are the basic operations addition subtraction multiplication and division so we look at all four operations in this lesson with whole numbers look at this one addition of numbers how you get 6 0 plus 6 1 plus 5 6 or 2 plus 4 you get 6 3 plus 3 you get 6. so what are the ways you get 8 1 plus 7 2 plus 6 3 with 5 and 4 with 4. look at this one how you get 10 1 with 9 2 with 8 3 with seven four with six and five with five these are the possibilities you can get ten with one digit numbers twelve what are the ways we can get twelve one with 11 here you 
,,have to use 2 digit number there 12 you can write 2 with 10 3 with 9 4 with 8 5 with 7 and 6 with 6. so you can create numbers using addition of two numbers now we are adding zeros to any digit what happens zero plus zero zero one plus zero you get one two plus zero two three plus zero is three four plus zero is four and 5 plus 
,,0 is 5 so that means when you add 0 to any number you get the same original number give the answers to the addition of the following numbers just adding two digits two plus seven you get nine three plus four seven six plus four you get ten zero plus 7 you get this same answer 7 8 plus 4 12 9 plus 5 you get 14 3 plus 8. eleven nine plus eight seventeen six plus six you get twelve nine plus seven sixteen nine plus one ten four plus four you get eight find the value of twenty three plus forty 
,,how we do that so we'll write 23 in tens place you get 20 and one's place you get 3. how you get 45 tens place 40 and once play is 5. so when you add ones place values what you get 3 plus 5 you get 8. tens place values you get sixty so what's the answer now sixty in tens place and eight in one's place sixty and eight you get sixty eight find the value of this one so we'll write in tens place values and ones place values 46 40 and 6 33 how can you write 30 and 3 30 tens and three once so what's the total here you get 70 6 plus 3 9. so what's the final answer 70 and 9 79 now do this one so 52 plus 36 so you need 52 and 36 so tens place you get 50 here this one is 2 what about 36 30 and 6 now add it 2 plus 6 becomes 8 50 plus 30 you get 80. so 80 tens and ones plays eight what's the total 88 now do the same way 73 plus 24 73 is the number 24 is the other number write in tens this becomes 70 and once you get 3 24 20 and 4 when you add it together what happens 3 plus 4 you get 7. 
,,70 plus 20 you get 90. now 90 and 7 you get 97 find the value of 38 plus 47 38 47 so tens place what are the values 30 and here 40. what are the units place values eight and seven now what happens when you are adding the numbers 8 and 7 you get 15 now 2 digit numbers you are getting so i'll write 8 plus 7 15 but i'm not going to write 15 there because that's two digit numbers so i'll write 5 here and take 10 to this side so 40 plus 30 70 70 plus 10 you get 80. now 80 and 5 you get 85 so it 
,,should go to tens place when you get two digit numbers and cross out 8 and 7. so that's what we do when you are adding numbers and when you get two digit numbers when you are adding ones place you take it to the tens place now similarly do this one 56 and 29 how many tens are there 50 here 20. how many ones are there 6 and 9 now 9 plus 6 what is nine plus six fifteen fifteen is two digit number so fifteen you can write ten and five so we write five here and what we do we can cross out these two and take 10 to this side now 50 plus 20 70 70 plus 10 you get 80 80 and 5 85 so that's the final answer do this one now 66 plus 25 66 25 66 write in tens 60 and 1 6 25 you can write 20 and 5 now add it 6 plus 5 6 plus 5 is 11 11 is two digit number you can't write it so we can write 10 and 1. so i can cross out these two and i can put 1 here and take 10 to tens place 60 plus 20. 80 80 plus 10 90. so the answer is 91 90 and 1. now we'll do the same way without creating a table this is ones and this is tens place four plus three seven three plus two five so that's easy you can straight away at three plus two five five plus four nine here six plus two eight three plus two five now here eight plus five eight plus five thirteen so what we do we write three here take one to the tens place four plus three seven seven plus one you get eight here also eight plus four eight plus four is twelve so you put two here take one to the tenths place six plus one seven seven plus two 9 this one 9 and 9 18 put 8 and take 1 to the tenths place 4 plus 3 7 7 plus 1 8 this one 7 plus 2 9 you get 1 digit number 6 plus 2 8 here 8 plus 9 8 and 8 sixteen sixteen plus one seventeen one you take it to the tens place three plus one four four plus one five nine plus seven you get sixteen write six and take one to the tens place eight plus one you get nine find the value of 237 plus 356 now you get hundreds place as well so how can you write 237 200 30 tens and seven years 356 356. now what happens seven plus six you get 13. 13 is two digit number you can't write you have to split ten l three so you write cross out these two and you write three here 
,,and take ten to this side 50 plus 30 80 80 plus 10 90. then hundreds when you add you get 500 so what's the answer 509 so that's the final answer this number 378 and 256. so split into hundreds place that's 300. here 200 is there then 70 that's tens place and 8 is the units place value ones place 256 50 here and 6 here now add these to 8 plus 6 14 14 you can't write so split it to 10 and 4. so you can write 4 here take 10. now 7 t plus 10 80 80 plus 50 130 now you get three digit number 130 you can split it to 100 plus 30. now you can keep 30 here and take 100 to this side now what's the final answer 300 plus 200 500 and 600 there so what's the final answer 634 now without writing in a table you can do same way this is units place of ones place tens place and hundreds place so eight plus six eight plus six fourteen you write the first ones place digit and take one to the tenths place one plus seven eight eight plus five 13 and take 1 to the hundredths place 1 plus 3 4 4 plus 
,,2 6. so you can do the same question this way so this is easy when you write ones place tens place and hundreds place you can take one to the next level at the numbers given below 5 plus 3 8 4 plus 2 6 3 plus 2 5 here 3 plus 4 7 7 plus 1 8 4 plus two six this one zero plus seven you get seven zero plus four four six plus two eight so it's easy you are not getting two digit numbers three plus two five six plus zero six four plus three seven here also you get one digit numbers five plus 4 9 0 plus 1 1 7 plus 2 9 here 3 plus 5 8 7 plus 1 8 4 plus 3 you get 7. now you are getting 1000 plays as well 3452 so similarly you do the column wise addition 2 plus 4 6 5 plus 3 8 4 plus 0 4 3 plus 1 4 3 plus 2 here 5 8 plus 1 9 0 plus 5 5 4 plus 2 6. these are all one digit numbers so straight away you can write down 4 plus 5 nine eight plus zero eight zero plus seven seven three plus three you get six this one four plus two six four plus three seven four plus five nine and three plus two five so you get five thousand nine hundred and seventy six this one three plus three six nine plus zero nine four plus zero four three plus two five here also one digit numbers three plus six nine six plus zero six four plus two six and two plus ones you get three find the value of 3765 and 2887 now we can write into thousands place hundreds place tenths place and ones place so you get three thousand here then seven hundred sixty and five this number two thousand eight hundred and eighty seven two thousand here eight hundred eighty 7. now try to add these to 7 plus 5 12. so you can't write 12 there so what you do you take the last digit and take 10 to this side 60 plus 10 70 70 plus 80 150 so 150 you can't write you write 50 there and take 100 to this side then 100 plus 700 800 800 plus 800 1600 now you need hundreds place so you write 600 there and take thousand to this side then thousand plus three thousand four thousand four thousand plus two thousand you get six thousand so what's the final answer six thousand six hundred fifty two when you look at the last row you can say six thousand six hundred and fifty two is the final answer now similarly you can do the same question this way 7 plus 5 you write down the last digit that's 12 2 there and you take 1 to the other side 8 plus 6 14 fourteen plus 
,,one fifteen take one to this side one plus seven eight eight plus eight sixteen take one so this is 1 8 plus 8 16 you take 1 to this side then 3 plus 1 4 4 plus 2 6 
,,6 652 we'll check it 6652 so you can easily do this way you write in a column and add it when it's more than one digit you take it to the next level now add these numbers thousand th means thousand hundreds tens units eight plus seven 15 we take 1 there 3 plus 1 4 4 plus 8 12. we write 2 here and take 1 to the next level 7 plus 
,,1 8 eight plus five thirteen take one here two plus one three three plus one is four this one four plus seven eleven take one to this side 8 plus 1 9 9 plus 3 12 and 1 you can take it to this level 9 plus 1 10 10 plus 5 15 and you take 1 to thousands place three plus one four four plus one five what about this one five plus seven you get twelve one you can take it to the next level seven plus one eight eight plus eight sixteen one take it to this level then nine plus one ten ten plus three 
,,thirteen take one to this side so 4 plus 2 6 6 plus 1 you get 7 this one 4 plus 8 12 take 1 to this level 9 plus 1 10 10 plus 3 13 take 1 8 plus 1 9 9 plus 3 12 then take 1 here 5 plus 1 six six plus three nine again addition seven plus six thirteen take one here seven plus six thirteen thirteen plus one fourteen and take one there eight plus six fourteen fourteen plus one fifteen so you put five and take one to the next level four plus one five five plus one six again this one now you get 
,,nine plus six nine plus six fifteen so you write five there take one to the next level seven plus 1 8 8 plus 2 10 and take 1 there 5 plus 1 6 6 plus 7 13 and take 1 
,,to the next level 5 plus 1 6 6 plus 1 you get 7. now we'll do addition without writing you needs tens and thousand place just add it all the digits in column wise 5 
,,plus 5 10 you take 1 to the next level 7 plus 1 8 8 plus 4 12 and take one two plus one three three plus one you get four add these two numbers four plus eight twelve take one to the next level seven plus seven fourteen fourteen plus one fifteen and take one to the next level three plus one four four plus one five this one seven plus eight fifteen take one to the next level nine plus one ten ten plus four four t take one there so six plus one seven seven plus five you get 12. here 8 plus 4 
,,12 take 1 there 7 plus 1 8 8 plus 5 13 take 1 here one plus one two two plus one three three plus two get five this one seven plus four eleven take one here eight and eight 16 1 there 10 plus 5 15 1 here then 2 plus 2 get 4 this one 5 plus three eight eight plus seven fifteen take one there ten plus one eleven one there so four 
,,plus two six fill in the blanks now answer is given so how you get 6 here 5 plus 1 how you get 0 you need to add 6 to 4 6 plus 4 tens then 1 is already there so you 
,,are getting 4 so that means this should be 0 this number you need 8 6 is already there so you need to add 2 6 plus 2 8. then how you get 10 here 7 plus 3. so 1 is already there so 3 is therefore to get 6 you need to add 2 this one you just added 9 plus 4 13 we take 1 there are 7 plus 1 8 plus 1 9 3 plus 2 5 here also just addition 5 plus 4 9 7 plus 2 9 1 plus 1 2 5 3 8. this one answer is given other way around you need 9 from 8 you have to add 1 to that so here you get 14 four you get four six is there so what's the number you need to add you need to add eight eight plus six fourteen so one already there now seven and 1 8 how do you get 3 8 plus 5 13 
,,so 1 already there so 2 plus 1 3 you need to add 2 to get 5 here you got 7 as the answer so how you get 7 from 8 you have to add 9 so that's 17. so you are taking 1 
,,there so 6 plus 1 7 is already there how you get 1 7 plus 4 11 1 is already there so we take 1 to this side 7 plus one eight how you get nine from eight you have to 
,,add one there then you already have one there how you get five you need to add four look at this question there are 2172 boys and 3247 girls in school a cool a 2170 
,,boys 3247 girls in school b there are three thousand 142 boys and 2173 girls complete the table given below so you need total so how many boys are there we can add these two 4 7 plus 4 11 take 1 you get 3 here 3 plus 2 5. now add these two 7 plus 3 10 take 1 8 plus 4 12 2 there and take 1 2 plus 1 3 plus 1 4 and 3 plus 2 5. now 
,,we'll take the total this way can you add this way units place separately 7 plus 2 9 4 plus 7 11 take one to the next level 2 plus 1 3 3 plus 1 4 and 3 plus 2 5. try to add this way if you can't you write as a column and at two plus three five four plus seven eleven put one and take one to the hundredths place so one plus one 2 
,,2 plus 1 3 and 3 plus 2 5. now we'll add it and see 9 plus 5 14 1 remaining so you get 3 7 10 10 734 now i want to check whether this is correct this way as well this total should be the same as this one so four plus zero four that's correct one plus two three three plus four seven that's okay last one five plus five ten so the 
,,final answer is correct in a factory 2748 employees turned up for the first shift 3249 employees turned up for the second shift find the total number of employees engaged so first shift how many employees 2748 second shift how many employees 3249 total means you need to add these two so find out the total 8 plus 9 17 and take 1 
,,4 plus 4 8 8 plus 1 9 7 plus 2 9 there 2 plus 3 five so all together 5997 employees are there look at this question 2379 mangoes are plucked from one tree 3068 mangoes were plucked from another tree find the total number of mangoes plucked first three that's 2379 from the second tree 3068 now total means addition add these two 8 plus 8 16 plus 1 7 1 taking to the this level 7 plus 7 14 1 there so you get 4 and 5 all together 5 447 mangoes are there look at this question 1765 cement stone blocks were transported in one tractor 2 348 similar cement stone blocks were transported in another tractor find the total number of civil blocks transported in the first structure so how many cement blocks transported 1765 in the second tractor 2348 now if you want the total that means take the addition of the two numbers add it together 8 plus 5 13 and take 1 7 plus 4 11. another one here 8 plus 3 eleven one there two plus one three three plus one you get four so all together four thousand one hundred and thirteen cement blocks transport this one 6349 bricks was transported in one lorry 4728 similar bricks were transported in the second larry find the total number of bricks transported so you have to first find this in the first lorry 6349 in the second lorry that's four thousand seven hundred and twenty eight to get the total you add it nine plus eight seventeen let's take one there four plus two six plus one 7 and 3 plus 7 10 take 1 there 6 plus 4 10 10 plus 1 11 11 07 bricks transported here now we look at subtraction so how we subtract simple digits 7 minus 3 get 4. nine minus five that's also four eight minus two six nine minus four you get five six minus six you get zero eight minus seven that's one nine minus three six four minus two you get two four minus three you get one eight minus six you get two eight minus five that's three six minus three again three find the value now we'll try to subtract column wise you write in a column and subtract separately units place tens place and hundreds place eight minus three you get five so we put five there then 7 minus 4 you get 3 so this is 3 then 3 minus 1 you get 2. so you put 2 here now look at this one 9 minus 5 you get 4 5 minus 2 that's 3 and 6 minus 2 you get 4. now we'll do this one 8 minus 5. so you start from the right side 
,,units place or ones place 8 minus 5 you get 3. right here 5 minus 2 3 and 9 minus 3 you get 6. so 633 this one 4 minus 2 you get 2 6 minus 2 that's 4 and 8 minus 3 you get 5. so you write 5 here 542. find the value so same thing now you get thousands place as well eight minus zero here this should be zero eight minus zero is eight five minus four you get one two minus zero is two and seven minus three you get 4. this one 9 minus 6 you get 3. 5 minus 2 3 again 8 minus 1 seven and seven minus three you get four four thousand seven hundred thirty three seven minus six one two minus zero that's two four minus one you get three and nine minus two that's seven in this question three minus one that's two five minus two you get three here eight minus six two there nine minus two that's seven population of a town is 6759 out of which 2354 are children find the remaining portion total amount is given number of children given how we find out the remaining part you subtract here not addition so total population is 6759 2354 children are there so the remaining population you subtract the two values nine minus four get five five minus five zero seven 
,,minus three that's four six minus two you get four four thousand four hundred five remaining population are there in 2015 7249 motor vehicles were manufactured in a 
,,factory in 2014 it was 5200 and how many more were manufactured in 2015 than in 2014 that means the number manufactured in 2015 is higher than that so we can subtract the two values so in 2015 that was 7249 in 2014 that's 5228 to get the number of extra vehicles in 2015 we can subtract the two 9 minus 8 that's 1. 4 minus 2 2 2 minus 2 0 7 minus 5 that's 2. so 2021 extra vehicles in 2015. last year there are worth 7 645 vehicles in a garage out of which 4232 are motor cars find the number of other vehicles again here total number is there and number of motor cars there so you are asking to find other vehicles here also you have to subtract number of vehicles 7645 and number of cars that's four thousand two hundred and thirty two so subtract these two five minus two three four minus three what six minus two four and seven minus four that's three now find the value so we can write in columns units place tens place hundreds place and now thousand plays also there so same method as before when you subtract here six minus three you get three so you write 3 here 7 minus 5 2. 13 minus 4. now you can't subtract 4 from 3. so what you do you take 1 from there so when you take 1 this becomes 13. so we write 10 here so 13 minus 4 you get 9. so we write 9 here now what's 5 minus 3 now that's not 5 why we already 
,,we have taken 1 from there so this becomes 4 now 4 minus 3 you get 1. so 4 cannot be deducted from 3 1 is taken from the thousands place it is 13. now this one subtract these two 7 minus 2 you get 5. then can you subtract 7 from 5 we can't we take 1 from there so when you take 1 this becomes 15 15 minus 7 you get 8 here now what's the number here we took 1 there this becomes 2 but can we subtract 6 from 2 you can't so you are taking 1 from there so when you take 1 that becomes 12 12 minus 6 is 6. now you took one from this side now this is not six this is five five minus two you get three so this is three now subtract these two three minus eight you can't you are taking one from here that becomes ten thirteen minus 8 what's 13 minus 8 that's 5. now this number is 4 now not 5. now 14 you have to take 1 so that becomes 14 14 minus 7 that's 7 here now again this is not 4 this is 3 now then take another one to this side that means 13 13 minus 6 you get 7 so 7 here now again this 
,,is not 7 this is 6 6 minus 2 you get 4. so this becomes 4. so we'll subtract now we can't subtract 8 from 3 so we are taking 1 from there so this becomes 13 so we are taking 10 10 plus 3 30 13 minus 8 what's 13 minus 8 5. now what's this number not 4 this becomes 3 so you need 1 from there so 13 minus 7 that's 6. then here this 
,,becomes 0 not 1. you can't subtract so take 1 from there 10 minus 4 that's 6. this becomes 6 now 6 minus 5 1. now when you add these two you need to get this answer 
,,just check 8 plus 5 13 and 14 1 remaining 11 and 7 so it's correct now subtract this one y minus 2 straight away you can write 3 but you can't subtract 7 from 6 take 1 so 1 and 6 means 16 16 minus 7 that's 9 then this becomes 3. so 13 take 1 from here 13 minus 7 6. here this becomes 2 2 minus 1 you get 1. 4 minus 7 you can't so 
,,you are taking 1 from this side so 14 minus 7 is 7. this becomes 5 now but we need 1 from there 15 minus 8 what is 15 minus 8 you get 7. so now what's this number this becomes 6. you can't subtract 9 so you take 1 from here 16 minus 9 you get 7 then this becomes 4 4 minus 2 you get 2. now do the subtraction here you can't subtract 9 from 7 you take 1. so this becomes 10. 17 minus 9 what is 17 minus 9 8 then this is 1 now we have already taken 1. can we subtract 5 from 1 you can't so take 1 
,,from here so 11 minus 5 that's 6. this becomes 2 now still you can't subtract so you need 1 from here 12 minus 6 you get 6. now this becomes 3 3 minus 1 that's 2. subtract the following numbers now you don't need to write it down so we can just subtract column wise without writing circles can we take out 9 from 7 no so you are taking 1 17 minus 9 8. now this becomes 11 11 minus 6 so you are taking 1 from here as well 11 minus 6 you get 5 now this is 2 2 minus 2 0 4 minus 1 3. this one you can't subtract 9 from 7 you take 1. 17 minus 9 8. this becomes 5 then 5 minus 5 0 you can't subtract 6 from 2 so take 1 from here 12 minus 6 that's 6. now what's the 
,,number here it becomes 6 6 minus 2. 4. do the same thing you can't subtract 8 from 3 you take 1 from here 13 minus 8. what's 13 minus 8 that's 5. so what's the number here now that's 1. so still you can't subtract you have to take 1 from this side 11 minus 6 that's 5. now what's a number here eight eight minus six you get two four minus one you get three look at this one a farmer took 3458 coconuts to the market and sold 2729 of them how much was left so how many coconuts brought 3458 and he sold 2729. so what's the number left that means we need to subtract the two numbers we'll subtract we can't subtract nine from eight take one eighteen minus nine is nine now this becomes 4 4 minus 2 you get 2 then again you can't subtract 7 from 4 you take 1 from here 14 minus 7 you get 7 now what's the remaining one here it becomes 2 2 minus 2 that's 0. so all together 729 coconuts left look at this question there were 4123 children in a mixed school out of which 2728 were boys find out 
,,the number of girls so this is also subtraction total number is given that's 4123 and how many boys 2 700 boys so the girls are the remaining parts so you subtract can we subtract 8 from 3 you can't you take 1. 13 minus 8 that's 5. so this becomes 1 now still you can't subtract you are taking 1 from here 11 minus 2 that's so what about this number now 10 10 minus 7 that's 3. so you are taking 1 from there so what's the number here so 3 minus 2 you get 1. now we'll look at multiplication so 
,,look at this question there are six buttons on a shirt find number of buttons in five shirts so what we can do you can add it so this is first shirt second third fourth fifth so we are adding all buttons to get the total number of buttons 6 plus 6 12 12 6 18 18 plus 6 24 24 plus 6 30. so you can get the same answer by multiple using multiplication number of buttons in five shirts means one shirt six and multiply by five because five shirts are there so you get 6 times 5 30. so multiplication is a sequence of addition but it takes time to add it's easy to know how to multiply because you can get the answer at once look at this question there are 8 pencils in a box how many are there in 6 boxes so number of pencils in a box is eight how many boxes are there six boxes all together number of pencils in six boxes you multiply eight by six eight times 6 is 48 48 pencils are there there are seven days in a week find the number of days in 11 weeks so number of days in a week is 7 we 
,,know that number of days in 11 weeks you multiply this by 11. so what you get 11 times 7 is 77 days are there the multiplication of any number by 10 100 or 1000 can 
,,be found by adding one two or three zeros to the number if you're multiplying by 10 means you add one zero if you're multiplying by hundred means you put two zeros multiplied by thousand means you put three zeros ten you put one zero and multiply by one seven times one seven one zero and multiply by nine nine times one nine put 
,,zero and one times 63 you get 63 put 0 75 times 1 75 1 0 there you get 280 one no multiplied by a hundred you put two zeros and thirty seven times one thirty seven put two zeros eight times one eight now thousand thousand means put three zeros and nine times one nine here also three zeros thirty one times one is thirty one three zero is there and one times 431 that's 431 here multiplied by 100 means put two zeros three times 318 times 1 380. multiply by 10 means put 1 0 and multiply by 1 51 put here on 0 and multiplied by 1 430 so it's easy when you get multiples of 10. fill in the blanks so first one done for you 2 times 7 is 14. so 14 you can write other way around 7 times 2 as well 8 times 3 24 24 you can write other way around 3 times 8 as well how you get 54 from 6 6 times 9 so that is same as 9 times now this one nine times five nine times five you get forty-five forty-five is same as five times nine eight times six is forty-eight so 48 you can write 6 times 8 as well so for multiplication order is not important you can multiply 2 into 3 or 3 into 2 you get the same answer now we'll multiply in a column like this this is units place tens place and hundreds place so we need to multiply 87 by 6. so we write 87 and 6 here with multiplication sign so what we do first 6 times 7 6 times 7 is 42 two 
,,digit numbers are there so what we do we write 2 here and take 4 to the next level then you multiply these two 6 times 8 6 times 8 48 and this 48 and this 4 you have to add 48 plus 4 is 52 now you can put 2 here and take 5 to the next level so what's the answer 522 to the multiplication 95 times 7 7 times 5 35 so we can't write 
,,both so you put 3 and take 3 to the next level 7 times 9 63 and 63 and this 3 you get 6 six so now you put six there and take six to the next level so what's the final answer 665 807 into 6. now you need thousands plays as well so what's the first step 6 times 6 36 so you write 6 here and take 3 to the tenths place 7 times 6 42 
,,42 plus 3 you have to add it together so what's 42 plus 3 forty five now we write five here so take four to this level six times eight forty eight and 48 and this 4 
,,when you add it you get 50 2. so you write 2 here take 5 to the next level that's thousands place so this is five multiply following numbers so we can do straight away without writing separately so we'll try to do 6 times 8 48 i'll write 8 and take 4 to the next level 6 times 4 24 24 plus 4 28 and 2 you take it to this level 6 times 3 18 18 plus 2 20. do this multiplication like that 7 times 9 63 take 6 7 times 7 49 49 and 6 you have to add it you get 55 so you write 5 here take 5 to the next level 6 times 7 42 42 plus 5 47 this one 7 times 9 63. you take 6 here 7 times 1 6 7 times 1 7 7 plus 6 thirteen take one there seven times seven forty nine forty nine plus one fifty this one eight times seven fifty six you take 5 there but 8 times 0 is 0 0 plus 5 becomes 5 8 times 8 64. now try this one nine times seven sixty three six you take it to the next level then nine times one nine nine plus six fifteen take one then so 9 times 8 72 72 plus 1 73 again check it nine times seven sixty three and nine times one nine plus six fifteen and this is seventy two plus one seventy three this one five times eight forty 4 you take it to the next level 5 
,,times 7 35 35 plus 4 39 and you take 3 to the next one 5 times 0 0 plus 3 that's 3. then 5 times 6 30 30 390. this one this is done for you so just check it 53 times 34 now 2 digit numbers so then you can split 34 as 30 and 4. so you can write 30 and 4. so what we do you multiply by 4 and multiply by 30 and add it together so multiply by 4 4 times 8 32 3 remaining 4 times 5 4 times 5 you get 20 20 plus 3 23 and 2 remaining so you can write 2 there now multiply by 30 means put a 0 and multiply by 3. so put 0 3 times 8 24 4 you take 2 there so 3 times 5 15 15 plus 2 17. so you write 17 and now add these 2 7 9 and 1. so what we do first multiply by 4 and 
,,multiply by 30 so instead of multiplying by 30 put a 0 and multiply by 3. now we'll do the same thing so we'll write down 43 how can you write 43 3 and 40. you can do other way round as well 40 and 3 doesn't matter so we'll multiply by 3 3 times 7 21 2 remaining 3 times 6 18 plus 2 20. so if you can't multiply like that so you can do this way 3 times 7 21. 6 times 3 18 plus 2 20. so 201 so you get 201 there so multiplying by 40 means put a 0 and multiply by 4. so what you do 67 multiplied by 4 4 times 7 28 2 remaining 4 times 6 24 plus 2 26 so 2 680 is the answer here 2 680 now add these two 1 8 8 2 so 2 81 now 348 multiplied by 36 so what are the steps you can multiply by 6 and 30. so if you can't do it once what you do you do separately we'll take 345 multiplied by 6 6 times 5 30 3 remaining 6 times 4 24 24 plus 3 27 2 remaining 6 times 3 18 18 plus 2 20. so 2 thousand seventy there so i can write two thousand seventy now multiply by thirty put a 0 and multiply by 3. so i can write 345 multiplied by 3. 3 times 5 50 1 remaining 3 times 4 12 plus 1 30 1 remaining 3 times 3 9 plus 1 10. so you get 10 35 and put a 0. so what's the answer when you multiply by 30 you get 10 350 when you add it you get the final answer so when you add it you need to get twelve thousand four hundred and twenty so we'll add it zero twelve one remaining so this becomes four two one twelve thousand four hundred and twenty will multiply now so i'll do first 4 and then 20. so how you do at once so look at carefully 4 times 8 32 3 remaining 4 times 4 16 16 plus 3 ninety one you take it there four times three twelve twelve plus one thirteen it's not hard if you can do that at once so how you multiply by 20 you put a 0 there and multiply by 2 2 times 8 60 one remaining two times four eight eight plus ones nine then two times three six again put a 0 multiplied by 2 2 times 8 16 1 remaining 2 times 4 8 plus 1 9 and 2 times 3 6 now add these two you get 2 here 15 so 1 there 10 plus 3 13 1 take it to this side 7 plus 1 8 now multiply by 33 so what's the method multiply by 3 and then 30. have you multiplied by 3 3 times 4 12 1 remaining three 
,,times one three plus one four three times five fifteen now multiply by thirty put a zero and multiply by three 3 times 4 12 1 remaining 3 times 1 3 plus 1 4 3 times 
,,5 15. so can you see in this one you are multiplying by 3 so what you do same answer you are getting but with a 0 2 6 9 6 1 16 962 how you multiply by 37 7 30 multiplied by 7 7 times 3 21 2 remaining 7 times 7 49 49 plus 2 51 5 remaining 7 times 6 42 42 plus 5 47 if you can't do that at once make sure that you do separately and 
,,write down the answer then multiply by 30 means put a 0 and multiply by 3 3 times 3 9. 3 times 7 21 2 remaining 7 times 6 42 42 plus 2 44 now add these you get 10 and 1 there 8 and 1 9 here 4 and 4 8 and 4 48 901 now multiply by 64 however you multiply by 64 60 and 4 so 4 and 60. multiply by four four times two eight four times 
,,one four four times seven twenty eight multiply by sixty means put a zero and multiply by 6 6 times 2 12 1 remaining 6 times 1 6 plus 1 7 6 times 7 42 now at 8 6 8 plus 7 15 and 2 and 2 4 and 1 5 45 568 23 motorcycles can be packed into a lorry how many motorcycles can this lorry transport in 230 trips so that means you need to 
,,multiply so what's the number here lorry of motorcycle in one trip that that's 23 number of motorcycles in 230 trips that means 23 into 230 so what you do 213 to 23 
,,means you multiply 20 and 3 or 3 and 20 odd is not important so multiply by 20 means put a zero and multiply by two zero six three times zero zero three times three 
,,nine three times two six and you add it when you add it you get 5290 motorcycles in 230 trips a tractor can transport 3220 bricks how many bricks can be transported 
,,in nine trips so in one trip 3200 bricks in nine trips means you multiply this by nine so we'll do it here if you can't multiply this way it's better to write in a column and multiply nine times zero zero nine times two eighteen one remaining nine times two eighteen plus one nineteen one remaining nine times three twenty 27 27 plus 1 28 28 980 bricks are there there are 144 tablets in one bottle how many tablets can eight bottles hold so you need to multiply this by eight multiply separately 8 times 4 32 3 remaining 8 times 4 32 32 plus 3 35 again three remaining eight times one eight eight plus three eleven thousand one hundred and fifty two tablets in eight bottles price of one coconut is 48 rupees what is the price of seven such coconuts so what's the price of one coconut 48 rupees and seven coconuts means you 
,,multiply this by seven shall we multiply this way this is how we do seven times eight fifty-six you put five you put 6 and 5 remain 7 times 4 28 28 and this 5 you get thirty three so thirty three here so if you can't do that way you do better to do this way seven times eight fifty six five remaining seven times four twenty eight plus 5 you get 33. 336 rupees a small lorry can transport 78 cement bags how many cement bags can the lorry transport in 74 trips so what's the number of cement bags can transport in one trip 78. so there are 14 trip sauce here 74 trips i'll put 74 trips so what's the value of 78 times 70 78 times 74. so how do you do that 78 74 74 means 70 and 4. so how you multiply by 70 you put a 0 and multiply by 7 7 times 8 56 5 remaining 7 times 7 49 49 plus 5 54 4 times 8 32 3 remaining 4 times 7 28 plus 3 28 plus 3 31 now add it 2 7 7 5 5 5772 cement bags are there in 74 trips the daily wage of laborer is 1560 rupees find the total wage is of 18 laborers so what's daily wage of one laborer thousand five hundred and sixty rupees so there are 18 laborers so you multiply that value into 18. so this is in rupees multiply 1560 multiplied by 18 that means 10 n 8. have you multiplied by ten put a zero and multiply by one six five one then multiply by eight eight times zero zero eight times 
,,six forty-eight four remaining 8 times 5 40 40 plus 4 44 4 remaining 8 times 1 8 8 plus 4 12 when you add it you get 6 plus 4 10 1 remaining that's 6 plus 2 8 and 2. so you get 28 000. 80 rupees fill in the blanks now answer is given and you need to fill in between so that's not easy 23 how you get 23 so you can write 3 and 20. 
,,that's how we multiply you split 3 and 20. so 20 means you put a 0 and multiply by 2. and here to get this answer multiplied by 3 so we need to this do 3 times 8 24 
,,2 remaining and you need to get 3 here so what should be the number 2 digit number 2 23 so what's the number 3 times so you better to do this way 23 minus 2 what's the answer you get 21 how you get 21 from 3 this should be 7. now check it 3 times 8 24 2 remaining 3 times 7 21 plus 2 23 so better to subtract this number first and then figure out the number now you have the number you can multiply by 20 put 0 and multiply by 2 2 times 8 16 1 remaining 2 times 7 14 plus 1 15. now see the addition is correct 5 plus 2 7 so that's correct so that should be 7 there this one you are getting 268 so two numbers are missing so 80 is this number and we don't know 
,,which number is that so how do you figure out that so here we need to find out both numbers how we get 8 here and 7 here what's the multiplication 7 times what you get the last digit 8 check it 7 times 7 49 7 times 5 no 7 times 4 you get 28 so that's what you have to do here 7 times 4 so this can be 4 so if this is 4 this becomes 4 here now check that value 4 times 7 28 2 remaining answer is 26 26 minus 2 you get 24. how do you get 24 from 4 4 times 6 so 4 times 6 24 plus 2 26 now that one 
,,is okay now how you multiply by 80 put a 0 and multiply by 8 8 times 7 56 5 remaining 8 times 6 48 48 plus 5 53 so you get 53 here now edit 8 6 and 6 12 1 remaining 
,,3 plus 2 5 plus 1 6 and here 5. so not easy so you have to figure out one value and then after you get the one value it's easy look at this one so 20 something there so that means 20 n we don't know this value so put a 0 here you get the answer here multiplied by 2. now how do you figure out this number how you get 9 9 times something is 5. 9 times 5 only 45 all the other numbers you are not getting 5 so that should be 5 there 9 times 5 45 that means here this is multiplied by 5 5 times 9 45 4 remaining and then it's 4 already there so that means when you subtract 4 there you are getting 160 164 minus 460 that means you are getting 0 there so what's the number to get a 0 there so you can put 0 there pi times 0 only you get 0. we'll check it out 5 times 0 0 and you get 4 there then 5 times 3 15. so that means not correct so you need to get not 0 10 so how you get 10 there so you can erase that so how you get 10 i can put 2 there 5 times 2 10. 10 plus 4 14. and put 4 and you can take 1 there 5 times 3 15 plus 1 you are getting 16 now so that's correct now we can multiply this answer by twenty so put a zero and multiply by two two times nine eighteen one remaining so two times two four four plus one five two times three six now add it you get five twelve one there six and six twelve one remaining you get here when you are writing the columns are like this this is with this this this and this is with this so here multiply by 2 again 2 times 9 18 1 remaining 2 times 2 4 plus 1 5 2 times 3 6. so when you are adding this is 5 8 plus 4 12 and then 12 here 1 remaining 7 plus 1 8 now we will look at division of numbers so look at this question sunil has 24 toffees and he distributed these are my six friends equally how many toffees does each friend receive so first 24 so what's the remainder after giving once 24 minus 6 you get 18. then second time when you get give another 6 18 minus 6 you get 10. third time 12 minus 6 you get 6 4 times 6 times 6 0. so that means how many time how many toffees you can give four toffees each so this one you can do it with division straight away so what we do total number of toffees is 24. there are six friends number of friends six so you divide 24 divide by six you get four toffees each four toffees for each fret so division is a sequence of repeated subtraction so we can see that without subtracting separately you can straight away divide so same question we can do 24 divide by 6 this way so we call this a simple division 24 6 you get 4 and the remainder is 0. so that means not remaining anything so just 4 you are getting this is called long division you divide this way so 6 times 4 24 and the remainder we call that's 0. so same way you can divide so either this simple division or long division look at this question if sunil has 
,,27 toffees after giving six of his friends equally how much is left so what's the remainder so if you are doing simple division what's 27 6 times 4 24 and 3 remaining so we can write the remaining part like this or if you are doing long division divide by 6 6 times 4 24 when you subtract you get 3 so this is called the remainder and this is the answer so he can give sunil can give four toffees each for six friends and remaining three toffees now when you are dividing by multiples of ten what happens you are just removing zeros if you are dividing by 10 you are removing 1 0 so you remove 1 0 the answer is 43 this answer divided by 10 means you are removing 1 0 answer is 60 this one remove 1 0 206 this one remove 1 0 170 when you are dividing by 100 you cross out two zeros divide by 100 that means 7 here remove this one 78 is the answer divide by 100 means remove two zeros that's 32. write the answer at once this is divided by ten one zero remove divide by hundred two zeros you remove divide by ten one zero remove divide by 10 1 0 you can remove divide by hundred two zeros you can remove divide by hundred two zeros divided by 10 means one 
,,zero you can remove divide by thousand means three zeros you can remove 785 divided by 5. so we'll do long division you write like this and divide by 5. 5 times 1 that's 5. so what's the remainder you get 2 now take the next digit 28 5 times 5 25 so when you subtract you get 3 here then take the next digit 35 5 times 7 35 so what's the remainder when you subtract you get 0 remainder so first 7 divide by 5 you get 1 and remainder 2 28 then divide by 5 you get 5 and remainder 3 then you do 35 35 divided by 5 you get 7 remainder 0. so the answer is 157 what's the remainder remainder is zero now we'll divide this one so what's the first step you can't divide 4 by 8 so you need 45 45 divided by 8 how many eights for 45 you get 8 times 540 so 5 so that's 5 45 that's 40 8 times 5 so what's the remainder remainder is 5 now take the next digit that's 56 how many 8s for 56 that's 7 8 times 7 56 and you get remainder 0. so what's the final answer answer is 57 and remainder 0 here nothing remaining look at this question if 987 biscuits are shared equally among 24 children how many biscuits does each child receive what is the remainder so that means 
,,you take 987 divide by equally divide by 24 how many 24's for 98 you need can we take four we can take four four times four sixteen one remaining four times two 8 8 
,,plus 1 9 now what's the remainder you get 2 so 7 is there so we will take the next digit for 27 how many 24's that's what what's the remainder now you get three remainder so number of biscuits for one child you can give 41 biscuits and number of remaining biscuits you get three it is decided to distribute 3068 kilograms of rice 
,,among 203 people who are destitute by floods how many kilograms of rice will each one receive what is the remain so what's the total 3068 and you have to divide this with 203 people so when you divide you can't divide 3 30 so you have to take the whole 306 so that's when you take 2 that's 400 something so that's 1 only 203. when you subtract these two you get 3 here and 103. now we need to find out for 138 how many 200 threes are there so what's the number if you put five you get less than 
,,this so this is 5. 5 times 3 15 5 times 2 10. so when you subtract you get 3 here and 2. so 23 remaining what's the answer then each receive 15 kilos so 15 times 203 you get something and what's the remainder 23 kilos remaining so you can't divide that in between 203 people so 23 kilos remaining in a 23 storey building each storey has an equal number of rooms if the building has 4991 rooms in all calculate the number of rooms in one store so what's the total number of rooms 4991 in each one there are 23. so there are 23 stories are there how you find out number of rooms in each story so you have to take 4991 divided by 23 23 times 2 you can do that so 
,,that's 46 subtract you get 39. for 39 that's 1 that's 23 remaining you get 16. 461 how many 23s 7 7 times 3 21 2 remaining 7 times 2 14 plus 2 16. so remainder is 0 
,,so that means how many rooms in each story there are 217 rooms this one in 36 boxes of pastel there is a total of 432 pastels how many pastels does each box contain 
,,so all together 432 so how many boxes are there 36. so how we find out number of pastels in each box you have to divide we'll use long division 36 times 1 is 36. when you subtract you get 7 for 72 how many 36 are there so you get 2. 2 times 6 12 and 2 times 3 6 plus 1 so so the remainder is 0. so number of pastas in each box that's 12. now we'll look at examples and exercises in your textbook example number one just add the two numbers so what we do we write in a column and add it seven plus three ten so one you take it to tens place eight plus two ten ten plus one eleven one you take it to hundredths place six plus one seven seven plus two nine this one eight plus six fourteen you take one to the next level five plus one six six plus two 8 9 plus 4 13 take 1 here 2 plus 1 3 3 plus 1 4 example number 3 add three numbers six seven six twelve twelve plus eight twenty take two seven plus two nine nine plus five fourteen and one consider in hundreds place four plus one five five 
,,plus three eight eight plus two ten and take one here one and one this becomes 2 in this one 7 plus 6 13 take 1 5 plus 1 6 6 plus 2 8 here and 1 there exercise 3.1 simplify the following all these are addition 5 plus 4 9 3 plus 2 5 9 plus two eleven take one six plus three nine seven plus five twelve take one here seven plus four eleven this one six plus two eight five plus two seven three plus one four five plus eight thirteen you take one here four and four eight four plus three seven eight plus seven fifteen take one ten plus nine nineteen take 1 there 6 plus 3 you get 9. this one add these two numbers 8 plus 9. 17 1 there 6 plus 2 8 plus 1 9 4 plus 7 11 this one add eight plus zero eight eight plus three eleven one you take there six plus four ten ten plus one eleven and take one two plus one three three plus 
,,one 4 9 plus 3 12 take 1 6 plus 8 14 take 1 there 8 plus 4 twelve and take one there so this becomes three this one six plus five eleven take one nine plus four 13 13 take 1 there so 10 you get and take 1 there so 2 plus 1 you get 3. now 3 numbers five plus nine fourteen fourteen plus one fifteen so one you need to take there eight plus seven fifteen plus one sixteen sixteen plus seven 23. so you take 2 to the next level 2 plus 3 5 5 plus 6 11 11 plus 1 12 here you get 9 plus 1 10 10 plus 7 17. take 1 there 10 and 1 11. another one here so you get 1 2 3. and 1 there simplify the following so you have given the addition this way so you write in a column and at you get 8 3 plus 2 5 43 plus 29 9 plus 3 12. 1 remaining so 5 plus 2 7 72 176 and 217 edit 6 plus 7 13 1 remaining 8 plus 1 9 and you get 3 here 352 and 189 
,,when you add it 9 plus two eleven one you take it to this level five plus one six six plus eight fourteen one take it to this level so you get four plus one five addition again so you write in a column and then at 7 plus 4 eleven take one nine plus five fourteen take one so nine plus one ten and take one there are two plus one three three plus one you get 4 395 and 1936 when you add it 5 plus 6 11 take 1. so 10 plus 3 13. take 1 there so 10 and take 1 there so what you get here 3 plus 1 4 4 plus 1 5 add these to 84 258 8 plus 4 12 take 1 there 9 nine plus five fourteen take one here two plus one three seven plus hundred ninety five seven plus 5 12 and 
,,1 you have to take it there 9 plus 1 10 and 1 take it here so 1 plus 1 2. some more addition 139 so 2875 so you have to write in a column 9 plus five fourteen one you take it there so ten plus one eleven one take it there eight plus one nine nine plus one ten so one here two plus one you get three this one three numbers thousand nine hundred eighty seven thirty six and hundred and seventy one all addition six plus one seven seven and seven fourteen one there so nine nine plus ten nineteen take one so ten plus one eleven take one there one and one you get two this one three numbers 657 eleven thousand three hundred and eighty nine and sixty four thousand seven 721 add all these numbers 10 10 plus 7 17. you take 1 here then 8 plus 2 10 ten plus six sixteen take one here six plus three nine nine plus one ten ten plus seven seventeen another one here four plus one five five plus one 6 and 6 plus 1 you get 7 76 767. there are 486 boys and 658 girls in a certain school how many students are there in total so you have to add number of boys 486 number of girls 658 total number you need to add 8 plus 6 40. let's take one there 9 plus five fourteen take one there six plus four ten ten plus one eleven thousand one hundred and forty four is the total number of students in that school question number four in january 1846 coconuts were plucked from the coconut trees in a certain estate and in march another thousand 1384 coconuts were plucked how many coconuts were plucked in total during the two months so january number of coconuts in january that's 1805 number of coconuts in march you get 1384 you need total number so add it 10 write down the answer 6 plus 4 10. you take 1 there 8 plus 4 12 12 1 13 take one there nine plus three twelve take one there one plus plus one plus one you get three three 
,,thousand two hundred and thirty coconuts all together the number of shoes manufactured by a certain company during the month january february and march were given how many shoes were manufactured in total so you can write number of shows in january so you get 1395 number of shows in february 1426 number of shoes in much 1737. so you can find out the total total number of shoes is addition of all three numbers so edit 6 plus 5 11 eleven plus seven eighteen and one you take it there ten plus 
,,two twelve twelve plus three fifteen and one you take it there four plus four eight 8 plus 7 15 take 1 there so you get 2 plus 1 3 3 plus 1 4 4 58 number of shoes all together nimal who is businessman received an income of 810 rupees on the first day an income of 985 on the second day and an income of 1130 on the third day what 
,,was his total income during the three days income first day what's the income eight hundred and ten rupees income second day nine hundred and income on the third day thousand one hundred thirty so what's the total total means addition you add these three numbers you get five nine nine plus three twelve one you take it up ten plus eight eighteen eighteen plus one nineteen and one there one and one becomes two so total is two thousand nine hundred and twenty five rupees question number seven 
,,if 974 milk bottles were collected at a certain collection center on monday and if 103 more milk bottles were collected on tuesday then on monday then how many bottles of milk were collected in total on the two days so number of bottles on monday that's 974 how we find out number of bottles on tuesday you need to do it separately 103 more than monday so 974 plus 103 you get 1077. now we can find our total number is just adding these two 7 plus 4 11 and 1 there 7 plus 7 14 plus 1 15 and 1 you take it up 1 plus 9 10 and 1 and 1 becomes 2 2051 bottles all together example number one simplify the following now you get subtraction so here 6 minus 1 becomes 
,,five seven minus four that's three it's easy you can subtract straight away four minus three you get one five minus two three three minus one two 2 231 this one 7 minus 2 5 5 minus 3 2 2 minus 1 is 1 4 minus 2 you get 2 there exercise 3.2 simplify the following just subtract 5 minus 3 you get 2 3 minus 2 1 8 minus 3 seven minus 
,,five two four minus one three five minus one four seven minus four three nine minus three six three minus two 1. this one you can't subtract 8 from 2. so you have to take 1 from there so 12 minus 8 becomes 4. so this becomes 6 6 minus 3 you get 3 what about this one take 1 from here 16 minus 9 so what is 16 minus 9 you get 7 then this becomes 6 6 minus 2 you get 4 and here what's the number here so this is 5 minus 1 you get what about this one take 1 from here 12 minus 5 that's 7. so this becomes 4. so 14 minus 7 is 7. this becomes 2 again 2 minus 1 is 1. so if you are not sure you can add and see 7 plus 5 12 and 14 plus 1 15 and you get this number when you add the other two look at this question you have to subtract 9 from 4 you can't do that you'd have to take 1 from there 14 minus 9 that's 5. so this becomes 0 now so take another one here 10 minus 5 is 5 this becomes 7 7 minus 3 you get 4 six minus three three and here you have to take one from here ten minus seven that's three so this becomes four four minus two two this one you can't subtract 5 from 2 so you take 1 from here so here you have to take 1 here and from there 1. so 12 minus 5 7 and here this becomes 9 now 9 minus 3 6 this becomes 5 5 minus 4 that's what so check it again 7 plus 5 12 and then 10 so that's correct this one can you subtract 4 from 0 no you have to take 1 from here 1 from there so 10 minus 4 this is 6. so this becomes now 9 9 minus 5 4. this becomes 6 6 minus 3 three here you need to subtract four from one you can't you take one from there eleven minus four that's seven so this becomes seven seven minus five that's two then four minus one is 
,,three seven minus two five can you subtract eight from one you can't you have to take one from here so we are taking one from there eleven minus eight three and here it becomes nine nine minus five four now this is one you can't subtract seven from one so you take one from here eleven minus seven that's four so this becomes three three minus one you get two this one you can't subtract six from 3 so you have to take 1 from there 13 minus 6 that's 7 this becomes 1 so take 1 from here and 1 from there so you get 11 11 minus 9 that's 2. now we can take this one as 9 9 minus 4 that's 5. so this is 2 minus 1 1 check it again when you add these two you are getting this one 6 plus 7 13 and 1 remaining 10 plus 2 12 1 remaining you get 10 and 1 remaining so you get 3023 when you add the other two numbers this one you can't 
,,subtract 8 from 0. so you have to take from here 1 here 1 here and then 1 there so 10 minus 8 10 minus 8 is 2. this becomes 9 now 9 minus 5 4 and here this is 9 again because you took 1 from there 9 minus 3 6 this becomes 5 5 minus 2 that's 3 add it and see 10 and when you take 1 10 again when you take 1 10 again 3 plus 2 5 plus 1 6 so you get this answer simplify the following now you have to subtract so you can write in a column now subtract can we subtract 7 from 2 no you can take 1 from there 12 minus 7 5 this becomes 7 now 7 minus 5 2 and 7 minus 2 you get 5. 524 minus 175 then you subtract what you get take 1 from here 14 minus 5 9 and this becomes 1 now you take 1 from here 11 minus 7 this becomes 4 4 minus 1 you get 3 631 subtract 58. so take one from here 11 11 minus 8 2. so this becomes 2. so you can't subtract 5 from 2 you take 1 there so 12 minus 5 that's 7. so this becomes 5. 246 minus 89. can you subtract 9 from 6 you can't so you take 1. 16 minus 9. that's 7. so this becomes 3 13 minus 8 that's 5 and this becomes 1. 3532 minus 785 you can't subtract 5 from 2 you take 1. 12 minus 5 that's 7. so this becomes 2 now 12 minus 8 that's 4 this is now 4 14 minus 7 is 7 this is 2. another one 4 000 minus 356 you can't subtract so you take 1 here 1 here and 1 10 minus 6 that's 4. this becomes nine nine minus five that's four this is also nine nine minus three is six and this becomes three so when you add it you are getting four thousand question number three if nimal who took 475 coconuts was able to sell 297 of them how many coconuts were remaining so remaining means this is subtraction so total number of coconuts that's 475 he sold 297 297 so the remaining number of coconuts you subtract so how we subtract you have to take 1 from here 15 minus 7 that's 8. this becomes 6 16 minus 9 that's seven so this is three now three minus two 178 coconuts are remaining question number four if there were 192 males in a gathering of 300 people how many females were there so total is there so you need to subtract the two numbers total given as 300 number of meals given as 192 when you subtract this number you get number of females so subtract you need to take 1 from here 1 from there 10 minus 2 8 this becomes 9 9 minus 9 0 and here 2 minus 1 1. question number five in a certain 
,,factory 1450 cars were manufactured in 2013 and 232 cars were manufactured in 2014. how many more cars were manufactured in 2014 than in 2013. this is also subtraction so you can first find out cars in 2014 so what's the number 2325 cars manufactured in 2015 that's 1450. so to find out how many cars more in 2014 you need to subtract the two values y minus 0 is 5. then you can't subtract 5 from 2. so you take 1. 12 minus 5 that's 7. this becomes 2 now take 1 12 minus 4 you get 8. so 1 minus 
,,1 that's 0. so all together 875 cars are extra in 2000 15 here not 15 what's the year given this is 13 2013 and 2014. so how many cars more in 2014 than 2013 that's 
,,875. question number six heishan received 325 from his father and 430 from his mother if he bought a pair of slippers for 149 and a book for 225 from this money how 
,,much money was left over so what's the total given by father and mother total money so you need to first add and get the total money from father 325 and from his mother 430 rupees that's the total five five and seven 755 rupees are there so he bought pair of slippers and a book so what's the total cost total cost for both book and the pair of slippers 149 and 225 so that's also you need to add 9 plus 5 40 1 remaining 5 plus 2 7 and 2 plus 1 3. now when you subtract these two you get the remaining money so money was left over so left over you can find out by subtracting he had 755 rupees and he spent 374 rupees for slippers and a book so when you subtract get 1 15 minus 7 is 8 and this is 6 6 minus 3 3. so the left over is 381 rupees so look at this one when the three groups of five are separated into groups of three we obtain five groups so three into five you get fifteen or you can split like this 5 into 3 groups that's also 50. so a multiplication table of the whole numbers from 0 to 9 is given below so you need to know the multiplication so here 0 times 0 now look at this one 5 times 3 here so you get 15. and again you get 15 that's three times five can you see this one if you take six six times two 12 2 times 6 or 6 times 2 you get 12. now when you look at the table you get all same number twice and here 10 10 so diagonally can you see a pattern 18 18 then 14 14 8 8 so this side and this side is the same exercise 3.3 obtain the following products using the 
,,multiplication table given above 3 times 4 so that means 3 into 4 that's 12. 7 times 3 7 times 3 21 8 times 0 8 times 0 you'll get 0. 9 times 6 that's this number 54 evaluate the following so we can use the multiplication table 42 times 3. so we can multiply like this so 3 times 2. so three times two six three times four three times four twelve so hundred twenty six this one 122 times four four times two that's eight four times two again eight four times one four then third one 78 times 7 7 times 8 what's 7 times 8 56 you put 6 there take 5 here 7 times 7 49 49 plus 5 you get 54. then part 4 you need 96 times 9 9 times 6 you get 54. 5 remaining 9 times 9 81 81 plus 5 8 6 so 864 evaluate 64 and 36 now two numbers how we find the multiplication 36 you can do 30 and 6 or 6 30 other way round also possible so how you 
,,do 30 put a 0 and multiply by 3 3 times 4 12 1 remaining 3 times 6 18 plus 1 90 6 times 4 24 remain 6 times 6 36 plus 2 38. so when you add these two you get the answer 8 plus 2 10 1 remaining 10 plus 3 13 1 remaining and you get 2 157 multiplied by 52 have you multiplied by 52 50 and then by 2. so how do you multiply by 50 put 
,,a 0 and multiply by 5 5 times 7 35 3 remaining 5 times 5 25 plus 3 28 2 remaining 5 times 1 5 5 plus 2 7. now multiply this by 2 2 times 7 14. one remaining two times five ten ten plus one eleven one remaining two times one two two plus one three so when you add it you get 8164 exercise 3.4 fill in the blanks multiplied by multiples of 10 so what you do we put zeros multiply by 10 means put a zero and multiply by one you get 30 multiplied by 100 means you put two zeros and multiply by one seventy two multiply by thousand means put three zeros and multiply by one it's 54. multiply by hundred put two zeros and you get 39 here 430 given so that means this is multiplied by 10 1 0 is there two zeros there that means multiplied by hundred zero's there so that means this number is 29 so two zeros there so what's the answer that means put two zeros and you get two four five zero multiplied by one here three zeros are there two zeros here so that means multiplied by another one zero multiplied by ten three zeros there so this should be 40 to get four zeros fill in the blanks using suitable values this is multiplication so this means three and ten this is three this is ten three times two six and three times five fifteen multiply by ten means put a zero and multiply by one one times two two one times five five now add it 6 7 6 here multiplied by 24 means 4 and 20 4 times 8 32 3 remaining 4 times 7 28 plus 3 30 multiply by 20 means put a 0 and multiply by 2 2 times 8 16 1 remaining 2 times 7 14 plus 1 15. now add it you get 2 7 8 1 this is 32 how you multiply it by 32 30 and 2 2 times 6 12 1 remaining 2 times 3 6 plus 1 7 2 times 1 2 multiplied by 30 means put a zero and multiply by three three times six eighteen one remaining three times three nine plus one ten one remaining three times one three plus one four now add it you get 8 plus 7 15 1 remaining this becomes 3 simplify the following so that's again multiplication how you get 21 20 and 1. so 1 times

,,20 schools how many shares will each school get so this is also division so 6480 divided by 20 scores 20 times 3 you get 60. remainder 4. for 48 how many 20s for 48 
,,that's 2 2 times 2 4 that's 40. so remainder is 8. for 80 this is 4 4 times 2 8 so you put a 0. so the remainder is 0. so how many shares you can give for each school so that's 324 chairs cheers number of chairs per school is equal to 324 question number five if the cakes of soap in 12 boxes each containing 25 cakes of soap are 
,,divided equally among 15 employees how many cakes of soap will each employee get so there are 12 boxes each containing 25 so you need to find out total number of cakes of soap total number of soups 12 boxes each box 25 that's multiplication so multiply 25 by 12 that means 10 and 2 multiply by 1 and multiply by 2. add it together you get 300. all together now you have to divide this equally with 15 employees so that means divide by 15 15 times 230 and you put a zero so 20. so you can say number of soaps each employee get number of so per person you can say per person that's 20 each miscellaneous exercise the number of people who visited an art exhibition on the first three days of the exhibition was respectively 1320 567 1624 how many people in total visited the art exhibition on these three days total means addition so you can find out total number this is equal to 1320 that's first day second day 1567 third day 1624 just add all these together you get the total 7 plus 4 11 and 1 remaining 6 plus 2 9 plus 1 6 plus 2 8 8 plus 1 9 9 plus 2 11 and 1 here you get 4 4 plus 5 9 9 plus 6 15 and 1 here you get 1 2 3 4. so total number is four thousand five hundred eleven question number two a factory produced three thousand seven hundred eighty eight yogurts during the first week and four thousand one hundred and twenty four yogurts during the second week how many more yogurts were produced in the second week than the first week so we have to take the difference so number of extra yogurts is equal to so second day it's more second week 4124 minus 3788 you subtract to get the difference you can't subtract 8 from 4 you take 1. 14 minus 8 6. this is 10 this is 1 11 minus is 3 and this becomes 0 0 means 10 minus 7 3 so this is 3 minus 3 0. you and then see whether you get this number 8 plus six fourteen nine plus three twelve and then eight plus three eleven and you get four thousand one hundred and twenty five so the answer is three hundred and thirty six question number three there are 10 identical book tracks in a library each book rack contains 5 shelves 30 books are placed on each of these shelves how many books are there in total in the library in these 10 book tracks so you need to read it carefully 10 identical book cracks in a library each book crack contain five shells so five shelves racks all together 10 and 30 books are placed on each of these shelves books 30 for 1. so how many books are all together so you can multiply all these numbers together total number of books so you can find out first how many books in one rack that's 5 times 30 and there are 10 racks so you multiply this by 10. so 
,,here multiply by 100 to two zeros and multiply this by five times three you get fifteen so thousand five hundred books all together question number four a man needs 
,,to plant 152 coconut plants however he is able to plant only eight per day how many days will he require to plant all 152 of them this is division so you have to divide and find out how many days so we can say number of days needed is 152 divided by 8. so you do long division 152 divided by 8 8 times 1 8 7 remaining for 72 this 
,,is 9. so no remainder so that means he needs 19 days to plant all these 152 coconut trees question number five it is required to bring 740 cement banks to a cement sales center the maximum number of cement bags that can be transported in a vehicle is 24. find the number of trips the vehicle needs to make to bring all the cement 
,,bags to the center so that means this is also division so how many trips number of trips is equal to 740 divided by 24 because each vehicle only 24 7 bags we can transport so we'll do long division so 140 divided by 24 24 times 3 72. then subtract this one 20. so again 3 times 4 12 3 times 2 6 plus 1 7. so 20. so that means you 
,,can't take this one so that means what's the answer there are 20 again remaining but what happens when you take this one so you have to transport all cement bags so 
,,30 here and another extra 20 you need to transport so 31 trips you need so here 20 remaining 20 cement bags remaining so 30 trips all together but we need to transport this 20 as well so all together how many trips so number of trips should be one more than that number of trips is 31 this 30 and to transport this extra 20 cement bags you need another one trip so all together 31. so in this lesson we covered all theory related to all basic operations addition subtraction multiplication and division only for whole numbers so practice and identify where you use addition and where you use subtraction division and multiplication

Operations of While number,WBwPhWAP394,I am welcome to samples for school heart dissection so today we're going to be looking at the pig's hearts and we're going to be looking at all the components that make up how this muscly organ works to Punk blood around the body we're using a pig's hearts because it's relatively similar in size to an average human heart which is about the same as your fists so if we look at this muscly organ we can see that there are a number of blood vessels coming out of the surface we're going to be cutting open into the four different chambers of the heart to look at what each section does now if we look at the outside of the heart we can see just where top surface lies is where the atria would have been these have been trimmed off so that we can see the details of the inner cavity so we're going to make our first incision onto this side of the heart parallel to the coronary artery and the coronary artery is the main blood supply to the heart tissue itself so the heart has its own supply of oxygen and glucose when we make this incision in here we're going to be cutting into the most muscular part of the heart which is the left ventricle and the left side pumps blood around the entire body out of the blood vessel called the aorta so our first incision will be parallel to the coronary artery straight through the 
,,muscle see as you start to cut it open it's thick muscle tissue so it may need more than one cut and you can see the depth of the ventricle they're incredibly thick 
,,firm muscular piece of tissue and we take our scissors and we continue that incision straight up to the top of the heart let me go into the remainder of the atrium and we see once we cut this ventricle open the cavity on the inside and the sheer depth of the muscle tissue we can also see if we clean away some of the remaining debris the tenderness hardcourts now these are there to attach the heart valve to the tissue of the muscle and those heart valves are incredibly important in maintaining uni-directional flow of blood around the body the second incision we're going to make is going to be into the right ventricle and again take the scissors to cut up towards the atria and in there we can see the right ventricle of the heart much slimmer muscle wall because the right side of the heart is only pumping blood to the lungs so the blood is pumped under much lower pressure so if we go back to the blood vessels that we can see at the top of the heart we can use a seeker or a finger to put a finger down the vessel to see where the chamber ends so if we go down this blood vessel it comes out into the left ventricle the thick chunky ventricle so that must be our aorta who's going to pump blood around the entire body if we were to explore the other blood vessel which is much thin it goes straight into the right ventricle the thinner less muscular ventricle so that must be the pulmonary artery that's going to transport blood from the heart to the lungs now in order to stop blood flowing back into the atria each of these ventricles have a valve valves are there to stop backflow of blood and to maintain unidirectional blood flow sometimes there are heart problems that mean the valves don't work properly they either don't revert back to their original shape or they become loose and we can replace 
,,those valves either biologically or mechanically if we look back at the surface of the heart with the coronary artery a common defect that you might see here is coronary heart disease and that's when these arteries become blocked with layers of fatty deposits now in order to treat that medical condition you can have a stent put 
,,in which keeps that artery open and maintains blood supply to your heart so in order for your heart to pump the blood around the body you need to maintain that heart rate and resting heart rate is maintained by a little bunch of cells in the right atria that signals when the heart needs to beat now if you need to increase your heart rate because your body needs more oxygen or more glucose then adrenaline is released from your adrenal glands it's what causes that fight-or-flight reaction and it will increase your heart rate to provide more oxygen glucose to your body if you'd like to know more about heart dissections then see our website for lesson plans and risk assessments thank you for watching you

Operations of While number,GUCcsMmZVec,ah what are you doing I'm going to perform an illusion Zahn it's not a magic trick it's science it's an optical illusion can I keep wearing my cape no go and get changed our optical illusion is going to show how your brain processes visual information here we've got a lovely batch of fresh cupcakes but which of the two middle cakes is bigger first up is Grace this cake is worth a pound how much will you pay for that cake you think a pound 30 so you think it's about 30% bigger paper it is the more it should cut yummy more yumminess mallya eNOS you pay for the yumminess so you're sure that that cake is about 1/3 bigger than that cake on the left okay if 
,,this yummy cake is a pound how much would people pay for this even yummier and pay a pound fifty Wow one pound 75 do you think that one is 75 P bigger than that one 
,,I'd say 2 pounds as well it's taller bigger well if you said you'd pay more for the bigger cake on the Left you'd be out of pocket because believe it or not that the same size Gracie what would you say if I told you those two cakes are exactly the same size so why do you think that one looks bigger yep they've got it this trick 
,,is known as the piping house illusion it demonstrates that our brain doesn't see the size of things as they really are but rather as they appear compared to what's around them both cakes are exactly the same size but the one on the left appears larger because it's surrounded by smaller cakes right so let's take the trait further down the street and see if we can find some more volunteers for our experiment wait a minute the middle cakes have gone No you've got loads there surely you can spare me one ordinarily Chris I'd love to but these have got to last me all the way to lunchtime till lunchtime but you're never going to eat all those before lunchtime gone give me one all right I tell you what you can have one brilliant you can have one if you can grab it for me now I'm gonna give you a head start put your hand there your hands closer than mine and all you have to do is grab it when I say go looks like I'm gonna get my sweet after all three two one go that is an amazing trick do you think I can do it oh I think so it is an amazing trick isn't it it's great I mean you gonna try it myself all right good luck wait a minute he needs one sweet to do the trick what am I gonna eat until lunch I've headed to a town center to see how many sweets I can win time to see if I'm as good at this as doctors and and medicine mines now do you reckon you can get the sweet before me if we both go on go definitely you sure of that 3 2 1 go what am I gonna do with all my sweet so I keep winning every time go go miles away now although all these people had quick reaction times they're not gonna be and that's because there is a slight delay in the word go leaving my mouth getting into their ears being processed in their brain and then their hand moving there's my brain cuz I've said it my hand starts to move immediately without any delay no matter how small well that's my mind bent is yours your body is an amazing machine but it can't do anything without your brain now your brain is what makes you you but it also tells the different parts of your body what to do so if I want to move my fingers I have to send an electrical signal from here to here and that moves really fast it goes at over 250 miles an hour that's faster than a Formula One racing track so we want to know more about where in the brain these signals come from and in order to do that we're gonna use this multi pulse transcranial magnetic stimulator it's a big magnet but it's a cool big magnet it sends electromagnetic pulses to the brain which interfere with the brains own electrical signals and that means we can use it to work out which bit of the brain does what let's give this brain scrambler awhile Chris what I want you to do first of all to reach up with your left hand and pick your nose all right perfect did it perfectly without slobber now I'm gonna get you to do the same thing again but this time I'm gonna try and interfere with the brain scrambler so Chris when you're 
,,ready pick your nose every time Chris's finger Wiggles that's the magnet or brain scrambler interfering with his brain signals which means he can't pick his nose properly you miss but the magnetic brain scrambler is also showing us which part of Chris's brain controls his left and on the right side of Chris's body but it's his left hand that's twitching now that's because your brain is why back to front so the right side of his brain controls the left side of his body and vice-versa so let's now try it on the other side and you're ready to go so now I'm interfering that the left side of Chris's brain and look his right hand is all over the place I feel like a cup of tea sounds lovely actually it's me that's drinking the tea and it's cold tea but you'll see why I reckon we can have a bit of fun with this brain scrambled there it goes the brain scrambler is interfering with our brains normal signals and it's creating a right mess ever wondered why you have to go to sleep ever heard someone snore so loudly the room rumbles we're about to tell you why this is a case for investigation ouch you spend a third of your life doing absolutely nothing but hardly call picking my nose nothing talking with your disgusting person levels I'm talking about sleep all animals do it including us and it's essential for life so to find out more about it we're going to bed to discover what happens when we sleep we're spending the night in this special sleep clinic but first we need to get wired up by a team of sleep experts all this equipment will give us information about what our bodies do when we sleep because you're also gonna have your bear 
,,wired up course I am mr. grumble has a lot of trouble sleeping sometimes monitoring us will be sleep expert dr. Webb dammit so sleep is not just sleep there are different types of sleep absolutely and some of the types of sleep relax your brain and recharge that and other types of sleep we've charged your body basically yes and 
,,that's what we that's why we need sleep right Chris eyes on it's time for us to go to sleep doctor wah headsets the computers up to record the night ahead and I'm hoping this will prove once and for all that Xan snores he's always denied it mr. grumbles knows I never snore though mr. grumbles in a single night your brain cycles 
,,through different types of sleep every 90 minutes until you get up you'll start with a light sleep this lasts around 20 minutes and your breathing and heart rate slow down you can still be easily woken at this stage then you fall into a deep asleep it's at this stage where some people walk or talk in their sleep because their body is still active even though their brain is resting and then you start REM sleep which stands for rapid eye movement it's in this stage where your brain is organizing itself and you'll have a dream or two and then your body repeats this sleep cycle about four or five times in a night next morning and it's time to get up other 
,,people say I snore but I really maintain that I don't I think they're all liars all will be revealed shortly zart I didn't sleep very well at all we're both looking 
,,a bit weary oh dear let's find out why we're both so tired press this line here thus for when you were awake and then here you slept that's difference the stage' and then here you were awake and then you slept again and then you were awake in terms of a good night's sleep I only had what two and a half hours although I was in bed for six hours I mean he was actually asleep for two and a half and then there's just not enough and not as my body feel very tired my brain feels really thick headed and unarrested as well so how did mine compare to Chris's you had more sleep and how long did I sleep four and a half hours so I got twice as much sleep as you but even poor our sleep isn't enough for your body to rest especially when you're young children need at least eight hours because you're still growing and your body needs to work harder Chris and I are adults and we can get away with less but it still makes us feel very tired what about dreaming how do we compare on that well with Chris I don't think you had a dream at all exam jihad too although I had a full sleep cycle it was pretty restless and I just didn't dream which can happen sometime look at this section of the graph I had lots of rapid eye movements and this suggests that I was dreaming how long the dreams the dreams or one of them is half an 
,,hour was half an hour really yes an hour of dreaming what about snoring you do the snore so I did okay zoned there's the proof you do snore oh dear how much of the time was I snoring 7% of the nights not everyone snores like me but people who do snore can't move air freely through their nose or mouth during sleep so the air vibrates against the relaxed muscles in their throat and nose and that's what makes that snoring sound you sleep for a third of your life but you're not doing nothing while that's going on you're recharging your brain and you'll recharging your body so if you don't get enough sleep that's gonna affect everything you do and you'll feel absolutely rubbish accident in emergency departments doctors and nurses need to act fast especially when things like this happen in Manchester six-year-old Rosie 
,,has been brought in by ambulance with a potentially serious head injury in fact head injuries can be so serious that the hospital has a trauma team of 12 doctors and nurses on standby in case Rosie needs to have surgery or further tests speed is vital so everyone is ready for action Rosie didn't recognize me at all and really looked quite unwell it was very worrying that I wasn't able to console her because she didn't know who I was luckily she recognizes her dad now but what actually happened Rosie and her friends were playing tack in the playground she and her friend were running away in different directions to escape being tagged but they were concentrating so hard on escaping but when they changed directions they headed straight towards each other and whack they both banged heads hard time for a trip to the hospital ouch meet professor Simon Carly he's heading up the trauma team okay did you get a glucose yes it was a point for thank you very much you don't but it sounds 
,,from the paramedics that her behavior has not been normal and she's been vomiting several times what the team's worried about at the moment is whether or not she's got any bleeding inside her skull that might be pressing on the brain and causing the significant brain damage professor Simon we'll need to do a thorough examination of Rosie's head but in the meantime he prescribed some sophisticated emergency medicine cuddles and luckily there's a professor of cuddle ology on-hand dad time now for Rosie's special test on her head it's called a CT scan it's a bit like an x-ray and the images will show professor Simon the details of Rosie's brain and skull 
,,to help him check for damage that's nice and competitive nice penny dad look at this I want to take this home it's so actually the penny means dad can stay in the room with Rosie because it protects his body from the x-rays a few snaps later and the results are in this is Rosie's brain so how's it looking yeah looks like a normal skull a normal brain there's no evidence that we can see at this time of any bleeding at all and that's great yep it's a huge relief for Rosie's mum and dad and it means the reason she's been feeling unwell is because she's got concussion inside your head your brain is surrounded by fluid to protect it but sometimes when you bang your head high your brain moves about and knocks into the size of your skull this can make you feel confused unwell and be sick but in Rosie's case these symptoms soon disappear and after a few hours rest there's been a transformation yep believe it or not this is the same girl back to normal and ready to leave the hospital 
,,"this has been quite an experience for Rosie and her family but thanks to the skilled trauma team she's got her groove back hi Rosie did you know there are 100,000 miles of blood vessels in your brain that's enough to go around the earth four times wow that's amazing and so's this in an ordinary city high above the streets lies the deserted urban playground waiting a prime performance ready to see some serious skills this is John Phan worth and he's a football freestyling genius he holds five World Records and can do 107 Shin keepy uppies in a minute his specialities also include Toki peopies around the world the side to side on head and he'll keep you "
,,up ease this keepy-uppy King trains for more than 40 hours a week and he's completed the London Marathon whilst keeping the ball in the air so how does Jon's amazing body do this believe it or not the secret to Jon's success lies in his brain a certain tricks are higher than others but they all require a lot of concentration to 
,,do when it comes to the brain upfront is the big lad the cerebrum that's what allows you to think make decisions and learn the cerebrum houses the motor cortex it's 
,,the midfield maestro pulling all the strings telling our muscles to move when we want them to playing at the back there's the cerebellum crucial for balance and coordination it's the big match player with a vital role in everything you're seeing right now now that's amazing we have our ball but please mister yes get off okay what about this no but get off I don't like it we all experience pain you've got over three million pain receptors throughout your body but some areas like this have more receptors than other areas like this now I know I shouldn't be pinching things on it but it was all to explain pain receptors pain receptors are specialized nerve endings there exist messengers so when they detect something painful they tell your brain your hurt pain can be really useful sometimes because it stops you accidentally damaging your body but why is it we feel pain differently in different situations sometimes you can stub your toe and be in terrible agony other times you cut 
,,yourself really badly playing football and you don't notice till the end of the match and that's because pain is in your brain this means that you can reduce the amount of pain you experience and we're gonna show you how but before I show you this clever trick I'm going to inflict a little bit of pain on sand so that we can see 
,,how a person reacts normally oh good this is heat stimulation thermo it's a pain machine I'm gonna put it on the backers arms hand and turn up the temperature and Tennie can't stand it anymore and I'm gonna do the same to him and we'll see you can take more pain dramatics this medical device is used by scientists to test people's sensitivity the end of the rod will get increasingly hot the more I turn this dial up it won't burn but let's see how much heat Zhaan can take by letting his body 
,,send pain signals to his brain just like normal get ready zond yep yet put your hand back right so that's the temperature on of the probe things start turning it out remember we can only do this because we're doctors yeah it's warm now let's turn it up a bit more I can definitely feel that there's a hot thing ah yeah yeah okay and a bit more again ah haha so that's really burning now yeah Saunders managed to stand the pain up to a temperature of forty five point two degrees it was definitely painful it wasn't just you kind of wimping out no it's painful it was getting more painful and there was definitely a moment where it just suddenly was just like oh no I won't take my hand away now that's too painful okay am I go now now I'm gonna try the same thing on press only I've got a trick up my sleeve I'm gonna distract my brain and that means I should be able to take more pain meds and so let's see how long Chris can last Chris this is gonna hurt you a lot more than just can hurt me we'll see about that I need to use the different techniques on I'm gonna distract myself and I'm gonna really pretend that this doesn't hurt and I reckon I can take real pain I'm on a beach what a really sunny beach they'd be really good you're not on a beach Chris you're in a lab with a red-hot probe sticking into your hands nor red-hot it's barely hot is it on how's that Beach feeling now the beach is quite hot now so let me tell you how you did forty eight point two degrees that meets you by three degrees no yeah really yeah there's obviously no way I could have gone another three degrees yeah really does work so next time you've got to go to the doctors and have an injection try it and see how you get on yes it's a clever trick if you think of something relaxing you'll find it easier to cope with pain don't feel a thing good morning Amy good morning you're late it's nice to meet you it's nice to meet you see where this is going yes and it's nice to meet you I didn't just bring my fake hands to fool Chris we're going to be using them for today's mind-bending trick so can you put your hand right there neck as if as if that was your other hand basically and then stick your other hand under the cloth yep that's perfect so it's next to that hand today's trick is going to show how what you see affects how you feel we're stroking the person's real hand behind the screen at the same time as stroking the fake hand which is in front of them is that plastic hand beginning to feel like your hand yeah keep the key on it it feels right are you feeling like I'm brushing your hands ready it's my hand now we've got the illusion going it's time to see how they react with a fake spider on the fake hand really nicely on your hand stay focused on our hands so we managed to trick plenty of people but how does it work there's a bit of your brain called the premotor cortex and that brings together your senses of touch of position and of vision so that your body 
,,can figure out what's happening in the world around it and what's so interesting about this experiment is that your sense of vision is the most important sense and so your brain actually temporarily rewires itself to adopt the plastic hand as your own amazing well Chris fooling all those people has tired me out give his hand son I'm not falling for the old fake hand trick again zhan what an earth you doing Chris now I'm about to meet two ice skaters from CBBC's eye Stars and I'm trying to figure out how they do their amazing spins you're not gonna wear that are you of course I it was very expensive don't you like it no I do I like it very much I just think you don't want to embarrass the skaters because they might not have any clothing that's quite so so sparkly sparkly exactly yeah that would be dad to embarrass 
,,them I'll go and change well that saved him from embarrassing both of us ouch meet Chloe and Alexia they start in CBBC's ice stars they can spin on the ice at incredible speeds without getting dizzy and falling over I thought you'd never ask I'm gonna come to comes inside of you okay so Bend now my problem is that I'm already dizzy and then you've got a skate off and keep that I can like maybe a little more practice will help me out I think I'd better leave this to the professionals so when you're doing your spins how many times do you think you go around maybe about 25 yeah maybe more you've got complete turns around and at the end of that do you feel dizzy at all then really half the time super dizzy yes thankfully now I know you thought I was brilliant but I actually can't compete with Alexia and Chloe on the ice so I've got a little experiment to see how we all deal with dizziness the safety of dry land right you ready we're each going to do a spin followed by the simple 
,,task of walking to the table and pouring a glass of water let's see how I fare against these - okay that wasn't very successful okay and you ready okay go let's see 
,,how the ice skaters do oh wow Wow what nothing so that's why I couldn't do the spins on the ice Bobby isn't it that's pretty the only reason when you spin around the fluid in your inner ear spins Toki when you stop spinning the fluid keeps moving but your eyes tell you that you're still and that makes you feel dizzy thus cases are brilliant at dealing with the effects of spinning but how do they do it I've come to meet dr. Barry C Mangal one of the country's top experts in dizziness now all of us know what dizziness feels like don't we but for some people it can actually be quite a serious problem Cantor if that happens to you out of the blue when you're not expecting you this can be due to problems in the inner ear or the brain I know you've done a study on ballet dancers why have you studied them ballet dancers 
,,have actually been training for most of their life and that suppresses their sensations of dizziness so what are those brain mechanisms that allow ballet dance to not feel dizzy we can understand that we can use that to treat patients this is doctor Barry's dizzy lab the most important pose of it is this a special chair that allows dr. Barry to see how different people deal with dizziness he's going to run some tests on me and the ice stars to see how differently our bodies cope this experiment will be conducted in the dark so I can't see when I'm turning after just under a minute in the chair something very strange happens I feel completely still it's really interesting like I would I would absolutely promise you that I'm not moving yeah now that's because the fluid in the canals in the inner ear and now moving together with your skull what we're going to do we're going to stop the chair it just feels like I'm definitely moving in the opposite direction the fluid in my inner ears is still spinning and you can see from my eyes flicking but my brain still thinks I'm moving now it's the girls turn let's see if when the chair stops they still think they're moving well well done okay you feel like you're spinning you don't I've never seen anyone with zero response but she just isn't getting busy at all 
,,when the chase stopped you were feeling as if you were turning for more than half a minute these guys were right they felt no sensation of self motion because their 
,,brains are better than yours and suppressing dizziness right finger finger to smug thank you Alexia and Chloe dr. Berry's research has shown that the part of the brain which deals with dizziness is actually smaller in people who train to spin like Chloe and Alexia incredible what's amazing about this is it could have very real medical benefits if dr. berry can train people's brains to cope with dismiss it could really help them live better lives right I'm off to practice my spinning around 
,,I'm not sure that's how you do it aren't here at the brain cut room at University College London and I'm about to get very close to a real human brain this is not for the squeamish we've got the exclusive access to this human brain to show you all its inner workings this organ controls every single thing you do even now your brain is busy sending messages all over your body now this brain it feels rubbish because it's been preserved but the brain inside your head right now is soft and squishy that's because our brains are actually made up of 75% water and the rest is mostly flat the average a dog brain weighs one and a half kilos that's as much as three tins of baked beans try picking them up and you'll see how much weight and neck has to carry but there's more to find out than that so let's pick the brains of a specialist meet dr. Helen Ling a brain doctor or neurologist so Helen why does the brain look like this why is it all wrinkly well the service of our brain effect you folded these phones and grooves increase the surface area of our brain so if we unfolded all this it would be enormous and we'd need a head the size of a surfboard 
,,how does the brain sit inside the skull is it just resting gently on the bones Oh our brain is like she's surrounded by a clear colorless fluid and it's like a cushion that protects the brain just like when you're at the swimming pool if you go and lie on a lie low and you feel very weightless that's the same thing the brain is 
,,doing it's just chilling out in this fluid inside your skull hey baby but it does a lot more than just chill out this big wrinkly structure is controlling your body 
,,24/7 yes even when you're asleep there are different sections in charge of different jobs which bit does what well toward the front is the motor cortex this tells you when to move by sending signals down your spinal cord and when I'm hungry and my stomach's gurgling which bits doing that it will be the hypothalamus this bit right in the middle of the brain that's right right here so when I'm hungry this bit of the brain right in the middle sends out chemicals that tell me to eat and when I've eaten it sends up chemicals telling me I'm full and I can stop easier what about memories where they can well new memories are kept in the hippocampus which is right inside here you can actually see it over here and a hypocrite is this like a temporary drive in the computer so new memory is kept there when we're asleep the hippocampus backs up new memories so you can remember them years later so although the brain is full of fat and water it's actually one of the most amazing computers on earth not bad for something that looks like a sponge deep doing for today's mind-bending trick is and it's gonna need warm facial muscles you ready sound it's quite a complicated vocal procedure will complicated the better for me now can you say the word far far can you say they went bar ah I think you're ready seem that complicated this lot are about to get their minds bent we're showing them a video of Sun repeating a word bah bah ok what sound is doctors and making well like a sheep right ok yeah alright let's watch the next video far far far far far now what sound is doctors on making in does anyone think he's still saying bar no he's definitely 
,,saying far are you ready to play at home okay everyone look at the laughs look at this one bah whilst looking at the left hands on what word can you hear bah bah bah bah ok now who's hearing far you're all hearing far okay now everyone look at the right bar looking at the right hands on what work can you hear now bah bah bah now who thinks this bar what if we told you that only one word was being said bah in reality is and is only ever saying the word bar bar bar bar is on on the left is mining the word far bar so depending on which zone you look at you hear different words even though the only word he's saying is bar have we bent your mind yeah so what do you think is going on tell me when your brain looks up one of them it like maybe changed it Sammy's now they're really good so your lip breathing basically so even when you're hearing a sound you trust your eyes more than your ears what this trick demonstrates is the dominance of vision over all your other senses so even though the sound you're hearing the whole time is far when your eyes seasons mouth make the shape bar that's what you hear but the sound hasn't changed at all and what's amazing about this is it's a video of me and I know what sound I was making and I'm still fooled my fent think you mean bent that's what I said today's mind-bending trick is all about distraction if you're sufficiently distracted you might not notice something that's going on right in front of your eyes that's not how it works on who said that today the children at this school think they're here to learn about bones but we've got a trick up our sleeve see if you can spot it or either count all the bones that you can see in this picture go and the first team get right on it before we've even had time to arrange the scenery and stop okay how'd you do 
,,got 49 Mary's 52 48 well they were all pretty close but did anyone notice something strange let's have another look right there Sandra's replaced by a fake Sun and nobody noticed how far can we push this we give the group another task starting now count all the bones in that picture and at the same time swap fakes and with mr. Hoskins their teacher somebody they should definitely recognize ok look at me answers Haiti but amazingly still nobody notices I now want you to count their backbones go now we get extreme I'm gonna swap places with Chris there's that scenery coming through again and right there stand and I swap over and time's up ok now when you were counting did you notice anything else maybe not on the wall finally they've spotted it and all our groups fell for it he didn't notice at all have you ever seen this man before really because he was standing right in front of you a few minutes ago well why do you think it was how are we able to fill you so easy well we'll 
,,say focus like we did we weren't aware what's happening around us a man's exactly right when your brains concentrating on one thing really hard it turns out everything else that's going on around you even so that you'll miss something quite important that's happening right in front of your eyes stop that let's head back to accidents in emergency go on for another curious case go on well in accident and emergency seven-year-old Jago is in with his mum go on right how'd that happen a seat on 
,,the chair and I fell back go on he's in lack of lucozade it took a long time to fall I tried I tried to lean forward but it was heavy makes it too much Rapids okay let's find out more Jago and his pals and ER were waiting patiently to play a game of squash but they soon got bored and started climbing on their seats oh I bet they were pretending to be mountain goats Chris hmm dangerous Oh clowning around at the circus even more dangerous or maybe they were all a space walk and no sound Jay goes seek tip backwards and he bashed his head on the wall hydra-matic examining Jay goes bash bonce is dr. Helen Stewart first dr. Stewart does some tests to make sure that jegos brain is functioning correctly dude reflexes Jago brains good what about that noggin sorry that's your hair after some of jegos hair is removed the doc can finally see the wound he's got a cut that's about a centimeter and a half in length but the edges are quite straight and come together quite nicely so it's it's quite deep so I thought it might need a stitch but actually we'll probably be able to glue the wings shut nice hair Jago werewolf hair fixing jegos head is sister and a cow a short and quick clean we'll stick it back together we loom quick snap for the family album look away if you're squeamish the edges of jegos wound are held together and a few spots of special skin glue are applied let's have a look great job sister Anna Jago can go home now and his head will be better in about five days and what does Jago learned you said it mum by today's mind-bending trick is one for your eyes but to do it Zander I need to change colour remember saying you could do this you know I only ever wear green it's on calm down it won't last forever three groups of children at this school are here to play one of our mind-bending tricks we're going to show you this picture I'm going to make you look at it very card and then we're gonna switch it to a black and white picture are there any colors 
,,in this picture an order for it to work you have to keep looking at that dog and even when the picture changes and you'll want to look at the rest of the picture you still have to keep looking at the dog does that make sense you can play at home too are you ready just remember keep your eyes fixed on the dot in the middle of the picture and don't move your eyes when the picture changes keep focused on that dot keep looking ready for the change don't move your eyes do you see this photo in color now move your eyes do you see it's actually in black and white how did this lock get on you saw us in color basically yeah and all the groups saw it so just to 
,,be clear guys at no stage is that black and white picture and for color there's no color it just goes from weird orange to black and white so why do you think we had to show you weird colors what do you mean by negative opposite color Omar's got the right idea first we showed the negative image which has the opposite colors of all those in the original as you can see on the color wheel the opposite to blue and green is orange and red so our blue and green tops have become orange --red so why do we then see color on the black-and-white picture when there is none at the back of your eyes you have cells called photoreceptors and they detect the light and 
,,you have different photoreceptors for different colors but when you've been looking at one color for a long time the photoreceptors that deal with that color get tired switch off a bit so when you're looking at our image the photoreceptors in the back of your eye that deal with orange and red get tired and they take a little break when it flips to black and white your brain isn't getting signals from the orange and red ones anymore so your blue and green receptors step in to provide that missing color Chris I'm glad you put me back to my normal color but wait a minute Stan wearing blue I'm gonna go and get my bottle of green clothes dye and I'm gonna fix this once and for all honesty just too absolutist quick this mind-bending trick is all about concentration isn't it Zant sound what are you doing I'm concentrating well that's not how the check work hey you're not fooling me these children at this school think they're here to play a simple game but we've got a trick up our sleeve so what we're going to show you is a video of a ball game and all you have to do is count the number of passes that the team in white make really good let's roll the video time to get counting so how many passes do you think the team in white made okay Joshua 21 Charles the correct answer is 21 but did you spot anything weird did you see anything at all other than the passing just sort of passing what we didn't tell you was before the match zan dressed up as a gorilla and made an amazing ape appearance during the game let's see if anyone spots it this time nope no one seems to have noticed in fact it took three attempts and then finally a gorilla 
,,he thinks Cecilia is crazy there was no gorilla was there so just watch it again don't worry about the past is now just see if you can see a gorilla there is wait a 
,,minute there is the gorilla at the back dancing gorilla and we fooled the other groups - oh there is that gorilla so why didn't they spot it it's because you're looking up and parting the blue don't notice that's the green Cecilia is right you're so busy concentrating on the passes that you don't notice the gorilla in the room this is called inattentional blindness the failure to notice something important because your attention is engaged where so always keep your eye out for the unexpected wears on I mean you really got stuck into your part as a gorilla you know Chris whenever I'm asked to take on a part I try and really get into it at one point I was going to interview a girl's hand and ask them about their motivation suspend he's left a gorilla feet on

Operations of While number,SaZaOm3Umkc,hello children today i'm here to teach you last chapter in your textbook that's chapter 29 likelihood of an event occurring so this is probability so in this lesson 
,,identify the events that definitely occur the events that definitely do not occur and the event that occur randomly and describe the outcomes of an experiment we have started this unit in grade six now we are studying further so we'll see what are the things that you have to study so what are events the sun rising from east through a stone up it will fall downwards water flows higher to lower places touch fire you will burn the sun set from west so these all are definitely happening so we call these are events that definitely occur certain last time also i explained the word certain to happen you're a hundred percent sure that this will happen look at 
,,these events a tossed coin landing heads up when you toss a coin you can get heads rain occurring this afternoon a bus leaving at the scheduled time sri lankan cricket team wins the next match geometry question appears when you turn the mathematics textbook what can you say about those events the above events cannot be certain will occur or not so we call these a random events what about these events the sunset from east age of grade 7 student is 21 years getting mango from an apple tree a 
,,heavy stone floating on water so these events do not occur at all definitely not happening impossible i use the term impossible to happen so when you take events what are the three types we can say events which definitely occur that is 100 sure certain and events which definitely do not occur impossible to happen or events which cannot be certain will occur or not random events so there are three types of events the events that definitely happen definitely not happening and random events before starting the cricket match a coin is tossed to decide the team starting betting write down the possible two outcomes when you toss a coin what are the two possible outcomes you can get head or tail side heads up or tails up if the coin is a fair one the chance of getting hit and the chance of getting tail is equally likely 
,,but what happens if you attach a small metal piece on one side of the coin and then toss it you will always see the heaviest side will land on table so is that a fair coin then it's not a fair coin so you need to take a fair coin then the chance of getting any side is equally likely what are the possible outcomes can get after a cricket match either wins lose or draw so those are the three possible outcomes you can get so likewise what are the possible outcomes when rolling a regular tetrahedral die labeled one two three four ones so four sides all are equally likely so you can get either one two three four those are the possible outcomes you can get when you roll a regular tetrahedral die what are the possible outcomes when rolling a cube shape die label one two three four five six so six sides all are equally likely so you can get either one two three four five or six six possible outcomes are there so all these are random events there are identical cards labeled 1 to 10 in a box write down all possible outcomes when taking a card at random without looking at the box so we are taking a card so you can get one there's a chance of getting two chance of getting three four five six seven eight nine or ten so ten possibilities are there there are red blue green yellow and black marbles one from each color in a box write down all possible outcomes when taking a marble from the box at random so what are the possibilities you can get a red marble you can get a blue one or a green one or a yellow one or a black one so those are the possibilities you can get so these are random events in a bag there are cards labeled g1 g2 g3 that means green and red one red two red three write down all possible outcomes when taking a card at random from the bag you can get green one or green two green three 
,,then red one red two or red three so these all are random events put a correct tick for events that are definitely occur get a mango from a jack tree that's not possible impossible multiples of ten that are divisible by 3 without a remain 10 20 not divisible by 3 that's impossible floating a stone in water normally it goes down 
,,not floating that's wrong there are four sides in a cordula true that's true for any quadrilateral you get four sides all multiples of seven that are odd numbers we'll check 7 times 1 7 that's odd 7 times 2 14 that's not odd so that means this is wrong x plus 10 equals 15 then x equals 3. so we'll find out x value when you take 
,,10 to the other side that's five so this is wrong you can't get three mahavali river flows sea level to higher level normally higher level to lower level that's wrong height of a person is less than three meters so that can be so less than three meters it's true so you get only two definitely events that are definitely occur a fair object means chance of getting one side is equally likely put correct for fair object and cross mark for not fair objects tossing a fair coin if it's fair yes that's a fair object equally likely chance of getting hit and tail throwing a coconut shell so no it's not equally likely always you get one side so that's not a fair 
,,one throwing a matchstick box all sides are different so you are not getting same as because if it's a die equally likely all sides are the same but matchstick box you get different size rolling a cubed shaped eye so all sides are equal that's a fair one throwing a funnel you always get one side so that's not true throwing a square base pyramid pyramid always tries to land the square side rolling a regular tetrahedral die regular that means all sides are equal so that's true rolling a triangular prism that's a different shapes you get rectangles and triangles so you are not getting same side equally likely throwing a stone different shaped stones it's 
,,not equally likely not a fair object taking a ball from a box which has identical balls inside yes if they're they all are identical it's fair so that's true now we'll look at the exercises in your textbook exercise 29.1 write down whether each of the events given below is an event which definitely occur an event which definitely does not occur or a random event of the two competing football teams a and b team a winning the game we don't know might mean a or b or draw so that's a random event when a red regular cube is tossed the side that lands up being red always happening if it's red q always you are getting red side that's definitely occur definitely occur a ball taken out of a bag which contains only five white balls being a black ball so all our bites you want to take a black one can you take that it's impossible so you can write does not occur definitely definitely does not occur the next passenger getting down from a bus being a woman we are not sure so that's a random event when a regular cube with each of its six sides marked with one of one two three four five and six is rolled the side with five turning up so that's a random 
,,event all are equally likely so random event a stone thrown at a mango tree with fruits hitting a mango so there's a chance of hitting a mango so you can say random 
,,event a piece of wood placed on water floating so that's definitely happening when you put wood it's normally floating so definitely occur so the youngest party participant in 100 meter race for those under 13 winning the race possible so that's random we don't know but it can happen chatri being a student who obtains more than 
,,75 marks for mathematics in the grade 7 year end examination chaturi being a student who obtains more than 75 marks for mathematics 6 in the grade 7 year end examination yeah it can happen but we are not sure so you can say random in a school having 700 students a prefect is chosen by the votes of all the students aravinda and suranga have been proposed for this position find the least number of votes that arvinda must get if he is to become the prefect so that means when you take now all together 700 students are there so they are voting too aravinda or suranga only two are there find the least number of votes that are in the must get if he is to become the prefect so that means more than half so what is more than half means half is 350 is the half value so 700 divided by 2 so 350 if it's 350 both are the same like chance of being the prefect is half equally likely so so he arriving the musket if he is to become the prefect that means 350 1 so write 351 will a prefect always be elected through this method it's possible so you can select using this method so we know if this is 350 that means you can't select one again they have to do something to select but now if it's 351 anybody can you know the person who gets 351 out of 700 if it's if it's a different number you have to think about the half of that value so will a prefect always be elected possible possible to select using this method using this month the faces of a die are numbered one two three four five 
,,six the die is rolled once write down whether each of the events given below is an e event which will definitely occur an event which will definitely not occur or random event obtaining a eight so only up to six so this is not possible definitely not occur obtaining an even number yes 2 4 6 even numbers are there so that's random obtaining 4 possible that's random obtaining a number which is less than 7 that's definitely all the numbers are less than seven so definitely occur example number one the phases of a die are numbered one two three four five and six the die is rolled once and the number on the face that are turns upward is observed write the set of outcomes of this experiment so you can get one two three four five six those are the possibilities so you can get these outcomes exercise 29.2 so question number one write down the experiments and corresponding outcomes for each of the events in abcde under exercise 29.1 so this is same as what we did we found out whether 
,,it it it is definitely occur or random event of the two competing football teams a and b team a winning the game if both are competing football teams so it can be draw also what are the possible outcomes it can be win lose or draw three possibilities are there so winning chance is one third if you take the draw also as an as one outcome this is one third if we take only winning and losing so that's half a chance so winning is half of that when a red regular cube is tossed the side that lands up being red definitely happening now so six out of six that means one a ball taken out of a bag which contains only five white balls being a black ball zero out of five that means zero not possible the next passenger getting down from a bus being a woman so half because either woman or me so you can have two possibilities so 
,,it can be half when a regular cube with each of its six sides marked with one of one two three four five six is rolled the side with five turning up so that's a random one so out of 6 out comes one possibility is there so 1 over 6 the likelihood obtaining each of the possible outcomes of an experiment so the faces of a regular die are numbered one two six the die is rolled once and the number on the face that turns upward is observed a coin is tossed once and the side that lands up is observed so these are all random experiments you can toss a coin and all are fair we assume that these are fair objects so chance of getting one side is equally likely a 
,,coin with one side made of aluminium and the other side of copper where the quantities of aluminium and copper used are equal is tossed once and the side that lands 
,,up is observed so what can you say about these ones so here if we take the first one it's regular and different numbers so here we need to identify whether it's what are the possible outcomes you can get 1 2 3 4 5 6. if it's a coin you can get either head or tail and what about this one so two sides are there aluminium or the copper side equally likely so you can either you can get aluminium side or or copper one side is aluminium the other side is copper a coconut shell similar to the one 
,,in the figure is tossed tossed once and the side that lands up is observed so two possibilities are there either this side or this side so what can we write open area up or down so we can say sometimes you can get this way also really happens but there's a chance so you can say open side up or open side down those are the two possibilities you can get the faces of the regular tetrahedron are numbered one two three four the tetra is rolled once and the number on the face that turns downward 
,,is observed so one two three four four possibilities are there the faces of a cuboid are numbered one two six the cuboid is rolled once and the number on the face that turns upward is observed so what are the possibilities you can get one two three four five six those are the possible outcomes now we'll see whether these objects are fair or not so we'll take the first one here we did before we'll take the first one this is a cube so what do you think this cube is a fair object all sides are equally likely fair object and a coin we can say this is equally chance of getting head or tail that's a fair object what about the other one this one one side is copper and one side is aluminium so depend on the weight so we can't say that's a fair object so not fair not a fair object when you take the coconut shell this is not a fair object so this is rare chance of getting this side so not a fair object and when you take regular regular tetrahedra is a fair object all sides are equally 
,,likely and what about a cuboid not a cube all sides are not the same so this is not a fair object exercise 29.3 for each experiment below write the set of outcomes and write down whether the experiment is carried out using a biased object or an unbiased object fair or not fair unbiased we can use the word unbiased that's a fair 
,,this means fair biased means not fair first one the top in the figure with its faces marked from zero to nine spun and the face that touches the ground when it stops spinning is observed so when you take this top we see it's not equally likely it's different so this side is not the same as this side so always it tends to come this part up so that's not a fair one so that we can say biased biased object the figure shows a circular disc divided into eight equal parts and the parts are numbered one to eight one end of the indicator is fixed to the center and the other end is rotated the number of the portion where the indicator stops is observed so all are equally likely equal parts so this is a this is an unbiased object unbiased consider the figure below each circular disk is made to rotate around its center when the disk stop rotating the color indicated by the arrow head is observed explain whether each of the disks used in this experiment is fair or not look at figure one this area is bigger than these areas so the chance of getting a is more than the other colors so this side is more so is it by a storm biased this is a biased one what about this one this is equally divided into three parts all sides are all parts are equally likely so we can say this is unbiased also you can use these words i told you unbiased means fair and bias means not fair write two examples of experiments which are done using fair objects so you can write rolling a cube labeled one two three four five six so different numbers when you are rolling a cube all sides are equally likely so that's a a fair object or you can take taking a marble from a 
,,bag or box from a bag with 10 or any number of identical marbles so that's a that's also equally likely when you get identical marbles getting one is a fair objects 
,,so we completed all theory related to probability so in this lesson the events which occur in our environment fall into one of the following three types what are the three types it can happen definitely does not happen definitely or that can be a random event the events that can occur in an experiment are called the outcomes of 
,,the experiment and if an experiment is carried out using an object the object is considered to be an unbiased object or biased one if it's unbiased means the chance 
,,of getting any side is equally likely if it's a biased one the chances are different so this is a important lesson in your syllabus and you need to practice questions related to probability because definitely you are getting a question in or level exam so this is the last unit so we'll practice the last revision exercise next and then you can move to grade 8 and i hope that you will join with me for the next year for grade 8 work you

Operations of While number,zr4onA2k_LY,digestion in human beings human beings take food through mouth and digest it in specific organs for digestion the undigested food is defecated the food we take passes through a specific canal which begins with buccal cavity and ends at the anus this canal is called elementary canal or the digestive tract the paths of the elementary canal are buccal cavity ESO Vegas stomach large intestine small intestine rectum and anus the food gets digested gradually as it passes through the various parts of the track digestive juices secreted by the salivary glands liver and pancreas also aid digestion mouth and the buccal cavity food intake in human beings is through mouth this process of taking food is called ingestion chewing food is very necessary for proper digestion as digestion process starts in the mouth itself what happens during chewing the large pieces of food we eat are mechanically broken down into small pieces teeth helps us in doing so action of saliva on food during chewing food mixes with saliva saliva is secreted from salivary glands located on the lower jaw between the tongue and teeth saliva converts starch in the food into sugars 
,,and also soft ins the food tongue taste of food can be detected by the taste buds present on the tongue dung is a fleshy muscular organ attached to the floor of the 
,,buccal cavity it is free at the front and moves in all directions taste buds appear as small bumps on the tongue and have different regions which help us enjoy different tastes esophagus or food pipe the swallowed food from the mouth passes on to the east figures the epiglottis which is a flap like structure behind the tongue directs the food into the East of Vegas and prevents entry into the larynx the peristaltic movements of the east of pages helps the food to move down the tract till it reaches the stomach stomach stomach is a bag like structure with thick wall it is in the shape of a flattened u and is the widest part in the elementary canal the food that enters the stomach is churned and mixes with the mucus hydrochloric acid and digestive juices secreted by the inner lining of the stomach the acid helps to 
,,kill the bacteria present in the food it also makes the medium in the stomach acid ick the digestive juice is secreted by the stomach break down proteins into simpler substances then the food is emptied into small intestine small intestine small intestine is a highly coiled structure and is about 7.5 meters long as soon as a small intestine receives food from the stomach the digestive juices from liver and pancreas are mixed into it liver liver is the largest gland in the human body and is 
,,situated in the upper side of the abdomen to the right it is reddish-brown in color it secretes bile which breaks down fats bile is stored in gall bladder between meals pancreas pancreas is a leaf shaped and cream-colored gland located just below the stomach it secretes pancreatic juice which acts and breaks down carbohydrates proteins and fats after this is completed the partially digested food reaches the lower part of the small intestine where intestinal juices act upon food and completes digestion of any remaining components in food the carbohydrates in the food break down into sugars like glucose fats into fatty acids and glycerol and proteins into amino acids the food consumed is digested and is now ready to be absorbed into the blood absorption of food in the small intestine the inner wall of the small intestine has finger-like projections called villi which have a network of thin blood vessels close to the surface the Willis increases the surface area of absorption and absorbs the digested food materials the substances thus absorbed are transported through the bloodstream to different organs in the body and are used to build complex substances like proteins this process is called a simulation in the cells glucose breaks down into carbon dioxide and water with the help of oxygen and releases 
,,energy the undigested and unabsorbed food enters the large intestine large intestine the large intestine is wider than small intestine and measures 1.5 metres in length once the undigested food enters the large intestine it absorbs water and some salts from it and passes the remaining waste into the rectum here it remains as semi-solid thickest the fecal matter is removed through the anus this is called ejection

Operations of While number,4lkq3DgvmJo,"Hi and welcome to Math Antics.  This video is all about dividing fractions, but in order to understand how dividing fractions works, we first need to learn about something called reciprocals. A reciprocal is just a fancy math term for what you get when you switch the top and bottom numbers of a fractions. For example, if you have the fraction 1 over 2 and then switch the top and bottom numbers, youll end up with 2 over 1. 2 over 1 is the reciprocal of 1 over 2. And, 1 over 2 is the reciprocal of 2 over 1. And an interesting thing about reciprocals is; multiplying a fraction by its own reciprocal will always give you 1. Thats because youll have the same multiplication problem on the top and bottom, so youll end up with a whole fraction which is always 1. Okay, thats nice, but what do reciprocals have to do with dividing fractions? Well, reciprocals let us do a really cool trick that makes dividing fractions easy! Whenever you have to divide something by a fraction, you can just multiply it by the reciprocal of that fraction instead, and youll get the correct answer. And thats great news because multiplying fractions is so simple. This trick of multiplying by the reciprocal works because fractions are really just mini division problems, so when you multiply something by 1 over 2, its the same as dividing by 2, since 2 is below the fractions division line. AND dividing by 2 is the same as dividing by 2 over 1, because you can turn any number into a fraction by just writing a 1 as the bottom number, right? But look reciprocals!  Thats why multiplying by 1 over 2 is the same as dividing by 2 over 1. And its true the other way around too. So really, its kind of like you never have to divide fractions. You can just re-write your division problems so that youre multiplying by the reciprocal instead. Then when you multiply, youll get the answer for the original division problem. As always, lets see a couple examples of how this works so youll really understand. Lets try this problem: 3 over 4, divided by 2 over 7. Okay, so the first thing we want to do is re-write our problem. Instead of dividing by 2 over 7, we can multiply by the reciprocal instead. The reciprocal of 2 over 7, is 7 over 2, so our problem becomes 3 over 4, times 7 over 2. Oh, I should mention a mistake that a lot of students make when they first learn to divide fractions. Sometimes students take the reciprocal of the first fraction (the one thats "
,,"being divided), or even the reciprocal of both fractions but you only want to take the reciprocal of the second fraction (the one you are dividing BY). Okay, now that our problem has been changed to multiplication, its easy! Just multiply the tops (3 times 7 equals 21) and multiply the bottoms (4 times 2 equals 8) and we have "
,,"the answer to our fraction division problem. So, 3 over 4, divided by 2 over 7, is 21 over 8. So thats pretty easy, but lets try one more example. Lets try 15 over 16, divided by 9 over 22. Again, the first thing we want to do is re-write our problem. Well change the divided by 9 over 22 into times 22 over 9. Now all we "
,,"have to do is multiply, but since these numbers are kinda big, Im going to use my calculator to help. Lets see here so we have alright! On the top we have, 15 times 22 equals 330, and on the bottom, we have16 times 9 equals 144. So the answer to our division problem is 330 over 144. Of course that could be simplified for your final answer on a test, but we cover simplifying fractions in another video. Alright, thats how you divide fractions; you just multiply by the reciprocal and you "
,,"have your answer. But, theres one more thing I want to show you. You already know that the line between the top and bottom number of a fraction is just another form of the division symbol. Well, that means you'll sometimes see fraction division problems written like this This shows the top fraction (2 over 3) being divided by "
,,"the bottom fraction (4 over 5). Its really just that we have a fraction made up from other fractions. The top number is a fraction and the bottom number is a fraction. It just looks a little confusing because we have all these fractions lines here. But, we can make it look a lot better. Lets re-write this as a multiplication problem by taking the reciprocal of the bottom number (the fraction that we are dividing BY) and multiplying it by the fraction on top. There, that looks easier to do, and its really the same problem! We just need to multiply to get the answer. So 2 times 5 equals 10, and 3 times 4 equals 12. Okay, so there you have it.  What sounded really hard turns out to be as easy as flipping fractions upside-down. If you can multiply fractions, then you can divide fractions too!

Operations of While number,aEYovzjp9_o,hey guys welcome to under the t'market our forgot with our and mozzie recession off with Don two young wonders because as I say every child is special each one of you whether you're in any part of the world of the country you are extra special and extraordinary for us and that is why we have started this amazing extraordinary series that is the science print for grade six seven and eight all your chapters from science subject will be covered like never before so if you haven't subscribed to the amazing channel of Vedanta young wonders subscribe it now the subscription button is right below the video to hit on it and subscribe and join the family of Vedanta young wonders and in today's amazing class we will be dealing with the first chapter of your great seven science NCERT that is nutrition in plants let us master nutrition in plants like never before before we move ahead let me introduce you to the amazing team of Veda two young wonders so indiscernible mehta kumar and myself who help you to master each and every subject like never before because our only motive in life is to make your tomorrow better than your today to make you a bigger stronger and better person with every passing day so please like share and subscribe too without too young windows and hit on the hit on the bell icon so that you 
,,get notified whenever we come online along with that I would also like all of you to connect with us on telegram which notifies you about all the upcoming classes and lectures on weight on to young wonders the details of the telegram app are given in the description below so connect with us on telegram and make this family bigger stronger and better let us now move ahead by learning more about nutrition in plants a very very important chapter a chapter which tells us about the different modes of nutrition that is seen in plants how plants consume food how plants prepare food and how plants distribute food to the different parts of its Bo a very important chapter from your great seven science NCERT textbook chapter number one that is nutrition in plants so let us begin the learning the very important mind map we try to cover the entire chapter in the form of a mind map and a very important mind map that begins by telling us that plants have got two major modes of nutrition Auto tropic Auto means self that is the self nutrition that plants do all green plants carry out a biochemical process known as the photo synthesis photosynthesis is carried out by all the green plants we will be learning more about photosynthesis in the coming slides all the green plants especially the green plants all the green plants carry out the process of photosynthesis and that is known as Auto tropic mode of nutrition hetero tropic mode of nutrition is where the plants depend on other 
,,organisms for food heterotrophic mode of nutrition is where the plants depend on other other organisms for food in this we have got different categories like the SAP roof like the sacra tropic saprotrophic we have got the symbiotic and we have got insectivorous plants we will be dealing about each and every category along with examples in the further slide so please stay tuned with this video along with that what are the needs of the plant so plants need mineral salts plants need mineral salts and two major minerals that are required by the plant are nitrogen and magnesium nitrogen and magnesium are the two major minerals that are required by the plants which the plant absorbs from the soil so this your soil in which the plants or the crops are growing they should have good amount of nitrogen and magnesium in them along with that the minerals in the plant can also be added with the help of fertilizers with the help of fertilizers these fertilizers can be chemical that can be 
,,chemically made man-made or natural fertilizers something like a urea so natural fertilizer or the man your compost these are natural fertilizers which help in organic farming where no man-made chemicals are used to increase the yield or growth of the plant some mineral salts that are required by the plants are nitrogen and magnesium or the other needs of the plant can be suffice with the help of fertilizers these fertilizers can be man-made or natural talking about gaseous exchange in plants where plants exchange the gases that is plants give out co2 yes guys you heard that right plants also give out co2 how when and why that we'll be learning now plants take in oxygen plants also give out oxygen and they also take in carbon dioxide so the process the process of taking in of carbon dioxide and giving out of oxygen using different chemicals is nothing but photosynthesis so photosynthesis is the process by which plants take in carbon dioxide and give out oxygen whereas respiration is the process by which plants give out carbon dioxide and take in oxygen but guys let me explain it to you very very carefully what exactly happens so let me tell you that two processes are taking place in the plant a very very important slide so please pay attention to important processes are taking place in the plant one is the respiration and one is carbon dioxide R stands for respiration and P stands for photosynthesis two very important processes that are taking place in the plant respiration and photosynthesis now let us see what happens in case of respiration in case of respiration just like human beings in case of respiration just like human beings plants will take in oxygen plants will take in oxygen and they will give out carbon dioxide they will give out carbon dioxide respiration happens in the plants just like human beings during the entire day and the entire night entire day and night plants carry out respiration so they are taking in oxygen and giving out carbon dioxide but but during the process of photosynthesis this carbon dioxide some major amount of the carbon dioxide is taken in during photosynthesis whereas oxygen is given out during photosynthesis and photosynthesis photosynthesis occurs only during the day only during the day a very very important slide that respiration and focuses photosynthesis are happening in the plant respiration happens both day and night whereas photosynthesis happens only in the day during the respiration plants will take in oxygen carbon dioxide just like human beings whereas during photosynthesis plants will take in the carbon dioxide and give out oxygen so this is very important processes that take place in the plant that is the gaseous exchange but as a short let us learn in detail about photosynthesis so what is exactly the process of photosynthesis in the process of photosynthesis plants take in carbon dioxide along with water in the presence of sunlight and the green pigment and the green pigment called chlorophyll with the help of sunlight and chlorophyll in the present day on carbon dioxide and water plants carry out the process of photosynthesis to give out glucose and oxygen this oxygen is given out this oxygen is given out in the atmosphere for other organisms to use so plants take in carbon dioxide plus water in the presence of sunlight and chlorophyll they carry out photosynthesis to give out glucose and oxygen and this entire process takes place in the leaves of 
,,the plant in the green leaves of the plant green leaves very very important in the green leaves of the plant the process of photosynthesis is carried out this is all about the process of photosynthesis that plants take in carbon dioxide and water in the presence of sunlight and chlorophyll to give out glucose and oxygen and this oxygen is given out in the atmosphere for other organisms to use now this is about Auto tropic nutrition let us now move on to hetero tropic nutrition where plants 
,,depend on other organisms to fulfill their nutritional needs as you can see on the screen we have got the images of Venus flytrap which is a green plant and the pitcher plant Venus flytrap and pitcher plant where you can see the plant is trapping in a frog and a mouse this frog and mouse when they enter the Venus flytrap and the pitcher plant respectively they will close they were closed and due to the chemicals present inside the plant the bodies of these animals will dissolve and plant will absorb the nutrients from them this is an insectivorous plant and this is what is practicing hetero tropic nutrition so this is an example of a hetero tropic nutrition heterotrophic nutrition can be seen this plant is known as a Venus flytrap whereas this is an example of a pitcher plant pitcher plant venus flytrap so these are insectivorous or the hetero tropic mode of nutrition practicing plants where they are dependent on other organisms to fulfill their nutritional needs after that we come on to saprophytic plants what do you mean by saprophytic plants very very important definition from your NCERT point of view saprophytic again it is a hetero 
,,tropic mode of nutrition again a hetero tropic mode of nutrition these type of plants example mushrooms they feed on the dead they feed on the dead and decaying matter they feed on the dead and decaying matter and the example of hetero and the example of saprophytic plants is mushrooms mushrooms are example of saprophytic plants their head pro tropic plants which feed on the dead and decaying matter to fulfill their needs so example of saprophytic very very important from your ncert point of view is mushrooms example of saprophytic plants is mushroom and that brings us to the last type of hetero tropic plants and that is symbiotic plants what do you mean by the word symbiotic plants symbiotic plants are the plants where two different organisms feed on each other to fulfill their nutritional need they are dependent on each other to fulfill their nutritional need and the example of a symbolic plant is lichens lightens lichens are an example of symbiotic plants lichens are also 
,,very good indicators of air pollution even if there is little amount of air pollution especially sulphur dioxide in the air immediately the number of lichens will reduce so a good number of lichens in the environment show that the air is pure if the number of lichens are not there if the number of lichens have reduced in the environment which shows that the air in the particular environment is very very polluted a very good example of this cities of Delhi and Mumbai and Bangalore where the 
,,air pollution is rising with every passing day and that is why lichens are reducing to lichens are very very good indicators of air pollution one once again a very good characteristic feature of lichen is that they are good indicators of and pollution so guys in today's class we learned about Auto tropic nutrition that is photosynthesis we learned that plasma nitrogen magnesium plants also need fertilizers which can be natural or chemical along with that gaseous exchange takes place in the 
,,plants plants carry out respiration during the day and night and plants also carry out photosynthesis during respiration plants take in oxygen and give out carbon dioxide whereas during photosynthesis plants take in carbon dioxide and give out oxygen in heterotrophic nutrition we learned that plants are dependent on other organisms for food but the three different types of hetero tropic modes of nutrition that we learned today were insectivorous where we learned about Venus flytrap and pitcher plant where these plants were dependent on other organisms for food we also learned about saprophytic nutrition where the plants feed on the dead and decaying example of which was mushrooms the last type of hetero tropic nutrition in plants that we learned was symbiotic nutrition where both the plants are dependent on each other to fulfill their nutritional needs and the example of that was lichens this brings us to the end of this amazing but a very very important chapter from your great 7 science first chapter nutrition in plants in CRT and this was all about what you want what you can learn from the chapter nutrition in plants to learn more in depth about this chapter and to see that how can this chapter be taught one-to-one in such fun and exciting way do not forget that we have got some amazing micro courses also about which I'll be telling you very soon to summarize the chapter the most important question from this particular chapter the most important question from this particular chapter is the difference between Auto tropic and hetero tropic plants Auto tropic it occurs in green plants carbon dioxide and water are needed for the synthesis of food the process is called photosynthesis chlorophyll and sunlight are essential for the for synthesis of food which is again indicating towards photosynthesis example of hetero tropic all the non green plants like the Venus flytrap the mushrooms which are whites a pro fighter lichens heterotrophs derive their 
,,food from green plants or other drop directly or indirectly chlorophyll is absent and sunlight is not needed in this plant example of that non green plant is a mushroom so the guys that brings us to the end of this amazing chapter but very important that was class seven ncert science first chapter nutrition in plants to learn more about this chapter in detail and in depth like never before do not forget to log on to VB and tyrannize - whitie micro where you will be getting knowledge about this chapter in detail like never before quizzes assignments and so much as with the help of a master teacher to enroll the course for only 11 rupees use my special code that is PRM I see use this code and you can get the codes for as less as 11 rupees along with that vedanta has also got some amazing crash courses which will help you to grow wise your entire syllabus of math and science of grade 6 7 & 8 respectively all the details for the micro courses are right in front of you on the screen as well as it is given in the description below so go ahead and take the crash courses the crash courses are available for only rupees two thousand eight hundred

Operations of While number,85RMEh-afOg,I think you got everything I need should be good to go frogs are different sizes I try to pick like an average-sized one so you're always gonna start with the stomach facing upward okay we need to begin by pinning it down we'll get some of these out here good all right you need to make sure that the pins are very securely in because the frogs an attempt to move a little bit now the problem though is unlike your starfish which you didn't have to pin and the earthworm which is really easy to 
,,pin through your frog has bones obviously so you are going to have to pin kind of right through the bone joint back here so it takes a little bit to get through there just pin it straight through sometimes you have to hit the bone like right there don't take a little bit to click it through all right then the tough part here is 
,,these arms they tend to get in the way I need to get them out of the way and to do that I'm going to do something very special with them what's the best way to get these arms out of the way besides putting them back so I pin it back they just they go like that so what am I gonna have to do first the fun part Vargas not necessarily cut it any other ideas good you might pop more like it yes it's a break the arms yep alright so if you're super quiet maybe you'll hear it now if that one didn't 
,,make any noise it's like this one just a little bit's in the arms because once they're broken the arms will tend to stick back a little bit better than they would have otherwise think now that you've been back alright there's two things here you have this thin skin layer on top you can kind of see it there we need to get that skin out of the way first so you start not really far down not into legs but just above the legs little bit you start by making an incision just done like that um frogs are juicy so I'm gonna kind of push some that liquid out of there cuz I don't really want to deal with it not anybody needs to but feel free to take a seat if you're like you know what I really want to see that now you I've never had anybody of a problem that nobody's going to but it's just out there just you know alright got 
,,my little incision there get some of the juice there all right and then I'm gonna cut the skin away right down the side on both sides here attempt this left hand it 
,,usually I don't do so well but that's okay good sort of all right good then we're gonna cut the skin all the way up have to cut through my glove all right keeping my centers pointed up right I want to dig down and stuff right up toward the chin good I'm gonna do the same thing right up here and underneath the arms to start cut the skin away on both sides open up check out the frogs awesome eight packets got going on obviously I could rotate this and do this a smart Wingo right-handed the whole way but let's train my brain a little bit and go left-handed or not expend my brain can't handle it okay too much there we go scan away now you could if you wanted to you could pin the skin back I don't want to it's kind of a pain I'm just gonna rid of it all together I'm just gonna cut off the skin here that's out of the way to deal with it which is kind of convenient let's throw that right there nice pretty other side same thing get nice and round it all if you can just like when opening up the top of the starfish you want to make sure you got a nice big window to go through so I'm gonna cut all the way around the Abdoun as much as possible okay 
,,good see the nice little fluid pockets back here get all that out of there all right then alright let's clean this up a little bit - all right I can meanly the skin 
,,obviously gonna cut it but it can kind of tear away a little bit too that helps out at times it's a little bit of muscle wall there as well Oh liquid you like flick 
,,water at you Wow not water not anymore which is why you where'd your goggles frogs can get back at you once in a while all right that's open up then so you can see the muscle lining in the inside you can see blood vessels kind of going right down the middle here as well next thing to repeat that process this time hover with the 
,,muscle lining as opposed to the actual skin itself so I should have a nice big spot to look through here good do the same thing again sniffing little spot right in the muscle nice and shallow of course as shallow as I can make it do the same thing I'm gonna cut down the side get some of that juice out of there otherwise it might pop up at me and I don't really want to deal with that same thing over here down the side shallow the whole time good all right and then very carefully same thing upward you might say there's nice and shallow don't want to dig too deep inks I don't want to try to avoid cutting the organs as best I can all right when I get to right about here um I can't really close my scissors any more they won't cut because I'm right where the rib cage is you have to cut through the bone which it's doable you have to kind of push a little harder so I'm gonna kind of my cities in there just kind of cut through it get that out of the way and back up here cut it off this side again again there's bones there so it's a snip through and I can do the sitter's gonna need to be back over this side cut some bones you mess it into the shallow as possible if I can throw them there we go all right cut some tissue here get that opened up you'll notice it's not as red as they made it look same thing I want to get this just out of here completely so I'm gonna cut this muscle off here as well what's up cutting my glove hopefully yeah it's great I guess I think I told you guys a lot of it would be Burke gray didn't I yeah yeah a lot of it is it's not as pretty bright red as they make it look that's for sure here we go okay so at this point this bunch of frog looked like in the app obviously I didn't pin back the skin in the muscle I kind of cut it all away but now you can kind of see a lot of 
,,parts you have the three different lobes of liver that would be this right here these three guys oh I forgot to ask one important question the beginning my frog male or female female yeah how can I tell Logan nice phone pad okay so then I've got it all open up you'll have a sheet of paper I don't have been made right now but a sheet of paper right next to you it has little circles for all the organs with me a spot says liver in the circle any event you want to very carefully try to get all 
,,of those organs so you're gonna try to very carefully break some of the tissues at the top it's like operation only way cooler yeah not as much of a buzzer more juice yeah a little bit more juice anyway I've never played a juicy version of operation so I think I don't if I talked about it or not but I challenge you to try to make sure you get the liver as nice and intact as you can did I talk about that at all yes maybe maybe not um anyway the liver has three big lobes it's always a nice challenge I'd like in the stomach go to the starfish and one piece it's a nice challenge to try to get the liver lobes in three distinct pieces as well so like there's one lobe of the liver so it's nice and careful the other one obviously when you guys dissect I think I told you I don't quite come on left-handed you you're steadier than that you can do it I don't quite enough rocks everybody to have their own so you will have somebody kind of giving you backup support while you're doing it as well long as you don't cut each other's hands how my left hand is really shaky too so I'll put kind of all three of these see looking a mushroom that's why I hate mushrooms good enough so I'll place all three of those and the spot says liver now the livers out of the way I've got a few remaining chunks here not too bad pretty good for a first effort all right then you can see some other things right underneath here let's get some of that cleaned up out of the way a little bit that's all unnecessary tissues all right we can see and you might not be able to see very well from far away but we have the heart right here does not look red it's as weird almost triangular thing right here that's the heart we have the gallbladder which you want to be careful about so it's just kind of like a see-through sac here it's not 
,,green like they made it look in the app so we have the gallbladder kind of right there you have the stomach right here this big thing I can check in a second see if 
,,I have a gift inside the stomach moving on um stomach can it's down here to the intestines you can see the two kind of running through here there's a large and small back in there as well all right then got some spaghetti 82 here's some my spaghetti it looks really close to what it looks like my noodles yeah forever ruin yeah all right few more on the other side like I said they're not limited to being on one side so I got a few on the other side here as well I would get those cleaned out all my fast bodies now I do have a female we talked about that the eggs would be right along in the inside here right by where the fat bodies are I don't have any um 
,,you would know if you had eggs to eat the fat bodies on the way and there'd be a bunch of a smaller clumps of yellow it looks like not the little strands or strings 
,,you'd have more kind of pin back in there all right let's see what else we have um we have work that bodies we have our kidneys back in here kind of way back in the 
,,bottom and kind of see them down there they're kind of attached let's just be nice and mean and rip it right out sorry frog you're not gonna do that you guys gonna cut it carefully this would be a kidney there's one on each side so I put that down the kidney spot up underneath here boom I have my lungs up on the other side they're just like yeah they're kind of small gray obviously inflated sorry frog nothing personal so I have two lungs you guys gonna take your time and cut them and supposed to ripping them but the lungs are up in there as well pancreas this little strand II guy right in here and kind of see that right there there'll be the pancreas kind of hard to see to be careful about that one when you have your mat next to you in the digestive system and then come out with one big piece too basically gonna cut right at top of stomach and down here at the end of the intestines right before the cloaca you can take the whole thing out and set that down otherwise that pretty much covers everything we need I am curious let's see if I have a gift here you can see their parts and there's our spleen right in there as well as I move stuff out of the way now it just looks like I'm butchering the Frog I mean to do that I'm trying to go super quick stomach there is something might cut in half that's okay 
,,please don't squirt something in there whatever was but there's something in there come here how do we got I don't really know what it was yet hello might be a beetle Kevin I think it was a beetle quake in just a second here anyway there's something there it looks like some legs probably a beetle something like that alright then the other thing you talked about was the time alright so right in here if you're on this side you can see pretty well here you see the little bone marine teeth right there the two little dots here to the top there you'll see them when you guys look tomorrow if you can't see them from there they're too little almost whitish dots there I can kind of feel it's on the inside Ridge right up here with the tweezers I can feel it kind of like the ampulla I kind of feel it a little bit like sandpaper this thing right here is the tongue it's really big right here this whole thing is the tongue so that is the tongue of the Frog it attaches on the underside here 
,,come here tom it does not look long because it's kind of dead otherwise it's very stretchy yep can I not very well because it's kind of dead no I can't but it's more that connective tissue on the bottom there's the tongue of our frog we could look further in later see if you can get into some of tissues when you have time when you dissect you be able to remove the jaw if you want kind of look on the inside as well I think that pretty much sums up any last questions you guys have anything dissection related pretty easy everything's for the most part pretty big there's a few things that are kind of hard to see you have to kind of dig in a little bit I think I told you guys is a nice little pool of juice on the bottom in here that's where you'll probably have the lungs and the kidneys so make sure you're willing to kind of take you that so this other long you can see is hiding back here boom lung right there anything else all right sounds good you can cut if you enjoy

Operations of While number,1_DSMABQZbk,if you are a student and struggling with
,,math if Math super difficult for you if math comes in your nightmare then
,,you are on a right place because this video is going to change your whole student life
,,after watching this video you will be solving that super easily like Albert
,,Einstein in the next couple of minute I am going to share with you that mindset
,,of every successful mathematician who created history in mathematics that
,,mindset is the key ingredient to solve math like a piece of cake I got 97 out
,,of hundreds in my 12th math exam and now you will also score obove 90 just by
,,learning that mindset which is required to solve any math problem first you have to
,,commit something to your self this is very important without this the video
,,will be a waste for you now allows you to yourself that math is easy for me yes
,,say it again I want to hear you louder more louder no matter who is near to you
,,don't feel shy if you didn't do this you will go back to your old life where math
,,is like a demon so do not care about anybody nobody is going to come and
,,change your life only you can change your life so say this loudly to yourself
,,that math is easy for me I can solve math easily Math is a piece of cake for
,,me why this is important I will give you answer this is
,,important to take off the wrong mindset wrong programming in your mind and
,,filling it with positiveness like Math is easy for you once you really believe
,,in this then you are on a right track it's not pause this video and go in
,,front of a mirror and say this to yourself
,,till you believe this from your within from your deepest heart that math is easy for me then play this video I will be
,,always here so if you are ready completely ready let's begin first I
,,will talk about the most toxic mindset to solve math whenever a math
,,problem comes to the most of the people first they get frightened and say oh my
,,god this question is so big this question is
,,super difficult for me I can never solve this question huh where is the formula
,,how I will solve this what will happen blah blah but you now you won't say this
,,because you just change your mindset and then suddenly they will open a help
,,book in which the solution of that question is already given and they will try to
,,copy the solution from there after that they will cram the solution from there
,,and cramming math is the most worst thing you can do about your math so
,,never cram Math or if they do not find a help book what will they do they will
,,find a similar question in which the solution is given and they will try to
,,do the same in that question and it doesn't matter that done is right or not
,,if the answer is right what you have learnt from that question nothing just cramming
,,copying etc so never do this this will only make your math
,,difficult for you and the more you do this the more you will get stuffed in
,,this because this is like a spider dance so never do this because the question
,,will only increase and cramming will not solve this now the time has come in
,,which I will talk about that mindset I call it the learning + solution
,,oriented mindset in which you focus on learning trying to learn something from
,,the question and you focus on finding the solution of that question by
,,focusing on the problem you have given first let me give you a tip for solving
,,every math problem in your math book first make a list of all the formulas
,,which are going to be used in that particular chapter you are going to
,,solve this is a proven method to solve math problems if you have a list of
,,formulas which can be used in that problem
,,this makes math super easy for you so always before starting a chapter make a
,,list of all the formulas which are going to be used in that chapter for example
,,if you are going to solve trigonometry then make a list of all the formulas
,,which are going to be used in it now you will say that I hardly remember any math
,,formula it is so hard to remember them and I know but no problem with this
,,mindset you will automatically start memorizing all the formulas in your math
,,book without doing any effort if you practice what I say now you have a math
,,problem and a number of formulas to solve that problem now how will you know
,,which formula is right for the problem the answer is to read the problem
,,carefully this is the first and the most important step to solve math problem
,,most people never do this they never read the problem carefully they do this
,,this question is of this chapter they solve it like this I will solve it like
,,this I will copy this oh I didn't got the right answer oh no math is so difficult
,, for me ask yourself do you ever read a math question carefully ever
,,without starting to solve the problem if so first read the question and then
,,you will know that formula automatically which is going to be used in that
,,problem because you have a list of particular formulas which are going to
,,be used in that chapter then do not suddenly start solving the problem first
,,think in your mind how will I get from these value in the question to the one
,,value of the answer I have to use the formulas which I have what to do think
,,use your mind this will make math super interesting it is
,,like solving the puzzle game you have given a puzzle and you have some patterns
,,and some formulas to solve the problem and you have to get to the answer to the
,,goal so how will you solve the problem think in your mind but I have to do what
,,I have to change the values I have to change these numbers to this and then
,,apply this formula make it super interesting in your mind and then start
,,solving the problem lets say you got a wrong answer you try tried again you again got the wrong answer no problem you have to try again
,,always remember Einstein said I am not intelligent I just stay with the problem
,,longer than other people so the longer you will be with  the problem the more
,,chances that you will solve the problem correctly and at last you will get
,,the right answer yess you just solved a math problem on
,,your own without any help book Congrats now you have to open a helpbook and see if
,,your solution is right and learn from your mistake you did in the  previous
,,question basically this is learning learning from your mistakes this will
,,make your brain more sharper now you just solved a math problem on your own
,,what do you think you did ?you made billions of connections in your mind you
,,are using a trial and error method and constantly learning from your tries and
,,by this you will start memorizing formulas easily because you will take up
,,a formula and apply that in your question and this automatically memorizes
,,formulas I tried this and all the math formulas just stamps in my mind if you
,,practice this that you can solve any question in that chapter remember
,,Einstein said imagination is more powerful than knowledge
,,if you don't memorize formulas no matter but you should have a mind which is
,,required to solve that problem a mind which has full of imagination that how
,,you can get to the answer so next time when your teacher give you a homework of
,,a question and try to use this method in this method will math super
,,interesting for you and it will be like playing a videogame and please do not
,,go back to what you were when you open this video because there is no other way
,,to solve math more easy than this there are lots of other videos which tell how
,,to solve math easily how to become a genius etc etc but there is no other way
,,they will give you tips routines etc like I also gave you a routine but
,,you have to stick with something something in this video or in any other
,,video ok so take a simple thing and stick with it like if you say I do not want
,,to do all this from tomorrow just do a simple thing like making a list of all
,,the formulas in your chapter this will change something and you just ask
,,growing so slow and steady wins the race now you know the way the single key to
,,success in mathematics if you follow this getting above 90 is a piece of
,,cake for you now let's get something practical we will take a universal math
,,problem of seven standards so that everybody can understand it and will
,,apply this method to solve that problem if you are a high standard student than
,,see how I will solve that problem and apply the same method in your math problems
,,this will clear this concept to you more so let begin take a look at this simple
,,math question this is the seventh standard math question i took this
,,question so that everybody can understand the mindset better in this
,,question you are asked to find the volume of the cylinder of height five
,,centimeters and radius two cm this this is a cylinder of height 5
,,centimeters and radius 2 centimeters for high standard student just assume this
,,as a demonstration of that mindset I will apply that mindset in this question
,,to find the answer let's say we have a chapter in which we can find two types
,,of questions first is the volume of the cylinder and second is the surface area
,,of cylinders and we have new to all this and we don't know which formula of
,,volume and this formula of surface area so assume that this is happening and now
,,we will apply the method to solve that problem so first step is to read the
,,problem carefully in this problem we have to find the volume of cylinder of
,,height 5 centimeter and radius 2 centimeter for high standard students
,,they will say that all this question is super easy this is of volume formula we have to chunk in these values and finds answer but no this is just a
,,demonstration take it as a demonstration and use the
,,same method in your difficult question so we have these two values first is
,,height and second is radius of cylinder now let us write  first what is the
,,radius of cylinder radius or cylinder equal to 2 cm and height of cylinder is equal to five centimeters so we have
,,these two values and we have to get from these two values to the one value of the
,,volume how do we get there we have to use one formula one formula of the
,,volume we do what we have to do so first we have to know which formulas is of
,,volume at which formula is of surface area so how do we know that see
,,what is the area of circle that means all this what is the area of circle that
,,is PI R square right so we have the area of circle this and if we
,,multiply it by the height which is this then we will have a circle stacked on
,,each other to five centimeter height and then we will have the volume so we know
,,that this formula is of volume and for surface area tell me the parameter of
,,circle that is 2 PI R right and if we have hollow circle stacked on each other
,,to 5 centimeters then we will have the surface area of cylinder so we know that
,,volume of cylinder is this and we will apply this in our question so volume of cylinder so the volume of
,,cylinder which is this formula and we will apply that in our question that is
,,PI R squared H so we first have chunk in the value okay so let's chunk in the
,,value Phi is three point one four multiplied by r square which is 2 and 2 square
,,equal to 4 multiply by h which is height which is 5 centimeter and now this is equal to 62.8 centimeter cube never forget to add the unit after the value in math    
,,this is also very important tip for math so we just read the question carefully
,,knew which formulas to be applied first thought what we have to do and then did it
,,and found the answer and this is how you should always solve a math question hope

Operations of While number,LkhPRz7Hocg,do you know why i pulled you over today uh some law that's right allah this law to be exact laws of exponents i've never even heard of these how was i supposed to know well you must have never heard of math antics they're this really cool math video series they have all sorts of basic math videos and the host is really funny is 
,,this some sort of ad can i skip this no i think you'll really like it check it out hi this is rob welcome to math antics in this video we're going to learn about the laws of exponents if you look up the laws of exponents online or in a math book you'll probably see a long list of equations that look something like this wow that's kind of overwhelming when you see them all at once but don't worry we'll take them one step at a time and you'll see that they're not that complicated after all but before we get going if you're not confident with the basics of exponents i highly recommend watching our previous videos about them before moving on in this video 
,,okay let's start with just the first two laws on our list which should look familiar if you watched our video called exponents in algebra they're just the two rules 
,,we learned in that video you know rules laws same difference so you probably already know them they simply tell us that anything raised to the first power is itself 
,,and anything raised to the zeroth power is just one and because we already know about exponents that are higher integer values like x to the second x to the third that means we've pretty much got things covered right ah not so fast don't forget that integers can have negative values too for example what if we add the expression 
,,x to the power of negative one or negative two or negative three we know that exponents are a way of doing repeated multiplication but how in the world could you multiply something together a negative number of times well you can't fortunately the next law on our list tells us how to interpret a negative exponent that law says x to the negative nth power equals 1 divided by x to the nth power and if you think about it that kind of makes sense a negative number is the inverse of its positive counterpart and division is the inverse operation of multiplication right so a negative exponent is basically repeated division x to the negative 1 would be 1 divided by x x to the negative 2 would be 1 divided by x divided by x x to the negative 3 would be 1 divided by x divided by x divided by x and so on seeing it like this 
,,makes the pattern clear but mathematicians prefer to express negative exponents in fraction form where one is divided by the same number of x's multiplied together but since those multiplied x's are all on the bottom of the fraction you're actually dividing by all of them here's an example that will help you see that that's true 2 to the negative third power let's first try that as a repeated division problem like our pattern shows us we always start with a 1 so we would have 1 divided by 2 divided by 2 divided by 2. if we do those operations from left to right using a calculator we get 0.125 as the answer now let's write it in fraction form like our law of exponents tells us we can 2 to the negative 3rd power would be the same as one divided by two to the third power and that's the same as one over two times two 
,,times two which simplifies to one over eight and one over eight simplifies to 0.125 see whether you write it as a pattern of repeated division or in fraction form like our inverse law shows you get the same answer and now you know how to handle any expression with a negative exponent it's just 1 over the same expression with a positive exponent x to the negative one is one over x to the positive one or just one over x x to the negative two is one over x to the positive two x to the negative three is one over x to the positive three and so on all right three laws down five more to go and these next five show us how we can do various math operations involving exponents in fact the next law tells us how we can take a number raised to a power and then raise that to a power as you can see it shows an expression x to the power of m grouped inside parentheses and then that whole group is being raised to the nth power it's a nesting situation kind of like those russian nesting dolls 
,,so what if someone asks you to simplify the expression x squared cubed which means the entire x squared term is raised to the third power well our law tells us that 
,,we can simplify that by multiplying the exponents together see how it equals x to the power of m n which means m times n that means x squared raised to the third power would be the same as x to the power of two times three which is six wanna see why that's true well think about what it would mean to raise x squared to the third 
,,power it would mean multiplying three x squared terms together like this and each one of those x squared terms simplifies to x times x right so we end up with six x's being multiplied together which is just x to the sixth power see our law works great if you have a number raised to a power and that's all raised to another power 
,,you can just multiply the two exponents together to simplify it and it works for negative exponents too like what if we had x squared raised to the negative third power well our law tells us that that's the same as x to the power of two times negative three which is x to the negative sixth to see if that's true we'll need to use the law we just learned about negative exponents and rewrite this as one over x squared to the positive third power that simplifies to one over x squared times x squared times x squared which in turn simplifies to one over six x's being multiplied together and that all checks out because one over x to the sixth would be the same as x to the negative sixth power pretty cool huh okay we're halfway through our list of laws and we're gonna look at the next two as a set because they tell us how we can multiply and divide expressions that have the same base and that's important because we couldn't simplify them to have a single exponent if the bases were different the first law says that if we have the base x with exponent m being multiplied by the same base x with exponent n we can combine them simply by adding the exponents together and the second law says if we have the base x with exponent m being divided by the same base x with exponent n we can combine them simply by subtracting the exponents let's see some examples of each like this one two to the third times two to the fourth does that fit the pattern of our first law yep the base of 
,,both expressions is the same but they happen to have different exponents the law would still work if the exponents were the same but they don't have to be just the bases have to be the same our law tells us that this would equal 2 to the power of three plus four or two to the seventh power but does it well let's break it down and see two to the third is two times two times two and that's being multiplied by two to the fourth which is two times two times two times two that's a lot of twos being multiplied together seven two's to be exact aha so that is what you'd get by just adding the exponents together since three plus four equals seven and this law makes total sense if you think about what an exponent really means the exponent is telling you to do repeated multiplication of the base right so this first part is telling you to multiply three twos together and the second part is telling you to multiply four twos together so that's why you can add the exponents together if the 
,,base is the same or think about it like this if we had 10 x's all being multiplied together we could form different groups of them and combine them using exponents like we could combine the first four x's into x to the fourth and combine the remaining six x's into x to the sixth and of course those expressions would be multiplied together since all of the x's were being multiplied but you'd probably never want to do that would you i mean why not just combine all 10 x's into the expression x to the tenth ah but there you see that our law holds true x to the fourth times x to the sixth would equal x to the power of four plus six or x to the tenth okay now let's move on and see some examples of the second law in this set which tells us how to divide expressions with the same base suppose we have the expression 5 to the third power divided by 5 to the second power our law says that we can simplify this by subtracting the exponents specifically we take the exponent on the top and 
,,subtract the exponent on the bottom from it if we do that the simplified version would be 5 to the power of 3 minus 2 or 5 to the first power but is that right to see let's write the expression out in expanded form on the top of our division problem we have five to the third which is five times five times five and on the bottom 
,,we have five to the second which is five times five does this look like something you've seen while simplifying fractions yep since all the bases are the same they form pairs of common factors on the top and bottom that can be canceled out this 5 over 5 cancels and this 5 over 5 cancels if you don't know why that works be sure to watch our video about simplifying fractions and what do we end up with well all the factors on the bottom cancelled out which leaves 1 since there's always a factor of 1 and there's only one 5 left on the top so our expression simplified to 5 over one or just five following our law we got a simplified version of five to the first power which is also just five so it really did work but to make sure you've really got it let's try using this law again with the expression x to the fourth power over x to the sixth power this one's interesting our law says that we can simplify it by subtracting the bottom exponent from the top right but in this case that will give us a negative exponent because the bottom exponent is bigger than the top four minus six would be negative two so according to our law this expression should be equal to x to the negative two let's try writing it out in expanded form to see if that's true on the top x to the fourth would be the same as four x's multiplied together and on the bottom x to the sixth would be the same as six x's multiplied together once again we see that there are pairs of common factors that we can cancel four pairs to be precise and when we cancel them all we're left with a one on the top because there's always a factor of one and only two x's multiplied together on the bottom if we recombine these two x's we get one over x squared and if you remember the law we learned earlier about negative exponents you'll see that one over x squared is exactly the same as x to the power of negative two so these laws really do work okay it's finally time to look at the last two laws on our list and 
,,fortunately they're pretty easy ones so we're not going to spend too much time on them these laws look kind of similar to the last pair just like before the first one involves multiplication and the second one involves division but notice that in these laws the bases are different but the exponents are the same that's the exact 
,,opposite of the situation with the last pair of laws it turns out that these laws aren't about simplifying exponents they're about how you can distribute or undistribute a common exponent to different bases the first law shows this group x times y that's being raised to the power of m and it says that you can rewrite it as x to 
,,the m times y to the m in other words you can distribute the exponent to each factor in the group and the second law shows the group x divided by y that's being raised to the power of n and it says that you can rewrite it as x to the n divided by y to the n in other words you can distribute the exponent to each part of the fraction of course these laws would work in reverse too and you could undistribute the exponents if they're the same for example if you're given the expression x squared 
,,times y squared you could rewrite that as the quantity x times y squared and if you have the expression x squared divided by y squared you could rewrite that as the 
,,quantity x over y squared here are two expressions that will help you see why you can distribute or undistribute exponents like our laws show in the first expression we have the quantity x times y squared and that's the same as x times y times x times y and the commutative property says that we can rearrange those factors like this x times x times y times y but look we can simplify that into x squared times y squared so that checks out in the second expression we have the quantity x over y 
,,squared that's the same as x over y times x over y to multiply these fractions we just multiply the tops and multiply the bottoms which gives us x times x over y times y and that simplifies to x squared over y squared so that one checks out too all right so now you know about the so called laws of exponents and there's a good chance that you'll see them explained in slightly different forms or different orders or even using different terminology in other math videos or books but the basic ideas will be the same some people like to try to memorize this list of laws and you can do that if you want to but it's an even better idea to focus on knowing how exponents really work because if you truly understand that you can actually figure out a lot of these laws for yourself and what's the best way to understand how exponents really work yep you gotta practice so be sure to do some problems with exponents on your own as always thanks for watching math antics and i'll see you next time learn more at mathantics.com so what'd you think i thought you said the guy was going to be funny

Now, let's draw a line on the lockers of the 4th row and then on the lockers of the 6th column. The point where the two lines meet is my locker. I need to enter the missing number. Easy. Don't believe me? This time the number is 13. How did I know? Squares of 12 and 5 are 144 and 25. Add them to get 169. 169 is the square of 13. Thats our missing number. Such groups of numbers where Sum of squares of two numbers is equal to square of the third are called Pythagorean triples or triplets. Positive. Zero. Negative. Negative. Zero. Positive Confused? Look dude. Math is everywhere. The temperature outside my igloo is negative 27 degrees Celsius, while inside it is 15 degrees Celsius. These numbers, that is, negative 27, 15 and zero are integers. Integers are a set of numbers which includes natural numbers, their negatives as well as zero. Fractions and decimals such as 1 over 12 or 9.2 are not integers. Honey. Where's my comb?

Operations of While number,TMubSggUOVE,in this video we're going to focus on just some basic topics in math this is for those of you who really want to boost your math skills so we're going to talk about 
,,how to add subtract especially when there's negative numbers how to multiply do mental math from your head we're going to go over the multiplication tables the ones 
,,that you got to know we're also going to talk about how to divide and how to convert fractions into decimals how to add subtract fractions multiply divide how to convert them to mixed numbers we're going to talk about how to do percentages in your head and how to simplify fractions like mentally we're also going to go over like 
,,exponents and even exponential fractions order of operations we're going to talk about square roots how to simplify radicals cube roots we're going to go into scientific notation how to convert it into decimal or standard form and vice versa how to multiply divide two numbers in scientific notation even how to take a square root of scientific notation number now we're also going to talk about how to solve equations both linear equations equations with decimals fractions equations involving 
,,radicals cube roots and also how to factor and use the quadratic equation and then after that we're going to talk about how to graph linear and quadratic equations and we'll go over some general parent functions and how to do some transformations so just some some of the common topics that you'll see in algebra but the beginning part of this video focus more mostly on arithmetic and then for those of you who are looking to do well in algebra the rest of the video might be of you see you so 
,,let's begin so let's start with some basic addition problems if you want to add five plus four what is the answer now for those of you who know you know it's nine but let's say if you don't know the answer to that problem what you could do is imagine a number line over here you have zero on the left side negative 1 negative 2 negative 3 and so forth on the right you have 1 2 3 4 & 5 but now let's start from 5 let's say zeros over here and this is 5 starting from 5 you want to add 4 if you wish to add you need to go to the right if you want to subtract you need to move to the left side so since you want to add 4 we're going to add 4 we're going to go 4 
,,units from the right so 1 2 3 4 we're going to stop here so this is going to be 6 7 8 9 therefore 5 plus 4 is 9 let's try some other examples so what is 7 minus 3 7 
,,minus 3 is 4 but let's prove it with the number line so let's say this is 0 & 7 is somewhere over here if we start from 7 and we wish to subtracted by 3 we need to go 3 spaces to the left so 1 2 3 so this is going to be 6 5 4 therefore 7 minus 3 is 4 so what about this one 5 minus 8 what's the answer to that particular problem now 5 minus 8 is negative 3 so we're going to start at 5 and because we're subtracting we're going to go 8 spaces to left so one two three four this would be five six seven eight so this is four three two one zero negative one negative two and negative three what's negative four plus five negative four plus five is positive one so if you start from negative four and since we're adding we're adding five to four we're going to go five units to the right so one two three four five negative 3 negative 2 negative 1 0 1 now you can also add it the other way to negative 4 plus 5 is the same as 5 minus 4 you can reverse the numbers this will also give you 1 so 
,,if you started at 5 my 14 is to the left 1 2 3 4 you would end up at the same location which is 1 so try this one negative 8 plus 3 by the way for these the problems feel free to pause the video try it yourself and see if you can get the answer negative 8 plus 3 is negative 5 so starting at negative 8 we're adding 3 so we're going to go 3 spaces to the right 1 2 3 so negative 7 negative 6 negative 5 and there it is now what about negative 9 minus 4 what's the answer to that problem so negative 9 minus 4 is a negative 13 so if we start at negative 9 we're going to subtract 4 to it so I'm going to go 4 units to the left so 1 2 3 4 this is going to be negative 10 negative 11 negative 12 negative 13 now what if there's like three negative signs like negative 10 minus 2 negative 4 sometimes you might see this in parentheses but it's the same as if it's written like this 2 now whenever you see two negative signs right next to each other with no number in between them you can change that into a positive so this is the same as negative 10 plus 4 a negative times a negative is a positive a negative times a positive is a negative and a positive times a positive is just a positive number so what we have is negative 10 plus 4 so starting from negative 10 we're going to add 4 units or go 4 units to the right so 
,,1 2 3 4 negative 9 negative 8 negative 7 negative 6 therefore negative 10 plus 4 is equal to negative 6 so what about 8 minus negative 3 how would you do that one so we can change the two negative signs into a plus so this is a plus 3 which we know is 11 if we start from 8 and go 3 units to the right we would end at 11 so now let's take a quiz try these problems 8 plus 7 5 plus 9 six plus seven and five plus twelve so try these four problems first you can use the number line technique and then I'm going to pause the video to take a minute to do that and I'll just give you the answers so eight plus seven is fifteen so if you go if you start from eight and you go seven units to the right you should end at 15 6 plus 7 is 13 5 plus 9 is 14 and 5 plus 12 is 17 try these let's say if you have 9 minus 4 and 12 minus 5 and 14 minus 6 and one more that's similar to this type of problem 22 minus 13 so in these four problems notice that the positive number is larger than a negative number when that happens usually your result is going to be positive so 9 minus 4 is equal to positive 5 using the number line if you start at 9 and go 4 units to the left since you're subtracting it by 4 this is going to be 8 7 6 5 so 14 minus 6 if you don't do that correctly it looks like this 14 minus 6 is positive 8 and 12 minus 5 that's positive 7 and 22 minus 13 is positive 9 so you can use the number line to check your answers or if you have a calculator you can use that too but it's always good to do mental math try these 4 problems 7 - 9 4 minus 12 five minus 16 and eight minus 19 so notice that the negative number is larger this time so therefore the result should be negative 7 minus 9 is negative 2 so if you start from 7 and if you travel 9 units to the left this will be 6 5 or what Scout it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 so this will be 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 negative 1 negative 2 so we get that answer 5 minus a negative 16 you should get negative 11 4 minus 12 is negative 8 and 8 minus 19 is negative 11 as well so let's use the number line for one more example now let's use it for 4 minus 12 but counting 12 spaces backwards that might seem like a long task you could do it though but we can also write it as negative 12 plus 4 that's the same as 4 minus 12 so if we start at negative 12 and if we go 4 units to the 
,,right it's it's going to be a 1 2 3 4 so this is negative 11 negative 10 negative 9 negative 8 but if you want to do it the long way you could start with 4 and go 12 spaces backwards 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 and as you can see you're going to reach negative eight try these examples negative 6 plus 9 negative 5 plus 14 negative 8 plus 12 and negative 9 plus 17 so we have a positive and a negative number notice that the positive number is larger so when we add these two values we should get a positive value at the end so negative 6 plus 9 is positive 3 using the number line hopefully start with negative 6 and if we go 9 spaces to the right 1 2 3 4 5 6 
,,7 8 9 this will be negative 5 negative 4 negative 3 negative 2 negative 1 0 1 2 3 negative 8 plus 12 that's going to equal positive 4 negative 5 plus 14 that's 9 and negative 9 plus 17 will give you 8 so here's the next round of questions negative five plus two negative twelve plus five negative 16 plus 7 and negative 14 minus five so try those so starting with negative five we're going to add two units so one two we're going to go to knees to the right this will be negative four and nine of three so negative five plus two is negative three so notice that the first number the negative one is larger so therefore the result will be negative negative 12 plus five is equal to negative seven negative 16 plus seven should get negative nine and negative 14 minus 5 is negative 19 try these what if so let's say if we have 
,,two negative signs negative 3 and minus 5 what do you think the answer will be to that particular problem so negative 3 minus 5 is negative 8 so if we make the number line start in that negative 3 we're going to subtract it by 5 so we need to go 5 units to the left 1 2 3 4 5 so this will be negative 4 negative 5 negative 6 negative 7 and negative 8 so when you have to number like two negative numbers written in the way that we have it in this video what you could do is just add 3 plus 5 which is 8 and then make a negative so negative 8 minus 4 is the same as 8 plus 4 with a negative on the outside so what you could do is say 8 plus 4 is 12 and add the 
,,negative sign to confirm it we're going to start at negative 8 which is over here and we're going to subtract it by 4 we're go for units to left 1 2 3 4 so this is negative 9 negative 10 negative 11 negative 12 so negative 7 minus 6 is the same as 7 plus 6 with a negative on the outside 7 plus 6 is 13 so this is negative 13 and 
,,this is going to be negative and then 9 plus 8 so 9 plus 8 is 17 so this is going to be negative 17 try these negative eight minus two negative three negative nine minus a negative 15 negative 12 minus negative four and negative 14 minus negative 16 so whenever you see two negative signs like right next to each other you can make that into a positive number so this is the same as a negative eight plus three so using the number line if we start at negative eight we're going to add three units to the right one two three so this is going to be negative seven negative six and negative five so negative 9 minus negative 15 is the same as negative nine plus 15 and negative 9 19 is the same as 15 minus 9 so you're going to get positive 6 so you can reverse it if you want so negative 12 minus negative 4 is the same I mean 
,,minus negative 4 is the same as plus 4 and negative 12 plus 4 is the same as 4 minus 12 and that should give you negative 8 here we have negative 14 minus negative 16 so that's negative 14 plus 16 and negative 14 plus 16 is the same as 16 minus 14 which equals 2 so keep that in mind you can always reverse the order if you have negative 3 plus 8 you can switch it the 8 is positive 2 3 is negative so this is the same as positive 8 minus 3 which is just 8 minus 3 and that's equal to 5 so if you have like a negative 10 plus 7 you can reverse and say no that's 7 minus 10 and the negative number is larger so when I subtract them I get 3 but since the sign of the larger one is negative this is going to be negative here the sign of the larger is positive so this positive so that covers some basic edition but let's say if 
,,you want to add larger numbers let's say if you want to add a 26 plus 74 what would you do without a calculator well you can write it like this 6 plus 4 is 10 so we're going to put the 0 here but the one we're going to put it in the next column and then we add 1 plus 2 plus 7 1 plus 2 is 3 3 plus 7 is 10 so 26 plus 74 is therefore 100 try this one add 35 and 62 so 35 plus 62 5 plus 2 is 7 3 plus 6 is 9 so this equals 97 now what about 47 plus 65 so 47 plus 65 5 plus 7 is 12 you got to carry over the 1 and then 1 plus 4 is 5 5 plus 6 is 11 so this gives you 1/12 now what about subtraction so let's say if we wish to subtract 87 minus 23 so let's write it like this 87 minus 23 so 7 minus 3 is 4 and then 8 minus 2 is 6 so this is equal to 64 not bad right so you can see it here 8 minus 2 6 and then the 7 minus 3 is 4 
,,so you get 64 what about this 164 - 39 so if we subtract 4 - 9 we're going to get a negative number so we don't want that actually let me put some space between these two numbers now what you could do is borrow a 1 from the 6 so the 6 turns into a 5 and we're going to put the 1 here so 14 minus 9 is 5 and then you can subtract 5 + 3 that gives you 2 so therefore 64 minus 39 is 25 let's try another one like that so 76 minus 48 so 6 minus 8 that's going to give us a negative number so let's take away or borrow a 1 from the 7 so that turns into a 6 so instead of having 6 we now have a 16 so 16 minus 8 is 8 and 6 minus 4 is 2 so we get 28 now what about 125 minus 69 what is that equal to so let's borrow a 1 from 2 so now we have 15 15 minus 9 is 6 and so this is not 1 1 and so now what we have here is 11 minus 6 is 5 
,,so therefore 125 minus 69 is equal to 56 try this one 42 minus 68 notice that 68 is a bigger number than 42 so therefore the overall result is negative now you don't want to subtract it the way it's written what you could do is if you're subtracting by a larger negative value reverse it 68 minus 42 so 8 minus 2 that's going to be 6 and 6 minus 4 is 2 since you reversed it add the negative sign so therefore 42 minus 68 is equal to negative 26 let's try another example 25 minus 74 so we're subtracting 25 by a larger negative number so let's reverse it so 4 minus 5 we can do that we need to borrow on 1 so the 7 will turn into a 6 and the 4 will become 14 
,,so 14 minus 5 is 9 and 6 minus 2 is 4 so we get 49 but we're going to add a negative sign so this is negative 49 so now let's go over multiplication the first thing 
,,we're going to do is construct a simple multiplication table so let's begin now if you can construct the table yourself it's going to help you to like know your multiplication numbers which I would highly recommend you do so as well because you will see a pattern so for example what's like what's five times four now some of you 
,,may know the answer but if you if you're not sure what that is it might help for you to get a calculator or construct a multiplication tables and you want to know your multiplication numbers up to 12 it's going to help you with a lot of referencing calculations that we're going to do from here on so don't skip this step now I may not go up to 12 in this particular example but I want you to I'm going to give you an idea of how to construct the table so what we're going to do is put numbers in the first row this is going to be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and here we're going to have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 I guess we'll go up to 8 here and maybe we can go up to 10 so 1 times 1 is 1 1 times 2 is 2 and then these numbers will increase by 1 now 2 times 1 is 2 2 times 2 is 4 2 times 3 is 6 and these numbers will continue to increase by twos so notice the pattern and so now for the threes 3 times 1 is 3 3 times 2 is 6 3 times 3 is 9 3 times 4 is 12 3 times 5 is 15 3 times 6 is 18 3 times 7 is 21 3 times 8 is 24 3 times 9 is 27 3 times 10 is 30 so notice we're just adding threes now 4 times 1 is 4 4 times 2 is 8 4 times 3 is 12 4 times 4 16 4 times 5 is 20 4 times 
,,6 is 24 4 times 7 is 28 8 4 times 8 is 32 4 times 9 is 36 and 40 in 4 times 10 is 40 now 5 + 1 is 5 5 times 2 is 10 and then these numbers will continue to increase 
,,by 5 so 5 times 5 is 25 5 times 8 is 40 and 5 times 10 is 50 so these numbers will continue to add by 6 6 times 4 is 24 6 times 7 is 42 and so forth 7 times 1 is 7 7 times 3 is 21 7 times 6 is 42 7 times 8 56 and now for the 8 so this will keep increasing by 8 so let's say if you wish to multiply 6 times 8 so you will look for you would go on the six row and stopping to reach the 8 column so 6 times 8 is 48 so now let's say if you want to multiply 7 times 9 so here 7 here's 9 so from the seventh row go towards the ninth column and you get 63 so therefore 7 times 9 is 63 so let's say if we wish to multiply 4 times 6 so for 406 column 4 times 6 is 24 so 
,,that's how you would use it so feel free to take a moment and study the table and even get to a point where you can just drop the table on yourself go up to 12 you want to know your multiplication numbers from 1 to 12 and then I'll cause you on it so let's say if you want to multiply 5 times 6 this can be written like this or you can be written as 5 times 6 5 times 6 is 30 now if you ever forget the table what you could do is um you can add 5 6 times because that's what most location is 5 times 6 means you're adding 5 6 times and this will give you 30 so for example 4 times 3 is equal to 12 4 times 3 means that your add in 4 3 times and that's equal to 12 it can also mean that you're adding 3 4 times which will also be equivalent to 12 so 5 times 3 according to the table is 15 but if you want to turn it into addition 5 times 3 is 5 plus 5 Plus 5 3 times or it's adding 3-5 times and that gives you in both cases 15 so what's 6 times 4 6 times 4 is 24 if you add 6 4 times you get 24 okay so at this point make sure you have the multiplication table memorize and then once you do try this quiz a times seven just make sure you know it is 56 9 times 9 is 81 7 times 6 is 42 10 times 5 is 50 okay try these feel free to pause the video so 12 times 12 8 times 6 4 times 9 and 3 times 12 so 12 times 12 is 144 8 times 6 is 48 4 times 9 is 36 and 3 times 12 is also 36 so 12 times 5 that is equal to 67 times 9 is 63 8 times 12 is 96 and 11 times 11 is 121 okay let's try a few more problems so what's 12 times 9 5 times 8 5 times 11 7 times 12 12 times 11 and finally 9 times 8 so 12 times 9 is 108 5 times 8 is 40 5 times 11 is 55 7 times 12 
,,is 84 12 times 11 is 132 9 times 8 is 72 so make sure you're able to perform such a multiplication now let's say if you have larger numbers let's say if you wish to 
,,multiply 15 times 8 how would you do that well you could do it the old-fashioned way 15 times 8 8 times 5 we know it's 40 so we're going to put the zero and move the 4 to the top and then you're going to multiply 8 times 1 8 times 1 is 8 but we need to add the 4 so this is equivalent to 120 now if you have a calculator with you 
,,or you can go online and type in online calculator in Google you can punch in this number in your calculated 15 times 8 is 120 now another way you can do this is you can break up the 15 into 10 plus 5 10 plus 5 is 15 and then multiply by 8 8 times 10 is 80 and 5 times 8 is 40 now 8 plus 4 is 12 if you add the 0 you get 120 so 80 plus 40 is 120 let's try another problem so what's 20 times 14 how would you multiply those two numbers so 4 times 0 is 0 and then 4 times 2 is 8 now we're going to add a 0 so 1 times 0 is 0 and 1 times 2 is 2 so if we add these numbers 0 plus 0 is 0 0 + 8 that's 8 and drop down the 2 we get to 80 so another way to multiply 20 
,,by 14 is picture in your mind if you have 14 $20 bills what's the value of 14 $20 bills you know 5 $20 bills is 100 so another 5 of another 5 $20 bills is another 100 and then you have 4 left over $20 bills for 20s is 80 so if you add this up you have $280 and as you can see you have 14 20s on this side 5 + 5 + 4 is 14 when it comes to money it's very easy to do math everyone understands it now another way you could have done this is you could separate the 14 into 10 plus 4 and 20 times 10 
,,is 200 if you have 10 $20 bills that's $200 and 20 times 4 well 2 times 4 is 8 so if you have the zero you get 80 and then so this adds to 280 so let's say if you want to multiply Oh point 25 by 15 what would you get so 5 times 5 is 25 so we're going to put the 5 here and add the 2 to the top 5 times 2 is 10 plus 2 that's 12 then we need to add a 0 5 times 1 is 5 and 5 times 2 I mean 1 times 2 that's 2 so if we add this we get 5 7 & 3 now notice that we have two spaces after the decimal so 
,,we need two spaces here after the decimal so this is 3.75 so that's how you can multiply a number in the decimal another way to multiply 15 by 25 is we know point 25 is 25 cents imagine if you have 15 quarters 15 quarters has a value of 375 for every four quarters you have as $1 so 4 times 25 cents that's one dollar another four quarters is a dollar and another set of four quarters is dollar so that's twelve quarters that we have so far and then 15 quarters we need three more so the remaining three quarters is twenty five cents I mean seventy five cents so you have three dollars and seventy five cents now if you add these numbers MPR these you have a total of 15 quarters 4 plus 4 plus 4 plus 3 is 15 so let's say if you want to multiply 8 times 17 so try this problem but using both techniques so let's do it this way 17 times 8 so 8 times 7 that's 56 we're going to move the 5 here and 8 times 1 is 8 plus 5 that's 13 so now let's use the other technique let's replace 17 with 10 
,,plus 7 so 8 times 10 is 80 and 8 times 7 is 56 if you add these two numbers 80 and 56 6 plus 0 is 6 8 plus 5 is 13 you get the same answer 136 so there's many techniques that you can use to do mental math or even just math on paper without the use of the calculator but now let's go over some other concepts let's say if you want 
,,"to multiply 10 times 10 now by instinct you probably know that this is 100 but the way you should do this is in your mind you should multiply 1 times 1 which gives you 1 and then add the 2 zeroes so for an example 10 times 100 well if we multiply 1 & 1 we get 1 and then add the 3 zeroes that we see we have one two three zeroes so one will be 0 0 0 so that's a thousand so 100 times 100 so 1 times 1 is 1 and then add the 4 0 so we get 10,000 so what do you think 100 times 10,000 is well here "
,,"we have a total of six zeros so this is 1 million okay so now let's try that let's try this principle to other harder problems let's say if you want to multiply 50 times 100 so basically if you have 50 $100 bills how much money do you have so if we multiply the numbers on the outside 5 & 1 5 times 1 is 5 and then add the 3 zeros this is 5000 if you want to multiply 40 by 200 what you do first is multiply 4 times 2 and that's going to give you 8 and then add the 3 zeroes so therefore 40 times 200 is 8,000 so what's 30 times 600 well 3 times 6 is 18 and if we add the 3 zeroes that's 18 thousand so what about 70 times eight hundred seven times eight is fifty-six add the three zeros that's 56 thousand okay so let's try a quiz so try these problems so these large calculations you can do without the use of a calculator "
,,"so 40 times 900 seems like you multiplying very very huge numbers but remember all you need to do is multiply the numbers on the outside 4 times 9 is 36 and then add the 3 zeroes so therefore 40 times 900 is 36,000 so what's 500 times 700 so 5 times 7 is 35 and then we have four zeros to add so this is going to be 350,000 60 times 40 so 6 times 4 is 24 add the zeros this is 2400 what's 8 times 5 8 times 5 is 40 then add the 6 remaining zeros so this is equal to 40 million now what's 12,000 "
,,"times 70,000 now this is why you want to know your multiplication tables up to 12 12 times 7 is 84 and we have three zeros on this side and four 0s here so we have a total of seven zeros so let me make sure I put the comma in the right place so I need 2 comma here and here so this is 12,000 times 70,000 is 840 million so regardless of how big these numbers get as long as you follow the basic principles you can pretty much do math up to any limit by the way the video that you're currently watching is on one our trailer version of a longer four-hour paid video so I'm going to post a link here in case if you want to watch the remaining three hours of this video if you find useful and you can check that out if you have any questions feel free to post it in the comments section below so now let's go over division let's say if you wanted to I'd 56 by 7 what is the answer now this can be written as 56 over 7 as a fraction in both cases it represents division now the vision is the reverse of multiplication so you need to ask yourself 7 times what number is equal to 56 again you need to know your multiplication tables 7 times 8 is 56 therefore 56 divided by 7 is 8 so let's try another example what is 24 divided by 6 so 6 times what number is equal to 24 so hopefully you have your multiplication tables memorized at this point we'll take a minute see if you can figure this out without the use of a calculator you can check your answer with the calculator though 24 divided "
,,"by 6 is 4 because 6 times 4 is 24 ok let's try one more example so what is 42 divided by 6 or 6 times what number is 42 since 6 times 7 is 42 42 divided by 6 is 7 so now it's your turn feel free to try the following problems so 20 divided by 4 36 divided by 6 72 divided by 8 and 144 divided by 12 so go ahead take a minute and see if you can find the answers to those questions so 20 divided by 4 is 5 because 4 times 5 is 20 since 6 times 6 is 36 36 divided by 6 is 6 now 8 times 9 is 72 so 72 divided by 8 is 9 and since 12 times 12 is 144 144 divided by 12 is 12 try these 30 divided by 5 18 divided by 2 48 divided by 6 and 54 divided by 9 so 30 divided by 5 is 6 18 divided by 2 is 9 since 9 times 2 is 18 and 48 divided by 6 is 8 and 9 times 6 is 54 so 54 divided by 9 is 6 try this example 400 divided by 5 now you might think this is outside of your range but you can view it this way 400 is 40 times 10 divided by 5 now what you could do is divide 10 by 5 10 divided by 5 is 2 because 5 times 2 is 10 and we still have the 40 so 40 times 2 is 80 another way you could have seen this is you can focus on the 40 right here 40 divided by 5 is 8 and then simply add the 0 you can get 80 so try this one 3500 divided by 7 so let's divide 35 by 7 first 35 divided by 7 is 5 and then add the 2 zeroes so 3,500 divided by 7 is 500 so what about this one what's 18,000 divided by 30 18 divided by 3 is 6 now we can cancel a zero so we have two zeros left over we're going to carry it "
,,"over so 18,000 divided by 30 is 600 now what about 4,500 divided by 900 well we can cancel the zeros so this is basically 45 divided by 9 and since 9 times 5 is 45 then 45 over 9 is 5 so 4500 over 900 that's just 5 now what about 600,000 divided by 1200 so let's cancel the zeros we can cancel two zeros and if we divide 60 by 12 "
,,"we get 5 since 5 times 12 is 60 now there's two zeros remaining that we didn't account for so we're going to add those two zeros here so therefore 600,000 divided by 1200 is 500 now let's try this example 60 3000 divided by 70 well we can cancel 0 63 divided by 7 is 9 and we're going to add these two zeros so therefore 63,000 over 70 is 900 so now let's say if you have a number that doesn't go into it let's say like 39 over 6 6 + 39 that's not in the multiplication tables so what can you do in a situation like this since 39 is not a multiple of 6 you can use long division to get the answer so basically we're converting a fraction into a decimal the 39 "
,,is going to go inside the long division symbol now you have to ask yourself how many times does 6 go into 39 well if you write out all the multiples of 6 is 6 12 18 
,,24 30 36 42 is too much so we're going to get rid of that you need to add 6 6 times to get to 36 since 6 times 6 is 36 and then you just um they need to subtract these numbers 39-36 is 3 now 6 doesn't go into 3 so we're going to add a 0 so we're going to add a decimal point and we're going to treat this as if it's 30 so 6 goes into 35 times because we have to add 6 5 times skip to 30 so this shouldn't have been a 0 here I should have just put just a decimal point but we still going to bring down to 0 so 6 times 5 is 30 and we have a remainder of 0 so the answer therefore is 6 point 5 so that's a simple way in which you can convert a fraction into a decimal but let's try another example let's try 42 divided by 8 so how many times does 8 go into 42 so let's write out the multiples of 8 8 16 24 32 40 48 is too much so if we add 8 5 times you get 248 times 5 is 40 and we need to subtract so 42 minus 40 is 2 and we're going to add a decimal point bring down a 0 so how many times is 8 go into 28 goes into 20 at least 2 times 3 times 2 b-24s that's too much so 8 times 2 is 16 and the difference of that will give us 4 and we need to add another 
,,zero so how many times is it go into 40 as you can see it's five times so we got to add eight five times get to 40 so we're going to put a 5 here and 8 times 5 is 40 so the remainder is zero once you get a remainder of zero that's it I'm you're done so the answer that you're looking for is right here so 42 divided by eight is therefore equal to five point two five let's try another example well actually you can pause the video and try this one so let's say if you want to find out what 22 divided by four is so take a minute and try it yourself so how many times does 4 go into 22 so if we write out the multiples of four it's 4 8 12 16 20 24 is too much so 4 goes into 22 at least five times so 4 times 5 is 20 and the difference is 2 we're going to add a decimal point and then bring down a zero now 4 goes into 20 five times so we get another 5 and when we subtract these numbers the remainder is zero so this is equal to five point five all right so let's try let's see 28/3 now three times six is eighteen three times nine as close as 27 3 times 10 is 30 has too much so 3 goes into 28 seven times so now we have to subtract 28 minus step 27 is 1 we're going to add a decimal point and bring down a 0 3 goes into 10 three times 3 times 3 is 9 and the difference is 1 so you bring that another 0 you get 10 notice that this process will repeat 3 times 3 is another 9 we're going to get 1 and therefore it's like 9 point 3 3 3 3 3 p.m. so what you could write it just nine point three with a line on top which means nine point three repeating you can route it to 9.33 if you want it's up to you so now let's try 47 divided by five so how many 
,,times is 5 2 going to 47 we know 5 times 9 is 45 5 times 10 is too much I'll be 15 and 47 divided by 45 is 2 so we need to add a decimal point since we don't have a 
,,remainder of 0 and we gotta add one here as well now 5 goes into 20 four times so we therefore get nine point four and for the sake of practice let's try one more example 426 divided by 12 so how many times does 12 go into 42 if we write out the multiples of 12 is 12 24 36 48 is too much so 12 goes into 42 at least 3 times 12 times 3 is 36 so 42 minus 36 is 6 bring down the other six so how many times does 12 go into 66 well let's keep adding multiples of 12 48 plus 12 is 60 60 plus 12 is 72 that's too much so we need five 12s to get up to sixty so 12 times 5 is 60 so that gives us a remainder of 6 so now we need to add a decimal point we're going to bring down to zero and we know another five will give us 60 12 times 5 is 60 and this time the remainder is zero so therefore 426 divided by 12 is equal to this number which is 35 point five so now let's say if you even if the numerator is smaller than the denominator so let's say if you have a fraction like 1 over 4 how do you convert that into a decimal so the 4 is on the outside and a 1 is on the inside well Ford is going to lunch so let's add a decimal point and we're going to add one here so now let's treat the one as if it's a 10 4 goes into 10 two times so it's really a decimal here but you can view it as 10 minus 8 10 minus 8 is 2 we're going to add a 0 4 goes into 20 5 times and the remainder 0 so 1 over 4 is equal to 0.25 what about 1 over 3 this is one that's going to repeat so let's add a decimal point 
,,so 3 goes into 10 three times three times three is nine so 10 minus 9 is 1 add another 0 3 goes into 10 three times so that's going to be 9 and this is just going to keep repeating so 1 over 3 is about point 33 repeating now there are some common fractions that you simply want to commit to memory you just want to know them it can help you if you need to do a quick calculation especially in your head 1/2 is 0.5 2 over 2 whenever the numerator which is the top part of the fraction and the denominator which is the bottom part of the fraction whenever they have the same value the value of the entire fraction is a whole it's equal to 1 now here's some other numbers you want to note 1 over 3 is about point 33 2 over 3 is like point 6 266 repeating which is really cool you can run into point 67 and 3 over 3 as a whole so that's equal to 1 1/4 is 1/4 that's point 2 5 which is the same as a 25 percent to 45 which is about 50% 3/4 is 0.75 as a percent that's 75% and 4 over 4 that's a whole that's equal to 1 which is a hundred percent so 1/5 that's point two and that's about a 20% to over five is point four you simply just multiply point two times 
,,two and you get point four and so that's like um so that's 40% 3 over 5 that's point 2 times 3 which is point six and so about 60% and 4 over 5 that is equal to 0.8 
,,which is 80% you know 5 over 5 is 1 now the other fractions that you want to know is like 1 over 8 1 over 8 is 0.125 which is equivalent to 12.5% 2 over 8 is point 25 3 over 8 is 0.375 which is 37.5% four eighths is point 5 or 50 percent and 5 over 8 is 0.625 which is 60 2.5% 6 over 8 if you divide the 6 and the 8 by 2 you get 3/4 you can reduce the fraction which is equal to 0.75 or 75% and 7/8 is 0.875 which is 80 7.5% and then the last one you want to know is the tenths so like 1 over 10 is 0.1 which is 10% to over 10 that's point 2 which is 20% 3 over 10 is 0.3 which is 30% 4 / 10 point four five ten point five nine over ten point nine so you can see a pad here and that's like 90% so now why is this useful well sometimes you may not want to do long division you can divide fractions in your head so like for example that problem that we have before 39 over 6 you can break that down into two smaller fractions you know 36 goes into 6 so you can write it as 36 over six now 39-36 is 3 so 39 over 6 is equal to 36 over 6 plus 3 over 6 because 36 plus 3 is 39 now by knowing your multiplication tables you know 36 over 6 is equal to 6 now 3 over 6 you can reduce that if you divide both numbers by 3 top and bottom whatever you do to the top you must do to the bottom of the fraction so if we divide the top fraction by 3 3 divided by 3 is 1 6 divided by 3 is 2 3 over 6 is equivalent to 1/2 and we know 1/2 as a fraction is point 5 so 6 plus 0.5 is therefore 6 point 5 and 
,,that's what we got for long division when we divide 839 by 6 the other example that we had was 42 over 8 now the highest multiple of 8 just under 42 is 14 so you want to separate this fraction one of which will be a multiple of 8 and the other is the remainder 42 minus 40 is 2 so 2 is the remainder now 8 goes into 40 five times 
,,or 40 divided by 8 is 5 now 2 over 8 we know that to be the same as 1/4 if you divide the top and the bottom by 2 you can reduce the fraction to 1/4 and 1/4 as a decimal we know it's point 2 5 so therefore we add 5 plus point 25 which is equivalent to 5 point 2 5 and so 42 over 8 is 5 point 2 5 so with this method go ahead and practice a few problems try 9 over 2 and 7 over 3 converted into a decimal and you can also convert it to a percentage as well 9 over 2 we can break it into 8 over 2 
,,plus from 1 over 2 8 divided by 2 is 4 and 1 over 2 is 0.5 so this is equal to 4.5 by the way as a percentage one is a hundred percent if you want to convert a decimal into a percentage multiply by 100 so 4.5 is 450 percent a coracle method is you can move the decimal point two units to the right so you get 450 now what about 7 
,,over 3 what is that as a decimal 7 over 3 we can break that into 6 over 3 and 1 over 3 now we know 6 divided by 3 is 2 and 1/3 is about point 33 so we get 2 point 33 as a percentage that's two hundred and thirty three percent so now let's try 5 over 4 and you can also try 8 over 5 so pause the video and see if you get the answer on paper so 5 over 4 we can rewrite that as 4 divided by 4 plus 1 over 4 now 4 divided by 4 that's just 1 and 1 over 4 is 0.25 so this is equal to 1.25 or 125 percent 8 over 5 that's 5 over 5 plus 3 over 5 so 5 over 5 is 1 3 over 5 is 0.6 now if you remember one of a 5 that's point 2 and then you multiply point 2 by 3 you get point 6 so this is equal to 1.6 or 160% okay let's not worry about the percentage anymore let's just convert the rest into decimals so try these two fifteen over two 
,,and nineteen over three so we can make this 14 over 2 plus 1 over 2 14 divided by 207 1/2 is 0.5 so this is equal to 7 point 5 now 3 goes into 19 6 times 3 times 6 is 18 so we can write this as 18 over 3 and 1/3 18 divided by 3 is 6 1/3 is point 33 so as a decimal this is six point 33 so try these two 11 over 4 and 24 over 5 11 
,,over 4 is 8 over 4 and 11 minus 8 is 3 that's the remainder so 8 over 4 is 2 3 4 6 point 7 5 so therefore 11 divided by 4 is 2 point 7 5 so 24 over 5 thats 20 over 5 plus 4 over 5 so if you think of the multiples of 5 that's 5 10 15 20 25 is too much it exceeds 24 so we need to stop at turning that's why we choose this number and then to get this number simply subtract 24 minus 20 it gives you the remainder 4 so 20 divided by 5 is 4 and 4 over 5 is 28 so that therefore 24 over 5 is 4.8 try 
,,this 123 over eight so multiples of eight are eight sixteen twenty-four twenty-four too high so will stop at sixteen 23 minus 16 is seven so eight 16 divided by 8 is 2 and 7/8 is about as a decimal point eight seven five so this is two point eight seven five by the way if you get like 9 as a fraction one over nine is about point one one one one repeating so 2 over 9 is about point 22 repeating 3 over 9 is point 33 repeating four over nine is point 44 repeating five over nine point 55 repeating and so forth so 6 over 9 is point six 6 repeating 8 over nine it's like point eight eight repeating so let's say if you have 15 over 99 that's going to be 0.15 repeating so it's like point one five one five one five it keeps on going forever so 27 over 99 it's going to be point two seven two seven two seven repeating so you 
,,"can write it as which is point two seven so 46 over 99 and 73 over 99 this will be point four six repeating 0.73 repeating now let's say if you have like 246 over nine nine nine this would be point two four six repeating and if you have like 375 over 999 it's 0.375 repeating now some of these you may be able to reduce this fraction but if you quickly want to get the decimal value this is what it is so just in case if it's based on nine now what about this one with 76 divided by 100 now remember the elastics actually before we do that let's do this 176 divided by 10 now when we said 5 or 10 we said that was 0.53 over 10 was 0.3 so what do you think 76 over 10 is equal to 76 over 10 is equal to 7.6 you see what you need to do is move the decimal one unit to the left so it's right now it's right here you move it to the left it becomes seven point six so notice the pattern so 76 over ten is seven point six 76 over 100 you move the decimal two units for left that's going to be 0.76 76 over a thousand point zero seven six 76 over 10,000 it's going to be point zero zero seven six so with that in mind divide these numbers by you'll go ahead and "
,,simplify these fractions convert them into a decimal let's say if you have 54 divided by 10 23 divided by 108 over 10 4.6 over 10 try those so 54 divided by 10 that's 5.4 23 divided by 100 is 0.23 so you move the decimal place two units to left here just one unit 8/10 that's 28 four point six divided by 10 is point four six so try this point 43 divided by 10 seven point 1 divided by ten eighty four divided by 100 and point twenty-five divided by 100 so if you divided by ten move the decimal point one into left so this is going to be point zero four three this is 0.07 one action that's too far that's point seven one this is going to be 0.84 and for this one I'm going to move it to units four left so it's going to be point zero zero two so try these 36 divided by a thousand 400 75/100 3856 divided by 10 and 4.9 2 divided by a thousand so 36 divided by thousand let's move the decimal point three units to the left one two three so it's point zero three six four hundred seventy five divided by 100 move it two units to left so this is four point seven five here this movement one unit two left so it's going to be three hundred eighty five point six now for this one move it three units to the left one two three so we got to fit in two zeros here the decimal point out here so it's going to be point zero zero four nine two so that's how you can divide numbers if it's ten one hundred or thousand

Operations of While number,LDIiYKYvvdA,"Hi, Im Rob. Welcome to Math Antics. In the last two Algebra videos, we learned how to solve simple equations that had only one arithmetic operation in them. But often, equations have many different operations which makes solving them a little more complicated. In this video, were going to learn how to solve equations that have just two math operations in them. one addition or subtraction operation, and one multiplication or division operation. And the concepts you learn in this video will help you solve even more complicated equations in the future. Now as you might expect, equations that have two arithmetic operations in them are going to require two different steps to solve them. In other words, to get the unknown all by itself, youll need to undo two operations. But that doesnt sound too hard, right? I mean we learned how to do undo any arithmetic operation in the last two videos. And thats true.  But there are a couple of reason that make two-step equations a little trickier to solve. The first is that there are a lot more possible combinations of those two operations. And the second is that, when theres more than one operation, you have to decide what order to undo those operations in. Uhhello! If you need to know what order to do operations in, just follow the Order of Operations rules! You DID watch that video, didnt you? I sure did! But the Order of Operations rules tell us what order to DO operations not what order to UNDO them! UhWellthen could we REVERSE the order since were UN-doing operations? Now thats a good idea. Well of course it is! When solving multi-step equations, thats basically what were going to do. Using the Order of Operations rules in reverse can help us know what order to undo operations in, but it can be a little tricky actually putting it into practice. So to see how it works, lets start by solving a very simple two-step equation:  2x + 2 = 8. In this equation, the unknown value x is involved "
,,"in two different operations addition and multiplication (which is implied between the first 2 and the x) And to undo those two operations, we need to use their inverse operations subtraction and division. But the question is, which one should we do first? Like many things in life, the order we decide to do things in can make a big difference. Ah, come on! Theres gotta be an easier way! [voice from off screen] First socks, then shoes. Fortunately, in math, we have a special set of rules that tell us what order to do operations in. Those rules tell us to do operations inside parentheses (or other groups) first. And then we do exponent, and then multiplication and division, and last of all, we do addition and subtraction. Those are the rules you need to follow when simplifying mathematical expressions or equations. But solving an equation is different because we are trying to UNDO any operations that the unknown value is involved with so that the unknown value will be all by itself. So when solving equations, the best strategy is to apply those Order of Operations rules in reverse. Using the reverse Order of Operations is not the only way to solve a multi-step equation, but its usually the easiest way. Just like its much easier to take your shoes and socks off in the reverse order that you put them on! Ahhhhh!  Are you sure its socks before shoes? Since the Order of Operations rules tell us to DO multiplication before we DO addition. We should UNDO addition before we UNDO multiplication. So first, we undo the addition by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation. On the first side, the plus 2 and the minus 2 cancel each other out, leaving just 2x on that side. And on the other side we have 8 minus 2 which is 6. Next, we can undo the multiplication by dividing both sides of the equation by 2. On the first side, the 2s cancel, leaving x all by itself. And on the other side, we have 6 divided by 2 which is just 3. There weve solved the equation using the Order of Operations rules in reverse, and now we know that x = 3. That wasnt so bad, was it? Lets try solving another simple two-step "
,,"equation that has division and subtraction in it: x/2 - 1 = 4. Again, were going to apply the Order of Operations rules in reverse to undo the subtraction and the division operations. Since we would normally DO the subtraction last, were going to UNDO it first. To undo the subtraction, we add '1' to both sides of the equation. On the first side, the minus 1 and the plus 1 cancel out, leaving just x over 2 on that side. And on the other side, we have 4 plus 1 which is 5. And then, to undo the divided by 2, we need to multiply both sides by 2. On the first side, the 2s cancel, leaving x all by itself. And on the other side, we have 2 times "
,,"5 which is 10. So our answer is x = 10. Those examples are pretty easy, right? But solving two-step equations gets a bit trickier thanks to a little something in math called groups. Do you remember how parentheses are used to group things in math? And our Order of Operations rules say we are supposed to do any operations that "
,,"are inside parentheses first. In other words, we need to do operations that are inside of groups first. Well guess what? That means that when were solving equations and UN-doing operations, we need to wait to do groups LAST of all. To see what I mean, lets solve this equation, which looks very similar to the first one we solved. The only difference is that a set of parentheses has been used to group this x + 2 together. And even though that might not seem like much of a change, it makes a big difference for our answer. Thats because, in the original equation, this first 2 is only being multiplied by the x, but in the new equation, its being multiplied by the entire quantity (or group) x + 2. And thats going to change how we solve it. Were still going to follow our Order of Operations rules in reverse, but "
,,"now that the x + 2 is inside parentheses (which means that its part of a group), were going to undo THAT operation last. Since we are supposed to DO operations in "
,,"groups first, that means were going to UNDO operations in groups last. So in this problem, we should start by undoing the multiplication that's implied between the "
,,"2 and the group (x + 2) To do that, we divide both sides of the equation by 2. On the first side, the 2 on the top and the 2 on the bottom cancel, leaving the group "
,,"(x + 2) on that side. And on the other side, we have 8 divided by 2 which is 4. That looks simpler already!  And we can make it even simpler than that, because now that theres nothing else on that side of the equal sign with the group (x + 2) we really dont even need the parentheses any more. Next, we just need to subtract 2 from both sides. On the first side, the plus 2 and the minus 2 cancel out, leaving x all by itself, and on the other side we have 4 minus 2, which is 2. So for "
,,"this equation, x = 2. And now you can see how grouping operations differently in our equation results in different answers. Lets try one more important example. Do "
,,"you remember the second equation we solved?  x/2 - 1 = 4 In this equation, the 1 is being subtracted from the entire x over 2 term. But take a look at this slightly different equation. This looks a lot like the original equation, but now that the '1' is up on top of the fraction line, its only being subtracted from the x and NOT the 2. The x - 1 on top forms a group. Hold on!  How can the x - 1 be a group? I dont see any parentheses or brackets around it. Ah, thats a good question! In Algebra, the fraction line is used as a way to automatically group things that are above it or things that are below it. For example, in this fancy algebraic expression, everything thats on top of the fraction line forms a group and everything on the bottom of the line forms another group. Of course, we could put parentheses there if we wanted to make it really clear, but its not required. Grouping above and below a fraction line is just implied in Algebra. Getting back to our new problem, now that we know that the x - 1 on the top of the fraction line is an implied group, as we learned in the last example, were going to wait and undo the "
,,"operation inside that group last. So the first step is to undo the divided by 2 by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2. On the first side, the 2 on top and the 2 on the bottom will cancel out, leaving just our implied group x - 1 on that side. And on the other side, we have 4 times 2 which is 8. Next, we can undo the operation inside the group by adding '1' to both sides. On the first side, the minus 1 and the plus 1 cancel, leaving x all by itself. And on the other side, "
,,"we have 8 plus 1 which is 9.  So in this equation, x = 9. Alright  As you can see, solving two-step equations is definitely more complicated than single step equations because there are so many different combinations and different ways to group things. But if you just take things one step at a time and remember to UNDO operations using the REVERSE Order of Operations rules, it will be much easier. Just pay close attention to how things are grouped in an equation and be on the lookout for  "
,,"those implied groups on the top and bottom of a fraction line. And, because there are so many variations of these two-step equations, its really important to practice by trying to solve lots of different problems.

5xe-6GPR_qQ,Which of the following
,numbers is a factor of 154? So when a number is going
,to be a factor of 154 is if we can divide
,that number into 154 and not have a remainder. Or another way of thinking
,about it-- a number is a factor of 154 if 154 is
,a multiple of that number. So let's look at each of these
,and see which of these we can rule out or say is a factor. So does 3 divide
,"evenly into 154? Or, another way of"
,"thinking about it, is 154 a multiple of 3? Well you'll later learn"
,that you could actually test whether something
,is divisible by 3 by adding up the digits. And if that's divisible
,"by 3, then it's going to be divisible by 3. And so you see"
,"here, 1 plus 5 is 6. 6 plus 4 is 10. 10 is not divisible by 3. But if you didn't want"
,to do that little trick-- and we have other
,videos where we go into more detail
,about that trick-- you can actually just
,divide 3 into 154. 3 doesn't go into 1. It does go into 15 five times. 5 times 3 is 15. Subtract. Then we have 0. Then you bring down a 4. 3 goes into 4 one time. 1 
,"times 3 is 3. Subtract, and you"
,have a remainder of 1. So 3 is clearly not a factor of
,"154, so we can rule that out. Now what about 5? Well, any multiple"
,of 5 is either going to have 5 or
,0 in the ones place. You see that if we write 5
,"times 1 is 5, 5 times 2 is 10, 5 times 3 is 15, 5 times 4 is"
,"20, you either have a 5 or a 0 in the ones place. This does not have 5"
,"or a 0 the ones place, so it's not going to"
,be divisible by 5. 5 is not a factor. 154 is not a multiple of 5. Now 6 is interesting. You could do the same thing. You could try to
,divide 6 into 154. But if something
,"is divisible by 6, it's definitely going to"
,be divisible by 3 as well because 6 is divisible by 3. So we can immediately
,rule this one out as well. Because 154 is not
,"divisible by 3, it's also not going"
,to be divisible by 6. And you could try
,it out if you like. And we could make the
,"same argument for 9. If something is divisible by 9,"
,"it's going to be divisible by 3 because 9 is divisible by 3. Well, it's not"
,"divisible by 3, so we're going to rule out 9 as well. So we've ruled out everything. It looks like 14"
,"is our only option, but let's actually verify it. Let's actually"
,divide 14 into 154. 14 doesn't go into 1. It goes into 15
,"exactly one time. 1 times 14 is 14. We subtract. We get 1. Bring down the 4. 14 goes into 14 one time. 1 times 14 is 14. And of course, we"
,have no remainder. So 14 goes into 154
,exactly 11 times. Or 11 times 14 is 154. 154 is a multiple of 14. Let's do one more. Which of the following
,"numbers is a multiple of 14? So now we have 14,"
,and we're trying to think of its multiples. So there's two
,ways of doing this. You could go number by number
,"and try to divide 14 into them, or we could just"
,try to figure out what all of the multiples
,of 14 actually are. So let's try to do that. Let's try to do that
,"second technique. 14 times 1 is 14. You add another 14. 14 times 2 is 28. Add another 14. Let's see, you add 10. You get to 38. Then you add 4 more. You get to 42. Then you add another 14. I haven't seen any of"
,these numbers show up yet. Add another 14 to this. You get to 56-- still
,"not quite there. Add another 14. Let's see, if you"
,"add 4, you get to 60, and you have to add the 10. So then you get to 70. And it looks like we have"
,"found one of these numbers. 70 is a multiple of 14. 14 times 1, 2, 3, 4,"
,5-- 14 times 5 is 70.
,
vcn2ruTOwFo,Find all of the factors
,of 120. Or another way to think about
,"it, find all of the whole numbers that 120 is"
,"divisible by. So the first one, that's"
,maybe obvious. All whole numbers are
,divisible by 1. So we could write 120 is equal
,to is to 1 times 120. So let's write a factors
,list over here. So this is going to be our
,"factors list over here. So we just found two factors. We said, well, is it"
,"divisible by 1? Well, every whole number"
,"is divisible by 1. This is a whole number, so 1"
,is a factor at the low end. 1 is a factor. That's its actual smallest
,"factor, and its largest factor is 120. You can't have something larger"
,than 120 dividing evenly into 120. 121 will not go into 120. So the largest factor
,on our factors list is going to be 120. Now let's think about others. Let's think about whether
,is 2 divisible into 120? So there's 120 equals
,"2 times something? Well, when you look here,"
,maybe you immediately recognize that 120 is
,an even number. It's ones place is a 0. As as long as its ones place is
,"a 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8, as long as it's an even number, the"
,whole number is even and the whole number is divisible
,by 2. And to figure out what you have
,"to multiply by 2 to get 120, well, you can think of 120"
,"as 12 times 10, or another way to think about it,"
,"it's 2 times 6 times 10, or 2 times 60. You could divide it"
,"out if you want. You could say, OK,"
,"2 goes into 120. 2 goes into 1 no times. 2 goes into 12 six times. 6 times 2 is 12. Subtract. You get 0. Bring down the 0. 2 goes into 0 zero times. 0 times 2 is 0, "
,and you get no
,"remainder there, so it goes sixty times. So we have two more factors"
,right here. So we have the factors. So we've established the next
,"lowest one is 2, and the next highest factor, if we're"
,"starting from the large end, is going to be 60. Now let's think about three. Is 120 equal to 3"
,"times something? Well, we could just try to test"
,"and divide it from the get go, but hopefully,"
,you already know the divisibility rule. To figure out if something is
,"divisible by 3, you add up its digits, and if the"
,"sum is divisible by 3, we're in business. So if you take 120-- let"
,"me do it over here. 1 plus 2 plus 0, well, that's"
,"equal to 1 plus 2 is 3 plus 0 is 3, and 3 is definitely"
,divisible by 3. So 120 is going to be
,divisible by 3. To figure what that number that
,"you have to multiply by 3 is, you could do it"
,"in your head. You could say, well, 3 goes into"
,"12 four times, and then you-- well, let me just do it"
,"out, just in case, just for those of you who want to"
,see it worked out. 3 goes into 12 four times. 4 times 3 is 12. You subtract. You're left with nothing here. You bring down this 0. 3 goes into 0 zero times. 0 times 
,3 is 0. Nothing left over. So it goes into it
,forty times. And the way to think of it in
,"your head is this is the same thing as 12 times 10. 12 divided by 3 is 4, but this"
,"is going to be 4 times 10, because you have that"
,"10 left over. Whatever works for you. Or you can just ignore the 0,"
,"divide by 3, you get a 4, and then put the 0 back there. Whatever works. So we have two more factors. At the low end, we have 3, and"
,"at the high end, we have a 40. Now, let's see if 4 divisible"
,into 120. Now we saw the divisibility
,rule for 4 is you ignore everything beyond the tens
,places and you just look at the last two digits. So if we're going to to think
,"about whether 4 is divisible, you just look at the"
,last two digits. The last two digits are 20. 20 is definitely divisible
,"by 4, so 120 will be divisible by 4. 4 is going to be a factor. And to figure out what we have"
,"to multiply 4 by to get 120, you could do it in your head. You could say 12 divided"
,"by 4 is 3, so 120 divided by 4 is 30. So we have two more"
,factors: 4 and 30. And you could work this out in
,"long division if you want to make sure that this works out,"
,so let's keep going. And then we have 120 is equal
,to-- is 5 a factor? Is 5 times something
,"equal to 120? Well, you can't do that simple--"
,"well, first of all, we could just test"
,"is it divisible? And 120 ends with a 0. If you end with a 0 or a 5,"
,you are divisible by 5. So 5 definitely goes into it. Let's figure out
,"how many times. So 5 goes into 120. It doesn't go into 1. It goes into 12 two times. 2 times 5 is 10. Subtract. You get 2. Bring down the 0. 5 goes into 20 four times. 4 times 5 is 20, and then you"
,"subtract, and you have no left over, as we expect, because"
,it should go in evenly. This number ends with
,a 0 or a 5. Let me delete all of this so we
,can have our scratch space to work with later on. So 5 times 24 is also equal
,"to 120, we have two more factors: 5 and 24. Let me clear up some space here"
,because I think we're going to be dealing with
,a lot of factors. So let me move this
,right here. Let me cut it and then let me
,paste it and move this over here so we have more space
,for our factors. So we have 5 and 24. Let's move on to 6. So 120 is equal to
,"6 times what? Now, to be divisible by"
,"6, you have to be divisible by 2 and 3. Now, we know that we're already"
,"divisible by 2 and 3, so we're definitely going to"
,"be divisible by 6, and you should hopefully be able to"
,do this one in your head. 5 was a little bit harder to do
,"in your head. but 120, you could say, well, 12 divided by 6"
,"is 2, and then you have that 0 there, so 120 divided"
,by 6 would be 20. And you could work it out in
,long division if you like. So 6 times 20 are two
,"more factors. Now let's think about 7. Let's think about 7 here. 7 is a very bizarre number, and"
,"just to test it, you could think of other ways to do it. Let's just try to divide"
,"7 into 120. 7 doesn't go into 1. It goes into 12 one time. 1 times 7 is 7. You subtract. 12 minus 7 is 5. Bring down the 0. 7 times 7 is 49, so it goes"
,"into it seven times. 7 times 7 is 49. Subtract. You have a remainder, so it"
,does not divide evenly. So 7 does not work. Now let's think about 8. Let's think about
,whether 8 works. Let's think about 8. I'll do the same process. Let's take 8 into 120. Let's just work it out. And just as a little bit
,"of a hint-- well, I'll just work it out. 8 goes into 12-- it doesn't"
,"go into 1, so it goes into 12 one time. 1 times 8 is 8. Subtract there. 12 minus 8 is 4. Bring down the 0. 8 goes into 40 five times. 5 times 8 is 40, and you're left"
,"with no remainder, so it goes evenly. So 120-- let me get"
,"rid of that. 120 is equal to 8 times 15, so"
,let's add that to our factor list. We now have an 8
,"and now we have a 15. Now, is it divisible by 9? Is 120 divisible by 9? To test that out, you just"
,"add up the digits. 1 plus 2 plus 0 is equal to 3. Well, that'll satisfy our 3"
,"divisibility rule, but 3 is not divisible by 9, so our"
,"number will not be divisible by 9. So 9 will not work out. 9 does not work out. So let's move on to 10. Well, this is pretty"
,"straightforward. It ends in 0, so we will"
,be divisible by 10. So let me write that down. 120 is equal to 10 times--
,"and this is pretty straightforward-- 10 times 12. This is exactly what 120 is. It's 10 times 12, so let's"
,write those factors down. 10 and 12. And then we have one
,"number left. We have 11. We don't have to go above 11,"
,"because we already went through 12, and we know that"
,"there aren't any factors above that, because we were going in"
,"descending order, so we've really filled in all the gaps. You could try 11. We could try it by hand,"
,"if you like. 11 goes into 120-- now you know,"
,if with you know your multiplication tables through
,"11, that this won't work, but I'll just show you. 11 goes into 12 one time. 1 times 11 is 11. Subtract. 1, bring down the 0. 11 goes into 10 zero times. 0 times 11 is 0. you're left with a"
,remainder of 10. So 11 goes into 20 ten times
,with a remainder of 10. It definitely does
,not go in evenly. So we have all of our factors
,"here: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30,"
,"40, 60 and 120. And we're done!"

FslcXS-SJ4g,hello children today i'm here to teach you chapter 11 in your textbook that's factors and multiples so in this lesson we are finding factors and multiples of a whole number and we are trying to solve problems related to factors and multiples and examine where the whole number is divisible by 2 5 and 10. look at this one multiples of 2. you already know multiples of 2. so what are the multiples of 2 2 times 1 2 2 times 2 4 2 x 3 6 two times four eight two times five ten two times six twelve 
,two times seven fourteen two times eight sixteen two times nine eighteen 2 times 10 20. write down the last digit of the multiples of 2. so when you look at the last digit i see 0 what else 2 then 4 6 eight these are the last digit of the multiples of two these are even numbers if the last digit is an even number or 0 the number is divisible by 2 without a remainder because these are multiples of 2. so look at the last digit if the last digit is 0 or even number the number is divisible by 2 without a remainder multiples of five five times one five five times two ten five times three fifteen five times four twenty five times five twenty five five times 
,six thirty five times seven thirty-five five times eight forty five times nine forty-five and five times ten 50 now write down the last digit of the multiples of 5 when you look at the last digit you can see either 0 or 5. so if the last digit is 0 or 5 the number is divisible by 5 without a remainder so how we identify the whether a number is divisible by 5 look at the last digit if the last digit is 0 or 5 the number is divisible by 5 without a remainder multiples of 10 10 times 1 10 10 times 2 20. 10 times 3 30 10 times 4 40. 10 times 5 50 10 times 660 ten times seven seventy ten times eight eighty ten times nine ninety and ten times ten hundred look at the last digit zeros so how we find out whether a number is divisible by 10 look at the last digit if the last digit is 0 the number is divisible by 10 without 
,a remainder now underline the numbers that are divisible by 2 without a remainder so how we identify look at the last digit the last digit is 0 or even number the number is divisible by 2. so here this is 4 it's divisible by 2 without a remainder but this is odd number this is again even it's divisible here 0 it's possible and 7 is an odd number it's not divisible 9 also odd number 4 again yes it is an even number and 672 the last digit is an even number underline the numbers that are divisible by 5 without a remainder so if the last digit is 0 or 5 it is divisible so this one this one here this this one here these are the numbers that are divisible by 5 without a remainder 5 or 0 as the last digit underline the numbers that are divisible by 10 without a remainder so that means the last digit should be zero so 240 this number here possible this is possible and you can't take the other two underline the three digit numbers that are divisible by 2 5 and 10 without a remainder so what's the condition this should be an even number if it's divisible by 2 5 means either 0 or 5 but 10 only 0 that means if we want to find out a number that's divisible by 2 5 10 the last digit should be zero so we'll find out what are the numbers with last digit zero this is divisible this is divisible here it's divisible these are okay but other numbers you can't take give the reason that 360 is divisible by 2 5 and 10 without a remainder as 360 is an even number it is divisible by 2 as last digit is 0 it is divisible by 5 or 10. look at this one 10 20 30 40 50 those are multiples of 10 as last digit is 0 is it divisible by 2 yes because it said the last digit is 0 it's divisible by 2 so we say yes is it divisible by 5 yes last digit is 0 0 or 5 it is divisible by 5. is it divisible by 10 yes because the last digit is zero write down 10 multiples of 3 so starting from 3 times 1 three three times two six three times three nine three times four twelve three times five fifteen so three times six eighteen three times 7 21 24 so how many we need another 3 24 3 times so this is 3 times 8 3 times 9 27 3 times 9 27 and 3 times 10 30. so all together 10. now write down 10 multiples of 4 times table 4 times 1 4 4 times 2 8 4 times three twelve four times four sixteen four times five twenty four times six twenty-four four times seven twenty-eight four times eight thirty-two four times 9 36 and 4 times 10 40. write down the common multiples of 3 and 4 look at carefully what are the common numbers so i'll highlight those common terms can you see 12 then what are the other numbers 24 then according to this one that's all write down the lowest common multiple out of these common multiples what is the lowest one that's 12. look at this one write down 12 multiples of 4. so we write it again four 
,times one four times two four times three four times four four times five four times six four times seven four times eight four times nine four times nine and four times ten four times eleven and 4 times 12 so we need 12 multiples write down 10 multiples of 6 6 times 1 6 times 2 six times three six times four six times five six 
,times six six times seven six times eight six times nine and six times ten sixty so we need ten multiples of six write down the common multiples of 4 and 6 by looking at these factors you can write down common one what are the common ones i can see 12. then what's the next one 24 next one 36 and you get forty eight now write down the lowest common multiple out of this the lowest one is 12 now what are factors can we divide 18 mangoes between two three four five six friends without a remainder so we'll figure out eighteen when you divide by two you get nine so it's a whole number so you can divide then divide by 3 so we'll divide by 3 now 18 divided by 
,3 so you get 6 18 divided by 4 can you divide 4 times 4 16 and there's a remainder remainder two eighteen divided by five you get five times three fifteen remainder 
,3 18 divided by 6 you get 6 times 3. so can we divide 18 man goes between two yes three yes but you can't divide it by four can we divide it by five no but we can divide it by six numbers that are divisible without a remainder that's two three and six numbers that are not divisible without a remainder that's four and five if a number divisible by another number without a remainder then the second number is a factor of the first number so here we can say 2 is a factor and 9 is also a factor 
,3 is a factor 6 also a factor 6 is a factor and 3 also a factor now we found out 18 you can divide by 1 that's 80. divide by 2 that's 9. divide by 3 that's 6 divide 
,by 6 you get 3 divide by 9. you get 2 18 divided by 18 also possible you get 1 all are whole numbers without a remainder so those are called factors of 18. so what are the factors starting from 1 then you get 2 it's divisible by 3 is divisible by what are 6 9 and then 18. so we call these are factors of 18. look at carefully you see one and the number itself also a factor look at this number 12 we'll find out what are the factors we know 12 we can write 1 times 12. if you take 2 2 times 6 3 times 4 so 12 can be written as multiplication of two numbers all the whole numbers are called factors of twelve so all these numbers we call factors so what's the 
,lowest one one then two three 4 and what are 6 and 12. those are factors of 12 write down the set of factors of 36 so 36 i can write 1 times 36 36 is again 2 times what you can divide by 2 you get 2 times 18 three times divide by three you get 12 4 times 9 36 and 6 times 6. now what are the factors so you have to write or one two three four what else now six twice is there but we don't write six twice in the set only once so we can write 6 only once and then 9 12 18 and 36 so those are the 
,factors of 36 write down the set of factors of the following numbers factors of one one means one times one so just 1 factors of 2 1 times 2 or 2 times 1. so 1 and 2. factors of 3 1 times three three times one factors of four one two times two and four times one so one two four factors of five one times five and what about factors of six one two times three so 3 is there and 6 times 1 factors of 7 1 times 7 1 and 7 factors of 8 two times four so two four and then eight times one factors of 
,nine what are the factors of nine one three times three we only write once and nine times one factors of ten we can write one then five times two so two times 5 and 
,10 factors of 11 1 times 11 it's 1 and 11. and factors of twelve one times twelve two times six three times four and here two times six and 12 times 1. so these are 
,the factors of all these numbers now when you look at carefully always 1 and the number itself are the factors of any number so look at carefully 11 is there 12 is there 10. so 1 and the number itself is always a factor so what are the factors of 12 so if you can't figure out you can divide also two times six two times three three times one so what are the possible factors one two times six three times four so four is also yeah then six times two and then twelve times one factors of 12 factors of 18. when you divide by 2 you get 9. so 1 2. when you divide by 3 you get 3 times 6 then 3 times 6 then 6 also possible 2 times 9 so 9 is also possible and 18 
,times 1 18. so these are the factors of 80. some numbers have factors one and the number itself only look at these numbers two only one and two three is one and three five is one and five seven one and seven and eleven only 1 and 11 13 also 1 and 13 17 1 and 17 19 1 and 19 23 1 and 23 29 1 and 29 so these numbers we call as prime prime numbers so what are prime numbers the factors are only one and itself only two factors are there what is the number that only has factors of 1 and 31 that's 
,only 31 because 31 is a prime number what is the number that only has factors of 1 and 73 73 is a prime number that's 73. now we'll look at how we can solve problems using factors and multiples price of a pen is 16 rupees find the price of seven such pens so what we do we take the multiples of 7 multiples of 16. so price of 7 pence 16 times 7 so 7 times 6 42 4 remaining and 7 times 1 7 plus 4 11. so 112 rupees so what's the this answer that's the seventh multiple of 16. so 16 32 like that you take the seventh multiple of 16. fill in the blanks one kilo price is given for sugar what about the price for 3 kilos you multiply 115 multiplied by 3 3 times 5 
,15. 1 remaining so 3 times 1 three three plus one four three times one three three hundred and forty five rupees one kilo of flies seventy rupees what about four kilos you multiply 4 times 0 0 4 times 7 28 280 rupees now what about dal 1 kilo is 150 we need two and a half kilos so we can do separately if it's 150 for one kilo what about half a kilo we divide by 250 divided by 2 you get 75 and 2 kilos means you multiply by 2 150 times 2 you get 300. so 300 plus 75 you get 300 375. one kilo of rice is 80 rupees and what about 3 kilos multiplied by 3 3 times 0 0 3 times 8 24. what about this one 117 is 150 what about 3 so 3 times 150 zero three times five fifteen and three times one three plus one four four hundred fifty rupees now how we find out the total just add all these together five plus 5 10 1 remaining 5 5 8 13 13 plus 7 20 25 and 29 two remaining five plus two seven seven plus three ten ten plus four fourteen fourteen plus two sixty so thousand six hundred and ninety rupees is the total cost now this table shows 10 by 10 multiplication 10 by 10. using the table we can write the factors of twelve can you see three times eight three times eight twenty-four again four times six and 24 again six times four and eight times three so it shows some factors of 24 so what are the factors we can write all these numbers so it's 1 times that one not given here the table only shows 10 by 10 so up to 10. so factors of 24 by looking at this table we can see 3 four six eight three four six eight those are the factors we can get it from this table using the previous table show that the ways you get 18 so we'll look at 18 and see where you get 18 here 9 and 2 what else 18 is here eighteen is here and here that's all so two times nine two times nine then three times six six times three and nine times 2 6 times 3 9 times 2. so what are the factors of 18 using that table we get two three six nine two three six nine that's all we can see from that table now we'll look at the exercises and example in your textbook example one find the factors of 20 how we find out the factors of 20 so 20 i can write one times twenty then divide by two two times ten then can we divide by three four four times five five times four is also same six not possible seven not possible 8 9 10 10 times 2 so what 
,are the factors of 20 we can write down 1 2 what else 4 5 10 and 20. so those are the factors of 20 and remember zero is not a factor of a whole num exercise point one fill in the blanks with the appropriate whole numbers four i can write one times four what about two times two so one two and four are the factors of 4 look at 7 
,7 i can write 1 times 7 so what are the factors 1 and 7 this one 8 i can write 1 times 8 2 times 4 so what are the factors 1 2 4 and 8 are the factors of 8 15 one times fifty and i can write three times five so what are the factors here one three five and fifty twenty-four what are the factors one times twenty-four and two times twelve three times eight four times six so what are the factors 1 2 3 4 6 8 12 and 24 when the factors of 18 are written we obtain what are the factors of eighteen 
,one times eighteen two times nine and three times six so one two three six nine eighteen when the factors of forty are written so one times four t two times twenty then four times ten and five times four and eight times five so we can write eight also now look at question number two find the factors of each of the following numbers five five is a prime number so what are the factors one and 5 5 times 1 only 27 we can write 1 1 times 27 so 27 is also a factor so you can divide by 3 3 times 9. so 1 3 9 and then 27 so you can divide and 27 divided by 3 you get 9 divided by 3 you get 3 here so 3 with 9 and 9 with 3 and 27 so those are the factors of 27 17 
,is a prime number so what are the factors of 17 1 and the number itself 17. 22 so 1 is a factor 1 times 22 2 times 11 so you get 1 2 11 and 22 21 you can divide by 1 1 times 21 3 times 7 so that's all and 31 31 is a prime number so 1 and the number itself 31. thirty-two one times thirty-two two times sixteen four times eight then 2 times you get 16 and then 1 times 32 45 you get 1 this is divisible by 3 3 times 15 then 5 times 9 45 so 3 times 15 and then 1 times 45 so those are the factors 
,of 45 50. so what are the factors divide by one you get one times fifty two times twenty five five times ten ten times five and 2 times 25 and 1 times 50. 60 how can we find out factors 1 is always a factor two times thirty three times twenty four four times also possible sixty divide by four get four times one four for twenty that's five so fifty then six five also possible twelve times five then 6 times 10. now we'll write down the other numbers 5 times twelve so six times ten five times 
,twelve four times fifteen and three times twenty what does 3 times 20 and 2 times 30 and then 60. so those are the so those are the factors of 60. now we'll look at 
,example number one what are the factors of 72 that can be found using the above multiplication table so we'll look at the table and see how we get 72 where you get 72 1 is here and another one is here so 72 means 9 times 8 and 8 times 9 so i can write 72 is 9 times 8 or 8 times 9 so that means factors of 72 factors of 72 i can take a ten nine from the table example number two what are the factors of 18 that can be found using the above multiplication table 18 one is here another one is here this one what else this one so what are the possibilities two times nine then three times six 6 times 3 same and 9 times 2 same so from this table what are the factors of 18 i can write factors of 18 that's 2 3 6 9 exercise 11.2 what are the factors of each of the following numbers that can be found using the 10 by 10 multiplication table so we have to refer this table 48 where you get 48 1 2 so two possibilities so what are the factors i can write 6 8 that's all 6 and 8 81 here only one possibility nine times 9 so i can say 9 is a factor 2 this one this one that's all 2 into 1 2 into 1 so 1 and 2 28 this one what else here and that's all so 28 means 
,four and seven seven times four four and seven forty here and you'll get 40 here and here so 10 times 4 and what else 5 times eight so four five eight forty so four 
,five eight and ten so those are the factors of 40 from the table obtain different ways in which 36 can be written as a product of two whole numbers using the 10 times 10 tables and fill in the blanks 36 so we need to find out what are the possibilities we can get 36 check this one nine times four six times six and four times nine so six and six four and nine so nine and four four and nine six and six those are the three possibilities write down in ascending order the factors of 36 which can be obtained from the above products so ascending means smallest to highest so what's the smallest number that's four the next number is six and 9. so those are the 
,factors of 36 obtain different ways in which 9 can be written as a product of two numbers using 10 by 10 multiplication table and fill in the blanks nine one possibility is there so nine times one or one times nine what else nine is here three times three so those are the possibilities another one one times nine nine times 1 so 
,these are the possibilities so what are the factors if you are asking to write down the factors we can write 1 3 9 write down the different ways in which 30 can be written as a product of two whole numbers using 10 by 10 multiplication table thereby write down factors of 30 30 where you get 30 here and here what else so when you look at the table carefully you get three ways so three times ten oh five times six or 3 times 10 or 10 times 3 that's the same thing so what are the factors of 30. of 30 3 5 6 and 10 3 5 6 10. is 4 a factor of 9 explain the reason for your answer so 9 what are the possibilities here here and here so nine you can write three times three and 1 times 9 9 times 1 the same thing so is 4 is there 4 is not there so 4 is not a factor because you can't divide cannot divide by 4 without a remainder so when you divide you get a remainder so that's not a factor example number one find three factors of 30 by using the method of division thirty you can divide by one you get one times thirty thirty divided by two 2 times 50 30 divided by 3 3 times 10. so they're asking only 3 factors so you can write without writing 1 and the 
,number itself will take 2 3 10 so we need only 3 you can write 2 3 10 are factors of 30. example number 2 is 9 a factor of 12 explain the reason for answer so we'll 
,divide and see nine times one we'll do long division 9 times 1 9 and 3 is the remainder you get a remainder there so is 9 a factor of 12 it's not so you can write 9 
,is not a factor factor of 12 because we get a remainder three exercise 11.3 find three factors of each of the following numbers using the method of division 28 i can divide by two you get 40. again 28 i can divide by 4 7. so you need only three factors so i can write 2 4 7 and 14 also possible so i'll write 14 as well 32 32 i can divide by two you get 16. again 32 i can divide by 8 8 times 4 so what are the factors of 32 2 4 8 16 you can write 54 54 divided by 2 2 times 2 4 that's 7. then 20 again 54 divided by 6 6 times 9 54. so what are the factors of 54 i can write 2 6 9 54 27 90 i can divide by 2 that's 45 and i can divide this by 3 3 times 30. so 
,what are the factors 2 3 30 45 90 those are factors i'm only writing 3 21 i can divide by 3 i get 7 what is and 21 i can divide by 1 so 3 one so i can write 1 3 7 21 question number two is 6 a factor of 84 will divide and see 84 divide by 6 6 times 1 6 2 remaining for 24 that's 4 6 times 4 24 and the remainder is 0. so explain the answer by the method of division so we can say 6 is a factor of 84 because the remainder i'll write as remainder is 0. is 5 a factor of 48 explain the reason for 
,your answer so we'll divide and see 48 divided by five five times eight forty five times nine five times nine forty five and three remaining so the remainder is three we can write as remainder is three 5 is not a factor of 48. example number one check whether 14 is a multiple of 2 by dividing 14 by 2 2 times 7 14 and you get the remainder 0. so that means you can say check whether 14 is a multiple of 2 by dividing so 14 i can write two times seven so that's a multiple so you can write multiple of 2 of 2 by 7 is 40. check whether 42 is a multiple of 3 by dividing 42 by 3 3 times 1 3. for 12 that's 14. that's 4 three times four twelve and the remainder is zero so remainder is zero so you can write 42 is three times fourteen so that's the multiple exercise 11.4 write down 5 multiples of 2 which are greater than 10. so what are the multiples two times five ten two times six that's twelve two times seven fourteen two times eight sixteen two times nine eighteen and two times 10 20. so we need to write numbers greater than 10. write down 4 multiples of 3 between 1 and 20. multiples of 3 3 times 1 3 3 times 2 6 3 times 3 9 3 times 4 12. so 1 2 3 4 only 4 multiples write down all the multiples of 4 between 1 and 25 4 times 1 4 4 times 2 8 4 times 3 12 4 x 4 16 4 x 5 20 4 x 6 24 so those are the multiples of 
,4 in between 1 and 25 from the following numbers select and write down the multiples of 3. so multiples of 3 means it should be divisible 60 3 times 20. now we'll check 150 it's not divisible by 3 so we can show that 115 is not divisible 3 times 3 9 for 25 that's 8 24 and the remainder is 1. so it's not divisible 48 it's divisible just check 3 1 3 times 1 3 four eighteen that's six so you can write three times sixteen twenty six you can't divide by three 14 also not divisible by 27 we know 
,that that's three times nine so that's also a multiple of three how many multiples of nine are they are between one and hundred we'll check nine what else nine times two nine times three nine times four nine times five nine times six nine times seven nine times eight nine times nine nine times ten nine times eleven now how many 
,are there one two three 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 multiples are there of these numbers which is the greatest multiple of 9 what's the greatest one that's 99 so the greatest 
,multiple is 99 write down three multiples of 18 18 times one eighteen eighteen times two two times eight sixteen two times one two plus one is thirty six then multiply by three three times 8 24 2 remaining 3 times 1 3 plus 2 that's 5 54. what is the largest multiple of 9 which is less than 150 so we'll divide and see 150 divide 
,by 9 and see what's the number 9 times one nine so you get six for sixty nine times nine times six 54. that's the remainder is 6. so 9 times 16 is what that's the largest number you can get so 16 times 9 you get 9 times 6 54 5 remaining 9 times 1 9 plus 5 14. so 144 is the largest possible value now 9 times 654 9 times 1 9 plus 
,5. 14 so 144 is the largest multiple of nine write down five multiples of each of the following numbers four times one four times two four times three four times four four times five so we need five only thirteen times one thirteen times two thirteen times three thirteen times four four times three twelve four times one four plus one five then five five times three fifteen one remaining five times one five plus one six so those are the five fifteen fifteen times one fifteen times 2 30 15 times 3 45 you can add 15 to that 45 plus 15 or 4 times 15 that's 60 then 6 times 15 2 3 4 5 we'll do 5 first 5 times 5 25 2 remaining 5 times 1 5 plus 2 7. so 1 2 3 4 5 eighteen eighteen times one eighteen eighteen times two thirty six eighteen times three three times eight twenty-four three times one three three plus two five fifty-four then four four times eighteen thirty-two four times one four plus three seven one two three four we need another more one more five times eight forty five times one five plus four nine so ninety twenty twenty times one twenty times two twenty times three twenty times four 20 times 5 so add 20 to each number question number 9 fill in the blanks any multiple of 10 is necessarily a multiple of because last digit is 0 that means divisible by 2 and 10 means it's divisible by 5 as well 11 times 7 is 77 so therefore 77 is a multiple of 11 and of 7 7 times 11 or 11 times seven write down two numbers which are multiples of both three and four three times four twelve four times three twelve then multiples any multiple is possible so you can write 24 write down a number which is a multiple of 2 3 4. so you can take 
,12 or 24 so 12 is divisible by 2 so that means 2 times 6 three times four four times three so you can write 12 or 24 any number example number one there are 30 apples in a bag they are separated into bags such that each bag has an equal number of apples find out the number of apples in a bag and the number of bags in each instance the total number of apples is obtained by product of the number of apples in the bag and the number of bags hence we find out the number of bags and the number of apples in each bag by considering the products of two factors of thirty so one times thirty two times fifteen three times ten and five times six six times five ten 
,times three fifteen times two and 30 times 1. so accordingly there are 8 ways of grouping 30 uppers in the back containing the same number of apples 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8. bags with one apple in a bag and bags with two wrappers in a bag bags with three apples in a bag and bags with 6 10 15 30. so if there are bags with one apple how many bags are there so you get 30 bags 2 apples in a bag 2 times 15 you can make 15 bags and 3 apples in a bag you can make ten bags out of that and five times six so you get six bags six times five so five backs and ten ten times three so three bags you can create with three apples in each 50 apples in a bag you can take two bags and if there are 30 apples inside it only you can get one back exercise 11.5 the price of a ballpoint pen is 12 rupees find the price of eight such pens is it a multiple of eight and twelve so we'll check so price of one pens is 12 rupees and price of 8 pens 8 times 12 8 times 2 16 and 8 times 1 8 plus 1 9 so 96 rupees so is it a multiple of 8 and 12 yes it's a multiple of 8 and 12 so 8 times 12 is 96 or 12 times 8 is 96 so yes a multiple of 8 10 12. question number two a water pump takes a day to fill a household tank of capacity 75 gallons what is the number of times and the total volume of water it can fill during a week so each day a day 75 gallons so you can write one day 75 then week means how many days you get seven days for a week so multiply it by seven so what's the answer 7 times 5 35 3 remaining 7 times 7 49 plus 3 52 so 525 gallons now it says just to find out the wallet what is the number of times and the total volume of water it can fill during a week question number three the prize offer rambutan is six rupees five children bought two three four five and six rambutans respectively find the amount each student spent one 
,rambutan is six rupees and five children bought two three four five like that so two rambutan multiplied by two twelve rupees three rumble time six times three eighteen rupees four rambutans six times four 24 rupees and five rambutan six times five thirty rupees and six rambutans six times six 36 rupees so these are the values each child's pen find the amount each student spends so there is 6 12 18 24 30 and 36 rupees question number four a parcel containing the following items needs to be 
,given to each student who participated in a certain event find how much it will cost to give 50 students a parcel each there are three gingerly rolls talaguli one fish ball two bananas and a packet of milk in each parcel the price of one packet of milk is 30 rupees the price of gingerly roll is five rupees and the price of fish 
,bun is 30 rupees and the price of banana is 10 rupees so we'll check out for each puzzle how much we need to spend so there are three gingerly rows so we'll multiply this by 3 so five times three fifteen rupees then one fish one price of fish one is thirty so thirty times one thirty rupees then 2 bananas 2 bananas means 10 times 2 that's 20 rupees and a packet of milk in each parcel so one packet is 30 so you get 30 rupees now we need to find out the total for all this is one packet five three plus one four four plus three seven seven plus 2 95 rupees per packet so how many students are there 50 students so we need the cost for 50 students total cost is 50 times 95 so what's the total cost we put a 0 and multiply by 5. 5 times 5 25 2 remaining 5 times 9 45 plus 2 47. so we need 4 750 rupees for 50 students question number five separate 50 pupils into groups such that each group has an equal number of pupils what are the numbers which can be taken in each group that means factors so in two groups so you can divide by one 1 times 50. so that means one group you can make with 50 students then it's divisible by 2 2 times 25 two groups with 25 students in each group and this is divisible by 5 5 times 10 5 groups each 10 students then 10 times 5 25 so those are the possibilities and other way round is also possible 10 times 5 10 groups with 5 students each and 25 times 2 that means 25 groups with two students each and other way around 50 times 1 that means 50 groups 
,each with one student so those are the possibilities that we can group exercise 11.6 from the following select and write down the numbers which are divisible by two 
,so what's the condition the last digit should be an even number or zero so 42 64 126 148 250 and this number is possible and here and here so you have to look at the last digit what are the digits that the blank box in this number can be filled with if this number consisting of four digits is divisible by two so last digit should be an even number or zero so it can be zero two six eight those are the possibilities question number three select and write down the numbers which are suitable for the blank boxes to the right of the box containing numbers a number could be included in more than one box numbers which are divisible by two so select even numbers the last digit is even 212 or zero possible 310 256 and 420 860 1236 and 5180 800 because all are even numbers numbers which are divisible by five so look at the last digit either five or zero 105 300 and 125 375 420 860 3200 forty five five thousand one hundred and eighty thousand eight hundred numbers which are divisible by 
,ten that means last digit should be a 0 value 310 and 420 860 five thousand one hundred eighty and thousand eight hundred now look at the same question are there numbers which are common to all three of the boxes on the right in question three above what are these numbers so look at carefully we see all these numbers in this box ah here as well so 310 420 860 5180 000 800 then second part are the numbers in box c essentially in boxes a and b yes what are the numbers that are common to both 
,boxes a and b in question three above a and b what are the numbers common what are the numbers comma what are the numbers common 310 then 400 860 5180 and 1 800 so that means either the last digit is 0 the last digit is 0 only so in question 3 examine whether these numbers are in box c as well accordingly write down the conclusion that you can draw so here we can say what are the numbers that are common to both boxes a and b in question three above so i can write 310 420 860 thousand one hundred and eighty and thousand eight hundred examine whether these numbers are in boxy as well accordingly write down the conclusion that you can draw when the last digit is zero it is divisible by 2 5 10 either 2 5 10 without a remainder so that's the conclusion then we can say divisible by all three numbers 2 5 10. question number five join the points relevant to the numbers which are divisible by two in ascending order then join the points relevant to the small number and the largest number you join so starting from the smallest divisible by 2 so that means even numbers 2 4. then what's the next number six six eight then ten what's the next number we can 12. 14 16 and we can join the largest and the smallest one so this is the shape of a house join the points relevant to the numbers which are divisible by five in ascending order smallest two largest then join the points relevant to the smallest number and the largest number you join so we'll start from 5 then you get 10. then you get 15. and then 20 then 35 35 after that 40 40 then you get around that 75 before 75 you get 65 65 then 75 then 90 105 and then you get 110 110 100 20. and then 135 and 100 then 155 and then you can join the first and the last so this is a fish join the points relevant to the numbers which are divisible by 10 in ascending order then join the points relevant to the smallest number and the largest number you join so multiples of 10 starting from 10 10 20. then 50 50 is the next number and 70 80 90 then 120 and that's the largest and this is the smallest we can chop so this is a boat now we look at the miscellaneous exercise give reasons why 7 is 
,not a factor of 45 we can divide and see when you divide by 7 you get 7 times 6 42 and the remainder is 3 so we can say 7 is not a factor as the remainder is three question number two all the factors of a certain number apart from the number itself are one two three four and six what is this number so what can you say if you take 12 12 is divisible by 2 you get 6 12 is divisible by 3 you get 4 12 is divisible by 6 that's 2 6 times 2 3 times 4 apart from apart from the number itself that means 1 and 12 so what is this number you get 12. the number of marbles in a certain box is a multiple of 6 when this number is rounded off to the nearest multiple of 10 the value obtained is 40. write down the two values that the number of marbles in the box can take so rounded to the nearest multiple of ten so you can when you round it to the nearest ten it can be above this this can be can we take 40 something you can't take 40. 6 46 above 46 or 45 you can't take so what are the numbers you can take you can take 41 42 43 44 up to 44 and below what are the numbers you can get when you round it to nearest 10 you need to get 40 39 is okay 38 37 36 and 35 
,you can't take 34 then that number becomes 30 when you round it to the nearest ten now this is a multiple of six so what are the multiples of six either 36 or 42. so write down the two values that the number of marbles in the box can take 36 or 42. question number four the number of biscuits there are in a certain packet of biscuits is a multiple of 4 which is less than 20 when this number is rounded off to the nearest multiple of 10 the value obtained is 20. how many biscuits are there in 
,the packet so this number is less than 20. so what are the possibilities you can get 19 18 17 16 and 50. but you can't take 40 because when you round 14 to the nearest 10 it becomes 10. so these are the possibilities and this number is a multiple of four only you get 16. you can't take 20 because that's less than 20. so how many biscuits are there in the packet it's 16. now we covered all theory related to factors and multiples a whole number is divisible by each of its factors when a whole number is multiplied by another whole number multiple of the initial number is obtained if the value of the digit in the ones place of a number is divisible by 2 then the number is divisible by 2 that means the last digit the digit in the ones place of a number which is divisible by 5 is either 0 or 5 the digit in the ones place of a number which is divisible by 10 is 0. so remember all these to identify whether any number is divisible by 2 5 and 10.
,
0IZyGB1qQmM,today let us revise factors and multiples let us start with factors what do we mean by a factor a factor of a number divides that number exactly let us look at an example find the factors of 58 the first pair is 1 into 50 8 is equal to 58 here when we divide 58 by 1 we get the quotient as 58 and when we divide 58 by 58 we get the quotient as 1 in both the cases the remainder is 0 thus it means that 58 is divisible by 1 and 58 the second pair of numbers which gives the product 58 is 2 into 29 thus the factors of 58 are 1 to 29 and 58 let us solve one more example find the factors of 81 the pairs of numbers which give the product a t1r1 into 81 is equal 
,to 81 3 into 27 is equal to 81 9 into 9 is equal to 81 thus the factors of 81 are 1 3 9 27 and 81 as each of these number divides 81 exactly did you notice we counted the repeated factor only once remember every number has 1 as a factor every number is a factor of itself thus every number except one has at least two factors one 
,and the number itself the factor of a number is always equal to or less than the number now let us look at multiples a multiple of a number is the product obtained when the number is multiplied by the same or any other number let us find the multiples of 12 it is easy when we multiply 12 by zero one two three four five six seven eight nine ten and so on we get 0 12 24 36 48 60 70 to 80 for 96 108 120 and so on as the products so here the products obtained are nothing else but the multiples 
,of 12 let us look at another example find the multiples of 19 when we multiply 19 by 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and so on we get 0 1938 5770 695 114 133 152 171 190 and 
,so on thus the multiples of 19 are 0 1938 5770 695 114 133 152 171 190 and so on remember a number is a multiple of itself every number is a multiple of one every multiple of a given number is equal to or greater than the number itself every number has an infinite number of multiples zero is a multiple of every number but zero is not a factor of any number except zero revising factors and multiples was fun you

0NvLtTwnUHs,"Hi and welcome to Math Antics. In today’s lesson, we’re gonna learn all about factoring. Factoring is a math operation.  It’s something you DO to a number. Now with "
,"the other math operations you’ve done so far, you’re given two or more numbers to work with. But with factoring, you only get one number. That’s because factoring is like being given the answer to a multiplication problem and then having to figure out what that problem was. So you can think of factoring as ‘UN-multiplying’. When you multiply, you take two numbers and multiply them together to get one number. And when you factor, you take one number, and figure out what two numbers you could multiply together to get that number. For example, let’s say you’re asked to factor the number 10. Now that means that you need to figure out what numbers you could multiply together to get 10. If you know your multiplication table, you’ll remember that 2 times 5 equals 10. That means that 2 and 5 are FACTORS of 10. So factors "
,"are just the parts of a multiplication problem, and factoring is figuring out what those parts are. I’m sure some of you are wondering, “Why would I ever want to factor a number?” Now that’s a good question, and I have a good answer. Factoring can make solving some math problems easier. For example, factoring is really useful for simplifying fractions. By breaking a number up into its factors, you can sometimes cancel out factors that aren’t really needed. For now though, you just need to learn what factoring is and how to do it. So let’s see another example.  Let’s factor the number 24. For this one, I think I’ll use my multiplication table. Let’s see here…  alright, well 4 times 6 is 24.  So that means that 4 and 6 are factors of 24. Now hold on…  I’m sure some of you have seen that 3 times 8 is also 24. And that’s true.  We could have decided to factor 24 into 3 times 8 instead. So which of the factors is right?  Is is 4 and 6  or 3 and 8? Actually, they’re both right.  There can be more than one way to factor a number. That’s one of the things that might make factoring a little confusing at first. You’re used to having just one right answer, because when you add, subtract, multiply or divide, there is just one right answer. But when you factor (or un-multiply) a number, you might find that there’s more than one correct way you can do it. So we can see that the number 24 has quite a few factors. 4 is a factor, 6 is a factor, 3 is a factor and 8 is a factor. "
,"The fact that each of these numbers is a factor of 24 means that each of them can divide evenly into 24. And when I say “divide evenly”, I mean that it will divide in without a remainder. For example, if we take our first factor (4) and divide it into 24 using a calculator, our answer will be 6. 4 divides into 24 six times with "
,"no remainder. But what if we try to divide 24 by a number that ISN’T one of our factors; like the number 7? If we try 24 divided by 7 on a calculator, we get 3.42857… blah, blah, blah … a long decimal number. That didn’t divide in evenly because there’s a big remainder! What we just did is called “testing for divisibility”. Testing for divisibility is a way to find out if a number is a factor of another number. With the test we just did, we confirmed that 4 is a factor of 24 but 7 is not. Sometimes you may be asked to find ALL the factors of a number. If that happens, you can use testing for divisibility to solve the problem. To see how it works, let’s try to find ALL the factor or 24. We already know four of them, but there’s a lot more numbers we can test. Fortunately, we only need to test numbers that are less "
,"than half of the number we’re testing. And since half of 24 is 12, we just need to test the numbers 1 thru 12. To keep things organized, let’s list the numbers we are gonna test and we'll circle the factors that we already know: 3, 4, 6, and 8. We can also cross out the 7 since we already tested it and found out it wasn’t a factor. Okay, now for the numbers we haven’t tested yet.  Let’s start with 1. Well of course 1 is a factor, because 1 will divide evenly into ANY whole number. So 1 is always a factor. And since 1 is a factor, then that means 24 is also a factor because 1 × 24 = 24. It might seem weird that a number is always a factor of itself, but it’s true. Knowing that helps you get started listing the factors, because you can ALWAYS include 1 and the number itself. Now let’s move on and test 2. If we divide 24 by 2, we get 12. So yes, 2 is a factor because it divided evenly. You can factor 24 into 2 × 12. That means that we can ALSO circle 12 as a factor of 24. So, any time you do a divisibility test, and the number you are checking passes the test, then the answer you get from dividing will also pass the test… it will ALSO be a "
,"factor! That will speed things up because we know we don’t have to test 12. Okay, let’s move on to the next number we haven’t checked: 5 24 divided by 5 equals 4.8 Well that didn’t divide evenly because our answer is a decimal number. That means that 5 is NOT a factor of 24. Next we’ll try 9.  24 divided by 9 equals 2.66666… That’s definitely not a factor. Okay… how about 10? 24 divided by 10 equals 2.4 Nope, that’s a decimal number, so 10 is not a factor. It looks like the last one we have to try is 11. 24 divided by 11 equals 2.181818…  That’s not a factor either. Alright, since we’ve tested all the numbers that are less than half of 24, we’ve found "
,"ALL of its possible factors, and they are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. Now I know that might seem like a lot of work, but fortunately you probably won’t have to do many of those problems. The important thing is just to know what factoring is, and how you can use ‘testing for divisibility’ to help you find factors. Alright, that wraps up this lesson. But since actually doing math is the best way to learn it, be sure to try the exercise problems for this section. Thanks for watching and I’ll see you next time. Learn more at www.mathantics.com"

47KLARvx3uo,welcome to our maths teacher youtube channel today you are going to learn about the first and second lessons of the unit factors and multiples the first lesson identifying factors there are three methods of finding factors the first method finding factors writing as a product of two numbers in this method you will be learned what a factor is here you can see six flowers we can arrange them in different formations the first one one row with six flowers in each row that is one into six in the second formation two rows with three flowers in each row it can be written as two into three in the third formation three rows with two flowers in each row that is 
,three into two fourth formation six rows with one flower in each row that is six into one thus six can be written as a product of two whole numbers in various ways they are 1 into 6 2 into 3 3 into 2 6 into 1 but here you can see that 1 into 6 and 6 into 1 are the same products as well as 2 into 3 and 3 into 2 thus it is enough 
,to write only one product each out of these two products that is 6 equals 1 into 6 and 6 equals 2 into 3. now let's see what the factor is when the whole number is written as a product of two whole numbers these two numbers are known as factors of the original number since 6 equals 1 into 6 1 and 6 are factors of 6 as well as 6 
,equals 2 into 3 so 2 and 3 are factors of six then we can write all the factors of six they are one two three and six there are four factors for six now let's see some examples first one write all the factors of 12 here first you have to write 12 as a product of two whole numbers in different ways 12 equals 1 into 12 as well as 
,12 equals 2 into 6 yet 12 equals 3 into 4 so we can list out all the factors of 12 easily now they are 1 2 3 4 6 and 12. now let's see another example write all the 
,factors of 36 we can write 36 as a product of two whole numbers in many ways they are 1 into 36 2 into 18 3 into 12 4 into 9 6 into 6 then we can list out all the factors of 36 they are 1 2 3 4 6 9 12 18 and 36 there are nine factors for 36 there is an important factor that is zero is not a factor of a whole number i think you have understood the first method bill let's remind it again when finding all the factors of a given whole number we have to write it as a product of two whole numbers and list out the numbers written in those products they are the factors of that number now you are given the homework you have to write answers for the exercise 11.1 in the textbook now let's move to the second lesson finding factors using the multiplication table the second method finding factors using the multiplication table here you can see a 10 to 10 multiplication table let's see some examples first one find the factors of 24 using the multiplication table here you can see that 24 cubes by the product of 3 and 8 in the multiplication table yet 24 gives by the product of 4 and 6. so 24 can be written as 3 into 8 and 4 into 6 there are no more products that can be found in this table hence the factors of 24 that can be identified from the multiplication table is 3 4 6 and 8. now you can understand that we can write only few factors using a 10 to 10 multiplication table but all the factors of a given whole number cannot be written now let's see another example find the factors of 36 using the multiplication table you can say that 36 cubes by the product of 4 and 9 as well as 36 views by the product of 6 and 6 in this multiplication table so 36 can be written 4 into 9 and 6 into 6 hence the factors of 36 that can be identified from the multiplication table is 4 6 and 9. now you are given homework write answers for the exercise 11.2 in the textbook let's meet in the next video listen thank you

XGbOiYhHY2c,"Hi and welcome to Math Antics. In this video, we’re gonna learn something called ‘prime factorization’. Wow! That sounds pretty complicated, doesn’t it?  But don’t worry, it’s not that bad. Now from the name “prime factorization”, you can probably guess that it involves factoring like we learned about in the last video. But what about this word “prime” here?  What does that mean? Well, to help you understand that, let’s use what we learned in the last video to factor the number 7. Well let’s see…  We could get 7 by adding 3 and 4, but factoring’s not about what you can ADD to get a number, it’s about what you can MULTIPLY. Well, since I can’t think of "
,"any numbers that would work, let’s find factors by ‘testing for divisibility’. Now I’m going to do this really fast using my calculator. Let’s see… Okay, here’s the "
,"numbers I got. That’s interesting… the only two numbers that didn’t leave remainders were 1 and 7.  And those are kinda obvious! We know that if you multiply ANY number by 1, you’ll just get that same number. But why aren’t there any OTHER factors of 7? Alright, here’s why…  7 is a special kind of number called a PRIME number. Now a prime numbers is just a number that has exactly two factors: itself and 1. There’s a lot of prime numbers. Here’s a list of all the prime numbers that are less "
,"than 20: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17 and 19. They’re the one’s you’ll use most often. Now some of you might be wondering why 1 isn’t on the list of prime numbers. Well, 1 is a lot like a prime number, but for some technical reasons, it’s not considered prime. Okay, so in a way, prime numbers are just special numbers that you can’t factor. Well, unless you use the obvious factors of 1 and the number itself. But what’s so special about prime numbers anyway?  Why do we need to know about them? Well, prime numbers are like the building blocks of all the other whole numbers. In fact, whole numbers that are not prime are called ‘composite’ numbers  because they’re composed of primes. That means that you can get them by multiplying prime numbers together. Here’s a good way to see how that works. Again we’ll list all the prime numbers that are less than 20. And now let’s list at all the composite numbers that are less than 20 over here. The 1st composite number is 4, and you get 4 by multiplying the primes 2 × 2 The next composite number is 6, and you get it by multiplying the primes 2 × 3 And the next composite number is 8, which you get by multiplying the primes 2 × 2 × 2 And the composite number 9 can be made by multiplying the primes 3 × 3 We could keep going like this and you would see that ALL the composite numbers are made by multiplying different combinations of prime numbers together. And each of these combinations is called the “prime factorization” of its composite number. AH… so the ‘prime factorization’ is a THING. It’s the set of prime numbers that you multiply together to get another number. That’s true, but you can also use the term ‘prime factorization’ as an ACTION to describe how we find out what prime numbers a composite number is made of. And that’s what we’re gonna do next. We’re gonna use prime factorization (the action) to find the prime factorization (the set of prime factors) for the number 12. And that just means that we’ll continue to factor 12 until all the factors are prime numbers. Now to do this, I’m gonna use something called a ‘factor tree’. A factor tree is just a diagram that helps you keep track of multiple factoring steps. When you factor a number, you write the two factors below it with lines (or branches) going to them. And then, if you factor one of the factors, you do the same thing again. You’ll see how it works as we do this example, so let’s get started. 12 can be factored into 2 × 6.  So we’re done, right?  Well not yet. Because we’re doing PRIME factorization, we need to keep going until all the factors are prime numbers. So let’s see if they are. Well we know that 2 is a prime number, but is 6 prime? No it’s not because 6 can be factored into 2 × 3. And both 2 and 3 ARE prime numbers, so now we’re done factoring. And if "
,"we bring down that 2 that we had from the first factoring step, we can see that the prime factorization of 12 is 2 × 2 × 3. Now I know what some of you are thinking. “I didn’t want to factor 12 into 2 × 6.  I wanted to factor it into 4 × 3.” Well okay then, let’s try it that way. This time we’ll start by factoring 12 into 4 × 3. But remember, we need to keep factoring until all our factors are prime numbers. So let’s see… are 4 and 3 prime numbers? Well, 3 is prime, but 4 is not.  4 can be "
,"factored into the primes 2 × 2. And again, if we bring down that 3 from the first step, we see that we have 3 prime factors for 12, and they’re the EXACT same ones that we got the first time. That means, no matter which way you start factoring, as long as you factor all the way down to prime numbers, you’ll always end up with the same group of prime factors. Let’s try just one more to make sure you’ve got it.  Let’s find the prime factorization of 42. Well, for the first step of our factoring, I see that 42 is an even number, so that means that we can divide it by 2 to get our first 2 factors. So 42 divided by 2 equals 21, so we can factor 42 into 2 × "
,"21. Okay, 2 is prime, so we can’t factor it anymore.  But what about 21? Well, if you’ve memorized your multiplication table, you might recognize that 21 is one of the answers on it. You can get 21 by multiplying 3 × 7, so we can factor 21 into 3 × 7. And if you didn’t remember that, you could have just done some divisibility tests and you would have figured it out. Okay, so what about the 3 and 7?  Well, they’re both prime, so that means that we're done factoring. We bring down the 2 from "
,"the first step and we can see that the prime factorization of 42 is 2 × 3 × 7. Alright… now you know what prime numbers are, and you know how to use prime factorization to find the set of prime factors that a composite number is made of. And that set of numbers is ALSO called its prime factorization. (just to confuse you) As usual, it’s important to practice what you’ve learned in this video so that you’ll get good at it. And you can practice by doing the exercises for this section. Good luck and thanks for watching Math Antics.  See you next time. Learn more at www.mathantics.com"

1qPfLkOEuYY,welcome to math with mr j in this video i'm going to cover multiples verse factors so the difference between multiples and factors and we have two examples that we're going to go through together in order to get this down so let's jump right into number one here where we have eight and we'll start with multiples so we need to list some multiples of eight now multiples are the result of multiplying the given number by integers so no fractions or decimals and we can think of this as skip counting let's make sense of that by writing out some examples here so the multiples of eight we can start with eight eight times one equals eight so we multiplied eight by the integer of one now we can multiply by the integer of two so eight times two is sixteen then three eight times three is twenty-four and you can see how this is turning into just counting by eights or skip counting eight times four is thirty-two eight times five is forty and so on and so forth so those multiples will continue on forever so it's all the numbers that 8 will hit if we count up by 8. or think of it as we multiplied 8 by integers starting with 1 and then going 2 3 4 5 6 7 
,8 and again it goes on forever now multiples can be positive and go up in value or multiples can decrease in value there are negative multiples but we are only going to be working with positives in this video so let's move on to factors and factors are all of the numbers that the given number can be divided by evenly so no remainders or you can think of factors as the numbers that can be multiplied in order to get that given number factors are numbers that are multiplied to get a product i 
,like to think of factors as all the numbers that can go into a given number that's not the most mathematical or technical way of thinking about it but it can help with determining the difference between multiples and factors so let's find all the factors of eight and when we find factors i like to start with two numbers for two 
,factors for every number and those factors are one and then the number itself so one and eight i can do eight divided by one and get a um that will divide evenly i will not get a remainder and i can do eight divided by eight or you can think of it as one times eight equals eight so all the math facts all the multiplication facts that will equal eight and we can think of this as a factor pair here so we'll start with 1 and 8 and for some numbers those are the only factors 1 and the number itself those numbers are called prime numbers but 8 is composite so it has other factors involved here so what other numbers can go into eight you can think of it as or a multiplication fact to equal that given number of eight well i could do eight divided by two right 2 can go into 8 so that's my next factor and i know 2's partner is 4 because 8 divided by 2 equals 4. or i could do 8 divided by 4 equals 2 or think of it as 2 times 4 equals 8. so different ways of thinking about factors but it's all the numbers that can divide evenly aka no remainders as far as 8 goes now when i wrote my factors list i put 1 and 8 and then i put a big gap in the middle there that way i could fit any other factors that would be between 1 and 8 and they would all go in order you'll get better with spacing the more you do of those let's go to number two and write out the multiples of 15. so we'll start with 15 times 1 or just start with 15 and skip count however you like to think about this 15 times 2 30 3 is 45 4 is 60 5 is 75 and again those do continue on forever but we'll cut it off right there as far as factors remember we start with 1 and the number itself because 1 can go into 15 and then 15 can go into 15. i like to leave a little gap there that way if there are any other factors i can list them in between 1 and 
,15 and they're all in order so think about 15 what other numbers go into 15 or can multiply to get 15 well i know 15 divided by 3 and 3's partner is 5 right because 
,let me start with this 1 and 15 are partners and then 3 and 5 are factor pairs or partners and those are all the factors of 15. so there you have it there's the difference between multiples and factors i hope that helped thanks so much for watching until next time peace

rUrLuTMq-sw,what are the multiples of a number say we have a number seven what are its multiples how many multiples does it have seven x one is seven this seven is one of the multiples of seven seven x two is 14 14 is another multiple of seven the word says it all a multiple if a number is multiplied with seven we get sevens multiple and seven x 3 is 21 and the list would continue forever the multiples of seven are 7 14 21 28 and so on this proves that the list of multiples of a number is infinite for 
,us the number of factors of a number is always finite concept of multiples gives us a very important result let us find the multiples of 2 2 times 1 is 2 2 times 2 is 4 2 times 3 is 6 and the multiples of 2 continue what's special about the multiples of 2 all the multiples of 2 are called even numbers yes all the multiples of 2 
,are even and what about the numbers which are not multiples of 2 the numbers which are not multiples of 2 are called odd numbers so the numbers 1 3 7 9 and so on are odd numbers this concept of even and odd numbers is very important no matter which grade you are in multiples of 2 even non multiples of 2 odd and now we come to a 
,very interesting question how our factors and multiples related let's understand the relation with the help of a random number sit 12 to find the factors of 12 we try writing it as all possible products of two numbers 12 can be written as 1 multiplied by 12 it can be written as 2 multiplied by 6 and 3 x 4 these are the only possible combinations each of these numbers are factors of 12 the factors of 12 are 1 2 3 4 6 and 12 now observe the number 12 in relation with these numbers 1 multiplied by 12 gives us 12 so 12 is a multiple of 1 2 multiplied by 6 gives us 12 so 12 is also multiple of 2 3 times 4 gives us 12 and so on what does this imply the number 12 is a multiple of all its factors yes this is always true a number is always a multiple of all its factors you

HL2v6rF4zhU,hello children today i'm here to teach you chapter 4 part 1 and 2 in your syllabus factors and multiples so we'll see what are factors and multiples and any integer 
,how you can find out whether it is divisible by 2 3 4 like that so we'll find out more about factors and multiples at this number 274 how can we find out whether the number is divisible by 2 you already know that if it's an even number it's divisible by 2. so we'll look at 274 is an even number divide by 2 2 times 1 2 times 3 6 
,1 remaining and then 7. so it's divisible take this number 358 we know that last digit is an even number so that means this whole thing is even number 2 times 1 2 for 15 that's 7 for 18 that's 9. divide this by 2 2 1 3 divide this by 2 510 2 times 2 4 1 remaining 5 10 1 remaining and 5. so 255 divide this by 2 1 and for 12 that's 6 and 1. so all these are even numbers so we know that it's divisible by 2. all above numbers are divided by 2 without a remainder without a remainder look at the 
,last digit of each above numbers what can you say you you get 0. 6 4 8 2 2 4 6 8 or either 0 or even numbers when the last digit of any large number is either 0 or an even number it can be divided by 2 without a remainder so remember how we identify whether the number is divisible by 2 look at the last digit last digit should be either 0 or any one number look at these numbers if it's divisible by 2 you can put a tick mark and if it's not you can put a cross you have to look at the last digit 4 so it's divisible by 2 9 not divisible 0 yes it is divisible 8 even number yes it's divisible 3 no that's not an even number it's not divisible by 2. look at this one 4 yes it is divisible 6 again it is divisible one not divisible zero yes it's divisible and seven it's not divisible find whether the following numbers are divisible by 5 now so we'll take these numbers and divide by 5. 5 times 7 35 for 25 that's 5. so it's divisible 5 times 840 for 20 that's 4 that's also divisible look 
,at this one 5 times 1 and 3 remaining 34 that's 6 45 that's 9 that's also divisible 5 times 1 5 1 remaining 5 times 3 15 and for 20 that's 4. so all these numbers are divisible by 5. so how we identify look at the last digit of the above numbers they are either 5 or zero five zero here five zero they can be divisible by five without a remainder so how we identify whether the number is divisible by five last digit should be zero or five now put tick mark for numbers divisible by five without a remainder and cross mark for numbers not divisible by 5 in the cage in front of each given number so what we do you we look at the last digit 5 so it's divisible 
,by 5 0 yes it is divisible eight no because only zero and five for the last digit the number is divisible by five eight no seven no zero years five years and this one also correct so you have to only look at the last digit look at this one find out whether the following numbers are divisible by 10 now without a remainder take a 
,look at all these numbers 360. so 10 times 330 for 60 that's 6. 580 10 times 550 for 80 that's 8. this one 10 times 440 for 70 that's 7. 810 here 810 divided by 10 you get 8 and for 10 that's 1. all these are divisible by 10. now we'll see the last digit of the above numbers is 0. look at all the numbers last digit is zero so if the last digit is zero the number is divisible by 10. play a stick mark if they are divisible by 10 without a remainder and place cross mark if not divided so last 
,digit is zero so it's divisible by 10 here 5 not divisible 3 also not divisible in this number 0 is there it's divisible by 10 here not in this one yes 0 is there so it's divisible by 10 5 no here's 0 yes and this one also years here also divisible by 10 so how we identify whether the number is divisible by 10 look at the last digit if it is 0 it's divisible by 10. complete the following table if divided without a remainder put correct while cross mark if not divided so look at this number 
,last digit 0 divisible by 5 without a remainder last digit 0 of 5 it's divisible by 5 divisible by 10 yes last digit is 0 that's divisible by 10 this one 5 so 5 means divisible by 5 but not divisible by 10 0 divisible by 5 as well as 10. here 2 it's not divisible by 5 or 10. here 0 divisible by 5 as well as 10. here also 0 it's 
,divisible by 5 and 10. here 5 is there it's divisible by 5 but not divisible by so look at this one if zero or an even number is the last digit in the ones place then that number can be divided by two without a remainder if 0 5 is that last digit in the ones place that number can be divided by 5 without a remainder and if 0 is the last digit in the ones place that number can be divided by 10 without a remainder so we did divisible by 2 5 and 10. now we'll see what is the digital root of a number sometimes we call this is the lucky number so look at this one gaura's birthday is on 11 2 that means february 2002 find out the digital root so how can we find out the digital root we add all the digits so here 1 plus 1 plus 0 plus 2 plus 2 not not 2. so you have to add all digits and see what's your lucky number one plus one two two plus two four four plus two six six plus two eight till you get one digit you have to add so lucky number is eight that's called the digital root birthday of gaura's grandfather is 12 11 that's november 1948. find out the digital root of his birthday so we'll add all the digits 1 plus 2 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 9 4 eight so one plus two three three plus one four four plus one five five plus one six six plus nine fifteen 15 plus 4 19 19 plus 8 27 now you get two digit number so again you have to add these two digits 2 plus 7 you get 9. so gaura's grandfather's lucky number is 9. here we get two numbered figure as the answer so they should be once again added to get the answer so here 27 we can find out taking 2 plus 7. find the digital root of the following numbers so we'll add it 2 plus 7 is 9. so lucky number is 9. 3 not 8. eight plus three eleven but eleven is two digit number so you have to add it again one plus one that's two five thousand one hundred and twenty 
,seven add all the digits five plus one six six plus two eight eight plus seven fifteen now add the two digits one plus five that's six this one four plus eight twelve twelve and ten twenty-two twenty-two means two plus two you get 4. here 6 plus 7 13 13 plus 7 20 and 9 29 now add the two digits 2 plus 9 11. again you have to add 1 plus 1 2 till you get one digit you have to add 3 plus 7 10 18 and 18 plus 4 22 22 plus 5 27 and 2 and 7 you get 9. 488 8 and 8 16 16 plus 4 20. so add 2 and 0 you get 2. that's the digital root 99999 so 4 9s you get 36 and three and six you get nine how many fours are there one two three four five six six fours you get 20 4 
,2 plus 4 you get 6. this one the 335 704 three plus three six six plus five eleven eleven plus seven eighteen eighteen plus four twenty two two plus two you get find whether the following numbers are divisible by 3 without a remainder now we'll check out these numbers we'll divide by 3 3 times 1 nothing for 2 for 21 that's 7. so it's divisible 612 divided by 3 you get 2 here nothing there 3 times 4 12. 102 3 times 3 9 for 12 that's 4. 201 this is 3 times 6 18 for 21 that's 7 67 that's divisible by 3. now we'll find out the digital root of all these numbers and see three two one five five plus one six six hundred and twelve six plus one seven 7 plus 2 9 here 102 1 plus 2 3 and 201 that's 3. now look at the digital root when you get 3 6 9 as the digital rule the number is divisible by 3. so you need to remember how 
,you identify whether the number is divisible by 3 the digital root should be either 3 6 or 9. find out the digital root of the following numbers and find whether they are divisible by 3 without a remainder so we'll find out the digital root 8 will straight away add this 8 plus 1 9 9 plus 3 12. so 12 means 1 plus 2 you get 3 408 
,8 plus 4 12 2 plus 1 3 this one 3 plus 1 4 4 plus 7 11 11 plus 2 13 3 plus 1 4 plus one six six plus two eight eight plus two ten eleven twelve so one plus two three three plus four seven seven plus five 12 12 plus 7 19 and 21 2 plus 1 again that's 3. 6 plus 7 13 13 plus 5 18. eight plus one nine seven plus two nine nine plus nine eighty and one nineteen and twenty four so 2 plus 4 again 6. now we found out digital root now check whether this number is divisible by 3 without a remainder so 
,what's the condition if the digital root is 3 6 9 the number is divisible by 3 so this is 3 this is divisible by 3. here also this is divisible by 3 but 4 is not here 3 again yes yes 9 also possible here 6 also possible so only this number is not divisible by 3. look at these numbers write the numbers divisible by 3 without a remainder from the above numbers within the set of 8 so what you have to do you have to find out the digital root 2 plus 1 3 so that's divisible by 3 3 plus 1 4 it's not divisible 4 plus 1 5. it's not divisible but here 5 plus 1 yes it's divisible 51 6 plus 1 again not divisible 7 plus 1 8 not divisible but 8 81 8 plus 1 9 that's 
,divisible by 3 9 plus 1 10 that's 1 plus 0 again 1 so that's not divisible so only 21 51 81 are divisible by 3. look at these numbers write the numbers divisible by 
,3 without a remainder from the above numbers within the set b again check the digital root 5 plus 2 7 that's not divisible five plus one six six plus two eight not divisible five plus two seven seven plus two nine that's divisible by three five plus three eight eight plus two ten not divisible five plus four nine nine plus two eleven eleven means one and one again two not divisible here 10 12 12 means 2 plus 1 again 3 that's divisible by 3 562 6 5 11 11 plus 2 13 13 means 1 and 3 you are getting 4 5 plus 7 12 12 plus 2 14 14 means 5. not divisible 5 plus 8 13 13 plus 2 15 15 means 6 that's divisible by 3 so these are the numbers divisible by three identify the numbers that are divisible by four without a remainder we'll take these numbers and divide by four four times six so that's divisible by 4 here 4 times 1 4 
,for 22 that's 5 and for 24 that's 6. that's also divisible 4 times 8 32 for 28 that's 7. 300 4 times 7 28 for 20 that's 5 that's also divisible this one 4 times 6 24 for 10 that's 2 8 and for 20 that's 5. 4 times 8 32 then 32 38 for 38 you get 9 36 remainder 2 5 times 1 4 times 1 4 1 remaining for 10 4 times 2 8 for 21 that's 4 
,times 5 20 and for 14 4 times 3 12 and remainder 2. this one divide by 4 4 times 1 4 for 3 nothing for 31 that's 7 28 so you get 30 so again 7 28 for 20 that's 5. so these two numbers are not divisible by 4. now look at the last two digits and see we'll look at last two digits so this is 24 here also 24 48 zero zero fifty eight 
,fourteen zero zero so how we identify whether the number is divisible by four if the final two digits of the above numbers are either 0 0 24 48 64 28 32 that means the numbers are divisible by 4 so you have to only look at the last two digits so here 58 is not divisible by 4 so the whole number is not divisible 14 also not divisible by 4 so that means 5014 is not divisible by 4. select and write the numbers divisible by 4 without a remainder from the following numbers so what we do we take 
,the last two digits 75 not divisible by 4 44 yes so 344 is divisible by 4 here 0 0 if it's 0 0 also it's divisible 84 divisible by 4 so 1284 divisible by 4 72 4 times 1 4 32 so that's divisible by 4 972 55 it's not divisible by 4. but 0 0 yes it's divisible by 4 here also 0 0 it's divisible by 4 36 yes it is divisible by 4 so 5 
,4 536 divisible by 4. what about 58 4 times 1 and for 18 it's not divisible by 4 so you can't write that number write three numbers beginning from 5 ending with 2 and having four numbers so you can create anything so numbers beginning from five so five but ending with two four digits ending with two write three numbers so four having four numbers four digit numbers so you can put any number in between seven three five and two you can put nine and one five and two eight and three another one now you asked to write only three numbers so these are the three numbers starting from five and ending with two look at this one write down all the numbers less than 100 divisible by 4 without a remainder and 6 at the ones place last digit is 6 and the number should be less than 100 that means only 2 digit numbers you can write how we identify whether the number is divisible by 4 the last 2 digit should be divisible by 4. so we can put 16 because that's less than 100 16 is divisible by 4 then 26 is not divisible 36 yes 46 no 56 56 is this divisible by 4 1 and for 16 you get 14 so that's divisible 66 it's not divisible 76 check 76 and see 76 divided by 4 1 and here 36 that's nine it's d it's divisible so 76 is okay what else 86 it's not divisible because 4 times 2 86 is not divisible 96 divisible by 4 4 times 2 8 
,for 16 that's 4 it's divisible so 96 so these are the numbers less than 100 last digit is 6 and all the numbers are divisible by 4. look at this one write 6 even numbers that do not divide by 4 without a remainder a1 means even means last digit either 0 or even number so we'll put 0 and it's not divided by 4 so what's the condition you can't put 0 there uh what about 30 is 30 divided by 4 no so you can put 30 and any number so 30 or you can put any number here 330. it's not divisible by 4 another one you can put 2 as the last digit and what about this can be 2 22 should be there because it's not divisible by 4 and here we'll put any number here 122. then another number 8 and 18 it's not divisible by 4 and you can put any number here 3. so you asked to write six even numbers another even number you can put 6 but if you put 2 26 is not divisible by 4 and then here you can put any number 526 1 2 3 4 another 2 so 2 and 32 is divisible 42 it's not divisible by 4. so put any number here 5 another one more we'll put 8 and 18 is not divisible by or we'll put 28 is divisible 38 it's not divisible by 4 so you can put any number here 600 or any number here it's not mentioned to write only three digit numbers you can write any number that you like but only condition is the last two numbers it's not divisible by four write six numbers with the last digit as zero and not divisible by three and four without a remainder so you need to be careful now 0 is there last digit is 0 
,not divisible by 4 that means this can be 30 last 2 digits 30 and not divisible by 3 means the digital root cannot be 3 6 9. so here 3 so we can put 1 there 1 plus 3 4 digital root is 4 so that's not divisible by 3 or 4. another one put 0 for last digit and 10 10 is not divisible by 4 so if you put 2 it's divisible by 3 so we can put 3 3 plus 1 4 4 is not divisible by the digital root four means not divisible by three another one you can put any number of digits zero we'll put last two digits 30 40 divisible 50 it's not divisible so 50 then 5 plus 1 6 6 plus 1 7 now digital root is 7 not divisible by 3 and 50 not divisible by 4 another one last digit is zero and we'll put 60 it's divisible 70. it's not divisible because 4 times 1 for 30 it's not divisible so 70 is the last two digits then now think about the digital root 7 plus 1 8 8 plus 2 10 so 10 is not divisible by 3 digital root 10 is not divisible by 3. another one we'll write a big number 1 2 three four we need two more zero and eighty eight is divisible by four ninety you can put ninety there and now put numbers in front 9 plus 1 10 10 plus 1 11 11 plus 2 13 that's 4 digital root is 4 so 2190 is also possible another one more one two three four five one more zero we'll put ten now see the digital root 1 5 1 6 6 plus 2 8 8 plus 2 10 10 plus 1 11 so 11 means digital root is 2 so not divisible by 3. so what's this number 122 510 is also not divisible by 3 or 4. finding a number divisible by 6 without a remainder how we do that we can check whether the number is divisible by 2 or 3 if it satisfy definitely that number is divisible by 6. so we can check it's a it's an even number yes it's divisible by 2. what's the digital root 7 plus 2 9 9 plus 6 15 15 means 6 that means it's also divisible by 3. so definitely if these two are okay that means it's divisible by six as well look at this one five last digit is five means not divisible by 2 digital root 11 plus 5 that's 16 so 6 plus 1 7 7 is not 
,divisible so definitely this is not divisible by 6 last digit is 8 divisible by 2 digital root 3 3 plus 4 7 7 plus 8 15 that means 6 6 means divisible by 3 then definitely this is divisible by 6 as well last digit is 4 divisible by two digital root eight eight plus four twelve twelve means three it's divisible by three so definitely it's divisible by six last digit is 4 divisible by 2. now the digital root 7 plus 4 is 11 11 plus 4 15 that's 6. it's divisible by 3 that means divisible by 6 as well last digit is 5 not divisible by 2 1 plus 8 9 9 plus 5 14 14 means 5. it's not divisible by 3 so definitely it's not divided by 6. last digit is 6 that's even number yes it's divisible by 2. digital root 9 9 plus 6 15 that's 5 plus 1 6. it's divisible by 3 so that means it's divisible by 6 as well if the digital root is divisible by 3 the number is divided by 3. if the number is an even number it can be divided by 2 without a remainder all those numbers divisible by 2 and 3 without a remainder can be divided by 6 as well finding a number divided by 9 without a remainder so we did so far two three four ten five six now nine look at the following 
,multiples of nine all these multiples of 9 take 9 so digital root is 9 18 1 plus 8 digital root is 9 2 7 digital root is 9 36 3 plus 6 that's 9. so take any number 7 plus 1 8 plus 1 9 here 4 plus 4 8 8 plus 1 9 all multiples of 9 you get the digital root 9 so that means you can look at the digital root and see whether the number is divisible by 9 45 4 plus 5 that's nice 117 seven plus one eight eight plus one nine 135 eight and nine here seven plus one all these digital roots are nine ten 8 plus 1 9. so 9 is the digital root of all the above numbers so any number whose digital rule digital index or digital root is 9 it is divided by 9. select and write the numbers that is divisible by 6 without a remainder from the following numbers so have you identify whether this is divisible by 6 first check whether this is a 
,this is an even number this is not so it's not divisible by 6 690 it's an even number now we'll check the digital route 9 plus 6 15 that's 5 1 6 6 means it's divisible by 3 as well so 609 divisible by 2 and 3 that means divisible by 6. this one even number correct digital root 10 10 plus 3 13 13 plus 1 14 that means 4 plus 1 that's not divisible by 3. is an even number check whether this is divisible by three eight plus four twelve twelve plus one thirteen thirteen plus two fifteen so five 
,plus one six it's divisible by two and three that means divisible by 6 as well check the digital route 10 12 12 means it's divisible 774 even number digital road 14 
,plus 4 80 8 plus 1 9 so that's divisible by 3 as well 916 10 10 plus 6 16 that means 7 so not divisible by 3 4 plus 4 8 8 plus 1 9 it's divisible by 3 and 2. that's 
,divisible by 6. this one even yes then digital root nine ten sixteen six plus one seven so that's not divisible by three this one even number look at the digital root three three plus 7 10 10 plus 2 12. it's divisible by 3 as well as 2 so definitely divisible by 6. if a certain number is divided by another whole number without a remainder what you call that number that is a factor of the first number so what are factors if a number can be written as a multiple of two whole numbers they are 
,considered as factors of the first number take look take a look at 24 what are the factors if we take one that's 1 times 24 so 1 and 24 both are factors 2 is also a 
,factor 2 times 12. you can write the same thing as 3 times 8 4 times 6 and 6 times 4 again you can write this way so what are the factors of 24 1 2 3 4 6 8 12 24 so 
,all these numbers we call those are factors so you can create that number by multiplying the two numbers so those are factors write the set of factors of 36 1 times 
,36 2 times 18 3 times 12 4 times 9 6 times 6. so what are the factors of 36 always 1 and the number itself are factors 2 3 4 6 9 12 18 36 so these are the set of factors of 36 all numbers are there all factors are there write the set of factors of 60 1 times 60 2 times 30 divide by 2 and see when you divide by 3 you get 20. divide by 4 1 and for 20 that's 5 15 times 4 divided by 5 you get 12 and here divide by 6 you get 10. so what are the factors of 60 starting from 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 here and 
,then 10 12 15 20 30 and 60. so those are the factors of 60. now we'll look at what are prime numbers take a look at 2 what are the factors of two one and two so factors of two one and two take three one times three factors of 3 1 times 1 and 3. what about factors of 5 1 times 5 so you get 1 and 5. look at carefully what are the 
,factors seven means one and one times seven factors of here seven factors of seven you get one and 7 so take a look at all the factors 1 and the number itself so what are prime numbers if a number has only two factors and the factors are one and itself so those numbers are called prime numbers select and underline the number out of the following numbers divided by 9 without a remainder so how you identify a number is divisible by 9 the digital root should be nine so we'll look at three plus six nine that means divided by nine so one plus five twelve twelve plus six eighteen eight plus one nine two plus two four four plus four eight eight plus one nine 
,that's divisible by nine nine and nine eighteen eight plus one nine two plus three five 5 7 12 12 6 18 that's also divisible by 9. take a look at this one 4 plus 5 9 9 plus nine eighteen that's also divisible by nine here also eight plus one nine this one eight eight plus eight sixteen sixteen plus two eighteen eighteen means nine all the numbers are divisible by nine this one ten ten plus eight eighteen eight plus one nine seven plus seven fourteen 14 plus 1 15 15 means 5 plus 1 6 is not divisible by 9. so all the other numbers except 177 is divisible by 9. select and underline the numbers out of the following numbers divided by 6 and 9 without a remainder how you identify we have to check the digital root and this should be an even number because to check whether the number is divisible by 6 it should be definitely divided by 2. so definitely out of this we can cross out this because this is an odd number this is an odd number not divisible by 6 these numbers we can cross out now for the other numbers we have to check the digital root 10 10 plus 8 18 it's divisible by nine as well as six six plus two eight eight plus one nine nine is divisible by nine as well as 3. here 15 that means 5 plus 1 6 it's not divisible by 9 so you can't select that 7 plus 1 8 8 plus 2 10 10 plus 8 18 18 means 9 that's divisible by 9 as well as 6. this one 7 7 plus 8 15 15 means not divisible by 9 here 16 20 27 divisible by 9 as well as 6. 384 12 12 plus 3 15 15 means 1 plus 5 not divisible by 9. now we'll look at this question factors 24 glass marbles should be packed with similar number leaving any remainder write down all the ways it can be 
,done so you can do one glass marble in each 24 that means one packet two glass marbles in each two times twelve then you get two packets three glass marbles in each 
,three times eight so you can make eight packets four glass marble in each four times six and you get six packets eight glass marbles eight times three you get three 
,packets with six glass marbles six times 4 that's 4 here and with 12 12 times 2 24. so you can make two packets and with 24 again one packet here according to the above information the set of numbers that can be divided by 24 without a remainder so 1 2 3 4 and 6 12 what is 12 24 these are factors now we looked at prime numbers now what are composite numbers we'll take a look at 4 what are the factors of 4 1 into 4 2 times 2. so factors of 4 you can write 1 2 4 factors of 6 1 times 6 or 2 times 3. so what are the factors of 6 you can write 1 two three six one two three six what are the factors of eight eight means one times eight so eight you can write 
,2 times 4 as well so what are the factors of 8 you get 1 2 4 8. now take a look at all the factors here if a certain number has more than two factors it is a composite number prime factors you get only two factors one and the number itself so composite numbers you get more than two factors then we can identify that number is a composite number write the set of composite numbers less than 21 so not prime numbers so one you can't take one just one factor is there two three four is a composite number five is a prime number 6 is a composite number 7 is prime 8 is composite 9 composite 10 11 is a prime number 12 is a composite 13 is prime 14 15 16 17 is prime 18 19 19 is prime 20 is the last number less than 21 means you can't write 21. so these are the composite numbers less than 21 finding prime factors of a number write number 24 in every way as a product of two numbers 1 times 24 2 times 12 3 times 8 4 times 6 so what are the prime factors out of these so write all the factors here we can write the factors of 24 is 1 2 3 4 6 8 12 24 out of these factors what are the prime factors the factors are prime numbers so what are the prime numbers there 2 3 that's all so prime factors of 24 is either 2 or 3 and write all the prime factors so you can write 2 and 3 and write 24 as a product of prime factors how can you write down as a product of prime factors you can take the number divide by only the prime numbers take 2 you get 12. another 2 6 2 3 so 3 1 till you get 1 you have to divide now how many times you multiply by 2 2 2 2 and 1 3. or you can write how many twos three twos into one three so this is a product of prime factors 
,so 2 to the power 3 n 3. now take 36 and write down everywhere as a product of numbers 1 times 36 two times eighty three times twelve four times nine and six times six so what are the factors of 36 you can write 1 2 3 4 6 9 12 18 36 those are the factors out of the factors what are the prime factors 2 3 that's all 2 and 3. now product as prime factors how can you do you can divide by two two times eighteen again divide by two nine you have to divide by three now three times three and again 
,divide by 3 you get 1. so what are the factors 2 times 2 4 4 times 3 12 12 times 3 36 so here 2 times 2 times 3 times 3 or you can write 2 to the power 2 because twice are there and 3 to the power 2 here also twice are there so that's the value 36 as a product of prime factors right all the prime numbers from 1 to 40 starting from 2 3 5 7 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 is 5 18 19 20 21 22 23 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 a prime number 30 31 is a prime number 32 33 34 35 36 30 7 is a prime number 38 and 
,39 it's not and 40. so these are the prime numbers 1 to 40. write all the composite numbers from 1 to 30 composite means you get more than 2 factors one two three four five six seven is prime eight nine ten eleven 12 13 14 15 16 17 here 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 and 30 1 2 30 means you can include 30 as well so those are composite numbers finding highest common factor so we'll take the number numbers 18 and 30. now what are the factors of 18 it's one divisible by two so two is a factor it's divisible by three three is a factor three times six then four five six six times 3 7 8 9 times 2 then 10 11 all these again finally 18. so those are the 
,factors of 18. what are the factors of 30 starting from 1 divisible by 2. it's divisible by 3 3 times 10 4 5 5 times 6 also a factor 7 8 9 10 is a factor then 15 times 2 so 15 is a factor and 30. now what are the common factors of eighteen and thirty one two three six what else that's all so out of these what's the highest one highest common factor of 18 and 30 is 6. that's the highest one now take these two these three numbers 28 42 and 63 and see what's the highest common factor factors of 28 one it's divisible by two three three times no three four four times seven six seven eight nine ten and two times fourteen so fourteen is a factor 4 times 7 and then finally 28 factors of 42 what are the factors of 42 1 it's divisible by two three three times four thirty three times what three times uh fourteen four five six six times seven so seven is a factor eight nine ten eleven and if it's two you get twenty one and if it's three three times one three three times four fourteen is 
,a factor and what is 6 times 7 and again 42 last digit is 42. now what are the factors of 63 1 it's divisible by 3. so 3 times so 63 comes that's the last number 3 times 21 and what else 63 9 times 6 6 and 9 those are the factors of 63. now what are the common factors out of those we'll find out common ones one is common 2 is not 6 no 9 21 it's not common so only one so what's the highest common factor of this so you get only one so the highest common factor of 28 42 and 63 is 1. finding highest common factor using prime factors so this is another way of finding highest common factor find the highest common factor of 36 so we'll find out 36 you can divide by 2 18 divide by 2 now divide by 3 3 divided by three you get one two times two times three times three forty five divide and see you can divide by three divide by three again and divide by five you get one three times three times five fifty-four divide by 2 then divide by 3 3 3 2 times 3 3 3. now these are the factors prime factors so how we find out the highest common factor we'll find out the common ones and multiply what's common two is not common three yes you get three a common one that's all another three another three is common so you get three two times so the highest common factor we take three times three you get three comma twice so three times three that's 9. so how we find out the highest common factor using this way so you find out the prime factor separately and see what are the common ones for all the numbers and then you multiply those find the highest common factor of 64 960 divide by 2 divide by 2 again divided by 2 divided by 2 divided by 2 and 1. so what are the factors 2 2 1 2 3 4 5 six three four five six ninety six divided by three thirty two divided by two sixteen divided by 2 8 divided by 2 4 divided by 2 
,and again 1. so what are the factors 1 2 3 4 5 2 3 4 five and three sixty divide by two get thirty divided by two fifteen divided by three five divide by 5 you get 1. so what are the factors of 60 2 and 2 and 3 and 5. now what are the common factors we'll take what are common two another two then 3 is not common 5 is not common 
,only these two so what's the highest common factor 2 times 2 that's 4. find the highest common factor of 16 36 48 and 60. we'll divide and see 2 times 8 2 times 4 2 
,times 2 2 times 1. so 16 is 2 4 times 36 divided by 2. you get 18 divide by 2 again 9 divided by three three divided by three one two times two three times three 48 
,divided by two 24 divided by 2 12 divided by 2 6 3 3 1. so you get 1 2 3 4 2 3 four and three sixty divided by two thirty divide by two again fifteen divided by three that's five divided by 5 you get 1 2 times 2 times 3 times 5. now find out the highest one what's the highest one 2 is common another 2 is common what else that's 
,all so what's the highest common factor of 16 36 48 and 60 that's 2 times 2 4. now finding least common multiple finding the least common multiple of 4 6 eight what 
,are the multiples of four four times one four four times two eight four times three twelve four times four sixteen 4 times 5 20 24 28 you can write but we'll stop here we'll put three dots that means we it's continuing multiples of six six times one six times two twelve six times three eighteen six times four twenty four six times 5 30 36 42 we'll put three dots multiples of eight eight times one eight eight times two 16 24 8 times 4 32 8 times 5 40 48 like that it's continuing so what are 
,the common multiples of all these will identify common multiples what are the common ones 20 is not there can you see 24 and then what else so 48 comes here so when 
,you do this 48 next you will get 48 like that so 48 also common for all so this is like 24 48 like that common months we need the lowest one so least one is 24 so that's the least common multiple of four six eight so 24 is the answer find the least common multiple of four six eight from prime factors so how can you write four two times two six two times three eight two times two times two so this is how we can do so how many 2s are there here 2 2's here 2 1 and 3 1 here 2 to the power 3 there so we are taking different numbers with maximum power greatest power of them so if you take two's maximum is 2 to the power 3 and then you get 3 here so that's the least common multiple now what's 2 to the power 3 that's 8 times 3 you get 24. so previous one also we got 24 as the least common multiple and there's another way 
,of doing that so how you do that way so here we will try it out you can write down the numbers at once and try to divide by prime numbers so that you get once 2 times two four six divided by two you get three eight divided by two four now you can divide by two this is one three you can't divide so you write down the number as it is this is four so you can divide by two now there's another two so you can divide by two one you can write as it is 3 you can't divide right as it is and this becomes 1. now 3 is there you need to divide this by 3 so you get all ones till you get once you can divide so from this also you can find out the lowest common multiple so 2 times 2 4 4 times 2 8 8 times 3 24 so that way is easier to find out the lowest common multiple find the least common multiple dividing method of the numbers four six eight so here that's what i did before so what are the numbers we got 2 2 2 3. so we get 2 2 2 3. so 2 times 2 4 4 times 2 8 8 times 3 24 as the least common multiple so here divide by prime numbers so here 2 also possible 3 5 7 like that least common multiple of 4 6 8 is 24 so the answer you get as the least common multiple should be eligible for dividing without a remainder by each number again number given find the least common multiple of 72 9608 so we'll use the factor method first 72 divide by 2 36 divided by 2 you get 18 and 9. now you can divide by 3. so what are the factors of 72 1 2 3 and 2 3's 2 to the power 3 3 squared 96 we'll do 96 divided by 2 48 divided by 2 divided by two again till you get one one two three four five and one three two to the power five and one three hundred and eight you 
,need to divide by three till you get one two twos and three threes two twos and three threes now we take the highest power with different numbers when you consider 2 2 to the power 5 is the maximum when you take 3 3 to the power 3 is the maximum so that's the least common multiple 2 to the power 5 32 3 to the power 3 3 times 3 times 3 27 now when you multiply these two what you get 32 into 27 20 and 7 21 plus 1 22 when you add it 964. so what's the least common multiple of 72 968 is 964 find least common multiple of 64 96 and 128 now divide by 2 32 divide by 2 again 16 divided by 2 here 8 4 2 and 1. so how many tools 1 2 3 4 5 6 2 to the power 6. 96 48 divided by 2 24 divided by 2 12 6 3 one two three four five two to the power five and three 168 is not 120 868 2 8 4 42 21 7 and 1 so 2 to the power 3 and 3 and 7. 
,now when you take different numbers when you take 2 the maximum power is 2 to the power 6. if you take 3 that's 1 power 1 and 7 2 to the power 6 is 60 4 3 times 7 21 so 64 times 21 what's the answer add it together thousand three hundred and forty four is the lowest or least common multiple fine least common multiple of 14 28 42 by applying dividing method so you write the numbers at once and divide 2 times 7 2 times 14. 2 times 24 again you can divide by 2 but 7 you can't divide so you write as it is 7 you're 12. again you can divide by 2 you get 6. again divide by 2 you get 3. now you can divide by 3 and finally by 7 till you get 1. so what's the least common multiple you multiply all these numbers two times two times two three four and three and seven two times two four four times two eight eight times two sixteen times twenty one what's sixteen times twenty one twenty and one here and 16 you get 336. that's the least common multiple look at this question the bells a in every 20 minutes be in every 30 minutes and see in every 40 minutes respectively rings if all three bells were ringing at the same time at eighteen when we all three bells be wrong once again so if you take multiples of twenty just see you get 20 20 and 20 40 then 60 80 80 plus 20 hundred hundred plus 20 hundred and twenty like that 140 if you take every 30 minutes it's ringing then multiples of 30 30 60 60 30 90 90 30 120 120 plus 30 150 150 plus 30 180 so and if it's 40 minutes interval what are the multiples of 40 40 80 80 plus 40 120 and 40 160 200 like that now what's the lowest common one look at these values and see what's the lowest common value 
,is comma and the lowest one so that means after 120 minutes it will ring again so 120 minutes means how many hours divided by 60 you get two hours so what's the time again the bell is ringing eight for the first time and 8 plus 2 10 a.m so again the bell will ring at 10 a.m so this is one way of solving this problem or you can do using factors 20 how can you write 2 times 10 10 again 2 and 5 30 how can you write 2 times three six six times five forty two times twenty again two times two ten two times two eight eight times five so forty those are the factors so how do you find out the lowest one when you take least common multiple of twenty thirty forty this is 2 to the power 2 and 5 here 2 3 5 here 2 to the power 3 and 5. so when you take power 2 to the power 3 is the maximum 3 to the power 1 is the maximum and 5 
,to the power 1. 2 to the power 3 is 8 8 times 3 24 24 times 5. 120 so least common multiple also 120 so which one is easy this way is easier than finding multiples so we'll find using least common multiple finding factors and take the highest factor now we'll look at exercise in your textbook exercise 4.1 without dividing select the numbers which are divisible by 9 how we identify digital root if the digital root is 9 that means divisible by nine five plus four now so 504 is divisible by nine six plus five eleven eleven plus two thirteen thirteen means you can't five plus six eleven eleven plus seven eighteen that means yes it's divisible by nine six plus five eleven eleven plus 8 19 that's not possible 2 2 plus 4 6 6 plus 3 9 that's possible 1 plus 3 four four plus five nine nine plus one ten that's not possible 
,two plus seven nine nine plus one ten ten plus nine ninety that's not possible and the last one four plus five nine nine plus three twelve twelve plus six eighteen eighteen means yes it is divisible by s nine because the digital root is nine look at question number two without dividing select and write down the numbers which are divisible by three so what's the condition we find out the digital root if it is three six nine the number is divisible by three so we'll look at the digital root eight one eight plus one nine so nine means divisible so you can select eighty-one hundred and two one plus zero plus two you get three that's also divisible by 3 164 1 plus 6 plus 4 7 plus 4 11 11 means again 1 plus 1 that's 2. not divisible so you can't select that 189 10 18 that means 1 plus 8 9. so that's divisible by 3 189 352 3 5 2 8 8 plus 2 10 that means 1 plus 0 that's 1. so you can't select 352. 372 372 99 plus 3 12 12 means 1 plus 2 you get 3 that means okay 372 466 466 12 12 4. sixteen one plus six that's seven so you can't take 466 756 75 six eleven eleven plus seven eighteen one plus eight nine that's divisible by three so 756 is also okay 951 951 15 15 means one plus five that's also possible so 951 also divisible by 3 last one 1 plus 0 plus two plus nine ten twelve twelve means two plus one three that's also divisible by 3. so 1029 is divisible by 3. so these are the numbers that are divisible by three question number three 3 divides the number 6 5 something such as 2 digits suitable for the empty space so what's the condition the digital root should be 3 6 or 9. what's 6 plus 5 11 11 means 1 plus 1 that's 2. so you need one more to get the digital root 3 so you can put 1 here so 651 you get digital root three then another one if this is six also it's divisible by three how you get six what's the next number you need to add this is 2 3 4 5 6 4 digit number you have to add so what's the other number 6 5 4 check 11 11 plus 4 15 means 1 plus 5 you get 6 as a digital root so that's possible so either 1 or 4 you can put you can check like that till you get nine also possible four five six six another three you can put seven also then six plus five eleven eleven plus seven eighteen that means 9 that's also possible 1 4 and what's the other number 7 6 plus 3 so that's 7. question number 4 pencils were brought to be distributed among nimal's friends on his birthday party the number of pencils was less than 150 but close to it nimal observed that each friend could be given nine pencils what is the maximum number of pencils that maybe may have been brought so from this we identify the number should be divisible by nine and as well as it is less than 150 so what's the condition to identify whether it is divisible by 9 the digital root should be equal to 9 now we'll 
,check with first the number less than 150 means 149 and c what's the digital root 1 plus 4 plus 9. you get 13 plus 1 14 again 1 plus 4 that's 5. we'll take another number to see the pattern 148 1 plus 4 plus 8 13 that means 1 plus 3 you get 4 so likewise now you need to get digital root 9 what are the possibilities you are getting the next number three two one zero zero means that's divisible by nine so till you get this number you have to find out so 148 here so this becomes 147 146 145 144 so we'll check 144 what's the digital root of 144 1 plus 4 plus 4 you get 9 digital root 9 and the number is less than 150 so what is the number number is 144 pencils question number five the following quantities of items were brought to make gift packs to be given to the winners of a competition 131 exercise books 130 pencils 128 platinums and 131 ballpoint pens if each gift pack should contain three units of each item write down the minimum extra amount needed from each item so that means this these numbers should be divisible by 3. so we'll take the first one exercise book exercise books 131 what what's the digital root 1 plus 3 plus 1 4 4 plus 1 
,5. how you check whether the number is divisible by 3 the digital root should be three six nine so to get six here you need one more exercise book so need one more exercise book to get digital roots now we'll look at pencils pencils 130. then 130 pencils means 1 plus 3 plus 0 3 plus 1 4 digital root is 4 what should be the digital root to see the number is divisible by 6 you need 2 more so to get the number divisible by three you need two more pencils so here you need two more pencils there now we'll look at the next one 128 platinum pens 128 plating no what's the digital root of this 1 plus 2 plus 8 10 10 plus 1 11 that means 1 plus 1 you get 2. so you need digital root 3 so you need one more platinum so you need one more now what's the other one we did platinums now 131 ballpoint pens 131 ball point pence so what's the digital root there 1 plus 3 plus 1 4 4 plus 1 5 to get 6 you need one more ball point so those are the items that need extra to get a number divisible by 3 exercise 4.2 from the following select and write down the numbers which are divisible by 6 which are divisible by 4. so we'll do the first part divisible by 6. so what's the condition it should be any one number because it's divisible by 2 then if the digital root is 3 6 9 it's divisible by 3 then definitely it's divisible by 6. 
,so here we can cross out this one that's odd number this one this one those three because those are odd numbers not divisible by 2 now we'll take the digital root 1 
,62 1 plus 6 plus 2 9. so that means it's divisible by 2 as well as 3. so this is correct 912 9 plus 1 plus 2 12 12 means 2 plus 1 3 that's also correct 966 9 plus 6 
,plus 6 9 plus 6 15 15 plus 6 21 2 plus 1 3 that's also possible 2 1 one eight two plus one plus one plus eight twelve that's two plus one three it's also possible two four seven two two plus four six six plus seven thirteen thirteen plus two fifteen fifteen means 6 so that's also possible 3024 3 plus 0 plus 2 plus 4. four plus two six six plus three nine so that's also divisible by three and two three three naught eight three plus three plus zero plus eight eleven eleven plus three fourteen fourteen means one plus four that's five not divisible three three three two nine nine plus 2 11 that means 2 not divisible 4 800 is 4 plus 8 12 12 means 1 plus 2 3 that means it's divisible by 3 so these are the numbers divisible by 2 and 3 therefore it's divisible by 6. now we'll take part 2. now we want to check whether this is divisible by 4 how we identify whether this is divisible by 4 you have to take the last two digits 62 is it divisible by 4 4 times 1 4 for 22 that's not divisible so you can't take that 87 it's not divisible by 4 12 yes it's divisible by 4 so 912 is divisible by 4. 66 last two digits you have to check 4 times 1 4 26 it's not divisible this one 18 not divisible by 4 23 not divisible by 4 72 2 times 4 times 1 4 32 4 times 8 that's divisible by 4 so 2 4 7 2 is divisible by 4 41 again not divisible by 4 24 yes it is divisible by 4 4 times 6 so 3024 is also divisible by 4 0 8 yes divisible by four three three not eight thirty two yes it's divisible by four four thousand eight hundred years when you get zero zero it's divisible by four so the other number divisible by four is four thousand eight hundred so these numbers are divisible by four question number two write the following numbers in the appropriate column of the table given below a number may be written in both column 
,1 and 2 1 and 3. so you need to check number of which 4 is a factor that means divisible by 4 and here reason numbers of which 6 is a factor and give the reason so what's the reason to identify it's a factor of four last two digit last two digits should be divisible by four that's the condition for divisibility of 4 what about 6 what's the reason reason is it should be an even number it should be an even number and the digital root should be three six nine if it's satisfied we can say this 
,is divisible by six now we'll check each one 348 last two digits 48 so divisible by 4 now check whether it's divisible by 6 it's an even number what's the digital root eight plus four twelve twelve plus three twelve plus three fifteen fifteen means one plus five six so digital root is there so you can write this number again here 496 96 is it divisible by 4 4 times 2 yes it is divisible by 4 what about the digital root 9 plus 6 15 15 plus 4 19 so it's not divisible by three 288 yes it is divisible by four what about divisible by three even number okay but what's the digital root 8 and 8 16 16 plus 2 18 18 means 1 plus 8 9 that's okay so that's divisible by 3 as well so definitely it is divisible by 6 414 it's not divisible by last two digits not divisible by four what's a digital root four plus four eight eight plus one nine and also an even number it's divisible by six thousand twenty four it's divisible by 20 uh it's divisible by 4 because last two digits 24 divisible by 4. digital root 4 plus 2 6 6 plus 1 7 it's not divisible by 3 so then it's not divisible by 6 as well this one 72 yes it's divisible by 4 4 times 1 4 32 that's eight so thousand two hundred and seventy two then digital root seven plus two nine nine plus two eleven eleven plus one twelve two plus one three so that's divisible by 6 
,as well 306 not divisible by 4 because last 2 digit is not divisible by 4. digital root 6 plus 3 9 so that means divisible by 6 then we'll do the next one there so the other two numbers 200 other three numbers 258 58 not divisible by 4. so you can't write it there digital root 8 plus 2 10 10 plus 5 15 15 means 1 plus 5 6 yes it 
,is divisible by it is divisible by 6 so 258 so you can write down the same reason that we did before thousand eight last two digits eight that's divisible by 4. so that is here digital root 9 9 is divisible by 6 as 9 means divisible by 3 so definitely divisible by 6 as well 0 0 there are last two digits that means divisible by 4 digital root six plus seven thirteen three plus one four that's not divisible by three the number six two something and then six is divisible by both 4 and 6 find the suitable digit for the empty space what's the condition satisfy for 4 this should be the last two digits should be div divide by four this one six means divisible by six means which this should be an even number and the digital root should be 3 6 9. now it's easy to first find the digital root here 6 plus 2 plus 6 here 12 12 
,plus 2 fourteen fourteen means one plus four you get five you need to get digital root six or what's the other one nine possible when you take now you need one more 
,to get six so if we put 1 here definitely it's divisible by 4 as well because 16 is divisible by 4. can we find out another digit you need 3 not 3 4 to get 9 46 is it divided by 4 you can't put 4 there so only possibility is 6 2 1 6 question number four a drill team arranges themselves in the following manner on one location they form lines consisting of three members each and on another occasion line consisting of four members they also make circles of nine members each if the drill team must have more than 250 members more than 250 members use the divisibility rule to find the minimum number of members that could be in the t so that means the number 
,should be divided by 3 divided by 4 and divided by 9 without a remainder so how we identify without a remainder here digital root should be nine here also possible how you get four divided by four last two digits should be divisible by four so we check last two digits now we'll take more than 250 so 2 5 is there we'll check up to 259 2 plus 5 you get 7. now you need another 2 to that so if this is 2 you get 252 but now check whether last two digits divisible by 4 4 times 1 and 4 times 3 you can divide that by 4 as well so digital root 9 so what's the number it can be 252. and it says minimum number you can find several numbers more than that so minimum number is 252. question number five determine whether 126 is divisible by 2 3 4 5 6 9 and 10. 126 it's an even number can divided by two how we identify for three digital root one plus two plus six nine so that's okay so that means divided by 3 as well next one last two digits these two digits not divided by 4 so not divided by 4. 5 how we identify 5 here last digit should be either 0 or 5 so not divided by 5 six how we identify with this divided by six even number digital root should be three six nine digital root is nine so that means definitely it's divided by 6 without a remainder how we identify it is divided by 9 digital root is 9 so that's correct you can divide by 9 is it divisible by 10 no last digit should be zero so this is not divided by 10. so this is the end of part 1 in your textbook so what's the 
,divisibility rule if 2 divides the ones place digit of a whole number then that number is divisible by 2. basically that means an even number if the digital root of 
,a whole number is divisible by 3 then the number is divisible by 3. so 3 6 9. if the last two digits of a whole number consisting of two or more digits is divisible 
,by 4 then the whole number is divisible by 4. how we identify whether it's divisible by 5 the last digit once place digit should be 0 or 5. if a whole number is divisible by both 2 and 3 then it is divisible by 6. if the digital root of a whole number is 9 then that number is divided by 9. if one's place digit of a whole number 
,is 0 then the number is divisible by 10. so remember all these rules then you can identify whether any number is divisible by these numbers now exercise 4.3 factorize so how we find out the factors we'll take the first one you can divide and find the factors two times seven and two times five three times two three times five then five times five now we can see what are the factors 1 with 150 first and the last number always a factor it's divisible by 2. two times seventy-five then three times fifty and what else five times 30 and 6 times 6 times 25 and what is 10 15 you you can get 15 10 you do 10 10 times 50. so these are the factors of 105 so when you're asked to factorize you can find out what are the possible products now we'll take 204 what are the factors you can divide and see divide by 2 divide by 2 again 
,divide by 3 and 17. so i can write 204 as 1 times 204 it's divisible by 2. so i can write 2 times 102. then three times three times six eighteen for twenty-four three times eight sixty-eight it's divisible by four times 5 and 1 51 then it's divisible by 6 6 times 3 18 for twenty four six times four what else twelve two times two four four times three twelve twelve times seventy or 17 times 12 what tips then what about these two 17 times 2 34 17 times 3 51. so all these are we have already taken 4 4 times 3 12 12 also there so those are the factors of 200 165 you can divide by 3 divided by 5 and 11. so you can write 165 as 1 times 165 then 3 times 3 times 55 then 5 times 33 and what else 11 times 15 or 15 times 11. here again when you combine you get all the other numbers so those are the factors of 165 284 you can divide by 2 again so 2 times 7 1 so 71 is a prime number so you can divide by 71 that's 1. so what are the factors 284 to 1 times 284 then 2 times 142 then 4 times 
,71 and here what else when you multiply these two you get 142 and here 142. so that's all four that's all those are the factors of 284 write down the 10 factors of 770 below 100 770 we can divide by 2. and you can divide by 5 35 again 7 divide by 7 and you get 11 and 1. so what are the factors of 770 less than 100 you can write 
,1 2 then 5 7 11 what else then 5 times 2 10 you have let's start right 10 and then 11. five times to ten seven times two fourteen then seven times five thirty five then 55 11 times 5 what else 7 times 11 77 do we need more one two three four five six seven eight nine ten you need ten factors so those are the ten factors less than hundred write five multiples of 36 36 36 times 2 72 36 times 3 108 36 times 4 144 4 times 6 24 4 times 3 12 plus 2 40. then 5 5 times 6 30 3 there 5 times 3 15 plus 3 18. so those are the 5 multiples of 36 5 multiples of 112 so you are adding 112 so starting from 112 multiplied by 2 224 multiplied by 3 336 multiplied by 4 multiplied by 5 160 5 times 2 10 1 remaining 5 times 1 5 plus 1 6 and 5 times 1 5 right 5 multiples of 53 below 500. so first number is 53 multiplied by 2 multiplied by 
,3 multiplied by four again four times three twelve one remaining four times five twenty twenty-one five times this 5 times 3 15 1 remaining 5 times 5 25 plus 1 2 6 2 3 4 5 so those numbers are below 500. look at this question 180 chairs in an examination hall have to be arranged such that each row has an equal number of chairs if the minimum number of chairs that should be in a row is 10 and the maximum that could be in a row is 15. find how many possible ways there are to arrange the chairs so 180 just so check whether this number is divisible by 2 3 like that so here we'll start from this is 10 so the next number is 11. now look at 180 and see what are the factors of 180 divide by 2 divide by 2 and divide by 3 and divide by 5. so what are the factors so we can't take less than 10 so 180 we can write as if it's 10 10 with 18 so that's one possibility to arrange the chairs then 12 3 2 2 12 with 15 then what else 12 with 15 and 1 more 9 eighteen three times three nine nine times two eighteen with ten we did that another possibility fifteen we took it we need to get less than 15 18 you can't because 18 there that's all those are the possibilities can we get one more 2 times 2 four four times three twelve four times nine four times nine 36 so that's more than that so those are the only possibilities so here 12 times 15 or you can write as 15 times 12. so these are the rows the minimum number of chairs that should be in a row in a row it can be 10 12 or 15 chairs example number one write 63 as a product of its prime factors so what you do you divide and see 21 7 and 1 so what how can you write 63 3 times 3 times 7 or you can rewrite as 3 squared into 7. exercise 4.4 find the prime factors of each of the following numbers 81 you can divide by 3 27 divided by 3 divided by 3 again divided by 3. so you are only dividing by prime numbers so 81 you can write 3 3 3 3 4 times or 3 to the power 4 84 how can you divide divide by 2 divide by 2 again divide by 3. i can write 2 times 2 times 3 times 7 or 2 to the power 2 3 and 7 96 and divide by 2 divide by 2 again divide by 2 again again 2 2 and 3. one two three four five one two three four five and one three so you can write as two to the power one two three 5 into 3 those are the prime factors express each of the following numbers as a product of its prime factors 12. divisible by 2 and you get 3 here so 2 times 2 times 3 15 you can divide by three and five so three times five sixteen and divide by two 2 again 2 again and 2 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 18 you can divide by 2 and 3 and three so two times three and three so those are the prime factors twenty divided by 2 divided by 2 and 5. 2 times 2 times 5 28 divide by 2 divided by 2 again and 7 2 times 2 times 7. take 59 it's not divisible by any other number just 1 and 
,itself so that's a prime number so you can't write factors there so 1 and 59 so prime number because it's prime number only 1 and itself are factors 65 divisible by 
,five and thirteen so five times thirteen so you are asked to write in prime factors 5 and 13 both are prime factors 77 7 with 11. 7 times 11 91 you can divide by 7 and 13. so 7 into 30 exercise 4.5 find six factors of each of the following numbers by considering their prime factors divisible by two again two and five so you need six factors each of the following numbers by considering they are prime factors so you need prime not only prime factors any six factors so one is definitely a factor 2 then you get 4 and 5 what else 10 and 5 times 2 10 4 times 5 we did and 20 times 1 that's 20 6 factors are there 42 can divide by 2 divide by 3 and 7 so 1 is a 
,factor 2 3 7 and then you can do multiply 6 is also 5 and 2 times 7 14 is a factor one two three four five six you can write more 21 42 any number only you asked to 
,write 6 factors 70 divided by 2 divide by 5 and 7. so 1 is a factor 2 5 7 then 10 2 times 5 then what is 3 times or not three times five five times seven thirty five or seventy one and last number always are factors 84 divisible by 2 divisible by 2 again so 3 and 7. now what are the factors one is a factor two three seven and two times two four two times three six likewise you can write any number 4 times 3 12 then 21 any number but you need only 6 factors 66 divisible by 2 3 and 11. so 1 2 3 11 then 6 is a factor what else is 22 is the first box then 3 times 11 33 is a factor 66 so you can write 86 99 divided by 3 3 and 11. so 1 3 then 9 11. what is 11 times 3 33 and 9 times 9 times 11 1199 six factors are there example number one find the highest common factor of 72 108 we'll use three methods first one write down separate factors so 72 how can you write 72 divide and see you get 3 and 3 so 2 into 2 into 2 into 3 into 3 factors of 72 you can write like that what are the factors of 108 you can divide and see nine three three again so i can write two twice three tries what's the highest common factor so highest common factor you can take the common ones out one two and three here another three so what's the highest common factor let's see if 2 times 2 times 3 times 3. 2 times 2 4 4 times 3 12 12 times 3 36 so that's the highest common factor this is one method we'll take another method now we'll look at another method so what are the two numbers 72 and 108 72 and 108 we'll find out all the factors of 72. y then it's divisible by 2. when we have factors it's easy nine three times three one so two one two three then four six what else nine eight so we'll put eight first nine two times three six six times two twelve what else then six times three eighteen also possible eight times nine twelve and then two times two four four times two eight eight times three eight times three twenty-four twenty-four times three seventy-two so we can write down all the factors of 72. now we'll try to write down all the factors of 108. first we'll divide and see so what are the factors one two three then two times two four then two times three six then three times three nines what else 12 2 times 2 4 4 times 3 12 is a factor then 3 times 2 6 6 times 3 18 is a factor then 2 times 2 4 4 times 
,3 12 12 times 3 12 times 3 30 6 is also factor and 108 is the other one three times three nine nine times three 27 is also factor this way twenty three times three nine nine times three twenty seven 27 27 times 2 54 and then 108 now when you take all the factors what are common one 2 3 4 6 9 12 18 and here this is also divisible by 36 we forgot to write down 36 times 2. so 36 or so common seven to two and hundred other numbers are not common out of these common numbers what's the highest common factor out of these the highest one is 36 so that's the second method now we'll take another method so we can write 72 and 108 in a row and find out the common 
,factors we can divide both the numbers by 2. again by two now this one you can divide both the numbers by 3 again by 3. now we can't divide because 2 and 3 there are no common factors till you get these common factors and then you can multiply these common ones 2 times 2 times 3 times 3 9 9 times 2 18 18 times 2 36 so highest common factor is 36 so we did three ways to find out the highest common factor example number two three types of items were brought in the following quantities to be offered at an arms giving 30 cakes of soap 24 tubes of toothpaste 18 bottles of ointment 30 24 and 18. parcels were made such that each contain all three items every 
,parcel had the same number of items of a particular type what is the maximum number of parcels that can be made accordingly write down the quantity of each item in a single parcel so what you have to find out the highest common factor of 30 24 and 18. so what's the easiest way to do we can write down separately and see the common ones 30 how can you write and divide by two divide by three and five two times three times five twenty-four you can divide by 2 and do divide by 2 again 2 again and 3. so 2 times 2 times 2 times 3 then 18 how can you divide divide by two and three two times three times three now what are the common ones two three that's all so that means highest common factor is six that means you can make six parcels so six parcels are there so how many you can put in each parcel 30 divided by six so you can put in one parcel if it's one parcel what are the things six thirty divided by six five cakes of salt divided by six six times four twenty-four so six times four four what's that toothpaste and six you divide by this one 18 divided by six you get three three bottles of ointment three bottles of ointment so those are the things you can include in one parcel and you can make six puzzles like that exercise 4.6 fill in the blanks to obtain the highest common factor by writing down all factors of the given numbers factors of 8 1 2 4 and 8 factors of 12 1 divided by 2 divided by 3 4 and 6 and 12 factors common to 8 and 12 1 too common what is and what's the highest common factor out of all these three factors common factors 4 is the highest one part 2 54 written as a product of its prime factors so it's easy first 
,divide and see twenty-seven divided by three and divide by three so you can write two times three times three threes then what about 90 you can divide and see 45 and divide by 3 get 15 divide by 3 again 5 divide by 5 you get 1 2 times 3 twice and 5 and 72 how can you write 72 divide by 2 divided by 2 again 2 and 3 and 1. so 2 3 
,times and 3 twice now the highest common factor of all three numbers how can we find out we can use the common one two and here three and another three can you see another three there another three common so what's the highest common factor 2 times 3 6 6 times 3 80. so highest common factor of all three numbers is 18. find the highest common factor of each pair of numbers by writing down all their factors so you need to write down all factors and find out the highest one twelve what are the factors one two three four six what is then 12 50 what are the factors 1 3 5 and 15 now out of these what are the what's the highest one highest one three three is 
,the highest common factor next one 24 24 how can you write you can divide by one two then three four what is six six times two twelve and six times three eighteen six times four twenty four do we get do we get another one four times three twelve four times two eight six times four so that's all 24 what about 30 1 2 3 it's not divisible by 4 5 6 seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen so two times three six six times five thirty do we get 15 15 and 30 now see the highest one what's the highest common one six is the highest common one that's all so highest common factor is six 60 72 so we can find out all factors of 60 1 two and three it's divisible by four as well four five 6 what is 7 0 8 9 10 yes 10 is a factor 12 what else 12 times 5 13 14 15 is a factor 15 times 4 then 30 and 60 factors of 72 1 2 three if you can't figure out it's easy to do this way and find out okay so two three then four six what is eight you can multiply and see what are the other factors 
,8 9 9 times 2 18 is a factor but before that four four times three twelve what else six six times two twelve nine nine times two eighteen then 4 4 times 3 12 12 times 2 24 36 36 times 2 and 72. now what's the common one and the highest highest common factor look at carefully and see what's the highest one 24 not that 18 12 12 is this that's the highest one so that's the highest common factor so hcf is 12 this is not easy this way is the hardest one to find out the all factors and then find 
,the highest one it's easy to find out taking separate factors four and five four what are the factors one two and four five one and five so what's the highest one that's one highest common factor is one here 72 we did that before we do 96 divide by 2. divided by 2 again divide by 2 2 again and finally with 3. so what are the factors of 96 one two three four six then eight what else three four five six eight twelve twenty-four three times two six six times two twelve twelve times two twenty-four twenty-four times two forty-eight ninety-six did we miss anything 32 we missed that 32 16 we miss that and 16 times 3 it's 48 it's there now see from 72 this and it is what's the highest common factor 24 24 is there 72 32 is not there so 24 here and 24 here so highest common factor is 24 there now we'll do the last part 54 
,and 35 so 54 divided and see 2 times 2 4 7 and then you get 9 3 3. so what are the factors of 54 1 2 3 and then 2 times 3 6 9 then 9 times 2 18. what is 3 times 3 9 
,9 times 3 27 and then 54 times 1. check again 6 9 we wrote 9 times 2 18 yeah and 35 what are the factors of 35 1 and it's divisible by 5 7 and 35 only few factors are there so what's the highest one out of these 1 5 is not there 7 not there 35 so what's the highest common factor for these two that's only one so highest common factor is one look at question number three find the highest common factor of each pair of numbers by writing each number as a product of its prime factors so this is 
,the easiest way to find out the highest common factor so 24 you divide and see you get 2 times 6 again divide by 2 so you can write 2 times 2 times 2 times 3 36 how 
,can you write 2 times 18 9 3 times 3 2 times 2 times three times three so what's the common one two two three so what's the highest common factor two times two times three you get 4 times 3 12 45 3 times 50 3 times 5 and 5. so what are the prime factors of forty-five three three and five fifty-four you can divide by two you can 
,divide by three and another three finally from three again two times three times three times three now see the common factors three is common another three is common that's all so highest common factor is three times three that's nine thirty two forty eight 32 we know that 2 times 2 4 4 times 2 8 8 times 2 16 16 times 2 32 48 2 
,then you get 24 again divide by 2 12 divide by 2 6 divide by 2 again that's three you get three so what are the common factors two two two two so two four times so highest common factor is 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 that's 16 48 so 48 we have already done we can take that one two fours you get two four times and then 3. now we'll take 72 divide by 2 you get 36 36 divided by 2 18. 18 divided by 2 9 9 you can write 3 and 3. now what are the common factors 2 another 2 2 again and one three so what's the highest common factor two times two four four times two eight eight times three twenty four 18 and 36 18 how can you write 2 that's 9 3 and 3 36 divided by 2 you get 18. 18 divided by 2 again 9. 9 is 3 times 3. so what's the highest common factor you get 2 and three and another three so two times three six six times three eighteen so highest common factor is 80. find the highest common factor by any method you like so which one is the easiest using separate factors that's the easiest way to find out highest common factor eighteen you can write two times three times three twelve six six you can write two times three fifteen three times five now find out the common ones three so highest common factor is three twelve eighteen twenty four two six is two times three eighteen divided by two nine nine is three 
,times three twenty-four divided by two twelve twelve divided by two six six you can write two and three so what's the highest common factor here two is common three 
,is common two times three that's six 24 32 48 divided by 2 12. divided by 2 6 divided by 2 and 3. 32 we know that 2 5 times 48 divided by 2 you get 24 divided by 2 you get 12. divide by 2 you get 6 2 and 3. so what's the highest common factor 2 another 2 another 2 3 is not common so 2 times 2 times 2 that's 8. this one 18 27 36 
,2 times 9 9 is 3 times 3 27 3 3 times 36 divided by 2 18 divided by 2 9 9 is 3 times 3 what's the highest common factor 1 3 is common another 3 is common here that's all 3 times 3 that's 9. question number five a basket contains 96 apples and another basket contains 60 oranges 96 apples and 60 oranges if these fruits are to be packed into bags such that there is an equal number of apples in every bag and an equal number of oranges too in every bag and no fruits remain after they are packed 
,into the bags what is the maximum number of such bags that can be prepared so that means highest common factor of 96 and 60. so we'll find out so 96 divided by 2 you get 48 divide by 2 again 24. divided by 2 again 12 divided by 2 we get 6 that means 2 times 3. 60 divided by 2. 30. 30 divided by 2 15 15 divide by 3 get 5 then divide by 5 you get 60. so what's the highest common factor of these two numbers two two three two two three four times three twelve so that means we can make 12 bags so in one bag how many apples 96 divided by 12 what's the number eight eight apples and 60 divided by 12 you get five five oranges you can keep five oranges so how many bags twelve bags each 8 apples and 5 oranges example number 1 find the lowest common multiple of 8 6 and 16. how we find out the lowest common multiple we'll first find out all factors and see which one is the lowest eight how can you write 2 times 2 times 2 i can write 2 to the power 3 6 2 times 3 2 to the power 1 and 3 to the power 1 16 2 4 times so when you're finding lowest common multiple you take the different numbers with maximum power when you take 4 when you take 2 2 to the power 4 is the maximum what else 3 only once so the lowest common multiple is 2 to the power 4 is 16 times 3 48 so that's 48 now we'll use another method second method we can write 8 6 16 in a row and divide divide by 2 divide by 2 again here 3 you can't divide you write as it is divide by 2 again and divide by 2 till you get 1 you 
,have to divide divide by 3 so you get 1 1 1 now we multiply all these numbers that's the lowest common multiple 2 times 1 2 3 4 and 3. so you get the same answer 16 
,times 3 48 as the lowest common multiple example number two two bells ring at interval of six minutes and eight minutes respectively if they both ring together at eight a.m what time they will ring together again so we'll take all multiples of 6 first 6 12 18 24 30 36 6 times 6 6 times 7 42 what are 6 times 7 6 times 8 48 like that those are multiples of 6 multiples of 8 8 16 24 8 times 4 32 8 times 8 times 5 40 so like that now what's the common one when you look at carefully can you see 24 is the next common one so that means after 24 minutes it will ring again so 24 minutes that means what's the time 8 24 so it will ring at 8 24 8 now same thing second method so you need to find out the lowest common multiple of 6 and 8. so how we find out the lowest common multiple of 6 and 8 we write down like this divide by 
,2 divide by 2 again here 2 again and 3. till you get 1 you divide and multiply these two so lowest common multiple is 2 times 2 times 2 times 3 8 times 3 24 this is 
,in minutes so 8 plus 24 minutes means 8 24 it will ring again exercise 4.7 find the lowest common multiple of each of the following triples of numbers we can take at once and find out the lowest common multiple divide by 2 divide by 2 again divide by 2. divided by 3 and finally again by 3 so what's the lowest common multiple 2 times 2 4 4 times 2 8 8 times 3 24 24 times 3 3 times 4 12 1 remaining 3 times 2 6 plus 1 seventy two now this one eighteen eight fourteen and twenty eight divide by 
,two divide by 2 again divide by 2 and divide by 7. until you get 1 you have to divide so what's the lowest common multiple 2 times 2 times 2 8 8 times 7 you get 56 is the lowest common multiple 20 30 40. you can divide by 2 divided by two again divide by two divide by three and finally divide by 5 get all once so what's the lowest common multiple 2 times 2 4 4 times two eight five times three fifteen so eight times fifteen eight times five forty eight times one eight plus four twelve so hundred twenty nine twelve twenty seven you can divide by two divide by two again now you can divide by 3 3 again and 3 again so what's the lowest common multiple two times two four four times three twelve three times three nine twelve times nine hundred eight two three five you can divide by two divide by three and divide by five 
,so what's the lowest common multiple two times three times five six times five thirty thirty six 54 24 divide by 2 80 divide by 2 7 divided by 2 here 12 again divide by 2. can divide by 2 again i'll divide by 3. divide by 3 again and three again till you get one now what's the lowest common multiple two times two four four times two eight eight times three twenty four and three times 9. 9 times 4 36 3 remaining 9 times 2 18 plus 3 21. so the lowest common multiple is 216. question number two at a military function three cannons are fire at intervals of 12 seconds 16 seconds and 18 seconds respective if the three cannons are fired together initially after how many seconds will they will be they all be fired together again so how many seconds so that means we need to find out the lowest common multiple in seconds so we'll find out the lowest common multiple of 12 16 and 18. divide by two divide by two again divide by two divide by two divide by three and three again so what's the lowest common multiple two times two four four times two eight eight times two sixteen and three times three nine nine times 9 times 6 54 5 remaining 9 times 1 9 
,plus 5 that's 14. so after again 144 seconds again you can see the three can again three cannons at the same time miscellaneous exercise without dividing determine whether the number 30 35 343 is divisible by 3. how we find out digital root 3 plus 5 8 8 plus 3 11 11 plus 4 15 15 plus 3 18 means 1 plus 8 9. so digital root is 9. 
,so that's divisible by three four last two digits not divisible by four so that means not divisible by 4 what about 6 how we identify whether it's divisible by 6 it 
,should be an even number so this is not an even number so not divisible by 6 and 9 digital root is 9 so that's divisible by 9 as well fill in the blanks the highest 
,common factor of 2 and 3 what's the highest common factor there's no common factor so we write only one the lowest common factor of 4 and 12 what's the lowest common multiple of 4 and 12. you can find out 3 times 2 6 6 times 2 12 that's the highest number the highest common factor of two prime numbers is so like this always when you get two prime factors highest common factor is always one the lowest common multiple of two three and five two three again and five two times three six six times five thirty find the highest common factor and lowest common multiple of twelve 42 and 75 so we'll use the factor method because for highest common factor anyway we need the factors 12 2 times 6 6 you get 2 times 3 42 divide by 2 21 3 and 7. divide by 3 you get 25 that's 5 and 5. highest common factor we just see what's highest common ones only three lowest common multiple we can write down two twice and three ones here here two ones three ones and seven ones here you get three ones and five twice so for lowest common multiple you take different numbers with the highest power 2 when you take 2 to the power 2 is the highest 3 just 3 to the power 1 5 5 to the power 2 is the highest and you get 7 to the power 1. now multiply 4 4 times 3 12. 5 times 5 25 and 7. so 12 times 7 we'll multiply these two 84 times 25 what's 84 times 20 5 20 and 5 00 or 8 16. five times four twenty five times eight forty plus two forty two two thousand 100 is the lowest common multiple it is proposed 
,to distribute books among 45 students in a class such that each student receives no less than 5 books and no more than 10 books if this is 5 books what's the if this is 5 books how many books all together 45 into 5 225 and it is no more than 10 books if it's 10 how many books are there 400 so the number of books should be in between 225 and 450 but that should be divisible by 45 because there are 45 students so what's the lowest number it can be 225 then add 45 to that okay 10 7 270 then add 45 again 350 45 again 360. another 45 405 another 45 450 so the number of books can be in between 225 and 450 you can get any number here so we covered the second 
,part of chapter 4 in this lesson and what did we do we identify what are prime numbers and highest common factor lowest common multiple so we explained several methods to identify highest common factor and the lowest common multiple so you can choose the easiest one to solve problems
,
NtkjbVb3Zv8,GCF is the partner to l see em you have learned how to find the lowest common multiple now we learn how to find the greatest common factor if you've practiced LCM and have used prime factorization to find it then you are ready for GCF which is also known as H CF or highest common factor what is GCF the greatest common factor is 
,the largest value that divides exactly into two or more numbers let's explore it using a problem like you'll see in school we'll find the LCM and the GCF of 36 and 44 first we do the LCM you know what to do get the prime factors 36 is from 3 times 12 12 is from 3 times 4 4 is from 2 times 2 then lists the prime factors in a table 2 times 2 times 3 times 3 clear the area 44 is from 4 times 11 4 is from 2 times to put those prime factors into the table aligning like factors 2 times 2 times 11 now get the factors of our mystery LCM 2 times 2 times 3 times 3 times 11 work it out 2 times 2 is 4 times 3 is 12 times 3 is 36 times 11 well 10 36s are 360 and add another 36 on that makes 11 36 s is 396 that's our LCM now let's do the greatest common factor if a prime factor is common to both the numbers listed then it is used in our greatest common factor 2 is in both lists of prime factors here and here three is not common nor is eleven list the common factors two and two then we multiply the common prime factors to get the GCF so two times two the GCF is four isn't that easy I think it's beautifully simple and it's really fast after doing the LCM if you use the prime factors Table two to help organize yourself as you're working through you're going to find it very clear and you'll be least likely to make a 
,mistake there's one last point you need to be aware of before you have a go at GCF for yourself at some point your teacher is going to give you a pair of numbers bit like this where when you do the prime factorization you find that there are no prime factors that are common to the two numbers so how do we list the GCF if there are no factors common to the two numbers then the GCF the greatest common factor is one why because every number always has one as a factor and now you are good to go on GCF check the links here to look at my videos on LC and if you want to refresher you you

jfP5-DVMVlU,introduction that did you notice that this lift does not stop at all the floors I did prainha it stops on the 2nd 4th 6th 8th and 10th floors the numbers 2 4 6 8 and 10 are multiples of 2 right dad absolutely right Reina do you also know that 2 is a factor of 2 4 6 8 and 10 no dad we are yet to learn factors at school in this lesson you will learn about multiples and factors at the end of this lesson you will be able to compute multiples identify common multiples apply concept of multiples 
,to word problems compute factors identify common factors draw factor trees apply concept of factors to vert problems getting to know multiples miss Rita is pronounced maths teacher she is playing a game with her student to teach them the concept of multiples she begins with the multiples of three ten students form a circle around Miss Rita each student has 30 pebbles miss Rita points to a student he recalls in his mind that three ones are three he places three pebbles on the hankie lying in front of him Miss Rita points to another student she recalls that three twos are six she places six pebbles on the hankie in front of her this process is repeated till the tenth student placed thirty pebbles on the hankie in front of her the numbers three 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 and 30 are the product of three with another number hence they are all multiples of 3 basics of multiples multiples of a number are those numbers that are the product of the original number with another number in order to understand multiples better let us now look at facts of multiples common multiples applications of multiples facts of multiples we will now learn some interesting facts about multiples weight is prerna's younger brother he buys a box of full marbles he expresses the total number of marbles as 4 multiplied by 1 is equal to 
,4 Prerna buys a packet of 5 biscuits she expresses the total number of biscuits as 5 multiplied by 1 is equal to 5 Rashmi is prerna's elder sister she brings home a 
,kilogram of mangoes containing six pieces she expresses the total number of mangoes as 6 multiplied by 1 is equal to 6 it is clear from these figures that every number is a multiple of itself Wade buys another box of 4 marbles he expresses the total number of marbles as 4 multiplied by 2 is equal to 8 Prerna buys 2 more packets 
,of 5 biscuits each she expresses the total number of biscuits as 5 multiplied by 3 is equal to 15 Rashmi buys three more kgs of 6 mangoes each she expresses the total number of mangoes as 6 multiplied by 4 is equal to 24 it is clear from these figures that every number is the smallest multiple of itself Wade buys yet another box of for marbles the total numbers of marbles are 4 multiplied by 3 is equal to 12 Rayna buys 2 more packets of 5 biscuits each the total numbers of biscuits are 5 multiplied by 5 is equal to 25 Rashmi buys three more kgs of six man Gossage the total number of mangoes are 6 multiplied by 7 is equal to 42 it is clear from these figures that a new multiple of a number can be generated by multiplying it with a new number therefore multiples of a number are infinite common multiples rima and Prerna are playing a game Rima will count the number of red and green cars on the road she will try to express them as multiples of three Trina will count the number of red and green buses on the road she will try to express them as multiples of six Reema observes 12 red cars and 18 green cars she expresses them as 3 multiplied by 
,4 is equal to 12 3 multiplied by 6 is equal to 18 renina observes 18 red buses and 24 green buses she expresses them as 6 multiplied by 3 is equal to 18 6 multiplied by 4 is equal to 24 18 is a multiple of both three and six such multiples are known as common multiples Prerna and her mother are at the Rose Garden Prerna notices 
,that a patch contains red rose plants arranged in two rows of twelfth plants each another patch contains yellow rose plants arranged in three rows of eight each yet 
,another patch contains pink rose plants arranged in four rows of six each twenty-four is a common multiple of two three four six eight and twelve applications of multiples let us now apply the concept of multiples to some word problems Wade clarinha and Rashmi are racing up the steps of their house starting from the fourth step

,factors miss Rita Brenna's maths teacher is playing another game with her students to teach them the concept of factors miss Rita calls a student and tells him to think of a multiplication table in which 12 appears as the product she asks him to pick up those many yellow balls the student picks up two yellow balls she repeats the exercise with four more students two three four six and twelve are the factors of 12 basics of factors factors of a number are those numbers that divide the original number without leaving a remainder in order to understand factors better let us now look at facts or factors common factors factor trees applications of factors let us learn them one by one in detail facts or factors let us now look at some interesting facts about factors Brina gifts her mother a bunch of 10 red roses on her 
,birthday Brenna's mother arranges them all in a single flower wasps we can express this arrangement as 10 multiplied by one is equal to 10 Brenna's mother tries out 
,a different arrangement she places the roses one each in 10 verses we can express this arrangement as 1 multiplied by 10 is equal to 10 1 and 10 are factors of 10 1 
,is a factor of every number every number is a factor of itself Brenna's mother tries out another arrangement she places the roses to each in 5 verses we can express 
,this arrangement as 2 multiplied by 5 is equal to 10 Brenna's mother tries out one more arrangement she places five roses each in two verses we can express this arrangement as five multiplied by 2 that is equal to 10 2 and 5 are also factors of 10 as there are no more arrangements possible it is clear that 1 2 5 and 10 are the only 4 factors of 10 therefore we can say that factors of a number are finite a number is the greatest factor of itself common factors Brenna's grandfather gives prena five rupees for ice cream she rushes to the ice cream parlor and buys her favorite orange bar for five rupees we can express it as one multiplied by 5 is equal to 
,five a week later he gives prena ten rupees this time she buys two orange bars we can express it as 2 multiplied by 5 that is equal to 10 next week he gives her 15 rupees she decides to buy 3 orange bars we can express it as 3 multiplied by 5 is equal to 15 it is clear that 5 is a factor of 5 10 and 15 such factors are known as

N-Y0Kvcnw8g,"Hi and Welcome to Math Antics. In the last video we learned how easy it is to add and subtract fractions that have the same bottom number. We call those ‘like’ fractions. But often you’ll be asked to add or subtract fractions that have different bottom numbers, or ‘unlike’ fractions. And we learned that the only way we can do that is to change our fractions so that they DO have the same bottom number. Alright then… how do we do that? How can we change two ‘unlike’ fractions into two ‘like’ "
,"fractions? How do we get our fractions to have a ‘common denominator’? The answer is, we need to use equivalent fractions! You remember what equivalent fractions are, right? They’re fractions that have the same value, but use different top and bottom numbers: like 1 over 2 and 2 over 4. They both represent one half, but with different numbers. Well, whenever we have two unlike fractions that we need to add, if we could find equivalent fractions to use instead, AND if those new equivalent fractions had the SAME bottom numbers as each other, then we’d be all set. We’d have two ‘like’ fractions and we could add them using our procedure. Okay, but how do we find equivalent fractions that have a common denominator (or the same bottom number)? Well, there’s two main ways of doing it. In this video, we’re only gonna learn the first way of doing it, and I like to call this way ‘finding the easiest common denominator’. In the next video, we’ll talk about another method that some of you may have already heard about. It’s called ‘finding the least common denominator.’ Okay, so how does this ‘easiest common denominator method’ work? Well, even though this is an easy method, it might sound a little complicated at first. But don’t worry.  It’ll make a lot more sense once you’ve seen a few examples. In this method, the common denominator is always going to be the product of the bottom numbers. In other words, it will be number you’d get if you multiplied the bottom numbers together. Basically, all we’re going to do is take the two different bottom numbers, and make two different ‘whole fractions’ using them. Then, we’re going to move the ‘whole fraction’ to the opposite sides and multiply them by our ‘unlike’ fractions. Doing this will give us two new equivalent fractions that will have the same bottom number. Then we can add or subtract them easily. Okay, let’s try a couple examples so we can see this method in action. Let’s add the fractions 2 over 5 and 1 over 3. These are NOT like fractions because they have different bottom numbers, so we’re going to change them. And the common denominator we will uses is the product "
,"of the bottom numbers: 5 × 3 = 15. We change them by multiplying each fraction by a ‘whole fraction’. The first ‘whole fraction’ is going to be 3 over 3, because 3 is the second fraction’s denominator, and the second ‘whole fraction’ is going to be 5 over 5 because 5 is the first fraction’s denominator. Next, we multiply starting with our first fraction. On the top: 3 × 2 = 6 And on the bottom: 3 × 5 = 15. So our first fraction has become 6 over 15. Now for the second fraction… On the top: "
,"1 × 5 = 5 And on the bottom: 3 × 5 = 15. So our second fraction has become 5 over 15. Now we just add them using our procedure for adding ‘like’ fractions.  We add the top numbers:  6 + 5 = 11. And then we keep the same bottom number, which is 15. So that means the answer to 2 over 5, plus 1 over 3, is 11 over 15. That’s pretty "
,"easy, huh?  Alright, let’s see one more example of this method. Let’s add the fractions 7 over 8 and 3 over 10. Our common denominator for this problem is going to be 80, because that’s what we get when we multiply the denominators together: 8 × 10 = 80. We’ll multiply our 7 over 8 by the ‘whole fraction’ 10 over 10. And we’ll multiply our 3 over 10 by the ‘whole fraction’ 8 over 8. Then, when we do our multiplication, the 8 times 10 will give us 80 on the bottom of both fractions. For the "
,"top of the first fraction we have: 7 × 10 = 70. And the top of the second fraction we have: 3 × 8 = 24. Now that we have ‘like’ fractions, we can just add the top numbers:  70 + 24 = 94. And keep the bottom number the same: 80 So… 7 over 8, plus 3 over 10, equals 94 over 80. Some of you see that this answer could be simplified. "
,"Be sure to check out our videos on Mixed Numbers and Simplifying Fractions to see how you could do that for your final answer. Alright, that’s the first way you can "
,"find the common denominator and change your ‘unlike’ fractions into ‘like’ fractions so you can add or subtract them easily. Remember, practice is really important in math, so be sure to do the exercises for this section so you really get the hang of it. After that, check out the next video and I’ll show you how to use a different method to find what we call the Least Common Denominator. Thanks for watching and I’ll see you next time.

WEdMdZI8CLM,hello children today of elisany's factors and multiples listen we will firstly learn about factors what are these factors Shirin see when we write a whole number as 
,a productive mother two whole numbers then these two whole these two numbers are called the factors of this original whole number okay here I have written this 20 as a product of 1 and 21 times 20 is 20 no so this one and 20 are factors of 20 again I have written this number as a product of another two numbers two times ten so these two are factors of this this 20 so remember that if we can write any whole number as a product of another two numbers so those numbers are all the factors of the original number now children we will learn how to find the factors of a number right see the first example number is 4 we are going to find all the factors of 4 right see you should start from 1 every time we are going to write as a product this number should should be written as a product of two numbers ok so every time you must start with 1 1 times what 1 times 4 then after 1 what is the next number to 2 times can be right for yes 2 times 2 then again can be write any no 3 times there is no then 4 times again same thing is coming up so we can start from here so writing this is not enough you must write the factors of 4 separately okay this is the way that we find the factors and we should write the factor separately see what are the factors of 4 1 2 & 4 don't repeat the same number okay next step we will start from 1 1 times 10 2 times 5 if you want you can write any question apus likewise you can write then 3 times no four times No again it's coming five times right five times - is there but we know that both are same so stop from here otherwise on tire chain you may find the factors no need if the same thing is repeated you can stop from there okay and this is the other way that we should stop when the same number is they are the same TRADOC we can stop from there no need to consider three times four times likewise so what are the factors of ten one two five and ten next seven we know that only by one time seven we can obtain seven there are no any other 
,multiples you can obtain seven two times three times four times no so what are the factors of seven one and seven next 15 we will start with one one times 52 times yes it is there because the last digit is 0 this is an even number so multiple of two 2 times 25 three times no ok recall the multiplication table four times no five 
,times here as it is coming five times ten right then six times no seven times no seven eight nine times no again ten times it is coming ten times five we know that the same thing now same thing is repeated so stop from there no need to consider the other numbers after that so what are the factors of 50 1 2 5 10 25 and 50 next 31 we know that 1 times 31 is there 2 times no 3 times 4 times 5 times as we know 31 is not there in the multiplication table ever many times no we cannot see that so 
,1 and 31 only are the factors of 31 next 45 if you try and recall the multiplication table with the help of that you can may find the factors of a number here 1 times 45 then 2 times no because of the last digit right 3 times 3 times 15 4 times five times nine six times no seven times no eight times no 9 times again five is coming so stop from here this is the place where you should start after this no need to consider the other numbers so what are the factors of 45 1 3 5 9 15 and 45 it's not compulsory of writing in an order you can write whatever that you want here 21 1 times 21 2 times no three times seven four times no six times not five times no six times no then 7 times same thing so stop from here not compulsory of writing this so what are the factors 721 this one 3 7 21 next 18 one times 18 2 times 9 3 times 6 4 times no 5 times no 6 times is same thing so what are the factors of 18 these are the factors of 18 okay so we will get the example aid we are going to find the factors of 8 here firstly we can divide that means not by all the numbers okay if you are given a question like this find 3 factors of 8 find 3 factors of 32 likewise if you are asked you can use this method also get the number divided by few numbers and see whether a remained is coming or not if the remaining is 0 that means that number is a factor 1 is a factor see I have divided it by 1 so according to usual division method when we divide a one time say it is it 0 is the remainder so 
,answer is H no answer he said with remainder 0 that means 1 is a factor next it can be divided by 2 boy is the answer with 0 remainder that means 2 is also a factor 
,next I haven't written the answers here so we will divide we will divide 8 by 3 3 times 2 we 6 and 2 is remaining here 2 is the answer with remainder 2 that means 3 
,is not a factor of 8 then then the next one is for 8 we will divide by 4 4 times 2 is 8 0 remainder answer is 2 with 0 remainder that means 4 is also factor likewise I have divided and shown you some answers 5 is not a factor because there is a remainder 6 is also not a factor because there is a remainder 7 is also not now in the last run 0 is the remainder that means this is also a factor using this method also you can find the factors see the fraction I have given you is 3 a factor of 90 
,if you are given such a question the method I taught you that means this you division method can be useful here okay see we need to check whether this only this number is a factor of the given one so we will divide and say you know that when we divide this number by 3 if there are is a remainder coming that missed is not effective if there is no remainder that means if the if there zero remainder is they are three is a factor right at that time easily you can use this method instead of the 
,previous first method so ninety we will divide by three three times three is nine zero will come now I'm bringing this number down inside zero no trees here with me 
,again multiply 0 will be the remainder right so according to me accordingly we know that zero remained is there so three is a factor of ninety why is that the remainder when we divide by three the remainder is zero next again we will check whether 4 is a factor of 5151 we will divide by four 4 times 1 is 4 1 means remaining bring this one down four times two is eight when we subtract 3 will come they are is a remainder coming that means four is not a factor four is not a factor of 51 why is that they are recently made the coming for sure so children for such type of creatures you can use this division method easily and remember that if you are given a 
,question to find all the factors of a number then the first method can be used okay now children our next part is multiples right no earlier we learnt about factors 
,no factors are totally different than the multiples multiples may simply you remember like this with the help of multiplication table we write multiples okay see when we talk about multiples of two what are the multiples of 2 2 4 6 8 10 all these are multiple software amo that's why I kept three dots here so we can see all these numbers can be divided by two without any remainder so remember that without any remainder if we can divide all these numbers they are multiples of the relevant one so simply simply you you can get all these with the help of the multiplication table remember that multiples can be obtained with the help of the multiplication table next multiples of three we know that 3 6 9 12 15 and so on these are the multiples of 3 very easy next multiples are 5 5 10 15 20 see these are the examples ok next one now it is a special thing here five multiples of two greater than 10 we are going to write only five multiples 5 only we are writing multiples of what multiples of 2 which are greater than 10 greater than 10 means can we write 2 4 6 8 and 10 10 even we cannot write the numbers which are bigger than 10 only we can run and 
,they should be multiples of 2 after 10 what is the next multiple of 2 to elaborate 12 is the first multiple 14 16 18 20 here we wrote five multiples of 2 greater than 10 next multiples of 3 multiples of 3 we are going to write you know 3 6 9 12 15 those are the multiples after you know but here we need to write between 6 and 20 
,between 6 and 20 whenever you see between and words we cannot take the boundary numbers as the solutions here we can see the first number 6 is a multiple of 3 but can we write it as an answer no remember when between and circa me we cannot write the boundary answers as the solutions here so six can be written twenty even can't be written there because they are in a boundary but it is not a multiple of three what are the others nine twelve fifteen eighteen only this much right we cannot write twenty-one we are given a boundary here next all the multiples of six is all the multiples all the multiples of five from five to twenty five when you'll see from 
,men too if the boundary answers can be written as the answer of course we should write okay we know that five entry if you are given four can we start from four here this is not a multiple of five right if it is an answer only if it is a solution only we can include to dance multiples of right from five to twenty five over five 
,ten fifteen twenty twenty-five so remember that whenever you see between and words we don't include the boundary answers though they are solutions or not we don't include them but when you see from two the boundaries should be included if they are solutions only just imagine we need to write the multiples of five but these two are not multiples of five just think four and twenty three other so we cannot write them as the solutions okay so this this is how we obtain multiples now the next part is divisibility under this children we will learn the divisibility by two by five and by 10 we will check whether a given number is divisible by two divisible by 
,five or nearby chain how do we identify the numbers which are divisible by two without any remainder the number is divisible by two how do we identify by the last digit okay we identify them by the last digit the last digit should be zero two four six or eight that means if the last digit is divisible by two the whole number is 
,divisible by two okay so here I have given you a few examples see every time the last digit is one of these fine si si and when we consider the divisibility by five 
,the last vid I have written here some multiples of five here all these numbers are divisible by five right observe the last digit five or zero every time it is five 
,was zero so remember that if a number is the how do we identify a number with a number is divisible by five the last digit is five all zero only that number is divisible by five then the next one is divisibility by ten say I have written some articles often and we know that all these are divisible by 10 without a remainder say the last digit it is every time zero so remember if the last digit is 0 the whole number is divisible by chain okay what are the three things we need to remember if the last digit is an even number or is if the last digit is divisible by two the whole number is divisible by two if the last digit is five or zero that number is divisible by five if the last digit is 0 the whole numbers divisible by 10 and children being the observe piece we can see there are some numbers in all the categories 
,here see 30 see there are some numbers which are you see there by 2 5 10 all and say that all the multiples of 10 all the numbers which are divisible by thing surely divisible by 5 into wall so these are the special things we can catch from here okay see all the multi all all the numbers which are divisible by 10 that means multiples of chain are divisible by 5 and to also write remember that you you

41eVMYPCWTQ,today let us learn prime and composite numbers before we begin let us understand what do we mean by natural numbers the set of numbers 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and so on are 
,called natural numbers natural numbers can be divided into prime numbers and composite numbers before we proceed ahead remember that any given number will always have one and itself as its factors now let us start with prime numbers look at the examples the factors of 3 are 1 and 3 the factors of 11 are 1 and 11 the factors of 17 are 1 and 17 all these numbers have only two factors one and the number itself such numbers are called prime numbers thus prime numbers are natural numbers that have only two factors one and the number itself composite numbers look at the examples the factors of 6 are 1 2 3 & 6 the factors of 14 are 1 2 7 and 14 the factors of 20 are 1 2 5 10 and 20 all the above numbers have more than two factors these numbers are called composite numbers thus composite numbers are natural numbers that have more than two factors remember these points one is neither prime nor composite as it has only one factor two is the smallest and the only even prime number three is the smallest odd prime number now why don't you list all the prime and composite numbers from 1 to 100
,
qc8LHRMs6FQ,today we will learn about factors first let us understand what we mean by the factor of a number let us take the number 12 to begin with let us find out the pairs of numbers that give 12 as their product 1 into 12 is equal to 12 2 into 6 is equal to 12 3 into 4 is equal to 12 so we get 3 pairs of numbers that give us the product 12 no other pair of numbers when multiplied will give the product 12 now let us take each pair of number separately and understand what it means let us take the first pair 1 into 12 is equal to 12 here when we divide 12 by 1 we get the quotient as 12 and when we divide 12 by 12 we get the quotient as 1 in both the cases the remainder is 0 thus it means that 12 is divisible by 1 and 12 pair to 2 into 6 is equal to 12 here when we divide 12 by 2 we get the quotient as 6 and if we divide 12 by 6 we get the quotient as 2 in both the cases the remainder is 0 thus it means that 12 is divisible by 2 and 6 pair 3 3 into 4 is equal to 12 here if we divide 12 by 3 we get the quotient as 4 and if we divide 12 by 4 we get the quotient as 3 here also we get the remainder as 0 in both the divisions thus it means that 12 is divisible by 3 and 4 thus we now understand that 12 is divisible by 1 2 3 4 6 and 12 hence we see that the numbers 1 2 3 4 6 and 12 are the factors of 12 hence we can define factor of a number as a number which exactly divides the given number or we can see that factors are numbers you can multiply together to get given number now 
,let us look at certain points which we need to understand related to a factor with the help of some examples point 1 1 is a factor of every number look at the examples 1 into 6 is equal to 6 8 divided by 1 is equal to 8 thus 1 multiplied by any number gives the number itself as the product and any number divided by 1 also gives 
,the number itself as the quotient hence we conclude that 1 is a factor of every number point to every number is a factor of itself we know that 6 into 1 is equal to 
,6 8 divided by 8 is equal to 1 thus any number multiplied by 1 gives the number itself as the product and any number divided by itself gives 1 as the quotient hence 
,every number is a factor of itself 3 the factor of a number is always less than or equal to the number look at the factors of 12 which we found out earlier they are 
,1 2 3 4 6 and 12 note that the factors 1 2 3 4 & 6 are less than 12 and the last factor 12 is equal to 12 thus it shows that the factor of a number is always less than or equal to the number for every number except one has at least two factors one and the number itself let us look at the factors of 7d are one and seven no other 
,pair of numbers when multiplied together will give the product seven that is the number seven has at least two factors one and seven that is number one and the number seven itself hence we can see that every number except one has at least two factors one and the number itself do remember these points properly they will help you 
,to find the factors as we go further now let us find the factors of one more number let us take the number 30 the pairs of numbers which give the product 30 are 1 into 30 is equal to 30 2 into 15 is equal to 33 into 10 is equal to 30 5 into 6 is equal to 30 thus the factors of 30 are 1 2 3 5 6 10 15 and 30 now look at these factors and remember these points 1 a factor of a number exactly divides that number to one is a factor of every number three every number is a factor of itself for the 
,factor of a number is always less than or equal to the number five every number except one has at least two factors one and the number itself wasn't it easy to learn about factors why don't you try to find the factors of some numbers yourself

fjdeo6anRY4,in this video we're gonna talk about how to find the LCM and the HCF of two or three numbers let's start with the Alsea so these three letters stand for the least common multiple let's say if we want to find the least common multiple of two numbers we'll keep it simple two and three what is the LCM of two and three well let's write out the multiples of two multiples of two are 2 4 6 8 10 12 and so forth multiples of 3 are 3 6 9 12 15 18 and so forth you just have to keep adding 3 now looking at these two lists of numbers which one contains a common multiple 6 is a common multiple of 2 and 3 and 12 is also a common multiple now which of these represents the least common multiple 6 is going to be the least common multiple is less than 12 so the LCM of 2 & 3 is 6 now let's try another example how can we find the LCM 
,of these two numbers 3 & 4 if you want to try this example feel free to pause the video and see if you can get the answer so go ahead and work on it now let's find out the multiples of 3 so we have 3 3 plus 3 is 6 6 plus 3 is 9 9 plus 3 is 12 12 plus 3 is 15 and then 18 4 plus 4 is 8 8 plus 4 is 12 12 plus 4 16 and just keep adding 4 so we could see that 12 is the least common multiple of 3 & 4 an example with larger numbers what is the LCM of 12 and 16 go ahead and try that so common multiples of I mean multiples of 12 rather are 12 24 36 48 60 72 multiples of 16 are 32 48 64 and 80 so the least common multiple of 12 and 16 we could see is 48 48 is the lowest number that is divisible by 12 and by 16 48 divided by 12 is 4 and if you divided by 16 you'll get 3 so the LCM is 48 now let's try an example where we have three numbers let's say 2 3 & 4 what is the LCM of those 3 numbers let's write out the multiples of 2 so we have 4 6 8 10 12 14 multiples of 3 are 6 and 9 12 15 18 
,and then for 4 we have 8 12 16 20 and 24 so looking at these three lists what is the LCM of 2 3 & 4 what is the least common multiple of these numbers so we can see 
,that 12 is the lowest number that is found in each list so the LCM of 2 3 & 4 is 12 now the next thing we're going to talk about is how to find the HCF the HTF stands for the highest common factor this is the same as the GCF which is known as the greatest common factor so let's start with a simple example let's use 12 and 16 so 
,what is the HCF of 12 and 16 so let's write out the factors of 12 numbers that can go into 12 are 1 2 3 4 6 and 12 now the factors of 16 are 1 2 4 8 and 16 so 16 is 
,divisible by all of those numbers now what is the highest number that is found in both lists the highest factor found in each list is 4 so the HCF of 12 and 16 is 4 
,now let's try another example what is the HGF of these two numbers 24 and 30 go ahead and work on that example so let's write out the factors of 24 so one can go into 24 so you can go into it 3 4 6 8 12 and 24 factors of 30 are 1 2 3 4 doesn't go into 35 does 6 7 8 and 9 they can't go into 30 you can't divide 30 by 7 8 and 9 and get an integer you could divide it by 10 you'll get 3 15 is a factor of 30 and so is 30 so now the highest common factor in these two lists is 6 that is the highest factor that can be found in both lists so that's the HTF for 24 and 30 now let's try three numbers 40 60 and 75 go ahead and find the HTF of those three numbers so 
,let's begin with 40 so we have 1 2 4 can go into 40 five six and seven does it go into 40 a can go into 40 the next number is 10 15 does it go into 40 but you could 
,divide 40 by 20 and 40 itself now factors of 60 this is gonna be a long one it's one two three four five six seven does it go into it the next number is ten and then twelve fifteen twenty thirty and sixty factors of 75 are 1 3 5 15 25 and 75 so the highest common factor for these three lists is 5 so that's the HTF for 40 60 and

pcluEJNUNao,"introduction you are at an ATM Center with your father you see a message on the screen that says this machine disperses money in multiples of 1000 you ask your father what the message means he says it means that he can either withdraw 1,000 or 2,000 or 3,000 but not 1,500 2700 or 3,800 you return home confused you're also curious to know more about multiples in this lesson you will learn about factors and multiples in detail objectives at the end of this lesson you'll be able to define factors and multiples list some interesting facts about factors and multiples define perfect numbers define co-prime numbers understand highest common factor HCF understand least common multiple LCM define even and odd numbers define Co prime numbers a factor of a number is an exact divisor of that number in other words the factor of a number divides the number exactly for example numbers 1 2 5 and 10 are all exact divisors of 10 therefore 1 2 5 and 10 a factors of 10 similarly 1 2 4 & 8 are exact divisors of 8 therefore 1 2 4 & 8 a factors of 8 you can see that factors are always smaller than or equal to the number itself number ten is the product of two "
,and five it is also a product of one and ten therefore ten is a multiple of one to five and ten similarly number eight is a product of one and eight or two and four 
,therefore eight is a multiple of one two four and eight thus we can say that a number is a multiple of each of its factors multiples are always greater than or at least equal to the number itself let us revise factors and multiples with the help of an interesting activity one collect some wooden strips each five units long to join them and to end as shown in the figure it is clear from the figure that the numbers 5 10 15 20 and 25 are multiples of 5 each of these numbers is greater than or 
,equal to 5 5 is a factor of 5 10 15 20 and 25 5 is equal to or smaller than each of these numbers a number the sum of whose factors is equal to twice the number itself is a perfect number for example 1 2 3 & 6 a factors of 6 the sum of the factors 1 2 3 & 6 is 12 which is the same as 2 times the number 6 hence 6 is a perfect number similarly the factors of 28 are 1 2 4 7 14 and 28 the sum of the factors is 56 which is the same as 2 times 28 therefore 28 is also a perfect number here are some interesting facts about factors and multiples 1 is a factor of every number every number is a factor of itself the smallest factor of a number is 1 and the largest is the number itself every factor of a number is an exact divisor of that number every factor is less than or equal to the given number they are finite factors of a given number every number is a multiple of itself the smallest multiple of a number is the number itself every multiple of a number is greater than or equal to that number there are infinite multiples of a given number let us take some numbers in pairs and observe their factors look at the numbers 4 and 32 the factors of 4 are 
,1 2 & 4 the practice of 32 are 1 2 4 8 16 and 32 the fact is 1 2 & 4 are common to both 4 & 32 hence they are called common factors consider the numbers 7 & 9 the factors of 7 are 1 & 7 the factors of 9 are 1 3 & 9 1 is the only common factor between 7 & 9 therefore 7 & 9 are co-prime numbers if two numbers have only 1 as the common factor they are called go prime numbers take a look at the multiples of 9 and 27 27:54 81 etc are multiples of both 9 and 27 hence 27:54 8 1 etc are the common 
,multiples of 9 and 27 now that you know what common factors are let us find the highest common factor of two numbers consider two numbers 28 and 32 the factors of 28 are 1 2 4 7 14 and 28 the factors of 32 are 1 2 4 8 16 and 32 the common factors are 1 2 & 4 it is clear that the highest common factor among these number is 4 therefore the highest common factor HCF of two or more given numbers is the highest or greatest of their common factors it is also known as greatest common divisor or GCD she call that common multiples of two numbers are those numbers which are multiples of both the numbers let us now use this knowledge to find the least common multiple of two numbers consider the two numbers 12 and 18 the multiples of 12 are 12 24 36 and so on similarly the multiples of 18 are 18 36 54 72 and so on the common 
,multiples of both the numbers are 36 72 and so on but 36 is the smallest among these therefore 36 is the LCM of 12 and 36 the least common multiple LCM of two or more given numbers is the least or smallest of their common multiples do you observe any pattern in the numbers 2 4 6 8 10 12 and so on you'll find that each of them is a multiple of 2 the numbers which are multiple of 2 are known as even numbers the rest of the numbers 1 3 5 7 9 11 and so on are called odd numbers summary let us summarize what we have learned a factor of a number is an exact divisor of that number the largest factor of a number is the number itself every factor of a number is less than or equal to the number itself the smallest multiple of a number is the number itself every multiple of a number is greater than or equal to that number if two numbers have only one as a common factor they are known as Co prime numbers if the sum of the factors of a number is equal to twice the number itself such a number is called a perfect number the highest common factor at CF of two or more given numbers is the highest of their common factors the least common multiple LCM of two or more given numbers is the lowest of their common multiples

2EvRYHbNsEA,hi I'm Tiffany today I'm going to show you how to solve for factors and multiples factors and multiples when dealing with factors and multiples there's some things that you could keep in mind that will help you remember how to differentiate the two I know that a lot of students forget which is a factor and which is a multiple so here's a little trick that I put together that I always taught my students to help me remember factors fall okay if somebody were to tell you that something is falling does that make you think of something getting bigger or smaller I would think that it would make you think that something's getting smaller if you had to deal with um you know the size of something which I know that the word fall isn't exactly meaning smaller but it it seems closer to fit a number getting smaller so I use factors fall as a reminder to say that the numbers are smaller than the original number the factors are smaller than the original number multiples are more I use that 
,to explain that multiples are always more than the original number so if you remember factors fall and multiples are more that may help you remember how to differentiate between the two let's jump into example number one so I can show you how I write factors and multiples of a number example number one we have the number 20 when writing factors I usually say you want to start with the first counting number when I said counting number I mean the number that you learn to count with you don't 
,learn to count with zero a mom doesn't tell her baby hey let's count 0 1 2 3 no you don't start the count like that when you learn to count you start with 1 you say 
,ok let's learn our numbers let's count 1 2 3 ok so we're start with the counting numbers so that means you're just going to go in order and every number that can evenly go into whatever number we're talking about which in this case is 20 we're going to write it down and then we're going to write a multiplication sign then we're 
,going to write the number that you would multiply by to get 24 example the first counting number is 1 1 times what would give you 20 and the answer to that is 20 now directly underneath our 1 I always write the next counting number only if it applies only if I can find a number that I can multiply it by to get the original number so after 1 the next counting number that a mom would teach your baby so we've got one there we go to to the next County number can two times something give me 20 yeah so I'm going to write it two times what 2 times 10 2 times 10 gives me 20 now after to the next counting number is three can three times anything give me 20 no it cannot okay so you do not write 3 down you go on to the next counting number we have 4 can 4 times anything give me 20 yes 4 times 5 so you write it down now I already know that I have listed all of my factors here how do I know because the next number after 4 would be 5 but we already have 5 all of the numbers that are on the outside are my factors my 1 my two my for my 5 my 10 and my 20 these are all factors of 20 when you're going down your counting numbers you automatically end up listing the higher numbers that are also factors so 20 10 and 5 are all factors of 20 I like to call this my horseshoe shape I like to refer to this as a horseshoe shape because if I wanted to list my factors out in order from least to greatest I would go in a horseshoe shape from left to right and that would give me all my factors for 20 in order from least to greatest so I'll do that actually 20 I like to draw : 1 we have 2 we have 4 5 is next then 10 then 20 so the factors of 20 are 1 2 4 5 10 and 20 so let's recap here we started with our counting numbers we listed them and the number that you could multiply by to get your original number we know when to stop when the next number in our counting number sequence is already listed on the right side so after 4 we would have gone with 5 but guess what we didn't need 
,to write 5 down because it was already listed that means we're done I'll tell you something sometimes at the bottom your numbers will be double for example if we had the number 100 at some point you would get 2 10 times 10 when your numbers are double that also means it's time to stop and you have listed all your numbers as long as you didn't skip a counting number that went into it so the factors of 20 are 1 2 4 5 10 and 20 okay factors fall so all of these numbers except for 20 itself which that's fine because it's itself our smaller factors fall so fall makes me think smaller 2 is smaller than 24 smaller than 25 10 they're smaller than 20 I also add that the number 1 is always always always a factor of any number 1 times any number is always going to get you at number so your first factor should always be 1 times whatever number you're talking about okay draw a line here if I wanted to list the multiples of 20 what would I do I also like to start with a 20 and a colon here to start my multiples as well and I always start with itself so I'm going to start with 20 now to list my multiples all I do is add the number to the last number that I left off with in the beginning here I start with 20 so I'm going to add 20 to itself and I get 40 now remember we're adding our original number to whatever number we left off with so we just ended up with 40 I'm going to add another 20 to that and I get 60 add another 20 to 60 and I get an 80 add another 20 to that and I get 100 guess what I'm going to go ahead and stop here I've listed my first five multiples of 20 and the reason I'm going to stop here is because I have to stop someplace but because numbers never end you could literally do this all day long there is no stopping point multiples go on forever I could always add 20 to any number that I have so no matter how big my number is I can always just add 20 to it and another 20 and another 20 and 21 and they would go on forever so we don't do that typically if you're finding the multiples um to a number that's given in your math book on our worksheet the directions will say list the first five multiples or the look first six multiples or the first 10 multiples they are going to give you a stopping point because multiples go on forever so just for clarification I will write factors multiples and again our multiples are more than the number so 20 40 60 80 100 these numbers are larger than 20 except for the 20 it is equal to it let's move on to example number two example number two we have the number 24 so let's start off by listing our factors first if you remember with our last example we start with our counting numbers when it's time to list the factors so the first counting number is 1 and really anytime we're listing factors 1 times whatever your number is is 
,always always always going to be a factor no matter what because remember any number times 1 is always itself so that's always going to be a factor the next counting number after 1 is 2 2 can go into 24 evenly it goes into it 12 times so 2 and 12 are also factors of 24 the next counting number after 2 is 3 can 3 go into 24 yes 3 times 8 is 24 the next counting number after 3 is 4 4 can also go into 24 evenly it can go into it 6 times so 4 & 6 are also factors of 24 the next counting number 
,is 5 5 cannot go into 24 so 5 should not be listed okay the next counting number after 5 is 6 oh look at this 6 is already listed so we do not need to continue and this is the sign let me know that I have listed all of my factors just like before I like to go on a horseshoe around my numbers um this picks up the numbers in order from least to greatest so my factors for 24 are 1 I'm going to my horseshoe shape it's going to be 1 2 3 4 6 8 12 and 24 so it's 1 2 3 4 6 8 12 24 these are the factors of 24 let's move on to the multiples of 24 the multiples of 24 are still pretty easy to calculate you start off with your original number 24 and you just add it to itself so 24 plus 24 is 48 48 plus 24 is 72 72 plus 24 is 96 and so on till 122 144 and remember you just have to stop somewhere when listing the multiples usually your book or your teacher or your worksheet is going to tell you how far to go it'll say list five multiples of the number list eight multiples of number and then you're going to stop because I could always add another 20 for multiples never end so you must stop somewhere factors do in you can collect all of the factors you cannot collect all of the multiples let's move on to example number three example number three I have the number 17 let's list the factors of 17 start with the counting numbers one times 17 guess what that's it the number 17 is prime okay when dealing with prime numbers you are only going to have one factor one set of factors it's going to be 1 times itself that always works but there are no other number combinations that can be multiplied together besides one is 17 to get 17 that means 17 is prime the reason we list here that 17 has no factors or prime means no factors is because one times whatever number is always going to work as a factor so we don't really count one in the numbers as being factors so much because that's always going to be the case we really are looking for numbers that have factors other than that but although 17 is prime it does still have multiples you can always add a number to itself so multiples are never affected because you can always add it to itself so the multiples of 17 would be 17 then you add 17 to that and get 34 add another 17 you get 51 then 68 85 and 102 these are the factors in multiples of 17 let's 
,move on to example number 4 81 let's list the factors we're always going to start with this one times itself that's 1 times 81 2 cannot go into 81 3 can go into 81 the next counting number that goes in is 9 and guess what 9 times 9 goes into 81 whenever you have double numbers like this that means that the number you're dealing 
,with is a perfect square which is really a more advanced topic than we're going to get into for this particular lesson but double numbers like this means that you can stop and you don't need to go on with your counting numbers you have listed all the factors unless you miss something in your initial counting numbers the multiples of 81 or 81 162 243 324 405 486 and so on you would just continue to add 81 as long as you need to as long as your directions want you to example number 5 we have 
,36 the factors of 36 are 1 times 36 2 times 18 3 times 12 4 times 9 6 times 6 oh here's another example of a perfect square we have 6 times 6 that means 36 is a perfect square let's list the multiples of 36 we have 36 72 108 144 180 216 to continue we would just add 36 again example number 6 factors of 50 we have 1 times 50 we also have 2 times 25 I've times 10 and that's it between 5 and 10 none of the counting numbers can go into 50 so none of them get listed 6 cannot go into 50 evenly 7 
,can not 8 can not neither can I so 10 would be your next County number and so it was already listed when you're with your 5 times 10 so you're done multiples of 50 are 50 100 120 200 250 300 and so on so just remember factors fall and multiples are more the factors of 50 these numbers are all smaller than 50 and multiples these 
,numbers are all larger than 50 that's my biggest tip to you to help you make sure you do not get the two of these mixed up that's my last example thanks for watching if you like this video don't forget to click like then head over to super easy math comm from our math tutorials printable video notes worksheets and more

5xe-6GPR_qQ,Which of the following
,numbers is a factor of 154? So when a number is going
,to be a factor of 154 is if we can divide
,that number into 154 and not have a remainder. Or another way of thinking
,about it-- a number is a factor of 154 if 154 is
,a multiple of that number. So let's look at each of these
,and see which of these we can rule out or say is a factor. So does 3 divide
,"evenly into 154? Or, another way of"
,"thinking about it, is 154 a multiple of 3? Well you'll later learn"
,that you could actually test whether something
,is divisible by 3 by adding up the digits. And if that's divisible
,"by 3, then it's going to be divisible by 3. And so you see"
,"here, 1 plus 5 is 6. 6 plus 4 is 10. 10 is not divisible by 3. But if you didn't want"
,to do that little trick-- and we have other
,videos where we go into more detail
,about that trick-- you can actually just
,divide 3 into 154. 3 doesn't go into 1. It does go into 15 five times. 5 times 3 is 15. Subtract. Then we have 0. Then you bring down a 4. 3 goes into 4 one time. 1 
,"times 3 is 3. Subtract, and you"
,have a remainder of 1. So 3 is clearly not a factor of
,"154, so we can rule that out. Now what about 5? Well, any multiple"
,of 5 is either going to have 5 or
,0 in the ones place. You see that if we write 5
,"times 1 is 5, 5 times 2 is 10, 5 times 3 is 15, 5 times 4 is"
,"20, you either have a 5 or a 0 in the ones place. This does not have 5"
,"or a 0 the ones place, so it's not going to"
,be divisible by 5. 5 is not a factor. 154 is not a multiple of 5. Now 6 is interesting. You could do the same thing. You could try to
,divide 6 into 154. But if something
,"is divisible by 6, it's definitely going to"
,be divisible by 3 as well because 6 is divisible by 3. So we can immediately
,rule this one out as well. Because 154 is not
,"divisible by 3, it's also not going"
,to be divisible by 6. And you could try
,it out if you like. And we could make the
,"same argument for 9. If something is divisible by 9,"
,"it's going to be divisible by 3 because 9 is divisible by 3. Well, it's not"
,"divisible by 3, so we're going to rule out 9 as well. So we've ruled out everything. It looks like 14"
,"is our only option, but let's actually verify it. Let's actually"
,divide 14 into 154. 14 doesn't go into 1. It goes into 15
,"exactly one time. 1 times 14 is 14. We subtract. We get 1. Bring down the 4. 14 goes into 14 one time. 1 times 14 is 14. And of course, we"
,have no remainder. So 14 goes into 154
,exactly 11 times. Or 11 times 14 is 154. 154 is a multiple of 14. Let's do one more. Which of the following
,"numbers is a multiple of 14? So now we have 14,"
,and we're trying to think of its multiples. So there's two
,ways of doing this. You could go number by number
,"and try to divide 14 into them, or we could just"
,try to figure out what all of the multiples
,of 14 actually are. So let's try to do that. Let's try to do that
,"second technique. 14 times 1 is 14. You add another 14. 14 times 2 is 28. Add another 14. Let's see, you add 10. You get to 38. Then you add 4 more. You get to 42. Then you add another 14. I haven't seen any of"
,these numbers show up yet. Add another 14 to this. You get to 56-- still
,"not quite there. Add another 14. Let's see, if you"
,"add 4, you get to 60, and you have to add the 10. So then you get to 70. And it looks like we have"
,"found one of these numbers. 70 is a multiple of 14. 14 times 1, 2, 3, 4,"
,5-- 14 times 5 is 70.

PrSf78pnTyE,Oh in today's video we can look at what multiples and factors are if we start with multiples these are basically the times tables of a number so the first five multiples of six are six because that's one times six 12 because that's two times six 18 because that's three times six and so on so the next ones would be 24 and 30 because of this all the move towards of a number will be divisible by that number without any remainder for example 18 divided by 6 is 3 with no remainder so 18 must be 
,a multiple of 6 whereas if we looked at 19 19 over 6 is 3 with a remainder of 1 so it's not to multiple of 6 because it gave a remainder you we can use this rule to 
,check if really big numbers are multiples of a certain number for example if we wanted to check whether 378 and 412 were multiples of 6 all we need to do is divide them both by 6 378 divided by 6 is 63 so because 63 is a whole number 378 must be a multiple of 6 412 divided by six though is sixty eight point six returing which isn't a whole number so 412 can't be a multiple of six another way to think about the multiples of a number is to just keep on adding that same number so to find the multiples of 14 we could just keep adding 14 so yeah 28:42 5670 and so on and all of these numbers that we get would be the multiples of 14 now the best way to understand factors is the start with factor pairs if we had the number 28 then its factor pairs would be the pairs of whole numbers that can be multiplied together to make 28 so 2 times 14 4 times 7 and 1 times 28 and if these six numbers that make up these factors that would be the factors of 28 because they are all whole numbers that can be multiplied by another whole number to make 28 another way to think about the factors of a number are all the numbers that divide into it a whole number of times for example 4 is a factor of 28 because 28 divided by 4 is 7 which is a whole number whereas 5 isn't a factor because 28 divided by 5 is 5 point 6 so 5 doesn't 
,go into it a whole number of times if you want to quickly find all the factors of a number the best thing to do is write how all the factor verse starting with 1 times the number itself so if we want to define all the factors of 48 where it start with 1 times 48 then do 2 times whatever factor is needed to make 48 so 24 and so on with 3 times 16 4 times 12 5 doesn't go in support yet so isn't a factor then we have 6 times 8 7 also isn't a factor and then we get to 8 which we've actually already covered in 6 times 8 so we can stop here and you know there are factors in ascending order are 1 2 3 4 6 8 12 16 24 and 48 so to find all the factors of 50 where to do one time is 52 times 25 3 doesn't go into 54 also doesn't work 5 times 10 6 7 8 & 9 don't work and then we're at 10 which we've already done so the factors are just 1 2 5 10 25 and 50 so to quickly sum everything up if we took a number like 12 it's multiples would be the bigger numbers that it can multiply to like 24 36 
,48 and so on whereas its factors are the numbers it can be divided into like 1 2 3 4 6 and 12 just make sure they remember which one is which because it's really easy to get them a wrong way around in exam and also remember that the number itself counters both a multiple and a factor so 12 is in both of these lists anyway that's everything for this video so hope you enjoyed it and we'll see you next time you

FslcXS-SJ4g,hello children today i'm here to teach you chapter 11 in your textbook that's factors and multiples so in this lesson we are finding factors and multiples of a whole number and we are trying to solve problems related to factors and multiples and examine where the whole number is divisible by 2 5 and 10. look at this one multiples of 2. you already know multiples of 2. so what are the multiples of 2 2 times 1 2 2 times 2 4 2 x 3 6 two times four eight two times five ten two times six twelve 
,two times seven fourteen two times eight sixteen two times nine eighteen 2 times 10 20. write down the last digit of the multiples of 2. so when you look at the last digit i see 0 what else 2 then 4 6 eight these are the last digit of the multiples of two these are even numbers if the last digit is an even number or 0 the number is divisible by 2 without a remainder because these are multiples of 2. so look at the last digit if the last digit is 0 or even number the number is divisible by 2 without a remainder multiples of five five times one five five times two ten five times three fifteen five times four twenty five times five twenty five five times 
,six thirty five times seven thirty-five five times eight forty five times nine forty-five and five times ten 50 now write down the last digit of the multiples of 5 when you look at the last digit you can see either 0 or 5. so if the last digit is 0 or 5 the number is divisible by 5 without a remainder so how we identify the whether a number is divisible by 5 look at the last digit if the last digit is 0 or 5 the number is divisible by 5 without a remainder multiples of 10 10 times 1 10 10 times 2 20. 10 times 3 30 10 times 4 40. 10 times 5 50 10 times 660 ten times seven seventy ten times eight eighty ten times nine ninety and ten times ten hundred look at the last digit zeros so how we find out whether a number is divisible by 10 look at the last digit if the last digit is 0 the number is divisible by 10 without 
,a remainder now underline the numbers that are divisible by 2 without a remainder so how we identify look at the last digit the last digit is 0 or even number the number is divisible by 2. so here this is 4 it's divisible by 2 without a remainder but this is odd number this is again even it's divisible here 0 it's possible and 7 is an odd number it's not divisible 9 also odd number 4 again yes it is an even number and 672 the last digit is an even number underline the numbers that are divisible by 5 without a remainder so if the last digit is 0 or 5 it is divisible so this one this one here this this one here these are the numbers that are divisible by 5 without a remainder 5 or 0 as the last digit underline the numbers that are divisible by 10 without a remainder so that means the last digit should be zero so 240 this number here possible this is possible and you can't take the other two underline the three digit numbers that are divisible by 2 5 and 10 without a remainder so what's the condition this should be an even number if it's divisible by 2 5 means either 0 or 5 but 10 only 0 that means if we want to find out a number that's divisible by 2 5 10 the last digit should be zero so we'll find out what are the numbers with last digit zero this is divisible this is divisible here it's divisible these are okay but other numbers you can't take give the reason that 360 is divisible by 2 5 and 10 without a remainder as 360 is an even number it is divisible by 2 as last digit is 0 it is divisible by 5 or 10. look at this one 10 20 30 40 50 those are multiples of 10 as last digit is 0 is it divisible by 2 yes because it said the last digit is 0 it's divisible by 2 so we say yes is it divisible by 5 yes last digit is 0 0 or 5 it is divisible by 5. is it divisible by 10 yes because the last digit is zero write down 10 multiples of 3 so starting from 3 times 1 three three times two six three times three nine three times four twelve three times five fifteen so three times six eighteen three times 7 21 24 so how many we need another 3 24 3 times so this is 3 times 8 3 times 9 27 3 times 9 27 and 3 times 10 30. so all together 10. now write down 10 multiples of 4 times table 4 times 1 4 4 times 2 8 4 times three twelve four times four sixteen four times five twenty four times six twenty-four four times seven twenty-eight four times eight thirty-two four times 9 36 and 4 times 10 40. write down the common multiples of 3 and 4 look at carefully what are the common numbers so i'll highlight those common terms can you see 12 then what are the other numbers 24 then according to this one that's all write down the lowest common multiple out of these common multiples what is the lowest one that's 12. look at this one write down 12 multiples of 4. so we write it again four 
,times one four times two four times three four times four four times five four times six four times seven four times eight four times nine four times nine and four times ten four times eleven and 4 times 12 so we need 12 multiples write down 10 multiples of 6 6 times 1 6 times 2 six times three six times four six times five six 
,times six six times seven six times eight six times nine and six times ten sixty so we need ten multiples of six write down the common multiples of 4 and 6 by looking at these factors you can write down common one what are the common ones i can see 12. then what's the next one 24 next one 36 and you get forty eight now write down the lowest common multiple out of this the lowest one is 12 now what are factors can we divide 18 mangoes between two three four five six friends without a remainder so we'll figure out eighteen when you divide by two you get nine so it's a whole number so you can divide then divide by 3 so we'll divide by 3 now 18 divided by 
,3 so you get 6 18 divided by 4 can you divide 4 times 4 16 and there's a remainder remainder two eighteen divided by five you get five times three fifteen remainder 
,3 18 divided by 6 you get 6 times 3. so can we divide 18 man goes between two yes three yes but you can't divide it by four can we divide it by five no but we can divide it by six numbers that are divisible without a remainder that's two three and six numbers that are not divisible without a remainder that's four and five if a number divisible by another number without a remainder then the second number is a factor of the first number so here we can say 2 is a factor and 9 is also a factor 
,3 is a factor 6 also a factor 6 is a factor and 3 also a factor now we found out 18 you can divide by 1 that's 80. divide by 2 that's 9. divide by 3 that's 6 divide 
,by 6 you get 3 divide by 9. you get 2 18 divided by 18 also possible you get 1 all are whole numbers without a remainder so those are called factors of 18. so what are the factors starting from 1 then you get 2 it's divisible by 3 is divisible by what are 6 9 and then 18. so we call these are factors of 18. look at carefully you see one and the number itself also a factor look at this number 12 we'll find out what are the factors we know 12 we can write 1 times 12. if you take 2 2 times 6 3 times 4 so 12 can be written as multiplication of two numbers all the whole numbers are called factors of twelve so all these numbers we call factors so what's the 
,lowest one one then two three 4 and what are 6 and 12. those are factors of 12 write down the set of factors of 36 so 36 i can write 1 times 36 36 is again 2 times what you can divide by 2 you get 2 times 18 three times divide by three you get 12 4 times 9 36 and 6 times 6. now what are the factors so you have to write or one two three four what else now six twice is there but we don't write six twice in the set only once so we can write 6 only once and then 9 12 18 and 36 so those are the 
,factors of 36 write down the set of factors of the following numbers factors of one one means one times one so just 1 factors of 2 1 times 2 or 2 times 1. so 1 and 2. factors of 3 1 times three three times one factors of four one two times two and four times one so one two four factors of five one times five and what about factors of six one two times three so 3 is there and 6 times 1 factors of 7 1 times 7 1 and 7 factors of 8 two times four so two four and then eight times one factors of 
,nine what are the factors of nine one three times three we only write once and nine times one factors of ten we can write one then five times two so two times 5 and 
,10 factors of 11 1 times 11 it's 1 and 11. and factors of twelve one times twelve two times six three times four and here two times six and 12 times 1. so these are 
,the factors of all these numbers now when you look at carefully always 1 and the number itself are the factors of any number so look at carefully 11 is there 12 is there 10. so 1 and the number itself is always a factor so what are the factors of 12 so if you can't figure out you can divide also two times six two times three three times one so what are the possible factors one two times six three times four so four is also yeah then six times two and then twelve times one factors of 12 factors of 18. when you divide by 2 you get 9. so 1 2. when you divide by 3 you get 3 times 6 then 3 times 6 then 6 also possible 2 times 9 so 9 is also possible and 18 
,times 1 18. so these are the factors of 80. some numbers have factors one and the number itself only look at these numbers two only one and two three is one and three five is one and five seven one and seven and eleven only 1 and 11 13 also 1 and 13 17 1 and 17 19 1 and 19 23 1 and 23 29 1 and 29 so these numbers we call as prime prime numbers so what are prime numbers the factors are only one and itself only two factors are there what is the number that only has factors of 1 and 31 that's 
,only 31 because 31 is a prime number what is the number that only has factors of 1 and 73 73 is a prime number that's 73. now we'll look at how we can solve problems using factors and multiples price of a pen is 16 rupees find the price of seven such pens so what we do we take the multiples of 7 multiples of 16. so price of 7 pence 16 times 7 so 7 times 6 42 4 remaining and 7 times 1 7 plus 4 11. so 112 rupees so what's the this answer that's the seventh multiple of 16. so 16 32 like that you take the seventh multiple of 16. fill in the blanks one kilo price is given for sugar what about the price for 3 kilos you multiply 115 multiplied by 3 3 times 5 
,15. 1 remaining so 3 times 1 three three plus one four three times one three three hundred and forty five rupees one kilo of flies seventy rupees what about four kilos you multiply 4 times 0 0 4 times 7 28 280 rupees now what about dal 1 kilo is 150 we need two and a half kilos so we can do separately if it's 150 for one kilo what about half a kilo we divide by 250 divided by 2 you get 75 and 2 kilos means you multiply by 2 150 times 2 you get 300. so 300 plus 75 you get 300 375. one kilo of rice is 80 rupees and what about 3 kilos multiplied by 3 3 times 0 0 3 times 8 24. what about this one 117 is 150 what about 3 so 3 times 150 zero three times five fifteen and three times one three plus one four four hundred fifty rupees now how we find out the total just add all these together five plus 5 10 1 remaining 5 5 8 13 13 plus 7 20 25 and 29 two remaining five plus two seven seven plus three ten ten plus four fourteen fourteen plus two sixty so thousand six hundred and ninety rupees is the total cost now this table shows 10 by 10 multiplication 10 by 10. using the table we can write the factors of twelve can you see three times eight three times eight twenty-four again four times six and 24 again six times four and eight times three so it shows some factors of 24 so what are the factors we can write all these numbers so it's 1 times that one not given here the table only shows 10 by 10 so up to 10. so factors of 24 by looking at this table we can see 3 four six eight three four six eight those are the factors we can get it from this table using the previous table show that the ways you get 18 so we'll look at 18 and see where you get 18 here 9 and 2 what else 18 is here eighteen is here and here that's all so two times nine two times nine then three times six six times three and nine times 2 6 times 3 9 times 2. so what are the factors of 18 using that table we get two three six nine two three six nine that's all we can see from that table now we'll look at the exercises and example in your textbook example one find the factors of 20 how we find out the factors of 20 so 20 i can write one times twenty then divide by two two times ten then can we divide by three four four times five five times four is also same six not possible seven not possible 8 9 10 10 times 2 so what 
,are the factors of 20 we can write down 1 2 what else 4 5 10 and 20. so those are the factors of 20 and remember zero is not a factor of a whole num exercise point one fill in the blanks with the appropriate whole numbers four i can write one times four what about two times two so one two and four are the factors of 4 look at 7 
,7 i can write 1 times 7 so what are the factors 1 and 7 this one 8 i can write 1 times 8 2 times 4 so what are the factors 1 2 4 and 8 are the factors of 8 15 one times fifty and i can write three times five so what are the factors here one three five and fifty twenty-four what are the factors one times twenty-four and two times twelve three times eight four times six so what are the factors 1 2 3 4 6 8 12 and 24 when the factors of 18 are written we obtain what are the factors of eighteen 
,one times eighteen two times nine and three times six so one two three six nine eighteen when the factors of forty are written so one times four t two times twenty then four times ten and five times four and eight times five so we can write eight also now look at question number two find the factors of each of the following numbers five five is a prime number so what are the factors one and 5 5 times 1 only 27 we can write 1 1 times 27 so 27 is also a factor so you can divide by 3 3 times 9. so 1 3 9 and then 27 so you can divide and 27 divided by 3 you get 9 divided by 3 you get 3 here so 3 with 9 and 9 with 3 and 27 so those are the factors of 27 17 
,is a prime number so what are the factors of 17 1 and the number itself 17. 22 so 1 is a factor 1 times 22 2 times 11 so you get 1 2 11 and 22 21 you can divide by 1 1 times 21 3 times 7 so that's all and 31 31 is a prime number so 1 and the number itself 31. thirty-two one times thirty-two two times sixteen four times eight then 2 times you get 16 and then 1 times 32 45 you get 1 this is divisible by 3 3 times 15 then 5 times 9 45 so 3 times 15 and then 1 times 45 so those are the factors 
,of 45 50. so what are the factors divide by one you get one times fifty two times twenty five five times ten ten times five and 2 times 25 and 1 times 50. 60 how can we find out factors 1 is always a factor two times thirty three times twenty four four times also possible sixty divide by four get four times one four for twenty that's five so fifty then six five also possible twelve times five then 6 times 10. now we'll write down the other numbers 5 times twelve so six times ten five times 
,twelve four times fifteen and three times twenty what does 3 times 20 and 2 times 30 and then 60. so those are the so those are the factors of 60. now we'll look at 
,example number one what are the factors of 72 that can be found using the above multiplication table so we'll look at the table and see how we get 72 where you get 72 1 is here and another one is here so 72 means 9 times 8 and 8 times 9 so i can write 72 is 9 times 8 or 8 times 9 so that means factors of 72 factors of 72 i can take a ten nine from the table example number two what are the factors of 18 that can be found using the above multiplication table 18 one is here another one is here this one what else this one so what are the possibilities two times nine then three times six 6 times 3 same and 9 times 2 same so from this table what are the factors of 18 i can write factors of 18 that's 2 3 6 9 exercise 11.2 what are the factors of each of the following numbers that can be found using the 10 by 10 multiplication table so we have to refer this table 48 where you get 48 1 2 so two possibilities so what are the factors i can write 6 8 that's all 6 and 8 81 here only one possibility nine times 9 so i can say 9 is a factor 2 this one this one that's all 2 into 1 2 into 1 so 1 and 2 28 this one what else here and that's all so 28 means 
,four and seven seven times four four and seven forty here and you'll get 40 here and here so 10 times 4 and what else 5 times eight so four five eight forty so four 
,five eight and ten so those are the factors of 40 from the table obtain different ways in which 36 can be written as a product of two whole numbers using the 10 times 10 tables and fill in the blanks 36 so we need to find out what are the possibilities we can get 36 check this one nine times four six times six and four times nine so six and six four and nine so nine and four four and nine six and six those are the three possibilities write down in ascending order the factors of 36 which can be obtained from the above products so ascending means smallest to highest so what's the smallest number that's four the next number is six and 9. so those are the 
,factors of 36 obtain different ways in which 9 can be written as a product of two numbers using 10 by 10 multiplication table and fill in the blanks nine one possibility is there so nine times one or one times nine what else nine is here three times three so those are the possibilities another one one times nine nine times 1 so 
,these are the possibilities so what are the factors if you are asking to write down the factors we can write 1 3 9 write down the different ways in which 30 can be written as a product of two whole numbers using 10 by 10 multiplication table thereby write down factors of 30 30 where you get 30 here and here what else so when you look at the table carefully you get three ways so three times ten oh five times six or 3 times 10 or 10 times 3 that's the same thing so what are the factors of 30. of 30 3 5 6 and 10 3 5 6 10. is 4 a factor of 9 explain the reason for your answer so 9 what are the possibilities here here and here so nine you can write three times three and 1 times 9 9 times 1 the same thing so is 4 is there 4 is not there so 4 is not a factor because you can't divide cannot divide by 4 without a remainder so when you divide you get a remainder so that's not a factor example number one find three factors of 30 by using the method of division thirty you can divide by one you get one times thirty thirty divided by two 2 times 50 30 divided by 3 3 times 10. so they're asking only 3 factors so you can write without writing 1 and the 
,number itself will take 2 3 10 so we need only 3 you can write 2 3 10 are factors of 30. example number 2 is 9 a factor of 12 explain the reason for answer so we'll 
,divide and see nine times one we'll do long division 9 times 1 9 and 3 is the remainder you get a remainder there so is 9 a factor of 12 it's not so you can write 9 
,is not a factor factor of 12 because we get a remainder three exercise 11.3 find three factors of each of the following numbers using the method of division 28 i can divide by two you get 40. again 28 i can divide by 4 7. so you need only three factors so i can write 2 4 7 and 14 also possible so i'll write 14 as well 32 32 i can divide by two you get 16. again 32 i can divide by 8 8 times 4 so what are the factors of 32 2 4 8 16 you can write 54 54 divided by 2 2 times 2 4 that's 7. then 20 again 54 divided by 6 6 times 9 54. so what are the factors of 54 i can write 2 6 9 54 27 90 i can divide by 2 that's 45 and i can divide this by 3 3 times 30. so 
,what are the factors 2 3 30 45 90 those are factors i'm only writing 3 21 i can divide by 3 i get 7 what is and 21 i can divide by 1 so 3 one so i can write 1 3 7 21 question number two is 6 a factor of 84 will divide and see 84 divide by 6 6 times 1 6 2 remaining for 24 that's 4 6 times 4 24 and the remainder is 0. so explain the answer by the method of division so we can say 6 is a factor of 84 because the remainder i'll write as remainder is 0. is 5 a factor of 48 explain the reason for 
,your answer so we'll divide and see 48 divided by five five times eight forty five times nine five times nine forty five and three remaining so the remainder is three we can write as remainder is three 5 is not a factor of 48. example number one check whether 14 is a multiple of 2 by dividing 14 by 2 2 times 7 14 and you get the remainder 0. so that means you can say check whether 14 is a multiple of 2 by dividing so 14 i can write two times seven so that's a multiple so you can write multiple of 2 of 2 by 7 is 40. check whether 42 is a multiple of 3 by dividing 42 by 3 3 times 1 3. for 12 that's 14. that's 4 three times four twelve and the remainder is zero so remainder is zero so you can write 42 is three times fourteen so that's the multiple exercise 11.4 write down 5 multiples of 2 which are greater than 10. so what are the multiples two times five ten two times six that's twelve two times seven fourteen two times eight sixteen two times nine eighteen and two times 10 20. so we need to write numbers greater than 10. write down 4 multiples of 3 between 1 and 20. multiples of 3 3 times 1 3 3 times 2 6 3 times 3 9 3 times 4 12. so 1 2 3 4 only 4 multiples write down all the multiples of 4 between 1 and 25 4 times 1 4 4 times 2 8 4 times 3 12 4 x 4 16 4 x 5 20 4 x 6 24 so those are the multiples of 
,4 in between 1 and 25 from the following numbers select and write down the multiples of 3. so multiples of 3 means it should be divisible 60 3 times 20. now we'll check 150 it's not divisible by 3 so we can show that 115 is not divisible 3 times 3 9 for 25 that's 8 24 and the remainder is 1. so it's not divisible 48 it's divisible just check 3 1 3 times 1 3 four eighteen that's six so you can write three times sixteen twenty six you can't divide by three 14 also not divisible by 27 we know 
,that that's three times nine so that's also a multiple of three how many multiples of nine are they are between one and hundred we'll check nine what else nine times two nine times three nine times four nine times five nine times six nine times seven nine times eight nine times nine nine times ten nine times eleven now how many 
,are there one two three 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 multiples are there of these numbers which is the greatest multiple of 9 what's the greatest one that's 99 so the greatest 
,multiple is 99 write down three multiples of 18 18 times one eighteen eighteen times two two times eight sixteen two times one two plus one is thirty six then multiply by three three times 8 24 2 remaining 3 times 1 3 plus 2 that's 5 54. what is the largest multiple of 9 which is less than 150 so we'll divide and see 150 divide 
,by 9 and see what's the number 9 times one nine so you get six for sixty nine times nine times six 54. that's the remainder is 6. so 9 times 16 is what that's the largest number you can get so 16 times 9 you get 9 times 6 54 5 remaining 9 times 1 9 plus 5 14. so 144 is the largest possible value now 9 times 654 9 times 1 9 plus 
,5. 14 so 144 is the largest multiple of nine write down five multiples of each of the following numbers four times one four times two four times three four times four four times five so we need five only thirteen times one thirteen times two thirteen times three thirteen times four four times three twelve four times one four plus one five then five five times three fifteen one remaining five times one five plus one six so those are the five fifteen fifteen times one fifteen times 2 30 15 times 3 45 you can add 15 to that 45 plus 15 or 4 times 15 that's 60 then 6 times 15 2 3 4 5 we'll do 5 first 5 times 5 25 2 remaining 5 times 1 5 plus 2 7. so 1 2 3 4 5 eighteen eighteen times one eighteen eighteen times two thirty six eighteen times three three times eight twenty-four three times one three three plus two five fifty-four then four four times eighteen thirty-two four times one four plus three seven one two three four we need another more one more five times eight forty five times one five plus four nine so ninety twenty twenty times one twenty times two twenty times three twenty times four 20 times 5 so add 20 to each number question number 9 fill in the blanks any multiple of 10 is necessarily a multiple of because last digit is 0 that means divisible by 2 and 10 means it's divisible by 5 as well 11 times 7 is 77 so therefore 77 is a multiple of 11 and of 7 7 times 11 or 11 times seven write down two numbers which are multiples of both three and four three times four twelve four times three twelve then multiples any multiple is possible so you can write 24 write down a number which is a multiple of 2 3 4. so you can take 
,12 or 24 so 12 is divisible by 2 so that means 2 times 6 three times four four times three so you can write 12 or 24 any number example number one there are 30 apples in a bag they are separated into bags such that each bag has an equal number of apples find out the number of apples in a bag and the number of bags in each instance the total number of apples is obtained by product of the number of apples in the bag and the number of bags hence we find out the number of bags and the number of apples in each bag by considering the products of two factors of thirty so one times thirty two times fifteen three times ten and five times six six times five ten 
,times three fifteen times two and 30 times 1. so accordingly there are 8 ways of grouping 30 uppers in the back containing the same number of apples 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8. bags with one apple in a bag and bags with two wrappers in a bag bags with three apples in a bag and bags with 6 10 15 30. so if there are bags with one apple how many bags are there so you get 30 bags 2 apples in a bag 2 times 15 you can make 15 bags and 3 apples in a bag you can make ten bags out of that and five times six so you get six bags six times five so five backs and ten ten times three so three bags you can create with three apples in each 50 apples in a bag you can take two bags and if there are 30 apples inside it only you can get one back exercise 11.5 the price of a ballpoint pen is 12 rupees find the price of eight such pens is it a multiple of eight and twelve so we'll check so price of one pens is 12 rupees and price of 8 pens 8 times 12 8 times 2 16 and 8 times 1 8 plus 1 9 so 96 rupees so is it a multiple of 8 and 12 yes it's a multiple of 8 and 12 so 8 times 12 is 96 or 12 times 8 is 96 so yes a multiple of 8 10 12. question number two a water pump takes a day to fill a household tank of capacity 75 gallons what is the number of times and the total volume of water it can fill during a week so each day a day 75 gallons so you can write one day 75 then week means how many days you get seven days for a week so multiply it by seven so what's the answer 7 times 5 35 3 remaining 7 times 7 49 plus 3 52 so 525 gallons now it says just to find out the wallet what is the number of times and the total volume of water it can fill during a week question number three the prize offer rambutan is six rupees five children bought two three four five and six rambutans respectively find the amount each student spent one 
,rambutan is six rupees and five children bought two three four five like that so two rambutan multiplied by two twelve rupees three rumble time six times three eighteen rupees four rambutans six times four 24 rupees and five rambutan six times five thirty rupees and six rambutans six times six 36 rupees so these are the values each child's pen find the amount each student spends so there is 6 12 18 24 30 and 36 rupees question number four a parcel containing the following items needs to be 
,given to each student who participated in a certain event find how much it will cost to give 50 students a parcel each there are three gingerly rolls talaguli one fish ball two bananas and a packet of milk in each parcel the price of one packet of milk is 30 rupees the price of gingerly roll is five rupees and the price of fish 
,bun is 30 rupees and the price of banana is 10 rupees so we'll check out for each puzzle how much we need to spend so there are three gingerly rows so we'll multiply this by 3 so five times three fifteen rupees then one fish one price of fish one is thirty so thirty times one thirty rupees then 2 bananas 2 bananas means 10 times 2 that's 20 rupees and a packet of milk in each parcel so one packet is 30 so you get 30 rupees now we need to find out the total for all this is one packet five three plus one four four plus three seven seven plus 2 95 rupees per packet so how many students are there 50 students so we need the cost for 50 students total cost is 50 times 95 so what's the total cost we put a 0 and multiply by 5. 5 times 5 25 2 remaining 5 times 9 45 plus 2 47. so we need 4 750 rupees for 50 students question number five separate 50 pupils into groups such that each group has an equal number of pupils what are the numbers which can be taken in each group that means factors so in two groups so you can divide by one 1 times 50. so that means one group you can make with 50 students then it's divisible by 2 2 times 25 two groups with 25 students in each group and this is divisible by 5 5 times 10 5 groups each 10 students then 10 times 5 25 so those are the possibilities and other way round is also possible 10 times 5 10 groups with 5 students each and 25 times 2 that means 25 groups with two students each and other way around 50 times 1 that means 50 groups 
,each with one student so those are the possibilities that we can group exercise 11.6 from the following select and write down the numbers which are divisible by two 
,so what's the condition the last digit should be an even number or zero so 42 64 126 148 250 and this number is possible and here and here so you have to look at the last digit what are the digits that the blank box in this number can be filled with if this number consisting of four digits is divisible by two so last digit should be an even number or zero so it can be zero two six eight those are the possibilities question number three select and write down the numbers which are suitable for the blank boxes to the right of the box containing numbers a number could be included in more than one box numbers which are divisible by two so select even numbers the last digit is even 212 or zero possible 310 256 and 420 860 1236 and 5180 800 because all are even numbers numbers which are divisible by five so look at the last digit either five or zero 105 300 and 125 375 420 860 3200 forty five five thousand one hundred and eighty thousand eight hundred numbers which are divisible by 
,ten that means last digit should be a 0 value 310 and 420 860 five thousand one hundred eighty and thousand eight hundred now look at the same question are there numbers which are common to all three of the boxes on the right in question three above what are these numbers so look at carefully we see all these numbers in this box ah here as well so 310 420 860 5180 000 800 then second part are the numbers in box c essentially in boxes a and b yes what are the numbers that are common to both 
,boxes a and b in question three above a and b what are the numbers common what are the numbers comma what are the numbers common 310 then 400 860 5180 and 1 800 so that means either the last digit is 0 the last digit is 0 only so in question 3 examine whether these numbers are in box c as well accordingly write down the conclusion that you can draw so here we can say what are the numbers that are common to both boxes a and b in question three above so i can write 310 420 860 thousand one hundred and eighty and thousand eight hundred examine whether these numbers are in boxy as well accordingly write down the conclusion that you can draw when the last digit is zero it is divisible by 2 5 10 either 2 5 10 without a remainder so that's the conclusion then we can say divisible by all three numbers 2 5 10. question number five join the points relevant to the numbers which are divisible by two in ascending order then join the points relevant to the small number and the largest number you join so starting from the smallest divisible by 2 so that means even numbers 2 4. then what's the next number six six eight then ten what's the next number we can 12. 14 16 and we can join the largest and the smallest one so this is the shape of a house join the points relevant to the numbers which are divisible by five in ascending order smallest two largest then join the points relevant to the smallest number and the largest number you join so we'll start from 5 then you get 10. then you get 15. and then 20 then 35 35 after that 40 40 then you get around that 75 before 75 you get 65 65 then 75 then 90 105 and then you get 110 110 100 20. and then 135 and 100 then 155 and then you can join the first and the last so this is a fish join the points relevant to the numbers which are divisible by 10 in ascending order then join the points relevant to the smallest number and the largest number you join so multiples of 10 starting from 10 10 20. then 50 50 is the next number and 70 80 90 then 120 and that's the largest and this is the smallest we can chop so this is a boat now we look at the miscellaneous exercise give reasons why 7 is 
,not a factor of 45 we can divide and see when you divide by 7 you get 7 times 6 42 and the remainder is 3 so we can say 7 is not a factor as the remainder is three question number two all the factors of a certain number apart from the number itself are one two three four and six what is this number so what can you say if you take 12 12 is divisible by 2 you get 6 12 is divisible by 3 you get 4 12 is divisible by 6 that's 2 6 times 2 3 times 4 apart from apart from the number itself that means 1 and 12 so what is this number you get 12. the number of marbles in a certain box is a multiple of 6 when this number is rounded off to the nearest multiple of 10 the value obtained is 40. write down the two values that the number of marbles in the box can take so rounded to the nearest multiple of ten so you can when you round it to the nearest ten it can be above this this can be can we take 40 something you can't take 40. 6 46 above 46 or 45 you can't take so what are the numbers you can take you can take 41 42 43 44 up to 44 and below what are the numbers you can get when you round it to nearest 10 you need to get 40 39 is okay 38 37 36 and 35 
,you can't take 34 then that number becomes 30 when you round it to the nearest ten now this is a multiple of six so what are the multiples of six either 36 or 42. so write down the two values that the number of marbles in the box can take 36 or 42. question number four the number of biscuits there are in a certain packet of biscuits is a multiple of 4 which is less than 20 when this number is rounded off to the nearest multiple of 10 the value obtained is 20. how many biscuits are there in 
,the packet so this number is less than 20. so what are the possibilities you can get 19 18 17 16 and 50. but you can't take 40 because when you round 14 to the nearest 10 it becomes 10. so these are the possibilities and this number is a multiple of four only you get 16. you can't take 20 because that's less than 20. so how many biscuits are there in the packet it's 16. now we covered all theory related to factors and multiples a whole number is divisible by each of its factors when a whole number is multiplied by another whole number multiple of the initial number is obtained if the value of the digit in the ones place of a number is divisible by 2 then the number is divisible by 2 that means the last digit the digit in the ones place of a number which is divisible by 5 is either 0 or 5 the digit in the ones place of a number which is divisible by 10 is 0. so remember all these to identify whether any number is divisible by 2 5 and 10.

47KLARvx3uo,welcome to our maths teacher youtube channel today you are going to learn about the first and second lessons of the unit factors and multiples the first lesson identifying factors there are three methods of finding factors the first method finding factors writing as a product of two numbers in this method you will be learned what a factor is here you can see six flowers we can arrange them in different formations the first one one row with six flowers in each row that is one into six in the second formation two rows with three flowers in each row it can be written as two into three in the third formation three rows with two flowers in each row that is 
,three into two fourth formation six rows with one flower in each row that is six into one thus six can be written as a product of two whole numbers in various ways they are 1 into 6 2 into 3 3 into 2 6 into 1 but here you can see that 1 into 6 and 6 into 1 are the same products as well as 2 into 3 and 3 into 2 thus it is enough 
,to write only one product each out of these two products that is 6 equals 1 into 6 and 6 equals 2 into 3. now let's see what the factor is when the whole number is written as a product of two whole numbers these two numbers are known as factors of the original number since 6 equals 1 into 6 1 and 6 are factors of 6 as well as 6 
,equals 2 into 3 so 2 and 3 are factors of six then we can write all the factors of six they are one two three and six there are four factors for six now let's see some examples first one write all the factors of 12 here first you have to write 12 as a product of two whole numbers in different ways 12 equals 1 into 12 as well as 
,12 equals 2 into 6 yet 12 equals 3 into 4 so we can list out all the factors of 12 easily now they are 1 2 3 4 6 and 12. now let's see another example write all the 
,factors of 36 we can write 36 as a product of two whole numbers in many ways they are 1 into 36 2 into 18 3 into 12 4 into 9 6 into 6 then we can list out all the factors of 36 they are 1 2 3 4 6 9 12 18 and 36 there are nine factors for 36 there is an important factor that is zero is not a factor of a whole number i think you have understood the first method bill let's remind it again when finding all the factors of a given whole number we have to write it as a product of two whole numbers and list out the numbers written in those products they are the factors of that number now you are given the homework you have to write answers for the exercise 11.1 in the textbook now let's move to the second lesson finding factors using the multiplication table the second method finding factors using the multiplication table here you can see a 10 to 10 multiplication table let's see some examples first one find the factors of 24 using the multiplication table here you can see that 24 cubes by the product of 3 and 8 in the multiplication table yet 24 gives by the product of 4 and 6. so 24 can be written as 3 into 8 and 4 into 6 there are no more products that can be found in this table hence the factors of 24 that can be identified from the multiplication table is 3 4 6 and 8. now you can understand that we can write only few factors using a 10 to 10 multiplication table but all the factors of a given whole number cannot be written now let's see another example find the factors of 36 using the multiplication table you can say that 36 cubes by the product of 4 and 9 as well as 36 views by the product of 6 and 6 in this multiplication table so 36 can be written 4 into 9 and 6 into 6 hence the factors of 36 that can be identified from the multiplication table is 4 6 and 9. now you are given homework write answers for the exercise 11.2 in the textbook let's meet in the next video listen thank you

0IZyGB1qQmM,today let us revise factors and multiples let us start with factors what do we mean by a factor a factor of a number divides that number exactly let us look at an example find the factors of 58 the first pair is 1 into 50 8 is equal to 58 here when we divide 58 by 1 we get the quotient as 58 and when we divide 58 by 58 we get the quotient as 1 in both the cases the remainder is 0 thus it means that 58 is divisible by 1 and 58 the second pair of numbers which gives the product 58 is 2 into 29 thus the factors of 58 are 1 to 29 and 58 let us solve one more example find the factors of 81 the pairs of numbers which give the product a t1r1 into 81 is equal 
,to 81 3 into 27 is equal to 81 9 into 9 is equal to 81 thus the factors of 81 are 1 3 9 27 and 81 as each of these number divides 81 exactly did you notice we counted the repeated factor only once remember every number has 1 as a factor every number is a factor of itself thus every number except one has at least two factors one 
,and the number itself the factor of a number is always equal to or less than the number now let us look at multiples a multiple of a number is the product obtained when the number is multiplied by the same or any other number let us find the multiples of 12 it is easy when we multiply 12 by zero one two three four five six seven eight nine ten and so on we get 0 12 24 36 48 60 70 to 80 for 96 108 120 and so on as the products so here the products obtained are nothing else but the multiples 
,of 12 let us look at another example find the multiples of 19 when we multiply 19 by 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and so on we get 0 1938 5770 695 114 133 152 171 190 and 
,so on thus the multiples of 19 are 0 1938 5770 695 114 133 152 171 190 and so on remember a number is a multiple of itself every number is a multiple of one every multiple of a given number is equal to or greater than the number itself every number has an infinite number of multiples zero is a multiple of every number but zero is not a factor of any number except zero revising factors and multiples was fun you

WEdMdZI8CLM,hello children today of elisany's factors and multiples listen we will firstly learn about factors what are these factors Shirin see when we write a whole number as 
,a productive mother two whole numbers then these two whole these two numbers are called the factors of this original whole number okay here I have written this 20 as a product of 1 and 21 times 20 is 20 no so this one and 20 are factors of 20 again I have written this number as a product of another two numbers two times ten so these two are factors of this this 20 so remember that if we can write any whole number as a product of another two numbers so those numbers are all the factors of the original number now children we will learn how to find the factors of a number right see the first example number is 4 we are going to find all the factors of 4 right see you should start from 1 every time we are going to write as a product this number should should be written as a product of two numbers ok so every time you must start with 1 1 times what 1 times 4 then after 1 what is the next number to 2 times can be right for yes 2 times 2 then again can be write any no 3 times there is no then 4 times again same thing is coming up so we can start from here so writing this is not enough you must write the factors of 4 separately okay this is the way that we find the factors and we should write the factor separately see what are the factors of 4 1 2 & 4 don't repeat the same number okay next step we will start from 1 1 times 10 2 times 5 if you want you can write any question apus likewise you can write then 3 times no four times No again it's coming five times right five times - is there but we know that both are same so stop from here otherwise on tire chain you may find the factors no need if the same thing is repeated you can stop from there okay and this is the other way that we should stop when the same number is they are the same TRADOC we can stop from there no need to consider three times four times likewise so what are the factors of ten one two five and ten next seven we know that only by one time seven we can obtain seven there are no any other 
,multiples you can obtain seven two times three times four times no so what are the factors of seven one and seven next 15 we will start with one one times 52 times yes it is there because the last digit is 0 this is an even number so multiple of two 2 times 25 three times no ok recall the multiplication table four times no five 
,times here as it is coming five times ten right then six times no seven times no seven eight nine times no again ten times it is coming ten times five we know that the same thing now same thing is repeated so stop from there no need to consider the other numbers after that so what are the factors of 50 1 2 5 10 25 and 50 next 31 we know that 1 times 31 is there 2 times no 3 times 4 times 5 times as we know 31 is not there in the multiplication table ever many times no we cannot see that so 
,1 and 31 only are the factors of 31 next 45 if you try and recall the multiplication table with the help of that you can may find the factors of a number here 1 times 45 then 2 times no because of the last digit right 3 times 3 times 15 4 times five times nine six times no seven times no eight times no 9 times again five is coming so stop from here this is the place where you should start after this no need to consider the other numbers so what are the factors of 45 1 3 5 9 15 and 45 it's not compulsory of writing in an order you can write whatever that you want here 21 1 times 21 2 times no three times seven four times no six times not five times no six times no then 7 times same thing so stop from here not compulsory of writing this so what are the factors 721 this one 3 7 21 next 18 one times 18 2 times 9 3 times 6 4 times no 5 times no 6 times is same thing so what are the factors of 18 these are the factors of 18 okay so we will get the example aid we are going to find the factors of 8 here firstly we can divide that means not by all the numbers okay if you are given a question like this find 3 factors of 8 find 3 factors of 32 likewise if you are asked you can use this method also get the number divided by few numbers and see whether a remained is coming or not if the remaining is 0 that means that number is a factor 1 is a factor see I have divided it by 1 so according to usual division method when we divide a one time say it is it 0 is the remainder so 
,answer is H no answer he said with remainder 0 that means 1 is a factor next it can be divided by 2 boy is the answer with 0 remainder that means 2 is also a factor 
,next I haven't written the answers here so we will divide we will divide 8 by 3 3 times 2 we 6 and 2 is remaining here 2 is the answer with remainder 2 that means 3 
,is not a factor of 8 then then the next one is for 8 we will divide by 4 4 times 2 is 8 0 remainder answer is 2 with 0 remainder that means 4 is also factor likewise I have divided and shown you some answers 5 is not a factor because there is a remainder 6 is also not a factor because there is a remainder 7 is also not now in the last run 0 is the remainder that means this is also a factor using this method also you can find the factors see the fraction I have given you is 3 a factor of 90 
,if you are given such a question the method I taught you that means this you division method can be useful here okay see we need to check whether this only this number is a factor of the given one so we will divide and say you know that when we divide this number by 3 if there are is a remainder coming that missed is not effective if there is no remainder that means if the if there zero remainder is they are three is a factor right at that time easily you can use this method instead of the 
,previous first method so ninety we will divide by three three times three is nine zero will come now I'm bringing this number down inside zero no trees here with me 
,again multiply 0 will be the remainder right so according to me accordingly we know that zero remained is there so three is a factor of ninety why is that the remainder when we divide by three the remainder is zero next again we will check whether 4 is a factor of 5151 we will divide by four 4 times 1 is 4 1 means remaining bring this one down four times two is eight when we subtract 3 will come they are is a remainder coming that means four is not a factor four is not a factor of 51 why is that they are recently made the coming for sure so children for such type of creatures you can use this division method easily and remember that if you are given a 
,question to find all the factors of a number then the first method can be used okay now children our next part is multiples right no earlier we learnt about factors 
,no factors are totally different than the multiples multiples may simply you remember like this with the help of multiplication table we write multiples okay see when we talk about multiples of two what are the multiples of 2 2 4 6 8 10 all these are multiple software amo that's why I kept three dots here so we can see all these numbers can be divided by two without any remainder so remember that without any remainder if we can divide all these numbers they are multiples of the relevant one so simply simply you you can get all these with the help of the multiplication table remember that multiples can be obtained with the help of the multiplication table next multiples of three we know that 3 6 9 12 15 and so on these are the multiples of 3 very easy next multiples are 5 5 10 15 20 see these are the examples ok next one now it is a special thing here five multiples of two greater than 10 we are going to write only five multiples 5 only we are writing multiples of what multiples of 2 which are greater than 10 greater than 10 means can we write 2 4 6 8 and 10 10 even we cannot write the numbers which are bigger than 10 only we can run and 
,they should be multiples of 2 after 10 what is the next multiple of 2 to elaborate 12 is the first multiple 14 16 18 20 here we wrote five multiples of 2 greater than 10 next multiples of 3 multiples of 3 we are going to write you know 3 6 9 12 15 those are the multiples after you know but here we need to write between 6 and 20 
,between 6 and 20 whenever you see between and words we cannot take the boundary numbers as the solutions here we can see the first number 6 is a multiple of 3 but can we write it as an answer no remember when between and circa me we cannot write the boundary answers as the solutions here so six can be written twenty even can't be written there because they are in a boundary but it is not a multiple of three what are the others nine twelve fifteen eighteen only this much right we cannot write twenty-one we are given a boundary here next all the multiples of six is all the multiples all the multiples of five from five to twenty five when you'll see from 
,men too if the boundary answers can be written as the answer of course we should write okay we know that five entry if you are given four can we start from four here this is not a multiple of five right if it is an answer only if it is a solution only we can include to dance multiples of right from five to twenty five over five 
,ten fifteen twenty twenty-five so remember that whenever you see between and words we don't include the boundary answers though they are solutions or not we don't include them but when you see from two the boundaries should be included if they are solutions only just imagine we need to write the multiples of five but these two are not multiples of five just think four and twenty three other so we cannot write them as the solutions okay so this this is how we obtain multiples now the next part is divisibility under this children we will learn the divisibility by two by five and by 10 we will check whether a given number is divisible by two divisible by 
,five or nearby chain how do we identify the numbers which are divisible by two without any remainder the number is divisible by two how do we identify by the last digit okay we identify them by the last digit the last digit should be zero two four six or eight that means if the last digit is divisible by two the whole number is 
,divisible by two okay so here I have given you a few examples see every time the last digit is one of these fine si si and when we consider the divisibility by five 
,the last vid I have written here some multiples of five here all these numbers are divisible by five right observe the last digit five or zero every time it is five 
,was zero so remember that if a number is the how do we identify a number with a number is divisible by five the last digit is five all zero only that number is divisible by five then the next one is divisibility by ten say I have written some articles often and we know that all these are divisible by 10 without a remainder say the last digit it is every time zero so remember if the last digit is 0 the whole number is divisible by chain okay what are the three things we need to remember if the last digit is an even number or is if the last digit is divisible by two the whole number is divisible by two if the last digit is five or zero that number is divisible by five if the last digit is 0 the whole numbers divisible by 10 and children being the observe piece we can see there are some numbers in all the categories 
,here see 30 see there are some numbers which are you see there by 2 5 10 all and say that all the multiples of 10 all the numbers which are divisible by thing surely divisible by 5 into wall so these are the special things we can catch from here okay see all the multi all all the numbers which are divisible by 10 that means multiples of chain are divisible by 5 and to also write remember that you you

1qPfLkOEuYY,welcome to math with mr j in this video i'm going to cover multiples verse factors so the difference between multiples and factors and we have two examples that we're going to go through together in order to get this down so let's jump right into number one here where we have eight and we'll start with multiples so we need to list some multiples of eight now multiples are the result of multiplying the given number by integers so no fractions or decimals and we can think of this as skip counting let's make sense of that by writing out some examples here so the multiples of eight we can start with eight eight times one equals eight so we multiplied eight by the integer of one now we can multiply by the integer of two so eight times two is sixteen then three eight times three is twenty-four and you can see how this is turning into just counting by eights or skip counting eight times four is thirty-two eight times five is forty and so on and so forth so those multiples will continue on forever so it's all the numbers that 8 will hit if we count up by 8. or think of it as we multiplied 8 by integers starting with 1 and then going 2 3 4 5 6 7 
,8 and again it goes on forever now multiples can be positive and go up in value or multiples can decrease in value there are negative multiples but we are only going to be working with positives in this video so let's move on to factors and factors are all of the numbers that the given number can be divided by evenly so no remainders or you can think of factors as the numbers that can be multiplied in order to get that given number factors are numbers that are multiplied to get a product i 
,like to think of factors as all the numbers that can go into a given number that's not the most mathematical or technical way of thinking about it but it can help with determining the difference between multiples and factors so let's find all the factors of eight and when we find factors i like to start with two numbers for two 
,factors for every number and those factors are one and then the number itself so one and eight i can do eight divided by one and get a um that will divide evenly i will not get a remainder and i can do eight divided by eight or you can think of it as one times eight equals eight so all the math facts all the multiplication facts that will equal eight and we can think of this as a factor pair here so we'll start with 1 and 8 and for some numbers those are the only factors 1 and the number itself those numbers are called prime numbers but 8 is composite so it has other factors involved here so what other numbers can go into eight you can think of it as or a multiplication fact to equal that given number of eight well i could do eight divided by two right 2 can go into 8 so that's my next factor and i know 2's partner is 4 because 8 divided by 2 equals 4. or i could do 8 divided by 4 equals 2 or think of it as 2 times 4 equals 8. so different ways of thinking about factors but it's all the numbers that can divide evenly aka no remainders as far as 8 goes now when i wrote my factors list i put 1 and 8 and then i put a big gap in the middle there that way i could fit any other factors that would be between 1 and 8 and they would all go in order you'll get better with spacing the more you do of those let's go to number two and write out the multiples of 15. so we'll start with 15 times 1 or just start with 15 and skip count however you like to think about this 15 times 2 30 3 is 45 4 is 60 5 is 75 and again those do continue on forever but we'll cut it off right there as far as factors remember we start with 1 and the number itself because 1 can go into 15 and then 15 can go into 15. i like to leave a little gap there that way if there are any other factors i can list them in between 1 and 
,15 and they're all in order so think about 15 what other numbers go into 15 or can multiply to get 15 well i know 15 divided by 3 and 3's partner is 5 right because 
,let me start with this 1 and 15 are partners and then 3 and 5 are factor pairs or partners and those are all the factors of 15. so there you have it there's the difference between multiples and factors i hope that helped thanks so much for watching until next time peace

HL2v6rF4zhU,hello children today i'm here to teach you chapter 4 part 1 and 2 in your syllabus factors and multiples so we'll see what are factors and multiples and any integer 
,how you can find out whether it is divisible by 2 3 4 like that so we'll find out more about factors and multiples at this number 274 how can we find out whether the number is divisible by 2 you already know that if it's an even number it's divisible by 2. so we'll look at 274 is an even number divide by 2 2 times 1 2 times 3 6 
,1 remaining and then 7. so it's divisible take this number 358 we know that last digit is an even number so that means this whole thing is even number 2 times 1 2 for 15 that's 7 for 18 that's 9. divide this by 2 2 1 3 divide this by 2 510 2 times 2 4 1 remaining 5 10 1 remaining and 5. so 255 divide this by 2 1 and for 12 that's 6 and 1. so all these are even numbers so we know that it's divisible by 2. all above numbers are divided by 2 without a remainder without a remainder look at the 
,last digit of each above numbers what can you say you you get 0. 6 4 8 2 2 4 6 8 or either 0 or even numbers when the last digit of any large number is either 0 or an even number it can be divided by 2 without a remainder so remember how we identify whether the number is divisible by 2 look at the last digit last digit should be either 0 or any one number look at these numbers if it's divisible by 2 you can put a tick mark and if it's not you can put a cross you have to look at the last digit 4 so it's divisible by 2 9 not divisible 0 yes it is divisible 8 even number yes it's divisible 3 no that's not an even number it's not divisible by 2. look at this one 4 yes it is divisible 6 again it is divisible one not divisible zero yes it's divisible and seven it's not divisible find whether the following numbers are divisible by 5 now so we'll take these numbers and divide by 5. 5 times 7 35 for 25 that's 5. so it's divisible 5 times 840 for 20 that's 4 that's also divisible look 
,at this one 5 times 1 and 3 remaining 34 that's 6 45 that's 9 that's also divisible 5 times 1 5 1 remaining 5 times 3 15 and for 20 that's 4. so all these numbers are divisible by 5. so how we identify look at the last digit of the above numbers they are either 5 or zero five zero here five zero they can be divisible by five without a remainder so how we identify whether the number is divisible by five last digit should be zero or five now put tick mark for numbers divisible by five without a remainder and cross mark for numbers not divisible by 5 in the cage in front of each given number so what we do you we look at the last digit 5 so it's divisible 
,by 5 0 yes it is divisible eight no because only zero and five for the last digit the number is divisible by five eight no seven no zero years five years and this one also correct so you have to only look at the last digit look at this one find out whether the following numbers are divisible by 10 now without a remainder take a 
,look at all these numbers 360. so 10 times 330 for 60 that's 6. 580 10 times 550 for 80 that's 8. this one 10 times 440 for 70 that's 7. 810 here 810 divided by 10 you get 8 and for 10 that's 1. all these are divisible by 10. now we'll see the last digit of the above numbers is 0. look at all the numbers last digit is zero so if the last digit is zero the number is divisible by 10. play a stick mark if they are divisible by 10 without a remainder and place cross mark if not divided so last 
,digit is zero so it's divisible by 10 here 5 not divisible 3 also not divisible in this number 0 is there it's divisible by 10 here not in this one yes 0 is there so it's divisible by 10 5 no here's 0 yes and this one also years here also divisible by 10 so how we identify whether the number is divisible by 10 look at the last digit if it is 0 it's divisible by 10. complete the following table if divided without a remainder put correct while cross mark if not divided so look at this number 
,last digit 0 divisible by 5 without a remainder last digit 0 of 5 it's divisible by 5 divisible by 10 yes last digit is 0 that's divisible by 10 this one 5 so 5 means divisible by 5 but not divisible by 10 0 divisible by 5 as well as 10. here 2 it's not divisible by 5 or 10. here 0 divisible by 5 as well as 10. here also 0 it's 
,divisible by 5 and 10. here 5 is there it's divisible by 5 but not divisible by so look at this one if zero or an even number is the last digit in the ones place then that number can be divided by two without a remainder if 0 5 is that last digit in the ones place that number can be divided by 5 without a remainder and if 0 is the last digit in the ones place that number can be divided by 10 without a remainder so we did divisible by 2 5 and 10. now we'll see what is the digital root of a number sometimes we call this is the lucky number so look at this one gaura's birthday is on 11 2 that means february 2002 find out the digital root so how can we find out the digital root we add all the digits so here 1 plus 1 plus 0 plus 2 plus 2 not not 2. so you have to add all digits and see what's your lucky number one plus one two two plus two four four plus two six six plus two eight till you get one digit you have to add so lucky number is eight that's called the digital root birthday of gaura's grandfather is 12 11 that's november 1948. find out the digital root of his birthday so we'll add all the digits 1 plus 2 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 9 4 eight so one plus two three three plus one four four plus one five five plus one six six plus nine fifteen 15 plus 4 19 19 plus 8 27 now you get two digit number so again you have to add these two digits 2 plus 7 you get 9. so gaura's grandfather's lucky number is 9. here we get two numbered figure as the answer so they should be once again added to get the answer so here 27 we can find out taking 2 plus 7. find the digital root of the following numbers so we'll add it 2 plus 7 is 9. so lucky number is 9. 3 not 8. eight plus three eleven but eleven is two digit number so you have to add it again one plus one that's two five thousand one hundred and twenty 
,seven add all the digits five plus one six six plus two eight eight plus seven fifteen now add the two digits one plus five that's six this one four plus eight twelve twelve and ten twenty-two twenty-two means two plus two you get 4. here 6 plus 7 13 13 plus 7 20 and 9 29 now add the two digits 2 plus 9 11. again you have to add 1 plus 1 2 till you get one digit you have to add 3 plus 7 10 18 and 18 plus 4 22 22 plus 5 27 and 2 and 7 you get 9. 488 8 and 8 16 16 plus 4 20. so add 2 and 0 you get 2. that's the digital root 99999 so 4 9s you get 36 and three and six you get nine how many fours are there one two three four five six six fours you get 20 4 
,2 plus 4 you get 6. this one the 335 704 three plus three six six plus five eleven eleven plus seven eighteen eighteen plus four twenty two two plus two you get find whether the following numbers are divisible by 3 without a remainder now we'll check out these numbers we'll divide by 3 3 times 1 nothing for 2 for 21 that's 7. so it's divisible 612 divided by 3 you get 2 here nothing there 3 times 4 12. 102 3 times 3 9 for 12 that's 4. 201 this is 3 times 6 18 for 21 that's 7 67 that's divisible by 3. now we'll find out the digital root of all these numbers and see three two one five five plus one six six hundred and twelve six plus one seven 7 plus 2 9 here 102 1 plus 2 3 and 201 that's 3. now look at the digital root when you get 3 6 9 as the digital rule the number is divisible by 3. so you need to remember how 
,you identify whether the number is divisible by 3 the digital root should be either 3 6 or 9. find out the digital root of the following numbers and find whether they are divisible by 3 without a remainder so we'll find out the digital root 8 will straight away add this 8 plus 1 9 9 plus 3 12. so 12 means 1 plus 2 you get 3 408 
,8 plus 4 12 2 plus 1 3 this one 3 plus 1 4 4 plus 7 11 11 plus 2 13 3 plus 1 4 plus one six six plus two eight eight plus two ten eleven twelve so one plus two three three plus four seven seven plus five 12 12 plus 7 19 and 21 2 plus 1 again that's 3. 6 plus 7 13 13 plus 5 18. eight plus one nine seven plus two nine nine plus nine eighty and one nineteen and twenty four so 2 plus 4 again 6. now we found out digital root now check whether this number is divisible by 3 without a remainder so 
,what's the condition if the digital root is 3 6 9 the number is divisible by 3 so this is 3 this is divisible by 3. here also this is divisible by 3 but 4 is not here 3 again yes yes 9 also possible here 6 also possible so only this number is not divisible by 3. look at these numbers write the numbers divisible by 3 without a remainder from the above numbers within the set of 8 so what you have to do you have to find out the digital root 2 plus 1 3 so that's divisible by 3 3 plus 1 4 it's not divisible 4 plus 1 5. it's not divisible but here 5 plus 1 yes it's divisible 51 6 plus 1 again not divisible 7 plus 1 8 not divisible but 8 81 8 plus 1 9 that's 
,divisible by 3 9 plus 1 10 that's 1 plus 0 again 1 so that's not divisible so only 21 51 81 are divisible by 3. look at these numbers write the numbers divisible by 
,3 without a remainder from the above numbers within the set b again check the digital root 5 plus 2 7 that's not divisible five plus one six six plus two eight not divisible five plus two seven seven plus two nine that's divisible by three five plus three eight eight plus two ten not divisible five plus four nine nine plus two eleven eleven means one and one again two not divisible here 10 12 12 means 2 plus 1 again 3 that's divisible by 3 562 6 5 11 11 plus 2 13 13 means 1 and 3 you are getting 4 5 plus 7 12 12 plus 2 14 14 means 5. not divisible 5 plus 8 13 13 plus 2 15 15 means 6 that's divisible by 3 so these are the numbers divisible by three identify the numbers that are divisible by four without a remainder we'll take these numbers and divide by four four times six so that's divisible by 4 here 4 times 1 4 
,for 22 that's 5 and for 24 that's 6. that's also divisible 4 times 8 32 for 28 that's 7. 300 4 times 7 28 for 20 that's 5 that's also divisible this one 4 times 6 24 for 10 that's 2 8 and for 20 that's 5. 4 times 8 32 then 32 38 for 38 you get 9 36 remainder 2 5 times 1 4 times 1 4 1 remaining for 10 4 times 2 8 for 21 that's 4 
,times 5 20 and for 14 4 times 3 12 and remainder 2. this one divide by 4 4 times 1 4 for 3 nothing for 31 that's 7 28 so you get 30 so again 7 28 for 20 that's 5. so these two numbers are not divisible by 4. now look at the last two digits and see we'll look at last two digits so this is 24 here also 24 48 zero zero fifty eight 
,fourteen zero zero so how we identify whether the number is divisible by four if the final two digits of the above numbers are either 0 0 24 48 64 28 32 that means the numbers are divisible by 4 so you have to only look at the last two digits so here 58 is not divisible by 4 so the whole number is not divisible 14 also not divisible by 4 so that means 5014 is not divisible by 4. select and write the numbers divisible by 4 without a remainder from the following numbers so what we do we take 
,the last two digits 75 not divisible by 4 44 yes so 344 is divisible by 4 here 0 0 if it's 0 0 also it's divisible 84 divisible by 4 so 1284 divisible by 4 72 4 times 1 4 32 so that's divisible by 4 972 55 it's not divisible by 4. but 0 0 yes it's divisible by 4 here also 0 0 it's divisible by 4 36 yes it is divisible by 4 so 5 
,4 536 divisible by 4. what about 58 4 times 1 and for 18 it's not divisible by 4 so you can't write that number write three numbers beginning from 5 ending with 2 and having four numbers so you can create anything so numbers beginning from five so five but ending with two four digits ending with two write three numbers so four having four numbers four digit numbers so you can put any number in between seven three five and two you can put nine and one five and two eight and three another one now you asked to write only three numbers so these are the three numbers starting from five and ending with two look at this one write down all the numbers less than 100 divisible by 4 without a remainder and 6 at the ones place last digit is 6 and the number should be less than 100 that means only 2 digit numbers you can write how we identify whether the number is divisible by 4 the last 2 digit should be divisible by 4. so we can put 16 because that's less than 100 16 is divisible by 4 then 26 is not divisible 36 yes 46 no 56 56 is this divisible by 4 1 and for 16 you get 14 so that's divisible 66 it's not divisible 76 check 76 and see 76 divided by 4 1 and here 36 that's nine it's d it's divisible so 76 is okay what else 86 it's not divisible because 4 times 2 86 is not divisible 96 divisible by 4 4 times 2 8 
,for 16 that's 4 it's divisible so 96 so these are the numbers less than 100 last digit is 6 and all the numbers are divisible by 4. look at this one write 6 even numbers that do not divide by 4 without a remainder a1 means even means last digit either 0 or even number so we'll put 0 and it's not divided by 4 so what's the condition you can't put 0 there uh what about 30 is 30 divided by 4 no so you can put 30 and any number so 30 or you can put any number here 330. it's not divisible by 4 another one you can put 2 as the last digit and what about this can be 2 22 should be there because it's not divisible by 4 and here we'll put any number here 122. then another number 8 and 18 it's not divisible by 4 and you can put any number here 3. so you asked to write six even numbers another even number you can put 6 but if you put 2 26 is not divisible by 4 and then here you can put any number 526 1 2 3 4 another 2 so 2 and 32 is divisible 42 it's not divisible by 4. so put any number here 5 another one more we'll put 8 and 18 is not divisible by or we'll put 28 is divisible 38 it's not divisible by 4 so you can put any number here 600 or any number here it's not mentioned to write only three digit numbers you can write any number that you like but only condition is the last two numbers it's not divisible by four write six numbers with the last digit as zero and not divisible by three and four without a remainder so you need to be careful now 0 is there last digit is 0 
,not divisible by 4 that means this can be 30 last 2 digits 30 and not divisible by 3 means the digital root cannot be 3 6 9. so here 3 so we can put 1 there 1 plus 3 4 digital root is 4 so that's not divisible by 3 or 4. another one put 0 for last digit and 10 10 is not divisible by 4 so if you put 2 it's divisible by 3 so we can put 3 3 plus 1 4 4 is not divisible by the digital root four means not divisible by three another one you can put any number of digits zero we'll put last two digits 30 40 divisible 50 it's not divisible so 50 then 5 plus 1 6 6 plus 1 7 now digital root is 7 not divisible by 3 and 50 not divisible by 4 another one last digit is zero and we'll put 60 it's divisible 70. it's not divisible because 4 times 1 for 30 it's not divisible so 70 is the last two digits then now think about the digital root 7 plus 1 8 8 plus 2 10 so 10 is not divisible by 3 digital root 10 is not divisible by 3. another one we'll write a big number 1 2 three four we need two more zero and eighty eight is divisible by four ninety you can put ninety there and now put numbers in front 9 plus 1 10 10 plus 1 11 11 plus 2 13 that's 4 digital root is 4 so 2190 is also possible another one more one two three four five one more zero we'll put ten now see the digital root 1 5 1 6 6 plus 2 8 8 plus 2 10 10 plus 1 11 so 11 means digital root is 2 so not divisible by 3. so what's this number 122 510 is also not divisible by 3 or 4. finding a number divisible by 6 without a remainder how we do that we can check whether the number is divisible by 2 or 3 if it satisfy definitely that number is divisible by 6. so we can check it's a it's an even number yes it's divisible by 2. what's the digital root 7 plus 2 9 9 plus 6 15 15 means 6 that means it's also divisible by 3. so definitely if these two are okay that means it's divisible by six as well look at this one five last digit is five means not divisible by 2 digital root 11 plus 5 that's 16 so 6 plus 1 7 7 is not 
,divisible so definitely this is not divisible by 6 last digit is 8 divisible by 2 digital root 3 3 plus 4 7 7 plus 8 15 that means 6 6 means divisible by 3 then definitely this is divisible by 6 as well last digit is 4 divisible by two digital root eight eight plus four twelve twelve means three it's divisible by three so definitely it's divisible by six last digit is 4 divisible by 2. now the digital root 7 plus 4 is 11 11 plus 4 15 that's 6. it's divisible by 3 that means divisible by 6 as well last digit is 5 not divisible by 2 1 plus 8 9 9 plus 5 14 14 means 5. it's not divisible by 3 so definitely it's not divided by 6. last digit is 6 that's even number yes it's divisible by 2. digital root 9 9 plus 6 15 that's 5 plus 1 6. it's divisible by 3 so that means it's divisible by 6 as well if the digital root is divisible by 3 the number is divided by 3. if the number is an even number it can be divided by 2 without a remainder all those numbers divisible by 2 and 3 without a remainder can be divided by 6 as well finding a number divided by 9 without a remainder so we did so far two three four ten five six now nine look at the following 
,multiples of nine all these multiples of 9 take 9 so digital root is 9 18 1 plus 8 digital root is 9 2 7 digital root is 9 36 3 plus 6 that's 9. so take any number 7 plus 1 8 plus 1 9 here 4 plus 4 8 8 plus 1 9 all multiples of 9 you get the digital root 9 so that means you can look at the digital root and see whether the number is divisible by 9 45 4 plus 5 that's nice 117 seven plus one eight eight plus one nine 135 eight and nine here seven plus one all these digital roots are nine ten 8 plus 1 9. so 9 is the digital root of all the above numbers so any number whose digital rule digital index or digital root is 9 it is divided by 9. select and write the numbers that is divisible by 6 without a remainder from the following numbers so have you identify whether this is divisible by 6 first check whether this is a 
,this is an even number this is not so it's not divisible by 6 690 it's an even number now we'll check the digital route 9 plus 6 15 that's 5 1 6 6 means it's divisible by 3 as well so 609 divisible by 2 and 3 that means divisible by 6. this one even number correct digital root 10 10 plus 3 13 13 plus 1 14 that means 4 plus 1 that's not divisible by 3. is an even number check whether this is divisible by three eight plus four twelve twelve plus one thirteen thirteen plus two fifteen so five 
,plus one six it's divisible by two and three that means divisible by 6 as well check the digital route 10 12 12 means it's divisible 774 even number digital road 14 
,plus 4 80 8 plus 1 9 so that's divisible by 3 as well 916 10 10 plus 6 16 that means 7 so not divisible by 3 4 plus 4 8 8 plus 1 9 it's divisible by 3 and 2. that's 
,divisible by 6. this one even yes then digital root nine ten sixteen six plus one seven so that's not divisible by three this one even number look at the digital root three three plus 7 10 10 plus 2 12. it's divisible by 3 as well as 2 so definitely divisible by 6. if a certain number is divided by another whole number without a remainder what you call that number that is a factor of the first number so what are factors if a number can be written as a multiple of two whole numbers they are 
,considered as factors of the first number take look take a look at 24 what are the factors if we take one that's 1 times 24 so 1 and 24 both are factors 2 is also a 
,factor 2 times 12. you can write the same thing as 3 times 8 4 times 6 and 6 times 4 again you can write this way so what are the factors of 24 1 2 3 4 6 8 12 24 so 
,all these numbers we call those are factors so you can create that number by multiplying the two numbers so those are factors write the set of factors of 36 1 times 
,36 2 times 18 3 times 12 4 times 9 6 times 6. so what are the factors of 36 always 1 and the number itself are factors 2 3 4 6 9 12 18 36 so these are the set of factors of 36 all numbers are there all factors are there write the set of factors of 60 1 times 60 2 times 30 divide by 2 and see when you divide by 3 you get 20. divide by 4 1 and for 20 that's 5 15 times 4 divided by 5 you get 12 and here divide by 6 you get 10. so what are the factors of 60 starting from 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 here and 
,then 10 12 15 20 30 and 60. so those are the factors of 60. now we'll look at what are prime numbers take a look at 2 what are the factors of two one and two so factors of two one and two take three one times three factors of 3 1 times 1 and 3. what about factors of 5 1 times 5 so you get 1 and 5. look at carefully what are the 
,factors seven means one and one times seven factors of here seven factors of seven you get one and 7 so take a look at all the factors 1 and the number itself so what are prime numbers if a number has only two factors and the factors are one and itself so those numbers are called prime numbers select and underline the number out of the following numbers divided by 9 without a remainder so how you identify a number is divisible by 9 the digital root should be nine so we'll look at three plus six nine that means divided by nine so one plus five twelve twelve plus six eighteen eight plus one nine two plus two four four plus four eight eight plus one nine 
,that's divisible by nine nine and nine eighteen eight plus one nine two plus three five 5 7 12 12 6 18 that's also divisible by 9. take a look at this one 4 plus 5 9 9 plus nine eighteen that's also divisible by nine here also eight plus one nine this one eight eight plus eight sixteen sixteen plus two eighteen eighteen means nine all the numbers are divisible by nine this one ten ten plus eight eighteen eight plus one nine seven plus seven fourteen 14 plus 1 15 15 means 5 plus 1 6 is not divisible by 9. so all the other numbers except 177 is divisible by 9. select and underline the numbers out of the following numbers divided by 6 and 9 without a remainder how you identify we have to check the digital root and this should be an even number because to check whether the number is divisible by 6 it should be definitely divided by 2. so definitely out of this we can cross out this because this is an odd number this is an odd number not divisible by 6 these numbers we can cross out now for the other numbers we have to check the digital root 10 10 plus 8 18 it's divisible by nine as well as six six plus two eight eight plus one nine nine is divisible by nine as well as 3. here 15 that means 5 plus 1 6 it's not divisible by 9 so you can't select that 7 plus 1 8 8 plus 2 10 10 plus 8 18 18 means 9 that's divisible by 9 as well as 6. this one 7 7 plus 8 15 15 means not divisible by 9 here 16 20 27 divisible by 9 as well as 6. 384 12 12 plus 3 15 15 means 1 plus 5 not divisible by 9. now we'll look at this question factors 24 glass marbles should be packed with similar number leaving any remainder write down all the ways it can be 
,done so you can do one glass marble in each 24 that means one packet two glass marbles in each two times twelve then you get two packets three glass marbles in each 
,three times eight so you can make eight packets four glass marble in each four times six and you get six packets eight glass marbles eight times three you get three 
,packets with six glass marbles six times 4 that's 4 here and with 12 12 times 2 24. so you can make two packets and with 24 again one packet here according to the above information the set of numbers that can be divided by 24 without a remainder so 1 2 3 4 and 6 12 what is 12 24 these are factors now we looked at prime numbers now what are composite numbers we'll take a look at 4 what are the factors of 4 1 into 4 2 times 2. so factors of 4 you can write 1 2 4 factors of 6 1 times 6 or 2 times 3. so what are the factors of 6 you can write 1 two three six one two three six what are the factors of eight eight means one times eight so eight you can write 
,2 times 4 as well so what are the factors of 8 you get 1 2 4 8. now take a look at all the factors here if a certain number has more than two factors it is a composite number prime factors you get only two factors one and the number itself so composite numbers you get more than two factors then we can identify that number is a composite number write the set of composite numbers less than 21 so not prime numbers so one you can't take one just one factor is there two three four is a composite number five is a prime number 6 is a composite number 7 is prime 8 is composite 9 composite 10 11 is a prime number 12 is a composite 13 is prime 14 15 16 17 is prime 18 19 19 is prime 20 is the last number less than 21 means you can't write 21. so these are the composite numbers less than 21 finding prime factors of a number write number 24 in every way as a product of two numbers 1 times 24 2 times 12 3 times 8 4 times 6 so what are the prime factors out of these so write all the factors here we can write the factors of 24 is 1 2 3 4 6 8 12 24 out of these factors what are the prime factors the factors are prime numbers so what are the prime numbers there 2 3 that's all so prime factors of 24 is either 2 or 3 and write all the prime factors so you can write 2 and 3 and write 24 as a product of prime factors how can you write down as a product of prime factors you can take the number divide by only the prime numbers take 2 you get 12. another 2 6 2 3 so 3 1 till you get 1 you have to divide now how many times you multiply by 2 2 2 2 and 1 3. or you can write how many twos three twos into one three so this is a product of prime factors 
,so 2 to the power 3 n 3. now take 36 and write down everywhere as a product of numbers 1 times 36 two times eighty three times twelve four times nine and six times six so what are the factors of 36 you can write 1 2 3 4 6 9 12 18 36 those are the factors out of the factors what are the prime factors 2 3 that's all 2 and 3. now product as prime factors how can you do you can divide by two two times eighteen again divide by two nine you have to divide by three now three times three and again 
,divide by 3 you get 1. so what are the factors 2 times 2 4 4 times 3 12 12 times 3 36 so here 2 times 2 times 3 times 3 or you can write 2 to the power 2 because twice are there and 3 to the power 2 here also twice are there so that's the value 36 as a product of prime factors right all the prime numbers from 1 to 40 starting from 2 3 5 7 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 is 5 18 19 20 21 22 23 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 a prime number 30 31 is a prime number 32 33 34 35 36 30 7 is a prime number 38 and 
,39 it's not and 40. so these are the prime numbers 1 to 40. write all the composite numbers from 1 to 30 composite means you get more than 2 factors one two three four five six seven is prime eight nine ten eleven 12 13 14 15 16 17 here 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 and 30 1 2 30 means you can include 30 as well so those are composite numbers finding highest common factor so we'll take the number numbers 18 and 30. now what are the factors of 18 it's one divisible by two so two is a factor it's divisible by three three is a factor three times six then four five six six times 3 7 8 9 times 2 then 10 11 all these again finally 18. so those are the 
,factors of 18. what are the factors of 30 starting from 1 divisible by 2. it's divisible by 3 3 times 10 4 5 5 times 6 also a factor 7 8 9 10 is a factor then 15 times 2 so 15 is a factor and 30. now what are the common factors of eighteen and thirty one two three six what else that's all so out of these what's the highest one highest common factor of 18 and 30 is 6. that's the highest one now take these two these three numbers 28 42 and 63 and see what's the highest common factor factors of 28 one it's divisible by two three three times no three four four times seven six seven eight nine ten and two times fourteen so fourteen is a factor 4 times 7 and then finally 28 factors of 42 what are the factors of 42 1 it's divisible by two three three times four thirty three times what three times uh fourteen four five six six times seven so seven is a factor eight nine ten eleven and if it's two you get twenty one and if it's three three times one three three times four fourteen is 
,a factor and what is 6 times 7 and again 42 last digit is 42. now what are the factors of 63 1 it's divisible by 3. so 3 times so 63 comes that's the last number 3 times 21 and what else 63 9 times 6 6 and 9 those are the factors of 63. now what are the common factors out of those we'll find out common ones one is common 2 is not 6 no 9 21 it's not common so only one so what's the highest common factor of this so you get only one so the highest common factor of 28 42 and 63 is 1. finding highest common factor using prime factors so this is another way of finding highest common factor find the highest common factor of 36 so we'll find out 36 you can divide by 2 18 divide by 2 now divide by 3 3 divided by three you get one two times two times three times three forty five divide and see you can divide by three divide by three again and divide by five you get one three times three times five fifty-four divide by 2 then divide by 3 3 3 2 times 3 3 3. now these are the factors prime factors so how we find out the highest common factor we'll find out the common ones and multiply what's common two is not common three yes you get three a common one that's all another three another three is common so you get three two times so the highest common factor we take three times three you get three comma twice so three times three that's 9. so how we find out the highest common factor using this way so you find out the prime factor separately and see what are the common ones for all the numbers and then you multiply those find the highest common factor of 64 960 divide by 2 divide by 2 again divided by 2 divided by 2 divided by 2 and 1. so what are the factors 2 2 1 2 3 4 5 six three four five six ninety six divided by three thirty two divided by two sixteen divided by 2 8 divided by 2 4 divided by 2 
,and again 1. so what are the factors 1 2 3 4 5 2 3 4 five and three sixty divide by two get thirty divided by two fifteen divided by three five divide by 5 you get 1. so what are the factors of 60 2 and 2 and 3 and 5. now what are the common factors we'll take what are common two another two then 3 is not common 5 is not common 
,only these two so what's the highest common factor 2 times 2 that's 4. find the highest common factor of 16 36 48 and 60. we'll divide and see 2 times 8 2 times 4 2 
,times 2 2 times 1. so 16 is 2 4 times 36 divided by 2. you get 18 divide by 2 again 9 divided by three three divided by three one two times two three times three 48 
,divided by two 24 divided by 2 12 divided by 2 6 3 3 1. so you get 1 2 3 4 2 3 four and three sixty divided by two thirty divide by two again fifteen divided by three that's five divided by 5 you get 1 2 times 2 times 3 times 5. now find out the highest one what's the highest one 2 is common another 2 is common what else that's 
,all so what's the highest common factor of 16 36 48 and 60 that's 2 times 2 4. now finding least common multiple finding the least common multiple of 4 6 eight what 
,are the multiples of four four times one four four times two eight four times three twelve four times four sixteen 4 times 5 20 24 28 you can write but we'll stop here we'll put three dots that means we it's continuing multiples of six six times one six times two twelve six times three eighteen six times four twenty four six times 5 30 36 42 we'll put three dots multiples of eight eight times one eight eight times two 16 24 8 times 4 32 8 times 5 40 48 like that it's continuing so what are 
,the common multiples of all these will identify common multiples what are the common ones 20 is not there can you see 24 and then what else so 48 comes here so when 
,you do this 48 next you will get 48 like that so 48 also common for all so this is like 24 48 like that common months we need the lowest one so least one is 24 so that's the least common multiple of four six eight so 24 is the answer find the least common multiple of four six eight from prime factors so how can you write four two times two six two times three eight two times two times two so this is how we can do so how many 2s are there here 2 2's here 2 1 and 3 1 here 2 to the power 3 there so we are taking different numbers with maximum power greatest power of them so if you take two's maximum is 2 to the power 3 and then you get 3 here so that's the least common multiple now what's 2 to the power 3 that's 8 times 3 you get 24. so previous one also we got 24 as the least common multiple and there's another way 
,of doing that so how you do that way so here we will try it out you can write down the numbers at once and try to divide by prime numbers so that you get once 2 times two four six divided by two you get three eight divided by two four now you can divide by two this is one three you can't divide so you write down the number as it is this is four so you can divide by two now there's another two so you can divide by two one you can write as it is 3 you can't divide right as it is and this becomes 1. now 3 is there you need to divide this by 3 so you get all ones till you get once you can divide so from this also you can find out the lowest common multiple so 2 times 2 4 4 times 2 8 8 times 3 24 so that way is easier to find out the lowest common multiple find the least common multiple dividing method of the numbers four six eight so here that's what i did before so what are the numbers we got 2 2 2 3. so we get 2 2 2 3. so 2 times 2 4 4 times 2 8 8 times 3 24 as the least common multiple so here divide by prime numbers so here 2 also possible 3 5 7 like that least common multiple of 4 6 8 is 24 so the answer you get as the least common multiple should be eligible for dividing without a remainder by each number again number given find the least common multiple of 72 9608 so we'll use the factor method first 72 divide by 2 36 divided by 2 you get 18 and 9. now you can divide by 3. so what are the factors of 72 1 2 3 and 2 3's 2 to the power 3 3 squared 96 we'll do 96 divided by 2 48 divided by 2 divided by two again till you get one one two three four five and one three two to the power five and one three hundred and eight you 
,need to divide by three till you get one two twos and three threes two twos and three threes now we take the highest power with different numbers when you consider 2 2 to the power 5 is the maximum when you take 3 3 to the power 3 is the maximum so that's the least common multiple 2 to the power 5 32 3 to the power 3 3 times 3 times 3 27 now when you multiply these two what you get 32 into 27 20 and 7 21 plus 1 22 when you add it 964. so what's the least common multiple of 72 968 is 964 find least common multiple of 64 96 and 128 now divide by 2 32 divide by 2 again 16 divided by 2 here 8 4 2 and 1. so how many tools 1 2 3 4 5 6 2 to the power 6. 96 48 divided by 2 24 divided by 2 12 6 3 one two three four five two to the power five and three 168 is not 120 868 2 8 4 42 21 7 and 1 so 2 to the power 3 and 3 and 7. 
,now when you take different numbers when you take 2 the maximum power is 2 to the power 6. if you take 3 that's 1 power 1 and 7 2 to the power 6 is 60 4 3 times 7 21 so 64 times 21 what's the answer add it together thousand three hundred and forty four is the lowest or least common multiple fine least common multiple of 14 28 42 by applying dividing method so you write the numbers at once and divide 2 times 7 2 times 14. 2 times 24 again you can divide by 2 but 7 you can't divide so you write as it is 7 you're 12. again you can divide by 2 you get 6. again divide by 2 you get 3. now you can divide by 3 and finally by 7 till you get 1. so what's the least common multiple you multiply all these numbers two times two times two three four and three and seven two times two four four times two eight eight times two sixteen times twenty one what's sixteen times twenty one twenty and one here and 16 you get 336. that's the least common multiple look at this question the bells a in every 20 minutes be in every 30 minutes and see in every 40 minutes respectively rings if all three bells were ringing at the same time at eighteen when we all three bells be wrong once again so if you take multiples of twenty just see you get 20 20 and 20 40 then 60 80 80 plus 20 hundred hundred plus 20 hundred and twenty like that 140 if you take every 30 minutes it's ringing then multiples of 30 30 60 60 30 90 90 30 120 120 plus 30 150 150 plus 30 180 so and if it's 40 minutes interval what are the multiples of 40 40 80 80 plus 40 120 and 40 160 200 like that now what's the lowest common one look at these values and see what's the lowest common value 
,is comma and the lowest one so that means after 120 minutes it will ring again so 120 minutes means how many hours divided by 60 you get two hours so what's the time again the bell is ringing eight for the first time and 8 plus 2 10 a.m so again the bell will ring at 10 a.m so this is one way of solving this problem or you can do using factors 20 how can you write 2 times 10 10 again 2 and 5 30 how can you write 2 times three six six times five forty two times twenty again two times two ten two times two eight eight times five so forty those are the factors so how do you find out the lowest one when you take least common multiple of twenty thirty forty this is 2 to the power 2 and 5 here 2 3 5 here 2 to the power 3 and 5. so when you take power 2 to the power 3 is the maximum 3 to the power 1 is the maximum and 5 
,to the power 1. 2 to the power 3 is 8 8 times 3 24 24 times 5. 120 so least common multiple also 120 so which one is easy this way is easier than finding multiples so we'll find using least common multiple finding factors and take the highest factor now we'll look at exercise in your textbook exercise 4.1 without dividing select the numbers which are divisible by 9 how we identify digital root if the digital root is 9 that means divisible by nine five plus four now so 504 is divisible by nine six plus five eleven eleven plus two thirteen thirteen means you can't five plus six eleven eleven plus seven eighteen that means yes it's divisible by nine six plus five eleven eleven plus 8 19 that's not possible 2 2 plus 4 6 6 plus 3 9 that's possible 1 plus 3 four four plus five nine nine plus one ten that's not possible 
,two plus seven nine nine plus one ten ten plus nine ninety that's not possible and the last one four plus five nine nine plus three twelve twelve plus six eighteen eighteen means yes it is divisible by s nine because the digital root is nine look at question number two without dividing select and write down the numbers which are divisible by three so what's the condition we find out the digital root if it is three six nine the number is divisible by three so we'll look at the digital root eight one eight plus one nine so nine means divisible so you can select eighty-one hundred and two one plus zero plus two you get three that's also divisible by 3 164 1 plus 6 plus 4 7 plus 4 11 11 means again 1 plus 1 that's 2. not divisible so you can't select that 189 10 18 that means 1 plus 8 9. so that's divisible by 3 189 352 3 5 2 8 8 plus 2 10 that means 1 plus 0 that's 1. so you can't select 352. 372 372 99 plus 3 12 12 means 1 plus 2 you get 3 that means okay 372 466 466 12 12 4. sixteen one plus six that's seven so you can't take 466 756 75 six eleven eleven plus seven eighteen one plus eight nine that's divisible by three so 756 is also okay 951 951 15 15 means one plus five that's also possible so 951 also divisible by 3 last one 1 plus 0 plus two plus nine ten twelve twelve means two plus one three that's also divisible by 3. so 1029 is divisible by 3. so these are the numbers that are divisible by three question number three 3 divides the number 6 5 something such as 2 digits suitable for the empty space so what's the condition the digital root should be 3 6 or 9. what's 6 plus 5 11 11 means 1 plus 1 that's 2. so you need one more to get the digital root 3 so you can put 1 here so 651 you get digital root three then another one if this is six also it's divisible by three how you get six what's the next number you need to add this is 2 3 4 5 6 4 digit number you have to add so what's the other number 6 5 4 check 11 11 plus 4 15 means 1 plus 5 you get 6 as a digital root so that's possible so either 1 or 4 you can put you can check like that till you get nine also possible four five six six another three you can put seven also then six plus five eleven eleven plus seven eighteen that means 9 that's also possible 1 4 and what's the other number 7 6 plus 3 so that's 7. question number 4 pencils were brought to be distributed among nimal's friends on his birthday party the number of pencils was less than 150 but close to it nimal observed that each friend could be given nine pencils what is the maximum number of pencils that maybe may have been brought so from this we identify the number should be divisible by nine and as well as it is less than 150 so what's the condition to identify whether it is divisible by 9 the digital root should be equal to 9 now we'll 
,check with first the number less than 150 means 149 and c what's the digital root 1 plus 4 plus 9. you get 13 plus 1 14 again 1 plus 4 that's 5. we'll take another number to see the pattern 148 1 plus 4 plus 8 13 that means 1 plus 3 you get 4 so likewise now you need to get digital root 9 what are the possibilities you are getting the next number three two one zero zero means that's divisible by nine so till you get this number you have to find out so 148 here so this becomes 147 146 145 144 so we'll check 144 what's the digital root of 144 1 plus 4 plus 4 you get 9 digital root 9 and the number is less than 150 so what is the number number is 144 pencils question number five the following quantities of items were brought to make gift packs to be given to the winners of a competition 131 exercise books 130 pencils 128 platinums and 131 ballpoint pens if each gift pack should contain three units of each item write down the minimum extra amount needed from each item so that means this these numbers should be divisible by 3. so we'll take the first one exercise book exercise books 131 what what's the digital root 1 plus 3 plus 1 4 4 plus 1 
,5. how you check whether the number is divisible by 3 the digital root should be three six nine so to get six here you need one more exercise book so need one more exercise book to get digital roots now we'll look at pencils pencils 130. then 130 pencils means 1 plus 3 plus 0 3 plus 1 4 digital root is 4 what should be the digital root to see the number is divisible by 6 you need 2 more so to get the number divisible by three you need two more pencils so here you need two more pencils there now we'll look at the next one 128 platinum pens 128 plating no what's the digital root of this 1 plus 2 plus 8 10 10 plus 1 11 that means 1 plus 1 you get 2. so you need digital root 3 so you need one more platinum so you need one more now what's the other one we did platinums now 131 ballpoint pens 131 ball point pence so what's the digital root there 1 plus 3 plus 1 4 4 plus 1 5 to get 6 you need one more ball point so those are the items that need extra to get a number divisible by 3 exercise 4.2 from the following select and write down the numbers which are divisible by 6 which are divisible by 4. so we'll do the first part divisible by 6. so what's the condition it should be any one number because it's divisible by 2 then if the digital root is 3 6 9 it's divisible by 3 then definitely it's divisible by 6. 
,so here we can cross out this one that's odd number this one this one those three because those are odd numbers not divisible by 2 now we'll take the digital root 1 
,62 1 plus 6 plus 2 9. so that means it's divisible by 2 as well as 3. so this is correct 912 9 plus 1 plus 2 12 12 means 2 plus 1 3 that's also correct 966 9 plus 6 
,plus 6 9 plus 6 15 15 plus 6 21 2 plus 1 3 that's also possible 2 1 one eight two plus one plus one plus eight twelve that's two plus one three it's also possible two four seven two two plus four six six plus seven thirteen thirteen plus two fifteen fifteen means 6 so that's also possible 3024 3 plus 0 plus 2 plus 4. four plus two six six plus three nine so that's also divisible by three and two three three naught eight three plus three plus zero plus eight eleven eleven plus three fourteen fourteen means one plus four that's five not divisible three three three two nine nine plus 2 11 that means 2 not divisible 4 800 is 4 plus 8 12 12 means 1 plus 2 3 that means it's divisible by 3 so these are the numbers divisible by 2 and 3 therefore it's divisible by 6. now we'll take part 2. now we want to check whether this is divisible by 4 how we identify whether this is divisible by 4 you have to take the last two digits 62 is it divisible by 4 4 times 1 4 for 22 that's not divisible so you can't take that 87 it's not divisible by 4 12 yes it's divisible by 4 so 912 is divisible by 4. 66 last two digits you have to check 4 times 1 4 26 it's not divisible this one 18 not divisible by 4 23 not divisible by 4 72 2 times 4 times 1 4 32 4 times 8 that's divisible by 4 so 2 4 7 2 is divisible by 4 41 again not divisible by 4 24 yes it is divisible by 4 4 times 6 so 3024 is also divisible by 4 0 8 yes divisible by four three three not eight thirty two yes it's divisible by four four thousand eight hundred years when you get zero zero it's divisible by four so the other number divisible by four is four thousand eight hundred so these numbers are divisible by four question number two write the following numbers in the appropriate column of the table given below a number may be written in both column 
,1 and 2 1 and 3. so you need to check number of which 4 is a factor that means divisible by 4 and here reason numbers of which 6 is a factor and give the reason so what's the reason to identify it's a factor of four last two digit last two digits should be divisible by four that's the condition for divisibility of 4 what about 6 what's the reason reason is it should be an even number it should be an even number and the digital root should be three six nine if it's satisfied we can say this 
,is divisible by six now we'll check each one 348 last two digits 48 so divisible by 4 now check whether it's divisible by 6 it's an even number what's the digital root eight plus four twelve twelve plus three twelve plus three fifteen fifteen means one plus five six so digital root is there so you can write this number again here 496 96 is it divisible by 4 4 times 2 yes it is divisible by 4 what about the digital root 9 plus 6 15 15 plus 4 19 so it's not divisible by three 288 yes it is divisible by four what about divisible by three even number okay but what's the digital root 8 and 8 16 16 plus 2 18 18 means 1 plus 8 9 that's okay so that's divisible by 3 as well so definitely it is divisible by 6 414 it's not divisible by last two digits not divisible by four what's a digital root four plus four eight eight plus one nine and also an even number it's divisible by six thousand twenty four it's divisible by 20 uh it's divisible by 4 because last two digits 24 divisible by 4. digital root 4 plus 2 6 6 plus 1 7 it's not divisible by 3 so then it's not divisible by 6 as well this one 72 yes it's divisible by 4 4 times 1 4 32 that's eight so thousand two hundred and seventy two then digital root seven plus two nine nine plus two eleven eleven plus one twelve two plus one three so that's divisible by 6 
,as well 306 not divisible by 4 because last 2 digit is not divisible by 4. digital root 6 plus 3 9 so that means divisible by 6 then we'll do the next one there so the other two numbers 200 other three numbers 258 58 not divisible by 4. so you can't write it there digital root 8 plus 2 10 10 plus 5 15 15 means 1 plus 5 6 yes it 
,is divisible by it is divisible by 6 so 258 so you can write down the same reason that we did before thousand eight last two digits eight that's divisible by 4. so that is here digital root 9 9 is divisible by 6 as 9 means divisible by 3 so definitely divisible by 6 as well 0 0 there are last two digits that means divisible by 4 digital root six plus seven thirteen three plus one four that's not divisible by three the number six two something and then six is divisible by both 4 and 6 find the suitable digit for the empty space what's the condition satisfy for 4 this should be the last two digits should be div divide by four this one six means divisible by six means which this should be an even number and the digital root should be 3 6 9. now it's easy to first find the digital root here 6 plus 2 plus 6 here 12 12 
,plus 2 fourteen fourteen means one plus four you get five you need to get digital root six or what's the other one nine possible when you take now you need one more 
,to get six so if we put 1 here definitely it's divisible by 4 as well because 16 is divisible by 4. can we find out another digit you need 3 not 3 4 to get 9 46 is it divided by 4 you can't put 4 there so only possibility is 6 2 1 6 question number four a drill team arranges themselves in the following manner on one location they form lines consisting of three members each and on another occasion line consisting of four members they also make circles of nine members each if the drill team must have more than 250 members more than 250 members use the divisibility rule to find the minimum number of members that could be in the t so that means the number 
,should be divided by 3 divided by 4 and divided by 9 without a remainder so how we identify without a remainder here digital root should be nine here also possible how you get four divided by four last two digits should be divisible by four so we check last two digits now we'll take more than 250 so 2 5 is there we'll check up to 259 2 plus 5 you get 7. now you need another 2 to that so if this is 2 you get 252 but now check whether last two digits divisible by 4 4 times 1 and 4 times 3 you can divide that by 4 as well so digital root 9 so what's the number it can be 252. and it says minimum number you can find several numbers more than that so minimum number is 252. question number five determine whether 126 is divisible by 2 3 4 5 6 9 and 10. 126 it's an even number can divided by two how we identify for three digital root one plus two plus six nine so that's okay so that means divided by 3 as well next one last two digits these two digits not divided by 4 so not divided by 4. 5 how we identify 5 here last digit should be either 0 or 5 so not divided by 5 six how we identify with this divided by six even number digital root should be three six nine digital root is nine so that means definitely it's divided by 6 without a remainder how we identify it is divided by 9 digital root is 9 so that's correct you can divide by 9 is it divisible by 10 no last digit should be zero so this is not divided by 10. so this is the end of part 1 in your textbook so what's the 
,divisibility rule if 2 divides the ones place digit of a whole number then that number is divisible by 2. basically that means an even number if the digital root of 
,a whole number is divisible by 3 then the number is divisible by 3. so 3 6 9. if the last two digits of a whole number consisting of two or more digits is divisible 
,by 4 then the whole number is divisible by 4. how we identify whether it's divisible by 5 the last digit once place digit should be 0 or 5. if a whole number is divisible by both 2 and 3 then it is divisible by 6. if the digital root of a whole number is 9 then that number is divided by 9. if one's place digit of a whole number 
,is 0 then the number is divisible by 10. so remember all these rules then you can identify whether any number is divisible by these numbers now exercise 4.3 factorize so how we find out the factors we'll take the first one you can divide and find the factors two times seven and two times five three times two three times five then five times five now we can see what are the factors 1 with 150 first and the last number always a factor it's divisible by 2. two times seventy-five then three times fifty and what else five times 30 and 6 times 6 times 25 and what is 10 15 you you can get 15 10 you do 10 10 times 50. so these are the factors of 105 so when you're asked to factorize you can find out what are the possible products now we'll take 204 what are the factors you can divide and see divide by 2 divide by 2 again 
,divide by 3 and 17. so i can write 204 as 1 times 204 it's divisible by 2. so i can write 2 times 102. then three times three times six eighteen for twenty-four three times eight sixty-eight it's divisible by four times 5 and 1 51 then it's divisible by 6 6 times 3 18 for twenty four six times four what else twelve two times two four four times three twelve twelve times seventy or 17 times 12 what tips then what about these two 17 times 2 34 17 times 3 51. so all these are we have already taken 4 4 times 3 12 12 also there so those are the factors of 200 165 you can divide by 3 divided by 5 and 11. so you can write 165 as 1 times 165 then 3 times 3 times 55 then 5 times 33 and what else 11 times 15 or 15 times 11. here again when you combine you get all the other numbers so those are the factors of 165 284 you can divide by 2 again so 2 times 7 1 so 71 is a prime number so you can divide by 71 that's 1. so what are the factors 284 to 1 times 284 then 2 times 142 then 4 times 
,71 and here what else when you multiply these two you get 142 and here 142. so that's all four that's all those are the factors of 284 write down the 10 factors of 770 below 100 770 we can divide by 2. and you can divide by 5 35 again 7 divide by 7 and you get 11 and 1. so what are the factors of 770 less than 100 you can write 
,1 2 then 5 7 11 what else then 5 times 2 10 you have let's start right 10 and then 11. five times to ten seven times two fourteen then seven times five thirty five then 55 11 times 5 what else 7 times 11 77 do we need more one two three four five six seven eight nine ten you need ten factors so those are the ten factors less than hundred write five multiples of 36 36 36 times 2 72 36 times 3 108 36 times 4 144 4 times 6 24 4 times 3 12 plus 2 40. then 5 5 times 6 30 3 there 5 times 3 15 plus 3 18. so those are the 5 multiples of 36 5 multiples of 112 so you are adding 112 so starting from 112 multiplied by 2 224 multiplied by 3 336 multiplied by 4 multiplied by 5 160 5 times 2 10 1 remaining 5 times 1 5 plus 1 6 and 5 times 1 5 right 5 multiples of 53 below 500. so first number is 53 multiplied by 2 multiplied by 
,3 multiplied by four again four times three twelve one remaining four times five twenty twenty-one five times this 5 times 3 15 1 remaining 5 times 5 25 plus 1 2 6 2 3 4 5 so those numbers are below 500. look at this question 180 chairs in an examination hall have to be arranged such that each row has an equal number of chairs if the minimum number of chairs that should be in a row is 10 and the maximum that could be in a row is 15. find how many possible ways there are to arrange the chairs so 180 just so check whether this number is divisible by 2 3 like that so here we'll start from this is 10 so the next number is 11. now look at 180 and see what are the factors of 180 divide by 2 divide by 2 and divide by 3 and divide by 5. so what are the factors so we can't take less than 10 so 180 we can write as if it's 10 10 with 18 so that's one possibility to arrange the chairs then 12 3 2 2 12 with 15 then what else 12 with 15 and 1 more 9 eighteen three times three nine nine times two eighteen with ten we did that another possibility fifteen we took it we need to get less than 15 18 you can't because 18 there that's all those are the possibilities can we get one more 2 times 2 four four times three twelve four times nine four times nine 36 so that's more than that so those are the only possibilities so here 12 times 15 or you can write as 15 times 12. so these are the rows the minimum number of chairs that should be in a row in a row it can be 10 12 or 15 chairs example number one write 63 as a product of its prime factors so what you do you divide and see 21 7 and 1 so what how can you write 63 3 times 3 times 7 or you can rewrite as 3 squared into 7. exercise 4.4 find the prime factors of each of the following numbers 81 you can divide by 3 27 divided by 3 divided by 3 again divided by 3. so you are only dividing by prime numbers so 81 you can write 3 3 3 3 4 times or 3 to the power 4 84 how can you divide divide by 2 divide by 2 again divide by 3. i can write 2 times 2 times 3 times 7 or 2 to the power 2 3 and 7 96 and divide by 2 divide by 2 again divide by 2 again again 2 2 and 3. one two three four five one two three four five and one three so you can write as two to the power one two three 5 into 3 those are the prime factors express each of the following numbers as a product of its prime factors 12. divisible by 2 and you get 3 here so 2 times 2 times 3 15 you can divide by three and five so three times five sixteen and divide by two 2 again 2 again and 2 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 18 you can divide by 2 and 3 and three so two times three and three so those are the prime factors twenty divided by 2 divided by 2 and 5. 2 times 2 times 5 28 divide by 2 divided by 2 again and 7 2 times 2 times 7. take 59 it's not divisible by any other number just 1 and 
,itself so that's a prime number so you can't write factors there so 1 and 59 so prime number because it's prime number only 1 and itself are factors 65 divisible by 
,five and thirteen so five times thirteen so you are asked to write in prime factors 5 and 13 both are prime factors 77 7 with 11. 7 times 11 91 you can divide by 7 and 13. so 7 into 30 exercise 4.5 find six factors of each of the following numbers by considering their prime factors divisible by two again two and five so you need six factors each of the following numbers by considering they are prime factors so you need prime not only prime factors any six factors so one is definitely a factor 2 then you get 4 and 5 what else 10 and 5 times 2 10 4 times 5 we did and 20 times 1 that's 20 6 factors are there 42 can divide by 2 divide by 3 and 7 so 1 is a 
,factor 2 3 7 and then you can do multiply 6 is also 5 and 2 times 7 14 is a factor one two three four five six you can write more 21 42 any number only you asked to 
,write 6 factors 70 divided by 2 divide by 5 and 7. so 1 is a factor 2 5 7 then 10 2 times 5 then what is 3 times or not three times five five times seven thirty five or seventy one and last number always are factors 84 divisible by 2 divisible by 2 again so 3 and 7. now what are the factors one is a factor two three seven and two times two four two times three six likewise you can write any number 4 times 3 12 then 21 any number but you need only 6 factors 66 divisible by 2 3 and 11. so 1 2 3 11 then 6 is a factor what else is 22 is the first box then 3 times 11 33 is a factor 66 so you can write 86 99 divided by 3 3 and 11. so 1 3 then 9 11. what is 11 times 3 33 and 9 times 9 times 11 1199 six factors are there example number one find the highest common factor of 72 108 we'll use three methods first one write down separate factors so 72 how can you write 72 divide and see you get 3 and 3 so 2 into 2 into 2 into 3 into 3 factors of 72 you can write like that what are the factors of 108 you can divide and see nine three three again so i can write two twice three tries what's the highest common factor so highest common factor you can take the common ones out one two and three here another three so what's the highest common factor let's see if 2 times 2 times 3 times 3. 2 times 2 4 4 times 3 12 12 times 3 36 so that's the highest common factor this is one method we'll take another method now we'll look at another method so what are the two numbers 72 and 108 72 and 108 we'll find out all the factors of 72. y then it's divisible by 2. when we have factors it's easy nine three times three one so two one two three then four six what else nine eight so we'll put eight first nine two times three six six times two twelve what else then six times three eighteen also possible eight times nine twelve and then two times two four four times two eight eight times three eight times three twenty-four twenty-four times three seventy-two so we can write down all the factors of 72. now we'll try to write down all the factors of 108. first we'll divide and see so what are the factors one two three then two times two four then two times three six then three times three nines what else 12 2 times 2 4 4 times 3 12 is a factor then 3 times 2 6 6 times 3 18 is a factor then 2 times 2 4 4 times 
,3 12 12 times 3 12 times 3 30 6 is also factor and 108 is the other one three times three nine nine times three 27 is also factor this way twenty three times three nine nine times three twenty seven 27 27 times 2 54 and then 108 now when you take all the factors what are common one 2 3 4 6 9 12 18 and here this is also divisible by 36 we forgot to write down 36 times 2. so 36 or so common seven to two and hundred other numbers are not common out of these common numbers what's the highest common factor out of these the highest one is 36 so that's the second method now we'll take another method so we can write 72 and 108 in a row and find out the common 
,factors we can divide both the numbers by 2. again by two now this one you can divide both the numbers by 3 again by 3. now we can't divide because 2 and 3 there are no common factors till you get these common factors and then you can multiply these common ones 2 times 2 times 3 times 3 9 9 times 2 18 18 times 2 36 so highest common factor is 36 so we did three ways to find out the highest common factor example number two three types of items were brought in the following quantities to be offered at an arms giving 30 cakes of soap 24 tubes of toothpaste 18 bottles of ointment 30 24 and 18. parcels were made such that each contain all three items every 
,parcel had the same number of items of a particular type what is the maximum number of parcels that can be made accordingly write down the quantity of each item in a single parcel so what you have to find out the highest common factor of 30 24 and 18. so what's the easiest way to do we can write down separately and see the common ones 30 how can you write and divide by two divide by three and five two times three times five twenty-four you can divide by 2 and do divide by 2 again 2 again and 3. so 2 times 2 times 2 times 3 then 18 how can you divide divide by two and three two times three times three now what are the common ones two three that's all so that means highest common factor is six that means you can make six parcels so six parcels are there so how many you can put in each parcel 30 divided by six so you can put in one parcel if it's one parcel what are the things six thirty divided by six five cakes of salt divided by six six times four twenty-four so six times four four what's that toothpaste and six you divide by this one 18 divided by six you get three three bottles of ointment three bottles of ointment so those are the things you can include in one parcel and you can make six puzzles like that exercise 4.6 fill in the blanks to obtain the highest common factor by writing down all factors of the given numbers factors of 8 1 2 4 and 8 factors of 12 1 divided by 2 divided by 3 4 and 6 and 12 factors common to 8 and 12 1 too common what is and what's the highest common factor out of all these three factors common factors 4 is the highest one part 2 54 written as a product of its prime factors so it's easy first 
,divide and see twenty-seven divided by three and divide by three so you can write two times three times three threes then what about 90 you can divide and see 45 and divide by 3 get 15 divide by 3 again 5 divide by 5 you get 1 2 times 3 twice and 5 and 72 how can you write 72 divide by 2 divided by 2 again 2 and 3 and 1. so 2 3 
,times and 3 twice now the highest common factor of all three numbers how can we find out we can use the common one two and here three and another three can you see another three there another three common so what's the highest common factor 2 times 3 6 6 times 3 80. so highest common factor of all three numbers is 18. find the highest common factor of each pair of numbers by writing down all their factors so you need to write down all factors and find out the highest one twelve what are the factors one two three four six what is then 12 50 what are the factors 1 3 5 and 15 now out of these what are the what's the highest one highest one three three is 
,the highest common factor next one 24 24 how can you write you can divide by one two then three four what is six six times two twelve and six times three eighteen six times four twenty four do we get do we get another one four times three twelve four times two eight six times four so that's all 24 what about 30 1 2 3 it's not divisible by 4 5 6 seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen so two times three six six times five thirty do we get 15 15 and 30 now see the highest one what's the highest common one six is the highest common one that's all so highest common factor is six 60 72 so we can find out all factors of 60 1 two and three it's divisible by four as well four five 6 what is 7 0 8 9 10 yes 10 is a factor 12 what else 12 times 5 13 14 15 is a factor 15 times 4 then 30 and 60 factors of 72 1 2 three if you can't figure out it's easy to do this way and find out okay so two three then four six what is eight you can multiply and see what are the other factors 
,8 9 9 times 2 18 is a factor but before that four four times three twelve what else six six times two twelve nine nine times two eighteen then 4 4 times 3 12 12 times 2 24 36 36 times 2 and 72. now what's the common one and the highest highest common factor look at carefully and see what's the highest one 24 not that 18 12 12 is this that's the highest one so that's the highest common factor so hcf is 12 this is not easy this way is the hardest one to find out the all factors and then find 
,the highest one it's easy to find out taking separate factors four and five four what are the factors one two and four five one and five so what's the highest one that's one highest common factor is one here 72 we did that before we do 96 divide by 2. divided by 2 again divide by 2 2 again and finally with 3. so what are the factors of 96 one two three four six then eight what else three four five six eight twelve twenty-four three times two six six times two twelve twelve times two twenty-four twenty-four times two forty-eight ninety-six did we miss anything 32 we missed that 32 16 we miss that and 16 times 3 it's 48 it's there now see from 72 this and it is what's the highest common factor 24 24 is there 72 32 is not there so 24 here and 24 here so highest common factor is 24 there now we'll do the last part 54 
,and 35 so 54 divided and see 2 times 2 4 7 and then you get 9 3 3. so what are the factors of 54 1 2 3 and then 2 times 3 6 9 then 9 times 2 18. what is 3 times 3 9 
,9 times 3 27 and then 54 times 1. check again 6 9 we wrote 9 times 2 18 yeah and 35 what are the factors of 35 1 and it's divisible by 5 7 and 35 only few factors are there so what's the highest one out of these 1 5 is not there 7 not there 35 so what's the highest common factor for these two that's only one so highest common factor is one look at question number three find the highest common factor of each pair of numbers by writing each number as a product of its prime factors so this is 
,the easiest way to find out the highest common factor so 24 you divide and see you get 2 times 6 again divide by 2 so you can write 2 times 2 times 2 times 3 36 how 
,can you write 2 times 18 9 3 times 3 2 times 2 times three times three so what's the common one two two three so what's the highest common factor two times two times three you get 4 times 3 12 45 3 times 50 3 times 5 and 5. so what are the prime factors of forty-five three three and five fifty-four you can divide by two you can 
,divide by three and another three finally from three again two times three times three times three now see the common factors three is common another three is common that's all so highest common factor is three times three that's nine thirty two forty eight 32 we know that 2 times 2 4 4 times 2 8 8 times 2 16 16 times 2 32 48 2 
,then you get 24 again divide by 2 12 divide by 2 6 divide by 2 again that's three you get three so what are the common factors two two two two so two four times so highest common factor is 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 that's 16 48 so 48 we have already done we can take that one two fours you get two four times and then 3. now we'll take 72 divide by 2 you get 36 36 divided by 2 18. 18 divided by 2 9 9 you can write 3 and 3. now what are the common factors 2 another 2 2 again and one three so what's the highest common factor two times two four four times two eight eight times three twenty four 18 and 36 18 how can you write 2 that's 9 3 and 3 36 divided by 2 you get 18. 18 divided by 2 again 9. 9 is 3 times 3. so what's the highest common factor you get 2 and three and another three so two times three six six times three eighteen so highest common factor is 80. find the highest common factor by any method you like so which one is the easiest using separate factors that's the easiest way to find out highest common factor eighteen you can write two times three times three twelve six six you can write two times three fifteen three times five now find out the common ones three so highest common factor is three twelve eighteen twenty four two six is two times three eighteen divided by two nine nine is three 
,times three twenty-four divided by two twelve twelve divided by two six six you can write two and three so what's the highest common factor here two is common three 
,is common two times three that's six 24 32 48 divided by 2 12. divided by 2 6 divided by 2 and 3. 32 we know that 2 5 times 48 divided by 2 you get 24 divided by 2 you get 12. divide by 2 you get 6 2 and 3. so what's the highest common factor 2 another 2 another 2 3 is not common so 2 times 2 times 2 that's 8. this one 18 27 36 
,2 times 9 9 is 3 times 3 27 3 3 times 36 divided by 2 18 divided by 2 9 9 is 3 times 3 what's the highest common factor 1 3 is common another 3 is common here that's all 3 times 3 that's 9. question number five a basket contains 96 apples and another basket contains 60 oranges 96 apples and 60 oranges if these fruits are to be packed into bags such that there is an equal number of apples in every bag and an equal number of oranges too in every bag and no fruits remain after they are packed 
,into the bags what is the maximum number of such bags that can be prepared so that means highest common factor of 96 and 60. so we'll find out so 96 divided by 2 you get 48 divide by 2 again 24. divided by 2 again 12 divided by 2 we get 6 that means 2 times 3. 60 divided by 2. 30. 30 divided by 2 15 15 divide by 3 get 5 then divide by 5 you get 60. so what's the highest common factor of these two numbers two two three two two three four times three twelve so that means we can make 12 bags so in one bag how many apples 96 divided by 12 what's the number eight eight apples and 60 divided by 12 you get five five oranges you can keep five oranges so how many bags twelve bags each 8 apples and 5 oranges example number 1 find the lowest common multiple of 8 6 and 16. how we find out the lowest common multiple we'll first find out all factors and see which one is the lowest eight how can you write 2 times 2 times 2 i can write 2 to the power 3 6 2 times 3 2 to the power 1 and 3 to the power 1 16 2 4 times so when you're finding lowest common multiple you take the different numbers with maximum power when you take 4 when you take 2 2 to the power 4 is the maximum what else 3 only once so the lowest common multiple is 2 to the power 4 is 16 times 3 48 so that's 48 now we'll use another method second method we can write 8 6 16 in a row and divide divide by 2 divide by 2 again here 3 you can't divide you write as it is divide by 2 again and divide by 2 till you get 1 you 
,have to divide divide by 3 so you get 1 1 1 now we multiply all these numbers that's the lowest common multiple 2 times 1 2 3 4 and 3. so you get the same answer 16 
,times 3 48 as the lowest common multiple example number two two bells ring at interval of six minutes and eight minutes respectively if they both ring together at eight a.m what time they will ring together again so we'll take all multiples of 6 first 6 12 18 24 30 36 6 times 6 6 times 7 42 what are 6 times 7 6 times 8 48 like that those are multiples of 6 multiples of 8 8 16 24 8 times 4 32 8 times 8 times 5 40 so like that now what's the common one when you look at carefully can you see 24 is the next common one so that means after 24 minutes it will ring again so 24 minutes that means what's the time 8 24 so it will ring at 8 24 8 now same thing second method so you need to find out the lowest common multiple of 6 and 8. so how we find out the lowest common multiple of 6 and 8 we write down like this divide by 
,2 divide by 2 again here 2 again and 3. till you get 1 you divide and multiply these two so lowest common multiple is 2 times 2 times 2 times 3 8 times 3 24 this is 
,in minutes so 8 plus 24 minutes means 8 24 it will ring again exercise 4.7 find the lowest common multiple of each of the following triples of numbers we can take at once and find out the lowest common multiple divide by 2 divide by 2 again divide by 2. divided by 3 and finally again by 3 so what's the lowest common multiple 2 times 2 4 4 times 2 8 8 times 3 24 24 times 3 3 times 4 12 1 remaining 3 times 2 6 plus 1 seventy two now this one eighteen eight fourteen and twenty eight divide by 
,two divide by 2 again divide by 2 and divide by 7. until you get 1 you have to divide so what's the lowest common multiple 2 times 2 times 2 8 8 times 7 you get 56 is the lowest common multiple 20 30 40. you can divide by 2 divided by two again divide by two divide by three and finally divide by 5 get all once so what's the lowest common multiple 2 times 2 4 4 times two eight five times three fifteen so eight times fifteen eight times five forty eight times one eight plus four twelve so hundred twenty nine twelve twenty seven you can divide by two divide by two again now you can divide by 3 3 again and 3 again so what's the lowest common multiple two times two four four times three twelve three times three nine twelve times nine hundred eight two three five you can divide by two divide by three and divide by five 
,so what's the lowest common multiple two times three times five six times five thirty thirty six 54 24 divide by 2 80 divide by 2 7 divided by 2 here 12 again divide by 2. can divide by 2 again i'll divide by 3. divide by 3 again and three again till you get one now what's the lowest common multiple two times two four four times two eight eight times three twenty four and three times 9. 9 times 4 36 3 remaining 9 times 2 18 plus 3 21. so the lowest common multiple is 216. question number two at a military function three cannons are fire at intervals of 12 seconds 16 seconds and 18 seconds respective if the three cannons are fired together initially after how many seconds will they will be they all be fired together again so how many seconds so that means we need to find out the lowest common multiple in seconds so we'll find out the lowest common multiple of 12 16 and 18. divide by two divide by two again divide by two divide by two divide by three and three again so what's the lowest common multiple two times two four four times two eight eight times two sixteen and three times three nine nine times 9 times 6 54 5 remaining 9 times 1 9 
,plus 5 that's 14. so after again 144 seconds again you can see the three can again three cannons at the same time miscellaneous exercise without dividing determine whether the number 30 35 343 is divisible by 3. how we find out digital root 3 plus 5 8 8 plus 3 11 11 plus 4 15 15 plus 3 18 means 1 plus 8 9. so digital root is 9. 
,so that's divisible by three four last two digits not divisible by four so that means not divisible by 4 what about 6 how we identify whether it's divisible by 6 it 
,should be an even number so this is not an even number so not divisible by 6 and 9 digital root is 9 so that's divisible by 9 as well fill in the blanks the highest 
,common factor of 2 and 3 what's the highest common factor there's no common factor so we write only one the lowest common factor of 4 and 12 what's the lowest common multiple of 4 and 12. you can find out 3 times 2 6 6 times 2 12 that's the highest number the highest common factor of two prime numbers is so like this always when you get two prime factors highest common factor is always one the lowest common multiple of two three and five two three again and five two times three six six times five thirty find the highest common factor and lowest common multiple of twelve 42 and 75 so we'll use the factor method because for highest common factor anyway we need the factors 12 2 times 6 6 you get 2 times 3 42 divide by 2 21 3 and 7. divide by 3 you get 25 that's 5 and 5. highest common factor we just see what's highest common ones only three lowest common multiple we can write down two twice and three ones here here two ones three ones and seven ones here you get three ones and five twice so for lowest common multiple you take different numbers with the highest power 2 when you take 2 to the power 2 is the highest 3 just 3 to the power 1 5 5 to the power 2 is the highest and you get 7 to the power 1. now multiply 4 4 times 3 12. 5 times 5 25 and 7. so 12 times 7 we'll multiply these two 84 times 25 what's 84 times 20 5 20 and 5 00 or 8 16. five times four twenty five times eight forty plus two forty two two thousand 100 is the lowest common multiple it is proposed 
,to distribute books among 45 students in a class such that each student receives no less than 5 books and no more than 10 books if this is 5 books what's the if this is 5 books how many books all together 45 into 5 225 and it is no more than 10 books if it's 10 how many books are there 400 so the number of books should be in between 225 and 450 but that should be divisible by 45 because there are 45 students so what's the lowest number it can be 225 then add 45 to that okay 10 7 270 then add 45 again 350 45 again 360. another 45 405 another 45 450 so the number of books can be in between 225 and 450 you can get any number here so we covered the second 
,part of chapter 4 in this lesson and what did we do we identify what are prime numbers and highest common factor lowest common multiple so we explained several methods to identify highest common factor and the lowest common multiple so you can choose the easiest one to solve problems

qc8LHRMs6FQ,today we will learn about factors first let us understand what we mean by the factor of a number let us take the number 12 to begin with let us find out the pairs of numbers that give 12 as their product 1 into 12 is equal to 12 2 into 6 is equal to 12 3 into 4 is equal to 12 so we get 3 pairs of numbers that give us the product 12 no other pair of numbers when multiplied will give the product 12 now let us take each pair of number separately and understand what it means let us take the first pair 1 into 12 is equal to 12 here when we divide 12 by 1 we get the quotient as 12 and when we divide 12 by 12 we get the quotient as 1 in both the cases the remainder is 0 thus it means that 12 is divisible by 1 and 12 pair to 2 into 6 is equal to 12 here when we divide 12 by 2 we get the quotient as 6 and if we divide 12 by 6 we get the quotient as 2 in both the cases the remainder is 0 thus it means that 12 is divisible by 2 and 6 pair 3 3 into 4 is equal to 12 here if we divide 12 by 3 we get the quotient as 4 and if we divide 12 by 4 we get the quotient as 3 here also we get the remainder as 0 in both the divisions thus it means that 12 is divisible by 3 and 4 thus we now understand that 12 is divisible by 1 2 3 4 6 and 12 hence we see that the numbers 1 2 3 4 6 and 12 are the factors of 12 hence we can define factor of a number as a number which exactly divides the given number or we can see that factors are numbers you can multiply together to get given number now 
,let us look at certain points which we need to understand related to a factor with the help of some examples point 1 1 is a factor of every number look at the examples 1 into 6 is equal to 6 8 divided by 1 is equal to 8 thus 1 multiplied by any number gives the number itself as the product and any number divided by 1 also gives 
,the number itself as the quotient hence we conclude that 1 is a factor of every number point to every number is a factor of itself we know that 6 into 1 is equal to 
,6 8 divided by 8 is equal to 1 thus any number multiplied by 1 gives the number itself as the product and any number divided by itself gives 1 as the quotient hence 
,every number is a factor of itself 3 the factor of a number is always less than or equal to the number look at the factors of 12 which we found out earlier they are 
,1 2 3 4 6 and 12 note that the factors 1 2 3 4 & 6 are less than 12 and the last factor 12 is equal to 12 thus it shows that the factor of a number is always less than or equal to the number for every number except one has at least two factors one and the number itself let us look at the factors of 7d are one and seven no other 
,pair of numbers when multiplied together will give the product seven that is the number seven has at least two factors one and seven that is number one and the number seven itself hence we can see that every number except one has at least two factors one and the number itself do remember these points properly they will help you 
,to find the factors as we go further now let us find the factors of one more number let us take the number 30 the pairs of numbers which give the product 30 are 1 into 30 is equal to 30 2 into 15 is equal to 33 into 10 is equal to 30 5 into 6 is equal to 30 thus the factors of 30 are 1 2 3 5 6 10 15 and 30 now look at these factors and remember these points 1 a factor of a number exactly divides that number to one is a factor of every number three every number is a factor of itself for the 
,factor of a number is always less than or equal to the number five every number except one has at least two factors one and the number itself wasn't it easy to learn about factors why don't you try to find the factors of some numbers yourself

pcluEJNUNao,"introduction you are at an ATM Center with your father you see a message on the screen that says this machine disperses money in multiples of 1000 you ask your father what the message means he says it means that he can either withdraw 1,000 or 2,000 or 3,000 but not 1,500 2700 or 3,800 you return home confused you're also curious to know more about multiples in this lesson you will learn about factors and multiples in detail objectives at the end of this lesson you'll be able to define factors and multiples list some interesting facts about factors and multiples define perfect numbers define co-prime numbers understand highest common factor HCF understand least common multiple LCM define even and odd numbers define Co prime numbers a factor of a number is an exact divisor of that number in other words the factor of a number divides the number exactly for example numbers 1 2 5 and 10 are all exact divisors of 10 therefore 1 2 5 and 10 a factors of 10 similarly 1 2 4 & 8 are exact divisors of 8 therefore 1 2 4 & 8 a factors of 8 you can see that factors are always smaller than or equal to the number itself number ten is the product of two "
,and five it is also a product of one and ten therefore ten is a multiple of one to five and ten similarly number eight is a product of one and eight or two and four 
,therefore eight is a multiple of one two four and eight thus we can say that a number is a multiple of each of its factors multiples are always greater than or at least equal to the number itself let us revise factors and multiples with the help of an interesting activity one collect some wooden strips each five units long to join them and to end as shown in the figure it is clear from the figure that the numbers 5 10 15 20 and 25 are multiples of 5 each of these numbers is greater than or 
,equal to 5 5 is a factor of 5 10 15 20 and 25 5 is equal to or smaller than each of these numbers a number the sum of whose factors is equal to twice the number itself is a perfect number for example 1 2 3 & 6 a factors of 6 the sum of the factors 1 2 3 & 6 is 12 which is the same as 2 times the number 6 hence 6 is a perfect number similarly the factors of 28 are 1 2 4 7 14 and 28 the sum of the factors is 56 which is the same as 2 times 28 therefore 28 is also a perfect number here are some interesting facts about factors and multiples 1 is a factor of every number every number is a factor of itself the smallest factor of a number is 1 and the largest is the number itself every factor of a number is an exact divisor of that number every factor is less than or equal to the given number they are finite factors of a given number every number is a multiple of itself the smallest multiple of a number is the number itself every multiple of a number is greater than or equal to that number there are infinite multiples of a given number let us take some numbers in pairs and observe their factors look at the numbers 4 and 32 the factors of 4 are 
,1 2 & 4 the practice of 32 are 1 2 4 8 16 and 32 the fact is 1 2 & 4 are common to both 4 & 32 hence they are called common factors consider the numbers 7 & 9 the factors of 7 are 1 & 7 the factors of 9 are 1 3 & 9 1 is the only common factor between 7 & 9 therefore 7 & 9 are co-prime numbers if two numbers have only 1 as the common factor they are called go prime numbers take a look at the multiples of 9 and 27 27:54 81 etc are multiples of both 9 and 27 hence 27:54 8 1 etc are the common 
,multiples of 9 and 27 now that you know what common factors are let us find the highest common factor of two numbers consider two numbers 28 and 32 the factors of 28 are 1 2 4 7 14 and 28 the factors of 32 are 1 2 4 8 16 and 32 the common factors are 1 2 & 4 it is clear that the highest common factor among these number is 4 therefore the highest common factor HCF of two or more given numbers is the highest or greatest of their common factors it is also known as greatest common divisor or GCD she call that common multiples of two numbers are those numbers which are multiples of both the numbers let us now use this knowledge to find the least common multiple of two numbers consider the two numbers 12 and 18 the multiples of 12 are 12 24 36 and so on similarly the multiples of 18 are 18 36 54 72 and so on the common 
,multiples of both the numbers are 36 72 and so on but 36 is the smallest among these therefore 36 is the LCM of 12 and 36 the least common multiple LCM of two or more given numbers is the least or smallest of their common multiples do you observe any pattern in the numbers 2 4 6 8 10 12 and so on you'll find that each of them is a multiple of 2 the numbers which are multiple of 2 are known as even numbers the rest of the numbers 1 3 5 7 9 11 and so on are called odd numbers summary let us summarize what we have learned a factor of a number is an exact divisor of that number the largest factor of a number is the number itself every factor of a number is less than or equal to the number itself the smallest multiple of a number is the number itself every multiple of a number is greater than or equal to that number if two numbers have only one as a common factor they are known as Co prime numbers if the sum of the factors of a number is equal to twice the number itself such a number is called a perfect number the highest common factor at CF of two or more given numbers is the highest of their common factors the least common multiple LCM of two or more given numbers is the lowest of their common multiples

yJ-T8z2-Zg4,factors for the first time in this short tutorial you will find out what factors are and how to find factors using multiplication factors are whole numbers that you 
,multiply together to get another number so in this example two times five is ten the factors are two and five you will often be given a number and told to list all its factors well you could just think of any numbers that multiply together to give 12 in this example but a better plan is to use the same simple way every time take a look the first thing you do is find the simplest way of multiplying to 12 and you start with 1 so 1 and the number itself are always the first factors you list right the factors down in pairs 1 here and 12 over here we will fill in the space between with other factors as we go along for each factor pair use an arc to show which factors multiply together it helps keep your thinking clear and stops you from accidentally forgetting to write a factor down ok now you try 2 times number to make 12 well 2 times 6 is 12 list the 2 and the 6 and put the arc in then 3 times a number 3 times 4 is 12 list the 3 and the 4 put the arc in 3 & 4 are consecutive numbers so we know we finish because there's no whole number between those two we've just found all the factors of 12 notice that because we worked from the outside in 
,the factors are in order this is the clearest way of showing all the factors of a number and using the arc for each factor pair shows you're thinking we'll do one more example we'll find the factors of 16 start with one and the number itself 1 + 16 use the ark now go to to two times number well 2 times 8 is 16 what about three times a number is three a factor well 3 times 5 is 15 we can't get to 16 3 is not a factor of 16 now 4 times a number 4 times 4 is 16 when a number is multiplied by itself like before times 4 we just put it in the factor listing once without any ark and there are no more factors we found them all when you're listing all the factors of a number remember always start with 1 and the number itself with a good space between then using multiplication try 2 times 3 times 4 times 5 times a number and up and when your numbers meet in the middle you have finished always use the arc to show your thinking and now it's your turn to practice have fun with this and become fantastic at factors created using powtoon

XGbOiYhHY2c,"Hi and welcome to Math Antics. In this video, we’re gonna learn something called ‘prime factorization’. Wow! That sounds pretty complicated, doesn’t it?  But don’t worry, it’s not that bad. Now from the name “prime factorization”, you can probably guess that it involves factoring like we learned about in the last video. But what about this word “prime” here?  What does that mean? Well, to help you understand that, let’s use what we learned in the last video to factor the number 7. Well let’s see…  We could get 7 by adding 3 and 4, but factoring’s not about what you can ADD to get a number, it’s about what you can MULTIPLY. Well, since I can’t think of "
,"any numbers that would work, let’s find factors by ‘testing for divisibility’. Now I’m going to do this really fast using my calculator. Let’s see… Okay, here’s the "
,"numbers I got. That’s interesting… the only two numbers that didn’t leave remainders were 1 and 7.  And those are kinda obvious! We know that if you multiply ANY number by 1, you’ll just get that same number. But why aren’t there any OTHER factors of 7? Alright, here’s why…  7 is a special kind of number called a PRIME number. Now a prime numbers is just a number that has exactly two factors: itself and 1. There’s a lot of prime numbers. Here’s a list of all the prime numbers that are less "
,"than 20: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17 and 19. They’re the one’s you’ll use most often. Now some of you might be wondering why 1 isn’t on the list of prime numbers. Well, 1 is a lot like a prime number, but for some technical reasons, it’s not considered prime. Okay, so in a way, prime numbers are just special numbers that you can’t factor. Well, unless you use the obvious factors of 1 and the number itself. But what’s so special about prime numbers anyway?  Why do we need to know about them? Well, prime numbers are like the building blocks of all the other whole numbers. In fact, whole numbers that are not prime are called ‘composite’ numbers  because they’re composed of primes. That means that you can get them by multiplying prime numbers together. Here’s a good way to see how that works. Again we’ll list all the prime numbers that are less than 20. And now let’s list at all the composite numbers that are less than 20 over here. The 1st composite number is 4, and you get 4 by multiplying the primes 2 × 2 The next composite number is 6, and you get it by multiplying the primes 2 × 3 And the next composite number is 8, which you get by multiplying the primes 2 × 2 × 2 And the composite number 9 can be made by multiplying the primes 3 × 3 We could keep going like this and you would see that ALL the composite numbers are made by multiplying different combinations of prime numbers together. And each of these combinations is called the “prime factorization” of its composite number. AH… so the ‘prime factorization’ is a THING. It’s the set of prime numbers that you multiply together to get another number. That’s true, but you can also use the term ‘prime factorization’ as an ACTION to describe how we find out what prime numbers a composite number is made of. And that’s what we’re gonna do next. We’re gonna use prime factorization (the action) to find the prime factorization (the set of prime factors) for the number 12. And that just means that we’ll continue to factor 12 until all the factors are prime numbers. Now to do this, I’m gonna use something called a ‘factor tree’. A factor tree is just a diagram that helps you keep track of multiple factoring steps. When you factor a number, you write the two factors below it with lines (or branches) going to them. And then, if you factor one of the factors, you do the same thing again. You’ll see how it works as we do this example, so let’s get started. 12 can be factored into 2 × 6.  So we’re done, right?  Well not yet. Because we’re doing PRIME factorization, we need to keep going until all the factors are prime numbers. So let’s see if they are. Well we know that 2 is a prime number, but is 6 prime? No it’s not because 6 can be factored into 2 × 3. And both 2 and 3 ARE prime numbers, so now we’re done factoring. And if "
,"we bring down that 2 that we had from the first factoring step, we can see that the prime factorization of 12 is 2 × 2 × 3. Now I know what some of you are thinking. “I didn’t want to factor 12 into 2 × 6.  I wanted to factor it into 4 × 3.” Well okay then, let’s try it that way. This time we’ll start by factoring 12 into 4 × 3. But remember, we need to keep factoring until all our factors are prime numbers. So let’s see… are 4 and 3 prime numbers? Well, 3 is prime, but 4 is not.  4 can be "
,"factored into the primes 2 × 2. And again, if we bring down that 3 from the first step, we see that we have 3 prime factors for 12, and they’re the EXACT same ones that we got the first time. That means, no matter which way you start factoring, as long as you factor all the way down to prime numbers, you’ll always end up with the same group of prime factors. Let’s try just one more to make sure you’ve got it.  Let’s find the prime factorization of 42. Well, for the first step of our factoring, I see that 42 is an even number, so that means that we can divide it by 2 to get our first 2 factors. So 42 divided by 2 equals 21, so we can factor 42 into 2 × "
,"21. Okay, 2 is prime, so we can’t factor it anymore.  But what about 21? Well, if you’ve memorized your multiplication table, you might recognize that 21 is one of the answers on it. You can get 21 by multiplying 3 × 7, so we can factor 21 into 3 × 7. And if you didn’t remember that, you could have just done some divisibility tests and you would have figured it out. Okay, so what about the 3 and 7?  Well, they’re both prime, so that means that we're done factoring. We bring down the 2 from "
,"the first step and we can see that the prime factorization of 42 is 2 × 3 × 7. Alright… now you know what prime numbers are, and you know how to use prime factorization to find the set of prime factors that a composite number is made of. And that set of numbers is ALSO called its prime factorization. (just to confuse you) As usual, it’s important to practice what you’ve learned in this video so that you’ll get good at it. And you can practice by doing the exercises for this section. Good luck and thanks for watching Math Antics.  See you next time. Learn more at www.mathantics.com"

1oQTriXR_Iw,hi guys i'm katie from how to become welcome back to my videos for basic maths focus for this video is multiples and factors now before I get started don't forget to subscribe for my whole range of basic math videos please leave comments share my video and give it a like okay so what am I going to teach you so I'm going to teach you what are multiples and what are factors how to work out the lowest common multiple and how to work out the highest common fracture okay so what are multiples so for this it's best that you learn your times tables so multiples basically means your times tables okay so that's why I'm telling you to make sure you know your times tables off by heart so I've given you a quick grid for your multiplications okay so of course you probably know all of these by now but if you don't this is just 
,to recap and refresh your memory okay so what aren't multiples so the best way to teach you is by example so the multiples of three so think your three times tables 
,so got 1 times 3 is 3 2 times 3 is 6 3 times 3 is 9 4 times 3 is 12 and so on so the multiples of 3 are 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 and so forth okay so it's basically just recalling and reciting your 3 times tables let's take a look at another example so the multiples of 8 so again think your 8 times tables so we've got 1 times 8 is 8 2 
,times 8 is 16 3 times 8 is 24 4 times 8 is 32 so multiples of 8 are 8 16 24 32 40 48 56 and so forth okay so what are factors okay so again you will also need to think your times tables so factors and numbers that divide exactly into another number so let me make this clearer with an example so the factors of 12 so you need to find all the numbers that can be divided into twelve so we've got 1 times 12 is 12 2 times 6 is 12 3 times 4 is 12 so in ascending order the factors of 12 are 1 2 3 4 6 and 12 ok because all of these numbers can be divided into 12 so let's take a look at another example so the factors of 60 so what numbers can be divided into 60 
,so we've got 1 times 60 or 62 times 30 is 60 3 times 20 is 60 4 times 15 is 60 5 times 12 is 60 and 6 times 10 is 60 so in ascending order the factors of 60 are 1 2 
,3 4 5 6 10 12 15 20 30 and 60 okay because all of these numbers can be divided into 60 okay so the lowest common multiple so the lowest common multiple is the smallest number that is shared by two or more numbers so let's use an example so the lowest common multiple of nine and four so first of all you need to do the first view 
,and nine times tables so I've gone up to 90 here and again you do it for the other number so I've gone up to 40 for the four times table and then you need to find a 
,number that they both share which is the smallest common multiple so as you can see both numbers have 36 and this is the lowest common multiple that both 9 and 4 share so the lowest common multiple of 9 is 9 and 4 is six so the highest common factor so to work out the highest common factor need to work out the factors for each number and then work out which number appears for both ie it's the highest common factor so the highest common factor of 24 and 18 so here are your FAC factors for 24 so we've got one two three four six eight twelve twenty-four and four 18 we've got 1 2 3 6 9 and 18 so you need to find the highest common factor okay as you can see 6 éclairs in both sets of numbers and it's the highest common factor that both of these numbers share so the highest common factor of 24 and 18 is 6 okay so hopefully now you have a better understanding of multiples and factors for more practice questions we have a fantastic guide and offer and can be purchased by clicking on

zNHzy8VKWtI,hello everyone I hope all of you are doing good and today I am here with a video on playing with numbers plus six months now we are going to learn about a very very 
,very basic concept of mathematics but a very important one and that is factors and multiples since our childhood days we have been learning about tables as in table 
,of 2 2 1 2 2 2 2 the 4 2 3 so 6 2 4 8 and so on similarly table of 3 4 5 6 and so on now is the time that we go back and look at those tables again and try to understand which one is a factor and which one is a multiple of a given number now trust me guys this is going to be a very interesting video and a very important one most importantly yeah so stay focused and let's get started so here in this lesson our target is to learn tricks to answer such complicated questions quickly so we will 
,play around with numbers on the screen you see there are some complicated questions which I do not say that you cannot solve and you definitely can but you would need time to do these kind of big divisions to decide whether but whether such a big number you get this number such a huge number and somebody asks you whether it is an even number or odd number so it's difficult to you know to tell these answers quickly but that is our target in this lesson so let us start with the first concept 
,of this chapter that is factors and multiples so what are factors factor is an of a number is an exact division of that number now you might ask what is a division now let's see now let us say that we are dividing two numbers so let us take an example here to understand desert division let's say that I have written 4/3 that means 4 is the number which is being divided by 2 so in this case du is the divisor and food is the dividend so whichever number is being divided that is dividend and by which number it is divided that is division so how do you divide you divided something like this two twos are four so on you get you get zero so here two is the divisor four is the dividend two is the quotient and zero is the remainder so these are the four terms that we use when we perform division operation now a factor is an exact divisor of a number exact divisor would mean that when when that number is divided by this number the remainder will be zero so if that is the meaning of exact division exact division means that the number will be exactly divisible by that number leaving no remind remainder behind so let us look at a few examples so let us let's start with the smaller numbers let's start with one now which number is an exact divisor of one that means if one is the dividend which is that number which 
,will be a divisor such that the remainder will be zero so what would be that number so that number would actually be 1 because 1 into 1 is 1 so therefore 1 is an exact divisor of 1 so we can say 1 is a factor of 1 now let us consider the next number that is - what about - now - 4 - 1 is an exact division because if you divide by one like 2/1 would be something like this so one user - so the reminder is 0 so one is an exact equation 2 is also an exact divisor because if you do 2 divided by 2 what do you get this is how you do it so 2 ones or to say here also this is an executive easel so basically 1 & 2 are factors of 2 and that is why this 2 can be written as 1 into 2 this can also be written as 2 into 1 right because if one divides 2 exactly that means 1 multiplied by something should be equal to 2 and that something is 2 right let's let's look at the next number that is 3 so in case of 3 1 again is an exact division do you think that 3 2 would be an exact division no that's because if you divide 3 by 2 what happens you see that you get one as a remainder that means 2 is not an exact divisor of 3 so 1 & 3 are the exact division of 3 so 
,this can be written as 1 into 3 this can be written as 3 into 1 now whenever a particular number is an exact divisor or a factor then that factor will be multiplied 
,with some other number to get this number let's talk about 4 4 is going to be a little different in case of 4 1 is a factor because 1 into 4 is 4 do you think 2 is a factor yes because 2 into 2 is 4 do you think 3 is a factor no 3 is not a factor what about 4 is 4 a factor yes because 4 into 1 is 4 so 1 2 & 4 these are the factors of 4 let's talk about 5 same ease of 5 1 is a factor because it can be written as 1 into 5 is 2 a factor no three no four no what about 5 yes 5 into 1 is equal to so 5 is also a factor let's look at 6 in case of 6 1 is a factor because 1 into 6 is equal to 6 2 is also a factor because 2 into 3 is equal to 6 3 is also a factor because 3 into 2 is equal to 6 what about 4 no four is not a factor 5 is also not a factor but 6 is a factor because 6 into 1 is equal to 6 therefore 1 2 3 & 6 are 
,the factors of 6 so basically whenever we see a factor of a number that means we are basically talking about that exact diesel of that number now another interesting thing that you will all be observed is that the factor of a number will always be either less than the number or equal to the number it can never be greater than the number for example here let's say the number is 6 so what are the factors that we have 1 2 3 & 6 you do you think that you can have any number which is greater than 6 as factor of 6 do you think that 12 can be a factor of 6 no it cannot be because if you divide 6 by 2n what happens 12 divided by 6 so what do you get you will get a result in decimals right so basically when you talk about factors of numbers we are talking about exact divisor so we are not talking about decimals we are talking about whole numbers so they will not get any visible by whole numbers and therefore bigger numbers cannot be factors so a factor of a number is always less than 
,or equal to that number so this is another very very important concept of factor now let us look at factors of some bigger numbers let us look at bigger numbers for 
,example let's consider 12 now if I ask you to find the factors of 12 not well comparatively a bigger number than one to be three or four so what about 12 now let's start from one do you think that one is a factor of 12 yes of course because if you divide 12 by one it will be exactly divisible so one is a factor 2 yes 2 is also a factor 3 3 is also a factor now why 1 is a factor because 1 into 12 is 12 why 2 is a factor because 2 into 6 is 12 why 3 is a factor because 3 into 4 is 12 4 yes 4 
,is a factor because 4 into 3 is 12 what about 5 is 5 a factor no because 5 doesn't divide 12 exactly what about 6 that's true 6 into 2 is 12 so 6 is also a factor what about 7 no 7 is not a factor 8 no 9 no then no what about 11 no what about 12 yes 12 again is a factor because 12 into 1 is 12 so this way we see now why didn't we go beyond 12 because we know that a factor of a number is either equal to 1 less than that number so factor of 12 can either be equal to 12 or less than 12 it cannot be greater than 12 so we went only up to plan so we won't do it but what did we find we find that 1 2 3 4 6 and 12 are the factors of the number 12 let's look at 
,number 13 now if you do the same thing for 13 you would see that 1 and 13 these are the only factors of 13 that's because the only possible ways of writing 13 is 1 into 13 or 13 is 2 1 so these are the only two factors let's talk about another number like 15 what do you say about 15 what again you write the same list of numbers 
,and you would realize that 1 3 5 and 15 these are the factors that's because 1 into 15 is 15 3 into 5 is 15 5 into 3 is 15 and 15 into 1 is 15 let's talk about another number like 24 so for 24 again we have a lot of factors like 1 is a factor 2 is also a factor because 2 into 12 is 24 3 is also a factor because 3 into 8 is 24 4 
,is also a factor because 4 into 6 is 24 5 no 5 is not a factor 6 yes 6 into 4 is 24 7 no 7 and not a factor 8 yes because 8 into 3 is 24 9 no what about 10 no 11 no 
,12 yes 12 again is a factor because 12 into 2 is 24 and after 12 again none of the numbers a factor and directly 24 is the factor because 24 into 1 is 24 so from this list and you're observing certain things we observe one thing we observe this a factor has to be an exact divisor of that particular number second thing that we observed is factor of a number is always less than or equal to the number the another thing that you would observe is 1 is a factor of all numbers you see whichever number we have considered everywhere we saw that 1 is a factor of that number and another observation is that the number itself is also a factor of that number you see 12 is a factor of 12 13 is a factor of 13 15 is a factor of 15 24 is a factor of 24 and so on so that means that one and the number itself these two are factors for every numbers let's now talk about multiples now a number is said to be a multiple of each of its factors not very interesting factors and multiples are very closely related so it is something like this let's say that you have a sister so what will you be to your sister you will be your sister's brother and she will be your she will be a brother sister and you will be a sister's brother so how is the relation language so let's see that the name of your sister is Sabrina and let's say that 
,your name is son so this means that Rena is sister of Sonny and Sonny is brother of Rena so that's the relation right so in a similar way if you see that say tooth is a factor of 12 that would mean that 12 is a multiple of 2 so that is how the relation is so let's say 2 and 12 so if we see that 2 is a factor of 12 then we will have to say that 12 is a multiple of 2 so a number is always a multiple of each of its factors so let us understand this with examples now we had seen in the previous slide that for any number let's if a number 3 we have how many factors it has 2 factors 1 and 3 right why because 3 can be written as 1 into 3 it can also be written as 3 into 1 so this means what does this mean this means that 3 is a much people of 1 3 is also a multiple of 3 so 3 is a multiple of 1 3 is a multiple of 3 similarly if you take number 4 so 4 can be written as 1 into 4 it can be written as 2 into 2 it can also be written as 4 into 1 so it has 3 factors that is 1 2 and 4 so that means that 4 is multiple of 1 2 and 4 let's talk about 6 so what are the factors that 6 has so 1 into say X 2 into 3 3 into 2 6 into 1 so one two three six these 
,are the factors of six so this means that six is multiple of one two three and six so this is the meaning of multiple now let us try writing multiples of different numbers so let us start with the small small numbers let's comes let's start with two so how do we write multiple multiple what how do we write multiples multiple means variable you multiply a number to this number you would get another number so that would basically become its multiple for example if you multiply one to do you get 2 that means 2 is a multiple of 2 because 2 can be exactly divided by 2 similarly if you write 2 into 2 which is equal to 4 that means 4 is divisible by 2 that means 2 becomes a factor of 4 and 4 becomes a multiple of 2 so please understand this concept very carefully you know exact division of any number is called its factor right and the number which of which it is a factor is called its multiple so that that's the simple concept so in this case 2 into 2 is 4 that means 4 is a multiple of 2 and 2 is a factor of 4 because 2 is an exact division of 4 similarly if you write 2 into 3 equal to 6 that means 6 is exactly divisible by 2 so 2 is a factor of 6 and 6 is a multiple of 2 2 into 4 is equal to 8 which means 8 is exactly divisible by 2 therefore 2 is a factor of 8 and 8 is a multiple of so that's the logic now in this way we can write down all the multiples of 2 and this will continue because as you keep increasing this number one two three four five and so on you will 
,continue to get these multiples so how many multiples exist for two infinite because this one two three four the counting will go to infinity we know right that natural numbers whole numbers they continue to infinity so basically 2 multiplied by infinity will become some infinity so that means we can see that there exists in finite number of multiples for a particular number so please understand the concept of or understand the relationship between factor and multiple very very clearly so let us take any one example from this so can you tell me from this who is a factor and who is a multiple and why so if you take this instant you will see this means that 8 is exactly divisible by 2 now since 8 is exactly divisible by 2 that means if you divide 8 by 2 what will you get you get 4 so that means that 2 is a factor of 8 and it also means that 8 is a multiple of 2 so that is the simple concept of factors and multiples right let's try try to write multiples of the number 3 how would you write multiples of 3 3 into 1 3 2 3 3 3 4 and so on so what you get 3 6 9 12 and so on so in this fashion you can write out the multiples of 3 now in similar fashion you can also write multiples of bigger numbers so let us take an example let's consider 12 so how would you write multiples of 12 just keep on multiplying the various natural numbers like 12 into 1 12 into 2 12 into 3 12 4 so what do you get you get 12 24 36 48 and so on so this can go till infinity so there exist in finite multiples of any number so you talk about even bigger number like 200 is loud 20 so it would be 20 into 1 which is 20 20 into 2 which is 40 20 into 3 which is 60 
,and so on so in this way we can write down multiples of numbers so I hope that the relationship between factors and multiples is clear now so based on whatever we have studied so far on factors and multiples let us see what did we conclude because there are certain important things that we knew about factors and multiples now a 
,factor has to be an exact divisor of the number only then it becomes a factor of that number so you think of any example so let's let's think of this example 4 so who would be a multiple of 4 only that number which divides 4 exactly leaving 0 as remainder for example 1 would be an exacta bezel 2 would be an exactly so for itself would be an exact division so 1 2 & 4 would be the factors of number 4 1 is a factor of every number now if you want you can just observe it for yourself so 8 is T 
,4 so what are the factors of 4 4 can be written as 1 into 4 it can be written as 2 into 2 it can be written as 4 into 1 now when we write 4 as 2 into 2 it basically 
,means that 2 exactly divides 4 there too the other two would be quotient and the remainder would be zero similarly when you divide four by four the quotient would be one and the remainder would be zero so considering these we find that one two and four add factors of 4 similarly think of a number like 8 so 8 can be written as 1 
,into a 2 into 4 4 into 2 8 into 1 so basically looking at least you can say 1 2 4 8 are the factors of 8 now did you notice something that one is common for both of 
,them in fact you consider any number occurred see the 13 you consider 59 you consider 100 everywhere you would see that 1 is a factor because 1 divides every number 
,every number is a factor of itself now that is also another interesting fact that 4 has a factor of 4 8 is a factor of 8 13 is a factor of 13 59 is a factor of 59 and so on so basically one and the number itself these two factors will be there for every number a factor is always less than or equal to the number so that is also very much evident because who would be a factor and exact division so that exact division has to be less than the number itself or as the master can be equal to the number so you see for 4 if the factors are either less than 4 like 1 & 2 or equal to 4 similarly for 8 the factors are either less than 8 like 1 2 & 4 or it is equal 
,to 8 a number has finite number of factors finite means fixed number of or limited number of factors so if you consider this number 4 so how many factors number 4 has 1 2 & 4 so basically it has 3 factors you think of number eight how many factors it has 1 2 3 4 so it has 4 factors and these number of factors remain constant so 
,4 and not more than three factors these are the only possible factors or four so for every number you have a finite number of factors now when we come to the multiples we see that every one every number is a multiple of itself now that is one very interesting fact that every number is a factor of itself and every number is also 
,a multiple of itself now let us look at an example let us consider the number four and let us try to write it's multiples so these would be the multiples of four so 
,basically what do you see that the multiple start with the number except so if it is for form and multiplied by one is for itself and that is which which property of whole number is this can you recall from the previous lesson it is nothing but multiplicative identity one is called the multiplicative identity because when you multiply one to any number the number remains the same and that is the reason why four is a multiple of itself because four when multiplied by one gives the number itself that is it gives for a multiple is always more than or equal to the number so that's another interesting thing because when we were talking about factors we were actually trying to divide the number by their factors but when we talk about multiples we try to multiply the numbers so you see in order to find the multiples what are we doing we are multiplying the number four by one two three four five and so on but when we were trying to find the factors of four what were we trying to do we were trying to divide 4 by one two three four and so on and then try to find out where the remainder is zero so since here we are multiplying so it is quite obvious that the value of the multiples would be more than that of the number or at least it would be equal to the number so a multiple will always be more than or to the 
,number a number has infinite number of multiples as you can see here that these the count of these natural numbers starting from 1 2 3 4 5 and so on this would continue till infinity so you might reach a number where you actually try to multiply 4 by infinity so what would you get you would get infinity so basically the number of multiples are also in finite so you can start from 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 so you can go on and on and you would write in finite number of multiples of four not only for this is true for any number so these are some of the differences between factors and multiples so I hope that the concept of factors and multiples are absolutely clear now if it is not here please you deeply and watch the video again but get your concept clear so now that your concept is clear let us quickly look at some of the questions question number one write all the factors of the following numbers 27 18 and 36 so let us start with 27 so how do we write factors of a number so we start from 1 and we just keep checking that is there any number which can divide 27 completely so that's how we would do it so let us start with one so yes one in 227 we can write it like this one anyways one is a factor of every number we know what about two two will not divide 27 how about three yes three nines or 27 how about 4 4 will again not divide five no six no seven no 8 no 9 yes 9 into 3 is 27 so again as you move on like this you find that again finally the next thing that you can write this 27 into 1 so basically from this you see that 1 3 27 these are the factors of 27 now you might ask me here that how and how can we just mentally decide that two can divide 27 completely or not or how would we decide that full will divide 27 or not because you might not know that at instance so for that we will give in towards as we move ahead with this lesson I will give you some tricks they are going to divisibility tests and using those tests you can very quickly determine whether a particular number is divisible by another number or not so that will make your task easier now let us talk about the next number that is 18 so for 18 what are the ways we can write 18 so we can write 18 as one into 18 this can be written as 2 into 9 this can also be written as 3 into 6 this can be written as 6 into 3 9 into 
,2 and 18 into 1 now how do you observe something very nice about this sequence that first you write 1 into 18 2 into 9 3 into 6 now the moment you write it as 2 into 9 that enemies proves that 2 is a factor of 18 but it also indirectly proves that 9 is also a factor of 18 because 9 will also divide 18 completely leaving quotient as 2 and remainder as 0 then that is why you get the same terms again just the odd has changed so this time you are dividing it by 9 instead of 2 and that is how you can see that 18 would have the factors 1 2 3 6 9 and 18 let us now talk about 36 36 can be written as 1 into 36 2 into 18 3 into 12 4 into 9 6 into 6 9 into 4 12 into 3 18 into 2 36 and so these are the various ways in which you can write 36 which shows that 1 2 3 4 6 9 12 18 and 36 are the factors of 36 question number 2 right first five multiples of nine now how do we find multiples by multiplying the number by the various natural numbers so first five so we start multiplying with one so x 1 x 2 then 3 then 4 and then 5 so what are their values so this is mining this is 18 this is 27 this is 36 and this is 45 so these are the first five multiples of 9 question number three match the items in column 1 with the items in column 2 35 is it a multiple of 8 do you think the 35 would be a multiple of 8 quickly recall the table of 8 8 1 0 8 8 is 16 inches 24 8 32 a factor 14 so you have 40 do you have 32 and then you have 40 so 35 is gone there so 35 is not a multiple of 8 multiple of 7 ah yes it is a multiple of 7 because when you actually look at the multiples of 7 you can see there they are second one's a 7 7 is a 14-7 321 frozen 28 + 7 5 is 35 so 35 is a multiple of 7 15 what is 15 is 15 multiple of 8 no multiple of 70 know because multiples of any number will always be greater than or equal to the 
,number so multiple of 70 has to be greater than or equal to 70 factor of 30 factor of 30 yes that could be possible because when you divide 30 now in order to be factored 3015 should exactly divide 30 so when you divide 30 by 15 what do you get you can write 30 else 15 into 2 so therefore it leaves remainder 0 so therefore 15 is a factor of 30 16 16 is a multiple of 8 why because 8 into 2 is equal to 16 so therefore 16 is a multiple of 8 20 so 20 is a multiple of 70 that is not possible because multiple of 70 has to be greater than or equal to 70 when D is a factor of 50 that is also not true because if you divide 50 by 20 you the remainder is not 0 a 
,factor of 20 yes because every number is a factor of itself 25 is a multiple of 70 no not possible again 25 is a factor of 50 yes that can happen that's because 50 divided by 25 is equal to 2 so 50 can be written as 25 into 2 so 25 is a factor of P I hope you found the video useful if at all you have a feedback or you want to share your experience with us do let us know in the comment section if you really like the video do share it with your friends as well I will meet you guys very soon with a new video with a new topic till then stay home stay safe take care bye bye
,
HVBTiNeLhPE,good morning to all you fabulous fives out there lovely to have you with me this morning I hope your times table challenge is going well I know that I keep going on 
,and on and on about times tables and mentalness but they really really are the basis of a good man's mom being able to do that makes all the other things easier so please PLEASE practice and I will set a challenge for you I'm gonna do my 8 times table I'll time it and we'll see what it is and then hopefully you guys can aim to beat it I won't go as fast as I can I will try and be clear but let's start I'll use my phone to time so 8 16 24 32 40 48 56 64 70 to 80 88 96 right 8 seconds that's 
,the challenge see if you can do it quicker than that and now on to our lesson a reminder that if you have any questions about math you wanted to share with me what your times table challenge times are anything like that you went ahead say hi grade 5 at witchy club.com email me and off the lesson click on the link above do the worksheet just to check that you've understood what it is that we're covering in today's lesson I'm mr. Travis today we're looking at factors multiples primes and composites I'm sure that you've heard all of those words perhaps maybe prime and composite numbers would meet you have heard it as prime and prime numbers and composite 
,numbers but primes are composites I've shaped her all those things it's really just a reminder and maybe some practical work with them and how to find Prime's lesson girls today and know what factors and multiples are be able to find factors of a number when I give it to you be able to identify prime numbers and composite numbers so to do that you need to know what they are check my video out of the way quickly so let's look on the left at multiples multiples are numbers in the times table 
,"of something so when I say we're looking for multiples of its six it means anything in the six times table so 6 12 18 24 and so on and so forth there are many multiples of any number so even if I give you a really big number like five thousand there's still multiples of five thousand so 10,000 15,000 and so on so all numbers have multiples some of them are just really big but it's important to know that there are many multiples of every single number you might be asked about multiples you might be asked something like is 72 a multiple of six and that's really asking is 72 in the six times table any one six 12 18 24 30 36 42 48 54 60 66 72 yes it is it's 12 so six is a multiple I mean 72 is a multiple of six or you might be asked to write down a multiple of seven that is an even number so it's got a first of all be in the seven times table but it also needs to be an even number so remember even numbers are numbers that end on zero two four six or eight okay so seven wouldn't work because it's an odd number fourteen would work so 14 is a multiple of seven and it's an even number so it's 28 there lots of them it's every second one in the seven times table would fit that definition you might also be asked to write down something that's a multiple of two different times tables this is useful for when we "
,were doing fractions and we needed to find a common denominator we needed to find something that two numbers fitted into you that's what we were doing we were finding a common multiple the lowest common multiple so we're looking for a number that's in the six and seven times table the first one that I can think of is 42 which is six times seven so it's in the six times table it's a multiple of six it's in the seven times table it's a multiple of seven so that's multiples right sir I like to think of multiples are okay we'll come back to it both of them made up of a particular number so multiples of six are numbers that are made up with six factors factors are whole numbers that fit into something exactly so numbers have numbers that have the number you're looking at in their times tables so it's really the other way around so when I say what are the factors of six I'm trying to find all of the numbers that fit into six exactly in other words in this case with six it's one two three and six cuz one two three four five six one fourteen two six two four six two foots into six three six three fits into six four eight nope four is not a factor five ten five doesn't fit into six runs not a factor and six force into 6 once so 6 is a factor so those four numbers or all the factors of six some numbers have only two factors some numbers have many factors we'll look at finding up what factors of a number are shortly where you may be asked about factors you might be asked 
,to list the factors of 10 for example you have to find all the numbers that fit exactly into 10 we're gonna practice that you might be asked is five a factor of 14 so asking if five fits exactly into 14 nope you might be asked how many factors does 24 have so then you have to work out how many they were and count them so if I was asked how many factors does six have then the answer would be four because four separate numbers fit exactly into six so that's multiples and factors and when I think of factors I think of F as find what fits into it some multiples make up factors fit in multiples M make up factors fit in if that's how I remember it if you remember it that way that's great if you remembered some other way as long as you remember that's really what's important we can find factors in different ways and I'm 
,going to show you three different ways I really don't mind which when you choose to use in the end it's really about whether you can find all the factors that you're looking for so I'm going to start off by looking to see what the factors of let's start with twelve right so I could do this the first way I'm going to show you is 
,just using your head so you could say work out well first off one fits in to every single number so we know that one is going to be a factor of any number so one fits in does to fit in lemme check two four six eight ten twelve yes two-thirds it does three fit in three six nine twelve yes three fits in does for fit him four eight twelve yes forfeit sin does 555 ten fifteen no does six finem six twelve years the 713 714 no does eight eight sixteen no does nine nine eighteen 10 no 11 no 12 yes twelve fourteen once and there we go that's a list of all the factors of 12 just as there are so you can do it that way that's one potential way to write it to do it yeah I'll come back to that note that I was going to share with you now all right another way to do it is what I think of as a factor rainbow I'm going to do the same problem I'm looking for factors of 12 and I'm going to use a the rainbow method it's not my favorite method and I'll explain why afterwards but here we go I'm gonna start off with one because one fits into all things and then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say to myself what will at times by one to get 12 one times 12 so I've got two of my factors written down next up I'm gonna ask what's the next small number that fits in well to fitted in and two times what would give me 12 two times 
,six so here's my next pair three fitted in three times what gave me 12 three times four gave me 12 and that is actually all of them so then afterwards I would write 
,it underneath 12 as one to you and there we go you've got the same answer there as you do there this is nice because factors are in pairs they always come in pairs and so it's it's quite nice it waters around but the drawback of over rainbow is and it won't look like this with mine because I've used different colors but sometimes if you're using the same color or a pencil it all kinds of blank kind of blends together and you can't always tell if this is one twenty six or one and two and six or 64 so it gets a little bit messy and so this isn't my favorite method my favorite method which I'm going to do with the same one I will factor trees and in fact 
,the trees I have branches and those branches come in pairs so again using the idea of the factors are always in pairs like the rainbow I always start by doing this branch 1 and itself so we know that one fits into anything and anything times by 1 is itself so we know that the first pair will always be 1 and whatever number is in the trunk of the tree next up I'm going to draw my next branch and to see what fits in next well 2 + 2 times what gives me 12 2 times 6 three feds in three times what gives me 12 three times for the next number that would fit in would be six and it would be six times two but we already have six times two so we've gone we've gone all the way we don't need to do any more we just need to list them underneath 12 1 2 3 4 6 and 12 all right and when we writing that down we go we're looking at the first branch bleach the 1 2 3 4 6 12 1 2 3 4 6 12 so there's our factor tree and this is the one I like the best it's a very easy way of doing it and for me it makes it the easiest not to miss any of the factors so in fact the trees that come in pairs we see how many branches each one has so as I said I don't mind which method you use to work it out I'm going to use the factor trees because those are my favorite the one I've seen children have the most success with I hope you have a pencil and paper or pen and paper with you I'm going to give you a few now for us to work us so let's start off with this one so I will put down a few you guys get going 
,with them and then after little while I'll come back to them and I'll go through them with you now I'm going to go through the first three even if you haven't done them if you'd like more time to try it on your own that's okay but this is a new process for some of you so let's do this right I know that one fits into everything and one times itself does anything else but into two while we've covered it so the answer to the factors of 2 is 1 & 2 or 1 n 2 C my internet is being a little bit slower it's taking a little while to update from my iPad there we go all right let's look at the second tree I always started with 1 1 times what gives me 3 1 times 3 
,does anything else fit into 3 to 4 nope and so that is the answer to 3 3 has 1 and 3 I did say that there was something that only had 2 factors and some that had many let's have a look at 8 mm well the first number that we always start with is 1 and they come in pairs 1 times itself 1 times 8 is 8 let's see does 2 go into 8 2 4 
,6 8 yes it does so we've got 2 & 2 times what gives me a 2 2 times 4 gives me 8 does 3 fit in 3 6 9 no those 4 oh we've got four so that nice all of them so it has the factors 1 2 4 & 8 let's move our screen over and it's try number nine if you'd like to try some on your own just pause the video so I'm gonna start again as I always do with one and myself 1n itself 1 times 9 is 9 does to fit in 2 4 6 nope ohh 2 4 6 8 10 no does 3 3 6 9 years 3 fits in how many times does 3 fit in 3 times 3 4 8 12 no 510 no ok and that's all so I answered to the factors is 1 3 we don't blister 3 a second time because we've listed it already so it's 1 3 & 9 it's like yeah putting the same thing twice it's still not going to make more factors it's the same factor so it's just a repeat so we only put the that done once so I look at Tim always start with one and myself so those are the factors there's to fit in 2 4 6 8 10 years it does 2 times 5 does 3 fit in nope just for fit in no 5 5 years but we've got 5 already so factors of 10 1 2 5 and Tim gonna do one more and then have a quick look back at what we've done so far we start with 1 and myself 1 and the number in tree trunk does 2 2 4 6 no does 3 3 6 note does 4 4 8 notice 5 yes we've got 5 that's all this is another one of the ones that only has two factors right if 
,we look at the ones we've done so far you will notice that every single one that we've covered so far whether it's got two factors or more factors always has one and itself 1 and itself 1 and itself all right so every single number has at least two factors and those factors are 1 and itself got some more for you to try we're moving on to slightly bigger numbers and remember yesterday in the previous lesson when we did when we looked at the divisibility rules this is where the divisibility rules will come in handy because you can always check to see what's going to go into the number so look we've done 12 quite a bit so let's do 16 here are a couple for you to get going with I'll give you a little while to get started and if you need longer you can pause it right great furs I do want to still come back or do want to get unto prime and composite numbers which shouldn't take too long but because of that I'm not going to leave it any longer we're just doing ten of these if you'd 
,like more time and I think it'd be great if you pause the video and did them yourself so you could check that you're on the right track before we get to the homework it's always useful to first do it or first try it before you have a look at how somebody else does it it's useful to watch somebody else to that's how we learn as well but trying is super important remember trying and failing is not a problem as long as you learn from your mistakes having a look at 16 I'm going to start with first one and my 1 and itself that's in everything then I'm going to try let's see 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 to goes in two guys hidden eight times three doesn't go in for does go in this is what times tables are so important because you can see what goes in so four goes in four times four and that's going to be as many as you get there won't be any other ones that fit into there so my factors written out neatly underneath factors of 16 are 1 2 4 8 and 16 factors of 24 west one and it serves so when in 24 to 12 24 Sivan so 2 goes in 2 times 12 you can count there 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 12 times 3 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 yeah 3 goes in 3 goes in 8 times that is an 8 even if it's a bit messy for goes in 4 8 12 16 20 24 years for goes in six times it goes in three times but we already have that one and so now we've covered all of them so writing it up neatly underneath 24 has the factors 1 2 3 4 6 8 12 and 24 so I did say that some have only a few factors and some have many we're 
,heading into some of the ones that have quite a lot more now so below get 36 always start with 1 and myself 1 and 36 36 is even said 2 goes in who a my goodness that's a lot of two's 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 my goodness how many is that that was 18 3 3 6 9 12 yes it does I'm not gonna go all the way but 
,it does it's what the advantages of knowing your times tables 3 times 12 4 goes in and this one I am going to shut down something underneath well I know that 4 goes 
,into 40 10 times so if I'm going backwards 1 to 36 then it would be 9 times so 4 times 9 it's a little trick for working out if it's close to the 10 times of something 5 doesn't go in 6 does go in see I know that 5 doesn't go in because that ends on a 6 and 5 so only going to numbers that end on 5 or 0 so that's one of the tricks that I'm using remember that a bit of literals from yesterday huh teachers teach things in a logical way that makes sense because we use things to do other things 
,so six goes in here six times and that is the end of it so writing the mark neatly and you can see when I do this I'm going across the branches on the one side and then I'm coming back on the other side so it's one two three four six and when you're gonna write down one of them because otherwise it's repeating 9 12 18 and 36 that is a lot of factors one more to go let's pick purple for this one right one in itself ends on a Knights of two definitely goes in two goes into well 2 goes into there 4 times 2 goes into the air so it's 24 3 well let's see if we add those together we get 12 so that means 3 does go in so 3 goes in how many times she goes in 16 
,times you can count then I will do division in a future lesson which will help you with this as well does 4 go in yes four guys in four girls in there 12 times kids 
,4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36 40 44 48 12 times does 5 go in no because it ends on a ace does 6 go in well if you add those together it's 12 and 12 and it ends on an even number divisibility rule for 6 if you don't remember the divisibility rules I think it's best to go back and do in the many few missed the last test and I really think it's important one though doesn't always seem that way it's very very useful it's like a little tool in your tool chest that helps you go quicker so 6 goes into 
,the 8 times 7 doesn't it does but we've got it and so that's it so 48 has the most factors we've seen yet 1 2 3 4 6 8 12 16 24 and 48 we have just time to look at prime numbers and composites prime numbers so remember we pointed out that a couple of them only had what went one pair of factors or two factors those are prime numbers so if there are only two numbers that fit in exactly it's gonna be one in itself and I have a little rhyme and this is probably the closest you're gonna get me to singing on on a platform like this or yeah I definitely wasn't done idols because I know I can sing but if my factors are one and myself then I sit on the prime number shelf that's a little rhyme that I you I used to remember which are prime numbers so when I say sit on the prime number shelf I mean that I'm a prime number so if my factors are one of myself then I sit on the prime number shelf let's look at our whiteboard again and look to see which of those numbers is prime well if we look at the first one the only things that fit in or one in itself so two is a prime number I'm just gonna put a P next to it P if I look the next one the only things that fit in there or one and itself so three is a prime number if I look at this one it has one end self and some other things so this is not prime for head or nine here's one three and nine it's got more than just itself and when so that's not prime 10 knot prime so 5 only has 1 and 5 so 5 is also a prime number the other ones we've done lots of factors and so those are not so if my if my factors are one and myself then I said on the prime number shelf out of interest 2 is the only even prime number every other prime number is an odd number and the reason for that is that two fits into all the other prime numbers so whatever the other prime number is it will have one and itself and at least two and two's partner so anything that's even above two will definitely not be a prime so once you see it's even and bigger than two you don't even have to check further than that you know it's not prime and there's one more way to look at composite numbers and this is going to be really hard to remember a composite number is anything that's not prime so all the ones that weren't prime on our whiteboard are composite numbers so it's have a look this one is a composite number a composite number composite composite composite composite and composite so this just its prime and composite is a way of dividing numbers if your factors are went in yourself then it's just prime and if it's composite or if it has more than just the two factors then it's composite that's where we're gonna end today we know what prime numbers are we know what composite numbers are we've explored what multiples are we've explored what factors are you needed to know what factors were in order to be able to understand prime numbers after the lesson click on the link above and the worksheet to check that you've got this well also if you have any questions email me grad 5 at worksheet cloud.com and I've been wearing the whole listen to do this my name is Optimus Prime Autobots move out have a great weekend great fans

5xe-6GPR_qQ,Which of the following
,numbers is a factor of 154? So when a number is going
,to be a factor of 154 is if we can divide
,that number into 154 and not have a remainder. Or another way of thinking
,about it-- a number is a factor of 154 if 154 is
,a multiple of that number. So let's look at each of these
,and see which of these we can rule out or say is a factor. So does 3 divide
,"evenly into 154? Or, another way of"
,"thinking about it, is 154 a multiple of 3? Well you'll later learn"
,that you could actually test whether something
,is divisible by 3 by adding up the digits. And if that's divisible
,"by 3, then it's going to be divisible by 3. And so you see"
,"here, 1 plus 5 is 6. 6 plus 4 is 10. 10 is not divisible by 3. But if you didn't want"
,to do that little trick-- and we have other
,videos where we go into more detail
,about that trick-- you can actually just
,divide 3 into 154. 3 doesn't go into 1. It does go into 15 five times. 5 times 3 is 15. Subtract. Then we have 0. Then you bring down a 4. 3 goes into 4 one time. 1 
,"times 3 is 3. Subtract, and you"
,have a remainder of 1. So 3 is clearly not a factor of
,"154, so we can rule that out. Now what about 5? Well, any multiple"
,of 5 is either going to have 5 or
,0 in the ones place. You see that if we write 5
,"times 1 is 5, 5 times 2 is 10, 5 times 3 is 15, 5 times 4 is"
,"20, you either have a 5 or a 0 in the ones place. This does not have 5"
,"or a 0 the ones place, so it's not going to"
,be divisible by 5. 5 is not a factor. 154 is not a multiple of 5. Now 6 is interesting. You could do the same thing. You could try to
,divide 6 into 154. But if something
,"is divisible by 6, it's definitely going to"
,be divisible by 3 as well because 6 is divisible by 3. So we can immediately
,rule this one out as well. Because 154 is not
,"divisible by 3, it's also not going"
,to be divisible by 6. And you could try
,it out if you like. And we could make the
,"same argument for 9. If something is divisible by 9,"
,"it's going to be divisible by 3 because 9 is divisible by 3. Well, it's not"
,"divisible by 3, so we're going to rule out 9 as well. So we've ruled out everything. It looks like 14"
,"is our only option, but let's actually verify it. Let's actually"
,divide 14 into 154. 14 doesn't go into 1. It goes into 15
,"exactly one time. 1 times 14 is 14. We subtract. We get 1. Bring down the 4. 14 goes into 14 one time. 1 times 14 is 14. And of course, we"
,have no remainder. So 14 goes into 154
,exactly 11 times. Or 11 times 14 is 154. 154 is a multiple of 14. Let's do one more. Which of the following
,"numbers is a multiple of 14? So now we have 14,"
,and we're trying to think of its multiples. So there's two
,ways of doing this. You could go number by number
,"and try to divide 14 into them, or we could just"
,try to figure out what all of the multiples
,of 14 actually are. So let's try to do that. Let's try to do that
,"second technique. 14 times 1 is 14. You add another 14. 14 times 2 is 28. Add another 14. Let's see, you add 10. You get to 38. Then you add 4 more. You get to 42. Then you add another 14. I haven't seen any of"
,these numbers show up yet. Add another 14 to this. You get to 56-- still
,"not quite there. Add another 14. Let's see, if you"
,"add 4, you get to 60, and you have to add the 10. So then you get to 70. And it looks like we have"
,"found one of these numbers. 70 is a multiple of 14. 14 times 1, 2, 3, 4,"
,5-- 14 times 5 is 70.

rUrLuTMq-sw,what are the multiples of a number say we have a number seven what are its multiples how many multiples does it have seven x one is seven this seven is one of the multiples of seven seven x two is 14 14 is another multiple of seven the word says it all a multiple if a number is multiplied with seven we get sevens multiple and seven x 3 is 21 and the list would continue forever the multiples of seven are 7 14 21 28 and so on this proves that the list of multiples of a number is infinite for 
,us the number of factors of a number is always finite concept of multiples gives us a very important result let us find the multiples of 2 2 times 1 is 2 2 times 2 is 4 2 times 3 is 6 and the multiples of 2 continue what's special about the multiples of 2 all the multiples of 2 are called even numbers yes all the multiples of 2 
,are even and what about the numbers which are not multiples of 2 the numbers which are not multiples of 2 are called odd numbers so the numbers 1 3 7 9 and so on are odd numbers this concept of even and odd numbers is very important no matter which grade you are in multiples of 2 even non multiples of 2 odd and now we come to a 
,very interesting question how our factors and multiples related let's understand the relation with the help of a random number sit 12 to find the factors of 12 we try writing it as all possible products of two numbers 12 can be written as 1 multiplied by 12 it can be written as 2 multiplied by 6 and 3 x 4 these are the only possible combinations each of these numbers are factors of 12 the factors of 12 are 1 2 3 4 6 and 12 now observe the number 12 in relation with these numbers 1 multiplied by 12 gives us 12 so 12 is a multiple of 1 2 multiplied by 6 gives us 12 so 12 is also multiple of 2 3 times 4 gives us 12 and so on what does this imply the number 12 is a multiple of all its factors yes this is always true a number is always a multiple of all its factors you

qKV_TiZqaMY,today let us learn about multiples at Anya's home with her mother hello kids let us understand what a multiple of a number is with an example consider 3 into 4 is equal to 12 we know that 3 & 4 are the factors of 12 so here 12 is a multiple of 3 and 12 is also a multiple of 4 therefore we define a multiple as a multiple of a number is the product obtained when the given number is multiplied by the same or any other number let us see now how to find multiples of a given number let us find the multiples of 5 from the definition we can multiply the given number five with any number and get its multiple so let us multiply it with a few random numbers to list a few of its multiples 5 x 0 1 2 5 8 12 24 38 46:59 100 and so on gives 0 5 10 25 40 60 120 190 230 295 500 and so on thus we get a series of multiples by multiplying the given number by our the numbers therefore we get the multiples of 5 as 0 5 10 25 40 60 120 190 230 295 500 and so on let us look at one more example it is easy when we multiply 12 by 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and so on we get 0 12 24 36 48 60 70 to 80 for 96 108 120 and so on as the products so here the products obtained are nothing else but the multiples of 12 I am sure you must have understood how to find the multiples of a given number remember the following points while finding the multiples of a number one we get a series of multiples by multiplying the given number by other numbers to the given number and other number are the factors of the product we call a multiple three zero is a multiple of every number but zero is not a factor of any number except zero for the multiples of any number is a set of numbers that does not end kids wasn't it easy to find the multiples so go home and try listing them yourself

0IZyGB1qQmM,today let us revise factors and multiples let us start with factors what do we mean by a factor a factor of a number divides that number exactly let us look at an example find the factors of 58 the first pair is 1 into 50 8 is equal to 58 here when we divide 58 by 1 we get the quotient as 58 and when we divide 58 by 58 we get the quotient as 1 in both the cases the remainder is 0 thus it means that 58 is divisible by 1 and 58 the second pair of numbers which gives the product 58 is 2 into 29 thus the factors of 58 are 1 to 29 and 58 let us solve one more example find the factors of 81 the pairs of numbers which give the product a t1r1 into 81 is equal 
,to 81 3 into 27 is equal to 81 9 into 9 is equal to 81 thus the factors of 81 are 1 3 9 27 and 81 as each of these number divides 81 exactly did you notice we counted the repeated factor only once remember every number has 1 as a factor every number is a factor of itself thus every number except one has at least two factors one 
,and the number itself the factor of a number is always equal to or less than the number now let us look at multiples a multiple of a number is the product obtained when the number is multiplied by the same or any other number let us find the multiples of 12 it is easy when we multiply 12 by zero one two three four five six seven eight nine ten and so on we get 0 12 24 36 48 60 70 to 80 for 96 108 120 and so on as the products so here the products obtained are nothing else but the multiples 
,of 12 let us look at another example find the multiples of 19 when we multiply 19 by 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and so on we get 0 1938 5770 695 114 133 152 171 190 and 
,so on thus the multiples of 19 are 0 1938 5770 695 114 133 152 171 190 and so on remember a number is a multiple of itself every number is a multiple of one every multiple of a given number is equal to or greater than the number itself every number has an infinite number of multiples zero is a multiple of every number but zero is not a factor of any number except zero revising factors and multiples was fun you

qc8LHRMs6FQ,today we will learn about factors first let us understand what we mean by the factor of a number let us take the number 12 to begin with let us find out the pairs of numbers that give 12 as their product 1 into 12 is equal to 12 2 into 6 is equal to 12 3 into 4 is equal to 12 so we get 3 pairs of numbers that give us the product 12 no other pair of numbers when multiplied will give the product 12 now let us take each pair of number separately and understand what it means let us take the first pair 1 into 12 is equal to 12 here when we divide 12 by 1 we get the quotient as 12 and when we divide 12 by 12 we get the quotient as 1 in both the cases the remainder is 0 thus it means that 12 is divisible by 1 and 12 pair to 2 into 6 is equal to 12 here when we divide 12 by 2 we get the quotient as 6 and if we divide 12 by 6 we get the quotient as 2 in both the cases the remainder is 0 thus it means that 12 is divisible by 2 and 6 pair 3 3 into 4 is equal to 12 here if we divide 12 by 3 we get the quotient as 4 and if we divide 12 by 4 we get the quotient as 3 here also we get the remainder as 0 in both the divisions thus it means that 12 is divisible by 3 and 4 thus we now understand that 12 is divisible by 1 2 3 4 6 and 12 hence we see that the numbers 1 2 3 4 6 and 12 are the factors of 12 hence we can define factor of a number as a number which exactly divides the given number or we can see that factors are numbers you can multiply together to get given number now 
,let us look at certain points which we need to understand related to a factor with the help of some examples point 1 1 is a factor of every number look at the examples 1 into 6 is equal to 6 8 divided by 1 is equal to 8 thus 1 multiplied by any number gives the number itself as the product and any number divided by 1 also gives 
,the number itself as the quotient hence we conclude that 1 is a factor of every number point to every number is a factor of itself we know that 6 into 1 is equal to 
,6 8 divided by 8 is equal to 1 thus any number multiplied by 1 gives the number itself as the product and any number divided by itself gives 1 as the quotient hence 
,every number is a factor of itself 3 the factor of a number is always less than or equal to the number look at the factors of 12 which we found out earlier they are 
,1 2 3 4 6 and 12 note that the factors 1 2 3 4 & 6 are less than 12 and the last factor 12 is equal to 12 thus it shows that the factor of a number is always less than or equal to the number for every number except one has at least two factors one and the number itself let us look at the factors of 7d are one and seven no other 
,pair of numbers when multiplied together will give the product seven that is the number seven has at least two factors one and seven that is number one and the number seven itself hence we can see that every number except one has at least two factors one and the number itself do remember these points properly they will help you 
,to find the factors as we go further now let us find the factors of one more number let us take the number 30 the pairs of numbers which give the product 30 are 1 into 30 is equal to 30 2 into 15 is equal to 33 into 10 is equal to 30 5 into 6 is equal to 30 thus the factors of 30 are 1 2 3 5 6 10 15 and 30 now look at these factors and remember these points 1 a factor of a number exactly divides that number to one is a factor of every number three every number is a factor of itself for the 
,factor of a number is always less than or equal to the number five every number except one has at least two factors one and the number itself wasn't it easy to learn about factors why don't you try to find the factors of some numbers yourself

41eVMYPCWTQ,today let us learn prime and composite numbers before we begin let us understand what do we mean by natural numbers the set of numbers 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and so on are 
,called natural numbers natural numbers can be divided into prime numbers and composite numbers before we proceed ahead remember that any given number will always have one and itself as its factors now let us start with prime numbers look at the examples the factors of 3 are 1 and 3 the factors of 11 are 1 and 11 the factors of 17 are 1 and 17 all these numbers have only two factors one and the number itself such numbers are called prime numbers thus prime numbers are natural numbers that have only two factors one and the number itself composite numbers look at the examples the factors of 6 are 1 2 3 & 6 the factors of 14 are 1 2 7 and 14 the factors of 20 are 1 2 5 10 and 20 all the above numbers have more than two factors these numbers are called composite numbers thus composite numbers are natural numbers that have more than two factors remember these points one is neither prime nor composite as it has only one factor two is the smallest and the only even prime number three is the smallest odd prime number now why don't you list all the prime and composite numbers from 1 to 100

j8vWxZBD4eU,hello children today the lesson has multiples and factors multiples and factors see before I start the lesson I'll just tell you a small story see they were fine French Taj Mina Mary knew Jehan and sharmeeli they were five friends now what they did is these five friends wanted to play indoor game so what these y friends decided 
,us they just started writing in a sheet of paper from 1 to 50 from 1 to 50 they started to write writing the number from 1 to 50 in a sheet of paper now after writing from 1 to 50 now what they decided is they took 10 sheets small small sheet and started writing from 1 to 10 they started writing from 1 to 10 and what they have to do was these 5 friends they have to pick one number from that lots now what it thought stood us from that lots this person that is thought he took number 3 from that Lord's so from 1 to 10 they wrote in a small paper and they just put the Lord and in that Lords what did Taj did is he took number 3 so no more did Taj do he just put the stone or he kept the stone on this tree and he started adding the number from tree 1 2 3 now in six number what did he do he kept on stone then again started adding one two three so number nine he kept a stone again 10 11 12 so again on to all he kept a stone 13 14 15 he kept a stone 16 17 18 again one stone 19 20 21 one stone again 22 23 24 again one stone here 25 26 again 27 one stone 28 29 30 31 32 again 33 he kept one stone here 34 35 36 he kept one stone here 37 38 one stone here 40 41 42 one stone here 43 44 one stone here 46 47 48 one stone again you can't count because it was just from 1 to 50 only they desired her to plate so now water Taj Gate he kept the stones in 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30 33 36 39 42 45 and 48 so this is what ah gee now one more I tell another Mary Mary she got number five she got number five in the launch so this is star and this is Mary now in Mary what she did she kept a stone on number five then she started counting one two three four five one stole here one two three four five again one two three four five one two three four five one stone here one-two-three-four-five one-two-three-four-five one-two-three-four-five one-two-three-four-five one-two-three-four-five so now what did you understand from this so what did they play actually what they did is whatever the number they caught in the last Lord's they have to keep a stone on that particular number and they have to start adding with that number C for example cards took three so without three years to start thing I started adding the number three one two three same way who is it Mary has it Mary took number five so she kept us to own a number five and she started adding five one two three four five so this is all now what do you understand from this so when you add when you add when you add the number repeatedly when you add the number repeatedly when you add the number repeatedly this resulting number is called as a multiple I will repeat once again resulting number is called multiple so this is one day what we call it as multiple this is a lesson we are going to start with today see when you add the number repeated let's see this number I told you thirds got three here appeal started repeatedly add at the number three one two three one two three one two three one two three 
,like that so when you add a number repeatedly this resulting number is called multiples C multiples of 3 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30 33 36 39 42 45 and 48 so this means this is a multiples of 3 this is a multiple of 3 now again once again I will repeat what does multiple when you

qKV_TiZqaMY,today let us learn about multiples at Anya's home with her mother hello kids let us understand what a multiple of a number is with an example consider 3 into 4 is equal to 12 we know that 3 & 4 are the factors of 12 so here 12 is a multiple of 3 and 12 is also a multiple of 4 therefore we define a multiple as a multiple of a number is the product obtained when the given number is multiplied by the same or any other number let us see now how to find multiples of a given number let us find the multiples of 5 from the definition we can multiply the given number five with any number and get its multiple so let us multiply it with a few random numbers to list a few of its multiples 5 x 0 1 2 5 8 12 24 38 46:59 100 and so on gives 0 5 10 25 40 60 120 190 230 295 500 and so on thus we get a series of multiples by multiplying the given number by our the numbers therefore we get the multiples of 5 as 0 5 10 25 40 60 120 190 230 295 500 and so on let us look at one more example it is easy when we multiply 12 by 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and so on we get 0 12 24 36 48 60 70 to 80 for 96 108 120 and so on as the products so here the products obtained are nothing else but the multiples of 12 I am sure you must have understood how to find the multiples of a given number remember the following points while finding the multiples of a number one we get a series of multiples by multiplying the given number by other numbers to the given number and other number are the factors of the product we call a multiple three zero is a multiple of every number but zero is not a factor of any number except zero for the multiples of any number is a set of numbers that does not end kids wasn't it easy to find the multiples so go home and try listing them yourself

CIkDcENjzBA,today let us learn about the least common multiple or you can call it LCM to let us understand the meaning of the term common multiple when two or more numbers have 
,the same numbers as their multiples those multiples are said to be common multiples now let us see what do we mean by the least common multiple the least common multiple of two or more numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of those numbers to understand it in a better way let us solve an example find the least common multiple of 5 and 10 we will follow a three-step process to find the least common multiple step 1 list the multiples of all the given numbers the multiples of 5 are 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 and so on the multiples of 10 are 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 and so on step 2 identify the common multiples of all the given numbers the common 
,multiples of 5 and 10 are 10 20 30 40 and so on step 3 right the least common multiple of all the given numbers here the least common multiple is 10 thus LCM is 10 which is the smallest number of the common multiples now let us solve one more example find the LCM of 6 8 and 12 the multiples of 6 are 6 12 18 24 30 36 42 48 54 60 
,and so on next the multiples of 8 are 8 16 24 32 40 48 56 64 72 80 and so on finally the multiples of 12 are 12 24 36 48 60 70 to 80 for 96 108 120 and so on here the common multiples of 6 8 and 12 are 24 and 48 and so on thus LCM is 24 now kids I am sure all of you must be wondering why we did not list 0 as a multiple for any of the numbers that is because we do not consider 0 when we have to find the LCM as otherwise the LCM of all the numbers would always be 0 remember kids it is important to learn the tables to find the multiples and the least common multiple

yJ-T8z2-Zg4,factors for the first time in this short tutorial you will find out what factors are and how to find factors using multiplication factors are whole numbers that you 
,multiply together to get another number so in this example two times five is ten the factors are two and five you will often be given a number and told to list all its factors well you could just think of any numbers that multiply together to give 12 in this example but a better plan is to use the same simple way every time take a look the first thing you do is find the simplest way of multiplying to 12 and you start with 1 so 1 and the number itself are always the first factors you list right the factors down in pairs 1 here and 12 over here we will fill in the space between with other factors as we go along for each factor pair use an arc to show which factors multiply together it helps keep your thinking clear and stops you from accidentally forgetting to write a factor down ok now you try 2 times number to make 12 well 2 times 6 is 12 list the 2 and the 6 and put the arc in then 3 times a number 3 times 4 is 12 list the 3 and the 4 put the arc in 3 & 4 are consecutive numbers so we know we finish because there's no whole number between those two we've just found all the factors of 12 notice that because we worked from the outside in 
,the factors are in order this is the clearest way of showing all the factors of a number and using the arc for each factor pair shows you're thinking we'll do one more example we'll find the factors of 16 start with one and the number itself 1 + 16 use the ark now go to to two times number well 2 times 8 is 16 what about three times a number is three a factor well 3 times 5 is 15 we can't get to 16 3 is not a factor of 16 now 4 times a number 4 times 4 is 16 when a number is multiplied by itself like before times 4 we just put it in the factor listing once without any ark and there are no more factors we found them all when you're listing all the factors of a number remember always start with 1 and the number itself with a good space between then using multiplication try 2 times 3 times 4 times 5 times a number and up and when your numbers meet in the middle you have finished always use the arc to show your thinking and now it's your turn to practice have fun with this and become fantastic at factors created using powtoon

1qPfLkOEuYY,welcome to math with mr j in this video i'm going to cover multiples verse factors so the difference between multiples and factors and we have two examples that we're going to go through together in order to get this down so let's jump right into number one here where we have eight and we'll start with multiples so we need to list some multiples of eight now multiples are the result of multiplying the given number by integers so no fractions or decimals and we can think of this as skip counting let's make sense of that by writing out some examples here so the multiples of eight we can start with eight eight times one equals eight so we multiplied eight by the integer of one now we can multiply by the integer of two so eight times two is sixteen then three eight times three is twenty-four and you can see how this is turning into just counting by eights or skip counting eight times four is thirty-two eight times five is forty and so on and so forth so those multiples will continue on forever so it's all the numbers that 8 will hit if we count up by 8. or think of it as we multiplied 8 by integers starting with 1 and then going 2 3 4 5 6 7 
,8 and again it goes on forever now multiples can be positive and go up in value or multiples can decrease in value there are negative multiples but we are only going to be working with positives in this video so let's move on to factors and factors are all of the numbers that the given number can be divided by evenly so no remainders or you can think of factors as the numbers that can be multiplied in order to get that given number factors are numbers that are multiplied to get a product i 
,like to think of factors as all the numbers that can go into a given number that's not the most mathematical or technical way of thinking about it but it can help with determining the difference between multiples and factors so let's find all the factors of eight and when we find factors i like to start with two numbers for two 
,factors for every number and those factors are one and then the number itself so one and eight i can do eight divided by one and get a um that will divide evenly i will not get a remainder and i can do eight divided by eight or you can think of it as one times eight equals eight so all the math facts all the multiplication facts that will equal eight and we can think of this as a factor pair here so we'll start with 1 and 8 and for some numbers those are the only factors 1 and the number itself those numbers are called prime numbers but 8 is composite so it has other factors involved here so what other numbers can go into eight you can think of it as or a multiplication fact to equal that given number of eight well i could do eight divided by two right 2 can go into 8 so that's my next factor and i know 2's partner is 4 because 8 divided by 2 equals 4. or i could do 8 divided by 4 equals 2 or think of it as 2 times 4 equals 8. so different ways of thinking about factors but it's all the numbers that can divide evenly aka no remainders as far as 8 goes now when i wrote my factors list i put 1 and 8 and then i put a big gap in the middle there that way i could fit any other factors that would be between 1 and 8 and they would all go in order you'll get better with spacing the more you do of those let's go to number two and write out the multiples of 15. so we'll start with 15 times 1 or just start with 15 and skip count however you like to think about this 15 times 2 30 3 is 45 4 is 60 5 is 75 and again those do continue on forever but we'll cut it off right there as far as factors remember we start with 1 and the number itself because 1 can go into 15 and then 15 can go into 15. i like to leave a little gap there that way if there are any other factors i can list them in between 1 and 
,15 and they're all in order so think about 15 what other numbers go into 15 or can multiply to get 15 well i know 15 divided by 3 and 3's partner is 5 right because 
,let me start with this 1 and 15 are partners and then 3 and 5 are factor pairs or partners and those are all the factors of 15. so there you have it there's the difference between multiples and factors i hope that helped thanks so much for watching until next time peace

,lakhs 90 mm then 99 lakhs ninety three thousand so it means 91 92 93 here you all right 99 lakhs ninety four thousand then here 99 lakhs 95 thousand then he are you 
,"write 99 lakhs 96,000 then here you write 99 lakhs 97,000 then here you write 99 lakhs ninety nine thousand is it yeah so this is how you have to fill in the blanks "
,"you have to see in what order they are given and you have to start filling up now next one see next one they have given fill in the correct numbers see in 1 crore I'll make it very easy at a table for you 1 crore then 10 lakhs then they are given lack in a lot then in 10,000 then they have given in thousand in a thousand now what does a table they have given us we have asked crow 10 lakh 10 lakh lakh then 10,000 10,000 then you write thousand then you love 100 then you write tens then once "
,this is the order you write it ok now in one crow now what will write one see then 10 lakhs here then 100 1 0 again - then you again will start 3 here again 4 0 here for then here fine fine then again here 6 then here are seven now same way now what you have to do you are nothing because crore it is 10 lakhs so now you're what you'll write will start one then 10 then 100 then what you'll write thousand say 1 0 2 0 then 3 then 4 0 then Phi 0 Phi then here 6 0 right now next one here one lakh you know here it will be nothing here it is 1 1 lakh then again here what you'll start 10 then hundreds then thousand then 10 thousand three zeroes are you you know you write for then again here 5 3 4 5 now next one in ten thousand you'll have put 1 0 here - that and here 1 will start one year see how the order goes 1 then again yet then hundred then here thousand been here ten thousand now C 1 0 2 0 3 & 4 0 no here in thousands 1 again here you will start now from here thousands will start 1 now what you put your PIN then 100 no thousands so this is what what you call it just filling up in the correct numbers in the following table now there is one activity that is I think you must have seen in the abacus I think you must have seen the abacus like you will have small small green Sula see now you'll ask small small rings you will find it in the abacus is it clear now this like this you have small above you'll have in the abacus will have links like you'll have rings like like this so the first one suppose you wanted to find odd I'll just show you one is see this is once this is tense this is hundreds and next one is what after hundred to a thousand okay now with this I'll start now with this I will start now this is the abacus this is the abacus now what happens us you'll have the rings in this now that you wanted to show nine thousand six hundred and seventy eight now you wanted to show in the abacus nine thousand six hundred and seventy eight now what will you do here what will you do here now in once this is once I told you the sister once so how many rings Allah one two three four five six seven and eight is it clear 
,so it means a rings are that it means eight ones are there now how many tens are here seven so how many rings will be there one two three four five six and seven rings will of now this one what is this hundreds now how many hundreds you love one two three four five and six now six now what is the next one nine thousand so you not drinks one two three four five six seven eight nine so with this abacus no automatically you can say so how many thousands are there nine thousand how many hundreds are there one two three four five six six hundred then one two three four five six seven seventy then how many ones are there three four five six seven eight nine 
,thousand six hundred and seventy eight now how will you explain this nine thousand six hundred and thirty eight now how would you write nine thousand that plus six hundred plus seventy plus a now still more again how you can expand your write like this nine in 2000 with abacus for nine in two thousand plus six in two hundred plus 7 into 10 plus 8 into 1 this is how you will do it in the abacus so a barkas form means when you wanted to use abacus if suppose nine thousand six hundred and seventy eight this way you write and expanded form nine thousand plus 600 plus seventy plus eight so how many thousands are there nine and how many hundreds are there six and how many 70s are there seven and how many eighths are the ones are there eight so this is how you have to represent in the abacus now one more this I told you 
,"thousands now will go for 10,000 Oh see next one we will go on with forty-nine thousand eight five seven forty-nine thousand eight hundred fifty seven now how will you show it in your abacus once tens hundreds thousands and after thousand what did I tell you ten thousand so TT right no no now what you have to do how will you show this forty nine thousand eight hundred fifty seven years now what you have to how many rings will be here so you'll have seven year one two three four five six seven now how many are five tens one two three four and five now how many hundreds one two three four five six seven eight now how many thousands one two three four five six seven eight nine okay now how many partings we have four one two three four now how will you put it expand when you when you expand how will you expand you will write how will you write for ten thousands how many ten thousands I have for ten thousands okay for ten thousands now how many thousands are here nine thousand now how many hundreds you have eight hundred now how many tens are there fight ends and how many one seven ones now I will write it in expanded form how will you write "
,"your 40,000 okay 40,000 then you will write your 9,000 then oh man 800 then 50 and seven now how do you write 49 thousand eight hundred fifty seven so this is how you have to represent and one more way also you could write it this way plus one more way now how many ten thousands means you have to write like this for in to ten thousand then what is that nine in two thousand then what is the next one eight in two hundred then Phi into 10 then 7 into 1 so this is how you would write that in the abacus form is it clear the next one we will go on for the practice time given in your book thirty eight thousand two hundred and five what is the next one what que 8205 thirty-eight thousand two hundred and five now how will you put it in the abacus now how will you do it in the Barkers see very easy once then tens then after place value hundreds then one of the next place value thousands next one is the ten thousand now what is it your fight firing should be the ones two three four five now we are nothing should be that so don't draw any drink then here in two one two now you're eight rings one two three four five six seven eight now here one two three now what will you write here you know how will you write you will write thirty thousand then let us three into ten thousand then eight thousand you're expanding it 8,200 zero and five right now this is one way then another way how will you do it still more expand three into ten thousand three into romney ten thousand other "
,three into ten thousand then how many thousands are there how many thousands are there eight into thousands then how many hundreds are there two 200 then how many tens are they zero zero into ten then what does once file into words so this is what you call it does a bad custom this is how you have to do here about custom now next one one more some you can do it salmon now how will you write it in words this thirty eight thousand two hundred and five you have to write like this thirty eight 
,thousand thirty eight thousand thirty eight thousand what is it 200 205 how will you write thirty eight thousand two hundred and five thirty eight thousand thirty eight thousand it is 38 mins thirty thousand plus thousand so thirty eight thousand two hundred and five next to some salmon lakhs twenty thousand seven kamat to zero 
,"comma zero four five next podcast you have to do the sum next one seven come on to zero comma zero four five now how will you do this now same way once tens next one is what hundred next one is what thousand next one is what ten thousand next turn is what after ten thousand what is that it does lakhs right now what how many rings you will draw your one two three four and five now here four one two three four now you have nothing here also nothing here it is two to one to your it is seven two three four five six and seven now how will you expand it in a expand form how will you write seven how many they serve a lakhs are there so how will you write seven into one luck 7 into 1 dot then 2 into 10,000 then next one is what in 2000 then zero in 200 now next step four into ten next Phi into one so how will you write now seven laughs now next one twenty thousand now next one thousand so zero zero zero okay next one hundreds next one is forty next one is what fight now how will you "
,"add it now what will your goddess answer seven two zero zero four five so now how would you express it in words this is what you call it as expanded notation and this is an abacus now how will you write it in words you write seven lakhs seven large 20,000 20,000 and 45 and 45 so this is how you have to do your abacus abacus this rock expanded rotation and then in words so this is how you have to do your sums"

Bx0fqW0rna8,today we are going to look at hcf and lcm you have learnt about this in your previous grade we'll try to revise what you learnt last year and also solve a few more questions so that you will be really good at solving hcf and lcm let's look at hcf what is hcf lcf is highest common factor you also call it as gcd greatest common division how do you find hcf of given numbers we've seen three methods last year but we said there are only two methods that we use commonly the first method is a prime factorization method and the second method is a long division method let's try to solve using the first method prime factorization method find the hcf of 80 60 and 36 remember we are trying to solve this problem using the prime factorization method so in this method we have to find the prime factors of all the three numbers let's do that 80 2 40 20s are two tens are two fives are five ones are prime factors of 60 2 30 2 15 2 15 2 sorry 3 5 0 5 1 0 what are the prime factors of 36 2 18s are 36. two nines are 18. three threes are nine three ones are three so let's list it down the prime factors of 80 are two into two into 2 into 2 into 5 into 1 in the 
,same way let's do it for 60. 2 into 2 into 3 into 5 into 1 and for 36 2 into 2 into 3 into 3 into 1. so common factors what are the common factors we have two and we have another two these are the only two common factors so the common factors are two comma two therefore hcf highest common factor will be two into two which is four that is your this is your hcf this is how you find scf using the prime factorization method let's look at the second method long division let's find the hcf using 
,long division we are taking the same numbers 80 60 and 36. in this method the first step is to divide any two numbers so we divide these two numbers sixty eighty divided by sixty sixty ones are sixty if you remove that 20. remember we bring 60 all the way here and the remainder becomes the dividend 20 goes 3 times 60 that's it this is your first step so hcf of 80 and 60 is 20. now in step two the third number that is remaining is divided with 60 so not 20 20 36 this is the hcf that we found earlier 20 wanza minus 16 the remainder becomes the divisor the divisor becomes a dividend 20 comes here 16 ones are 16 minus 4 we continue this process till we get the remainder 0. so 16 is again brought here then four fours are 16 remainder is zero so therefore you need to take the last divisor that is 4 therefore the hcf of 
,80 60 36 is 4. this is how you are able to find the hcf using long division method so when three numbers when three numbers are given step one you take two numbers and do the division the last divisor becomes the hcf you take the hcf and use that to divide 36 and then the last divisor that you get will be the hcf of all the three numbers in this case it is 4. look at this question find the greatest number that divides 162 322 and 482 leaving a remainder two in each find the greatest number 
,that divides so we know this is a hcf problem so the step one is to subtract 2 from the numbers we are subtracting 2 because in the question it's mentioned that it leaves a remainder 2 in each so the first number is 162. remove 2 you get 160 the second number given is 322 you remove 2 you get 320 the third number given is 482 you remove 2 you get 480. this is your step one you remove two from the numbers the second step is to now find hcf of these three numbers 160 320 and 480 let's do this using the long division method so we will take 160 and 320 first 160 320 divided by 160 gives you 160 goes 2 times 320 0 therefore 160 is your is the hcf for 160 and 320 now step two is where you take that you divide the last number 480 with 160 because 3 times 480 0. therefore hcf of those three numbers is 160 this is how you 
,get the 160 because you got the last divisor is 160. so i'm going over the steps once again they asked us to find the greatest number that divides the three numbers 
,162 322 and 482 leaving a remainder 2 since they mentioned that remainder 2 is left we need to subtract 2 from all the three numbers that's your step one you subtract 2 when you subtract 2 you get these numbers 160 320 and 480. now the step two is to find the greatest number that divides these numbers in other words you have to 
,find the hcf of these three numbers and using the long division method you get 160 is your hcf so we found the hcf of 160 320 480 is 160. tell you a couple of properties of hcf number one hcf of the given numbers cannot be greater than any of the given numbers in other words lcf will be equal to or less than the given number for example let's look at this 160 320 480 the hcf is 160 that means the hcf will always be less than or equal to the given numbers that's your first property we look at the other properties of hcf after we do lcm let's go and do lcm you have learned two methods to find lcm the first method is by prime factorization and the second 
,method is by division of prime factors let's look at each of these methods method one finding lcm by prime factorization method find lcm of 144 180 384 what is lcm lcm we know is the least common multiple so how do we find lcm using method 1 prime factorization method we have to find the prime factors of each of these numbers so 144 272's are 2 36a 2 18 2 9 3 3 3 1 and the next number is 180 by now you should be good at doing divisions to 90's uh to 45 3 15 3 5 5 1 the next number is 384 we finished 144 180 between 384 384 is 2 192's are 296 248 2 24 to 12 2 6 2 3 3 1 there you go now i'm going to list down all the prime factors 144 has how many twos one two three four twos so i write it as two to the power of four you remember the exponential form and then it has got two threes three square or three to the power 
,of two and one how about 180 the prime factors are two twos and two threes so that is 2 square into 3 square into 5 into 1 what about 384 it's got one two three four five six seven twos so it is two to the power of seven and how many threes one three and one therefore now we know how to do lcm remember you have to take all factors but highest powers this is how you take the lcm all factors have to be considered but the highest powers only so what are the factors we have 2 we have 3 and we have 5 what is the highest power of 2 if you notice the highest power of 2 is 7 so we take 7 2 to the power of 7 what about 3 what is the highest power of 3 is 2 3 to the power of 2 and what is the highest power of 5 is only 1 so it is 5 just 5. now you just have to solve this 2 to the power of 7 is 128 3 to the power of 2 is 9 into 5. this is 128 into 45 therefore your lcm is 5760. that's how you find lcm using the prime factorization method now let's do the second method division by prime 
,factors let's take the same numbers 144 180 and 384 in this method we have to find the prime factors of all the three numbers simultaneously so let's do it 2 72 90 192 2 36 are 245's is 90 296 size 192. let's take two 18s are here 45 is not divisible by 2 so it is brought down as it is 240 heats up two nines are 45 again is brought down as it is because it is not divisible by 2 2 24z two nine is also brought down as it is because it is not divisible by two same with forty five two twelve zero two 9 is as it is 45 is as it is 6 0 2 9 45 3 is up now we can do three is a common factor three threes are three fifteens are three ones are three ones are three fives are the last one is five ones are therefore lcm is how many twos are there let's see one two three 4 5 6 7. so we write it as 2 to the power of 7 into how many 3's 1 2 3 to the power of 2 into 5. that is 5760. so using method 1 we got 5760 in method 2 also we get the same lcm 5760. here remember we take the given numbers 
,and we find the prime factors simultaneously and when a number is not divisible by 2 or by the prime number given you bring it down as it is the lcm would be all the prime factors multiplied and that is 5760. now that you've seen both the methods let's try to do this problem find the smallest number which when divided by 20 15 and 28 leaves a remainder of 9 in each case the moment you see a question like this you know that they're asking you for lcm because they're asking you the smallest number that divides these three numbers that is your least common multiple or lowest common multiple but here they are they mentioned that it leaves a remainder of 9 
,in each case so remember so in hcf you removed the remainder from all the three numbers but here you first find lcm and the answer would be lcm that you found here plus remainder so let's find the lcm how do we find the lcm of the three numbers 2 15 28 the commonly used method is the division by prime factors so we are going to 
,do that 2 10 15 is brought down as it is fourteen two fives are seven zero five once a threes are seven three seven one one one therefore what is the lcm how many twos are there one two into one three one five and one seven if you multiply this you will get four into 105 that is 420 but remember we are not we the we have not yet got the answer because we need to add the remainder to this number therefore the smallest number which divides 20 15 in 2015 and 28 leaving a remainder of 9 is this 420 plus the remainder that is 420 plus 9 429 that's your answer let's just check 429 when divided by 15 20 and 28 or 28 when you divide 429 by 15 20 or 28 let's see what the remainder is so let's just divide it by 15 429 divided by 15 15 2's are thirty twelve nine comes down fifteen eights are hundred and twenty if you remove 
,the answer is nine that is your reminder this was just a check so the answer to that question is 429 here let's look at one property of lcm lcm of 20 15 and 28 regarded as 429 which leaves the remainder 9. let's look at the property lcm of given numbers cannot be less than any of the given numbers in other words lcm will be equal to or greater than given numbers look at the given numbers 20 15 and 28 the lcm is always greater than or equal to given numbers we saw earlier that hcf is always 
,less than or equal to given numbers so you found you got two properties of hcf and lcm let's look at another property if the hcf of two numbers is equal to any one of the numbers the lcm will be the other number i'll show you an example let's take 12 and 48 if you have to find the hcf first 48 by 12 will give you 412 folds of 48 0. hcf is 12 hcf of these numbers is 12. so the property says if the hcf of two numbers is equal to one of the numbers so we found that the cf is 12 then lcm will be the other number let's see if lcm is 48 how do we find 12 48 let's do the division by prime factors 2 6 are 12 24 2 3 12 3 once we do 2 2 therefore lcm will be 2 to the power of 1 2 3 4 to the power of 4 into 1 3 that is 16 into 3 that is your 48 therefore the two numbers given are 12 and 48. we got the hcf as 12 lcm if hcf is one number lcm will be the other number 48 this is another interesting property of hcf and lcm so here's the property the lcm of two co-prime numbers is always the 
,product of the two numbers let's take three and seven the hcf is 1 because they are co-prime numbers so if the hcf is 1 then lcm is product of these two numbers that is 3 into 7 21 let's check how do you find the lcm of 3 and 7 3 ones are 3 7 is brought down as it is 7 anza therefore lcm is equal to 3 into 7 that is 21. so for coparame numbers where the hcf is 1 the lcm will always be the product of the two numbers that's your property so here's a look at the properties of hcf and lcm we've learned so far the first one is hcf will be equal to or less than the given number second one is lcm will be equal to or greater than the given numbers the third one is if hcf of two numbers is equal to any one of the numbers lcm will be the other number we looked at the example of 12 and 48 and the last property we saw is that if at cf of two numbers is one that is if they are co-prime numbers the lcm of co-prime numbers is always the product of those two numbers let's look at the relation between hcf and lcm we're going to find something interesting let's take two numbers four and six what is the lcm if you do the lcm you will find it as 12 and if you find the hcf you will get it as two so i'll show you how you got this 12 4 6 is two twos are two threes are two ones are three so 2 into 2 into 3 is your 12 which is your lcm how about ncf 4 6 4 is 4. if you do minus you get 2. 4 is brought down here two twos are four zero therefore it's cf is your two so four and 6 you got hcf s2 and lcms 12. now hcf into lcm is 2 into 12 that is 24 how about the product of the numbers given 4 and 6. 4 into 6 24. therefore we see the product of lcm the 
,product of hcf and lcm is the same as the product of the given numbers that is an interesting property of hcf and lcm the product of hcf and lcm of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers you can take any numbers you will find those numbers satisfying this property i hope this session has been useful to you you can find this chapter in your textbook from page number 87 to 97 go ahead and read the chapter and answer all the questions given there that way you will be really good at finding hcf and lcm happy learning bye you

,to be a prime number. And what you'll
,"see in this video, or you'll hopefully"
,"see in this video, is it's a pretty"
,straightforward concept. But as you progress through
,"your mathematical careers, you'll see that there's actually"
,fairly sophisticated concepts that can be built on top of
,the idea of a prime number. And that includes the
,idea of cryptography. And maybe some of the encryption
,that your computer uses right now could be
,based on prime numbers. If you don't know
,"what encryption means, you don't have to worry"
,about it right now. You just need to know the prime
,numbers are pretty important. So I'll give you a definition. And the definition might
,"be a little confusing, but when we see"
,"it with examples, it should hopefully be"
,pretty straightforward. So a number is prime if
,"it is a natural number-- and a natural number, once"
,"again, just as an example, these are like the numbers 1, 2,"
,"3, so essentially the counting numbers starting"
,"at 1, or you could say the positive integers. It is a natural number divisible"
,"by exactly two numbers, or two other natural numbers. Actually I shouldn't"
,"say two other, I should say two"
,natural numbers. So it's not two other
,natural numbers-- divisible by exactly
,"two natural numbers. One of those numbers is itself,"
,and the other one is one. Those are the two numbers
,that it is divisible by. And that's why I didn't
,"want to say exactly two other natural numbers,"
,because one of the numbers is itself. And if this doesn't
,"make sense for you, let's just do some"
,"examples here, and let's figure out if some"
,numbers are prime or not. So let's start with the smallest
,"natural number-- the number 1. So you might say, look,"
,"1 is divisible by 1 and it is divisible by itself. You might say, hey,"
,"1 is a prime number. But remember, part"
,of our definition-- it needs to be divisible by
,exactly two natural numbers. 1 is divisible by only one
,"natural number-- only by 1. So 1, although it might be"
,a little counter intuitive is not prime. Let's move on to 2. So 2 is divisible by
,1 and by 2 and not by any other natural numbers. So it seems to meet
,our constraint. It's divisible by exactly
,"two natural numbers-- itself, that's 2 right there, and 1. So 2 is prime. And I'll circle"
,"the prime numbers. I'll circle them. Well actually, let me do"
,"it in a different color, since I already used"
,that color for the-- I'll just circle them. I'll circle the
,numbers that are prime. And 2 is interesting
,because it is the only even number
,"that is prime. If you think about it,"
,any other even number is also going to be
,"divisible by 2, above and beyond 1 and itself. So it won't be prime. We'll think about that"
,"more in future videos. Let's try out 3. Well, 3 is definitely"
,divisible by 1 and 3. And it's really not divisible
,"by anything in between. It's not divisible by 2, so"
,3 is also a prime number. Let's try 4. I'll switch to
,"another color here. Let's try 4. Well, 4 is definitely"
,divisible by 1 and 4. But it's also divisible by 2. 2 times 2 is 4. It's also divisible by 2. So it's divisible by three
,"natural numbers-- 1, 2, and 4. So it does not meet our"
,constraints for being prime. Let's try out 5. So 5 is definitely
,"divisible by 1. It's not divisible by 2. It's not divisible by 3. It's not exactly divisible by 4. You could divide them into it,"
,but you would get a remainder. But it is exactly
,"divisible by 5, obviously. So once again, it's divisible"
,"by exactly two natural numbers-- 1 and 5. So, once again, 5 is prime. Let's keep going,"
,just so that we see if there's any
,kind of a pattern here. And then maybe I'll
,"try a really hard one that tends to trip people up. So let's try the number. 6. It is divisible by 1. It is divisible by 2. It is divisible by 3. Not 4 or 5, but it "
,is divisible by 6. So it has four natural
,number factors. I guess you could
,say it that way. And so it does not have
,"exactly two numbers that it is divisible by. It has four, so it is not prime. Let's move on to 7. 7 is divisible by 1, not 2,"
,"not 3, not 4, not 5, not 6. But it's also divisible by 7. So 7 is prime. I think you get the"
,general idea here. How many natural
,"numbers-- numbers like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, the numbers"
,"that you learned when you were two years old, not including 0,"
,"not including negative numbers, not including fractions and"
,"irrational numbers and decimals and all the rest, just regular"
,counting positive numbers. If you have only two
,"of them, if you're only divisible by yourself and"
,"one, then you are prime. And the way I think"
,about it-- if we don't think about the
,"special case of 1, prime numbers are kind of these"
,building blocks of numbers. You can't break
,them down anymore they're almost like the
,"atoms-- if you think about what an atom is, or"
,what people thought atoms were when
,they first-- they thought it was kind of the
,thing that you couldn't divide anymore. We now know that you
,"could divide atoms and, actually, if"
,"you do, you might create a nuclear explosion. But it's the same idea"
,behind prime numbers. In theory-- and in prime
,"numbers, it's not theory, we know you can't"
,break them down into products of
,smaller natural numbers. Things like 6-- you could
,"say, hey, 6 is 2 times 3. You can break it down. And notice we can break it down"
,as a product of prime numbers. We've kind of broken
,"it down into its parts. 7, you can't break"
,it down anymore. All you can say is that
,"7 is equal to 1 times 7, and in that case, you really"
,haven't broken it down much. You just have the 7 there again. 6 you can actually
,break it down. 4 you can actually break
,"it down as 2 times 2. Now with that out of the way,"
,"let's think about some larger numbers, and think about whether"
,"those larger numbers are prime. So let's try 16. So clearly, any number is"
,"divisible by 1 and itself. Any number, any natural"
,number you put up here is going to be
,divisible by 1 and 16. So you're always
,going to start with 2. So if you can find anything
,"else that goes into this, then you know you're not prime. And 16, you could have 2 times"
,"8, you could have 4 times 4. So it's got a ton"
,of factors here above and beyond
,just the 1 and 16. So 16 is not prime. What about 17? 1 and 17 will
,"definitely go into 17. 2 doesn't go into 17. 3 doesn't go. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 10, 11--"
,"none of those numbers, nothing between 1"
,and 17 goes into 17. So 17 is prime. And now I'll give
,you a hard one. This one can trick
,a lot of people. What about 51? Is 51 prime? And if you're
,"interested, maybe you could pause the"
,video here and try to figure out for yourself
,if 51 is a prime number. If you can find anything
,"other than 1 or 51 that is divisible into 51. It seems like, wow, this is"
,kind of a strange number. You might be tempted
,to think it's prime. But I'm now going to give you
,"the answer-- it is not prime, because it is also"
,divisible by 3 and 17. 3 times 17 is 51. So hopefully that
,gives you a good idea of what prime numbers
,are all about. And hopefully we can
,give you some practice on that in future videos or
,maybe some of our exercises.

znmPfDfsir8,What is the least common
,multiple of 36 and 12? So another way to say this is
,"LCM, in parentheses, 36 to 12. And this is literally"
,saying what's the least common
,"multiple of 36 and 12? Well, this one might"
,"pop out at you, because 36 itself"
,is a multiple of 12. And 36 is also a multiple of 36. It's 1 times 36. So the smallest number that is
,both a multiple of 36 and 12-- because 36 is a multiple
,of 12-- is actually 36. There we go. Let's do a couple more of these. That one was too easy. What is the least common
,multiple of 18 and 12? And they just state this
,with a different notation. The least common
,multiple of 18 and 12 is equal to question mark. So let's think about
,this a little bit. So there's a couple of ways
,you can think about-- so let's just write down our
,"numbers that we care about. We care about 18,"
,and we care about 12. So there's two ways that
,we could approach this. One is the prime
,factorization approach. We can take the prime
,factorization of both of these numbers
,and then construct the smallest number
,whose prime factorization has all of the ingredients
,"of both of these numbers, and that will be the"
,"least common multiple. So let's do that. 18 is 2 times 9, which is"
,"the same thing as 2 times 3 times 3, or 18 is 2 times 9. 9 is 3 times 3. So we could write 18 is"
,equal to 2 times 3 times 3. That's its prime factorization. 12 is 2 times 6. 6 is 2 times 3. So 12 is equal to
,"2 times 2 times 3. Now, the least common"
,multiple of 18 and 12-- let me write this down-- so
,the least common multiple of 18 and 12 is going to have to have
,enough prime factors to cover both of these
,"numbers and no more, because we want the least"
,"common multiple or the smallest common multiple. So let's think about it. Well, it needs to have at"
,"least 1, 2, a 3 and a 3 in order to be divisible by 18. So let's write that down. So we have to have"
,a 2 times 3 times 3. This makes it divisible by 18. If you multiply this
,"out, you actually get 18. And now let's look at the 12. So this part right over"
,here-- let me make it clear. This part right over
,"here is the part that makes up 18, makes"
,"it divisible by 18. And then let's see. 12, we need two 2's and a 3. Well, we already have one 3,"
,"so our 3 is taken care of. We have one 2, so this"
,"2 is taken care of. But we don't have two 2s's. So we need another 2 here. So, notice, now this number"
,"right over here has a 2 times 2 times 3 in it, or it has a"
,"12 in it, and it has a 2 times 3 times 3, or an 18 in it. So this right over here is"
,"the least common multiple of 18 and 12. If we multiply it out,"
,"so 2 times 2 is 4. 4 times 3 is 12. 12 times 3 is equal to 36. And we are done. Now, the other way"
,you could've done it is what I would say
,just the brute force method of just looking at the
,"multiples of these numbers. You would say, well, let's see. The multiples of 18"
,"are 18, 36, and I could keep going"
,"higher and higher, 54. And I could keep going. And the multiples of"
,"12 are 12, 24, 36. And immediately I say, well, I"
,don't have to go any further. I already found a
,"multiple of both, and this is the smallest"
,"multiple of both. It is 36. You might say, hey,"
,why would I ever do this one right over here
,"as opposed to this one? A couple of reasons. This one, you're"
,"kind of-- it's fun, because you're actually"
,"decomposing the number and then building it back up. And also, this is a better"
,"way, especially if you're doing it with really, really"
,"large and hairy numbers. Really, really, really"
,large and hairy numbers where you keep trying to
,"find all the multiples, you might have to go pretty"
,far to actually figure out what their least
,"common multiple is. Here, you'll be able to do it a"
,"little bit more systematically, and you'll know"
,what you're doing.

bLTfBvkrfsM,"We're asked, what is the"
,"greatest common divisor of 20 and 40? And they just say,"
,"another way to say this is the GCD, or greatest"
,"common divisor, of 20 of 40 is equal to question mark. And greatest common divisor"
,"sounds like a very fancy term, but it's really"
,"just saying, what is the largest number that is"
,"divisible into both 20 and 40? Well, this seems like a pretty"
,"straightforward situation, because 20 is actually"
,divisible into 40. Or another way to
,say it is 40 can be divided by 20
,without a remainder. So the largest
,number that is a-- I guess you could say-- factor of
,"both 20 and 40 is actually 20. 20 is 20 times 1,"
,"and 40 is 20 times 2. So in this situation,"
,"we don't even have to break out our paper. We can just write 20. Let's do a couple more of these. So we're asked, what is"
,the greatest common divisor of 10 and 7? So let's now break out
,our paper for this. So our greatest common
,divisor of 10 and 7. So let me write that down. So we have 10. We want to think about what
,is our GCD of 10 and 7? And there's two ways that
,"you can approach this. One way, you could literally"
,"list all of the factors-- not prime factors, just"
,regular factors-- of each of these numbers and figure
,out which one is greater or what is the largest
,"factor of both. So, for example, you could"
,"say, well, I got a 10, and 10 can be expressed"
,"1 times 10 or 2 times 5. 1, 2, 5, and 10. These are all factors of 10. These are all, we could"
,"say, divisors of 10. And sometimes this is called"
,greatest common factor. Seven-- what are
,"all of its factors? Well, 7 is prime. It only has two"
,factors-- 1 and itself. So what is the
,"greatest common factor? Well, there's only one"
,"common factor here, 1. 1 is the only common factor. So the greatest common"
,"factor of 10 and 7, or the greatest common divisor,"
,is going to be equal to 1. So let's write that down. 1. Let's do one more. What is the greatest common
,divisor of 21 and 30? And this is just another
,way of saying that. So 21 and 30 are the two
,numbers that we care about. So we want to figure out
,"the greatest common divisor, and I could have written"
,"greatest common factor, of 21 and 30. So once again, there's"
,two ways of doing this. And so there's the way I did
,the last time where I literally list all the factors. Let me do it that
,"way really fast. So if I say 21, what"
,"are all the factors? Well, it's 1 and"
,"21, and 3, and 7. I think I've got all of them. And 30 can be written as 1 and"
,"30, 2 and 15, and 3-- actually, I'm going to run out of them. Let me write it this way so"
,I get a little more space. So 1 and 30. 2 and 15. 3 and 10. And 5 and 6. So here are all of
,the factors of 30. And now what are
,"the common factors? Well, 1 is a common factor. 3 is also a common factor. But what is the"
,"greatest common factor or the greatest common divisor? Well, it is going to be 3. So we could write 3 here. Now, I keep talking"
,about another technique. Let me show you the
,"other technique, and that involves the"
,prime factorization. So if you say the prime
,"factorization of 21-- well, let's see, it's divisible by 3. It is 3 times 7. And the prime factorization"
,"of 30 is equal to 3 times 10, and 10 is 2 times 5. So what are the"
,most factors that we can take from both 21 and
,30 to make the largest possible numbers? So when you look at the
,"prime factorization, the only thing that's common"
,right over here is a 3. And so we would say that
,the greatest common factor or the greatest common
,divisor of 21 and 30 is 3. If you saw nothing in
,"common right over here, then you say the greatest"
,common divisor is one. Let me give you another
,"interesting example, just so that we can get a"
,sense of things. So let's say these two
,"numbers were not 21 and 30, but let's say we care about"
,"the greatest common divisor not of 21, but let's"
,say of 105 and 30. So if we did the prime
,"factorization method, it might become a"
,"little clearer now. Actually figuring out, hey,"
,what are all the factors of 105 might be a little bit
,"of a pain, but if you do a prime factorization,"
,"you'd say, well, let's see, 105-- it's divisible"
,"by 5, definitely. So it's 5 times 21,"
,and 21 is 3 times 7. So the prime
,factorization of 105 is equal to-- if I write them
,in increasing order-- 3 times 5 times 7. The prime factorization of
,"30, we already figured out is 30 is equal to"
,2 times 3 times 5. So what's the most
,number of factors or prime factors that
,"they have in common? Well, these two both have a"
,"3, and they both have a 5. So the greatest common factor"
,or greatest common divisor is going to be a
,"product of these two. In this situation,"
,"the GCD of 105 and 30 is 3 times 5, is equal to 15. So you could do it either way. You could just list out the"
,"traditional divisors or factors and, say, figure"
,out which of those is common and is the greatest. Or you can break it down
,"into its core constituencies, its prime factors,"
,and then figure out what is the largest set
,"of common prime factors, and the product"
,of those is going to be your greatest
,common factor. It's the largest number that
,is divisible into both numbers.
,
ZKKDTfHcsG0,Write the prime factorization
,of 75. Write your answer using
,exponential notation. So we have a couple of
,"interesting things here. Prime factorization, and they"
,say exponential notation. We'll worry about the
,exponential notation later. So the first thing we have to
,"worry about is what is even a prime number? And just as a refresher, a"
,prime number is a number that's only divisible by itself
,"and one, so examples of prime numbers-- let me write"
,"some numbers down. Prime, not prime. So 2 is a prime number. It's only divisible"
,"by 1 and 2. 3 is another prime number. Now, 4 is not prime,"
,"because this is divisible by 1, 2 and 4. We could keep going. 5, well, 5 is only divisible"
,"by 1 and 5, so 5 is prime. 6 is not prime, because it's"
,divisible by 2 and 3. I think you get the
,"general idea. You move to 7, 7 is prime. It's only divisible"
,by 1 and 7. 8 is not prime. 9 you might be tempted to say
,"is prime, but remember, it's also divisible by 3,"
,so 9 is not prime. Prime is not the same thing
,"as odd numbers. Then if you move to 10,"
,"10 is also not prime, divisible by 2 and 5. 11, it's only divisible"
,"by 1 and 11, so 11 is then a prime number. And we could keep going"
,on like this. People have written computer
,programs looking for the highest prime and all of that. So now that we know what
,"a prime is, a prime factorization is breaking up"
,"a number, like 75, into a product of prime numbers. So let's try to do that. So we're going to start with"
,"75, and I'm going to do it using what we call a"
,factorization tree. So we first try to find just the
,"smallest prime number that will go into 75. Now, the smallest prime"
,"number is 2. Does 2 go into 75? Well, 75 is an odd number, or"
,"the number in the ones place, this 5, is an odd number. 5 is not divisible by 2, so"
,"2 will not go into 75. So then we could try 3. Does 3 go into 75? Well, 7 plus 5 is 12. 12 is divisible by 3, so"
,3 will go into it. So 75 is 3 times
,something else. And if you've ever dealt with
,"change, you know that if you have three quarters, you have"
,"75 cents, or if you have 3 times 25, you have 75. So this is 3 times 25. And you can multiply this out"
,"if you don't believe me. Multiple out 3 times 25. Now, is 25 divisible by--"
,"you can give up on 2. If 75 wasn't divisible by 2,"
,25's not going to be divisible by 2 either. But maybe 25 is divisible
,by 3 again. So if you take the digits
,"2 plus 5, you get 7. 7 is not divisible by 3, so 25"
,"will not be divisible by 3. So we keep moving up: 5. Is 25 divisible by 5? Well, sure. It's 5 times 5. So 25 is 5 times 5. And we're done with our prime"
,factorization because now we have all prime numbers here. So we can write that 75
,is 3 times 5 times 5. So 75 is equal to 3
,"times 5 times 5. We can say it's 3 times 25. 25 is 5 times 5. 3 times 25, 25 is 5 times 5. So this is a prime"
,"factorization, but they want us to write our answer using"
,"exponential notation. So that just means, if we have"
,"repeated primes, we can write those as an exponent. So what is 5 times 5? 5 times 5 is 5 multiplied"
,by itself two times. This is the same thing as
,5 to the second power. So if we want to write our
,"answer using exponential notation, we could say this is"
,"equal to 3 times 5 to the second power, which is the"
,same thing as 5 times 5.
,
S7CLLRHe8ik,Let's say that today-- and
,we'll call today Day 1-- Day 1 is a Monday. What I want to
,figure out is what is the Day 300 going to be? What day of the week
,will Day 300 be? And I encourage you
,to pause the video and think about
,that a little bit. So let's just write out
,the days of the week. You have Monday-- I'll do this
,"in a different color-- you have Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,"
,"Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday. So if we had a"
,"lower number here, we could just fill this out. Monday is Day 1. Tuesday's Day 2. Wednesday, Day 3. 4, 5, 6, 7. I'll keep going. Day 8, well, that's going"
,to be a Monday again. 9 10. I'm almost writing
,"a calendar out. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. So this is kind of useful. I could just write"
,it out if I wanted to figure out something
,Day 16 or Day 20. I could just write that out. But this isn't that helpful if
,I want to figure out Day 300 or especially
,wouldn't be helpful if I wanted to
,"figure out Day 3,000. So can I come up with"
,some mathematical way of thinking about what
,"Day 300 is going to be? Well, as you see when I"
,"started drawing this grid here, this grid has rows. And each row, you"
,have seven days in it. And that makes sense. There are seven
,days of the week. So is there a way that if
,someone just gave you 16 without drawing
,"this grid, then you would know that 16 is a Tuesday? Well, one way to think about"
,it that might jump out at you is you could divide 16 by 7. That will tell you how many of
,these rows will come before 16. So 16 divided by 7 is 2. You have 2 rows before
,16 right over here. You could get 7 into 16 2 times. And then you have a remainder. What is the remainder
,when you divide 16 by 7? 16 divided by 7
,is going to be 2. 2 times 7 is 14. You're going to have
,"a remainder of 2. So when we divide,"
,we've historically cared more about this 2. We normally care
,"more about well, how many times"
,"does it go into it. But now, the remainder"
,is actually interesting. The remainder is really
,interesting here. Because the remainder
,tells you-- the first two just tells you 7
,goes into 16 2 times. That's how many rows you have
,before getting to the 16. But then the remainder tells
,you in that row where is the 16? So the 16 is remainder 2. So the 16 is not the first. It's the second entry
,in the third row. And so it's going
,"to be a Tuesday. Tuesday is the second day. I know what you're saying. Does that always work? Well, let's try it out"
,with some other examples. Let's imagine Day 25. So let's just divide 25 by 7. So I'll do it right
,over-- I could do it. I'm going to make sure
,I have enough space. So if I have 7 goes into
,"25, it goes 3 times. 3 times 7 is 21. You have a remainder of 4. So let's see. So based on that-- so let"
,me rewrite this-- so 25 divided by 7 is equal
,"to 3, remainder 4. So based on this, if we"
,"were to write out the grid, we should have three rows of"
,7 before we get to the 25. And then 25 should sit
,in the fourth column. So if it's sitting
,"in the fourth column, it should be a Thursday. So Day 25, based on this"
,"little math we just did, should be a Thursday. Let's see if that"
,"actually works out. So let's go to 17, 18, 19,"
,"20, 21, 22, 23, 24 and 25. It is indeed a Thursday. But it makes complete sense. You could get seven rows in it"
,"before the row that gets to 25. And then in that row, it's"
,"going to be the fourth entry, because you have"
,"a remainder of 4. 1, 2, 3, 4. It's going to be a Thursday. So now we're ready to"
,answer the question. What is Day 300 going to be? So let's just divide 300
,"by 7 and see where we get. 7 goes into 30 4 times. 4 times 7 is 28. Subtract, you get 2. Bring down a 0. 7 goes into 20 2 times. 2 times 7 is 14. And then we get our remainder. And now we care much"
,more about the remainder. 20 minus 14 is 6. So our remainder is 6. So if we think about what day
,"of the week it is, in its row it's going to be"
,the sixth entry. It's going to be
,the sixth column. There's going to be
,42 rows above it. But we care about which
,entry it is in its row. So Day 300 is going to be
,"the sixth day of the week, the way we've written it out. It is going to be a Saturday."

g805f4HlV1Y,"e're told we know that five times three is equal to 15. Yep, that's true. So which of the following"
,statements are also true? And it says to choose two answers. So pause this video and see
,"if you can work through that. All right, now let's go"
,"through them one by one. So this first one says,"
,"Three is a multiple of 15. Now, in order for three to be"
,"able to be a multiple of 15, that means that we can multiply 15 by some whole number to get to three. But a multiple of 15,"
,"we're thinking 15, 30, 45, it's not gonna be three. What whole number can I"
,multiple 15 by to get three? If I multiply 15 by
,"one, I'm already at 15. So this is not going to be our choice. And since it say pick two answers, well, we might be able to figure out it's these. But let's just read them to make sure that they make sense. 15 is a multiple of three. So that means I can multiply"
,"three times some whole number to get to 15, and we know"
,what that whole number is. It's five. They tell us right over there. Five times three is 15. So 15 is a multiple of three. 15 would also be a multiple
,of five 'cause I can multiply five by the whole
,"number three to get to 15. So I like this choice. Five is a factor of 15. Well, a factor, factors of a number are numbers that you can multiply together to get that "
,"number. So five is a factor of 15,"
,"and three is a factor of 15, because five times three is 15. So this one is also true. It would've also been true if they'd said three is a factor of 15, or if they'd said 15"
,is a multiple of five. Any of those would have
,"been true statements based on what we know, that"
,five times three is equal to 15.

jFd-6EPfnec,Welcome to the greatest
,"common divisor or greatest common factor video. So just to be clear, first of"
,"all, when someone asks you whether what's the greatest"
,common divisor of 12 and 8? Or they ask you what's
,the greatest common factor of 12 and 8? That's a c right
,there for common. I don't know why it
,came out like that. They're asking you
,"the same thing. I mean, really a divisor is"
,"just a number that can divide into something, and a factor--"
,"well, I think, that's also a number that can divide"
,into something. So a divisor and a factor
,"are kind of the same thing. So with that out of the way,"
,"let's figure out, what is the greatest common divisor or"
,"the greatest common factor of 12 and 8? Well, what we do is, it's"
,pretty straightforward. First we just figure out the
,factors of each of the numbers. So first let's write all of the
,"factors out of the number 12. Well, 1 is a factor,"
,2 goes into 12. 3 goes into 12. 4 goes into 12. 5 does not to go into 12. 6 goes into 12
,"because 2 times 6. And then, 12 goes"
,"into 12 of course. 1 times 12. So that's the factors of 12. Let's write the factors of 8. Well, 1 goes into 8. 2 goes into 8. 3 does not go into 8. 4 does go into 8. And then the last factor,"
,pairing up with the 1 is 8. So now we've written all
,the factors of 12 and 8. So let's figure out what the
,"common factors of 12 and 8 are. Well, they both have the"
,common factor of 1. And that's really
,not so special. Pretty much every whole
,number or every integer has the common factor of 1. They both share the common
,factor 2 and they both share the common factor 4. So we're not just interested in
,"finding a common factor, we're interested in finding the"
,greatest common factor. So all the common
,"factors are 1, 2 and 4. And what's the"
,"greatest of them? Well, that's pretty easy. It's 4. So the greatest common"
,factor of 12 and 8 is 4. Let me write that down
,just for emphasis. Greatest common factor
,"of 12 and 8 equals 4. And of course, we could have"
,"just as easily had said, the greatest common divisor"
,of 12 and 8 equals 4. Sometimes it does
,things a little funny. Let's do another problem. What is the greatest common
,"divisor of 25 and 20? Well, let's do it the same way. The factors of 25? Well, it's 1. 2 doesn't go into it. 3 doesn't go into it. 4 doesn't go into it. 5 does. It's actually 5 times 5. And then 25. It's interesting that"
,this only has 3 factors. I'll leave you to think about
,why this number only has 3 factors and other numbers
,tend to have an even number of factors. And then now we do
,"the factors of 20. Factors of 20 are 1,"
,"2, 4, 5, 10, and 20. And if we just look at this by"
,"inspection we see, well, they both share 1, but that's"
,nothing special. But they both have the
,common factor of? You got it-- 5. So the greatest common divisor
,"or greatest common factor of 25 and 20- well, that equals 5. Let's do another problem. What is the greatest common"
,"factor of 5 and 12? Well, factors of 5? Pretty easy. 1 and 5. That's because it's"
,a prime number. It has no factors other
,"than 1 and itself. Then the factors of 12? 12 has a lot of factors. It's 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. So it really looks like only"
,"common factor they share is 1. So that was, I guess, in some"
,ways kind of disappointing. So the greatest common
,factor of 5 and 12 is 1. And I'll throw out some
,terminology here for you. When two numbers have a
,"greatest common factor of only 1, they're called"
,relatively prime. And that kind of makes sense
,because a prime number is something that only has 1
,and itself as a factor. And two relatively prime
,numbers are numbers that only have 1 as their
,greatest common factor. Hope I didn't confuse you. Let's do another problem. Let's do the greatest common
,divisor of 6 and 12. I know 12's coming up a lot. I'll try to be more creative
,"when I think of my numbers. Well, the greatest common"
,"divisor of 6 and 12? Well, it's the factors of 6. Are 1, 2, 3, and 6. Factors of 12: 1, 2, 3--"
,"we should have these memorized by now. 3, 4, 6, and 12. Well, it turns out 1 is a"
,common factor of both. 2 is also a common
,factor of both. 3 is a common factor of both. And 6 is a common
,"factor of both. And of course, what's the"
,"greatest common factor? Well, it's 6. And that's interesting. So in this situation the"
,greatest common divisor-- and I apologize that I keep switching
,between divisor and factor. The mathematics community
,should settle on one of the two. The greatest common divisor
,of 6 and 12 equals 6. So it actually equals
,one of the numbers. And that makes a lot of
,"sense because 6 actually is divisible into 12. Well, that's it for now. Hopefully you're ready to do"
,the greatest common divisor or factor problems. I think I might make another
,module in the near future that'll give you more
,example problems.

AHRh3EpJQH0,SAL KHAN: I'm here with our
,"exercise guru, Ben Eater-- BEN EATER: Hi, Sal. SAL KHAN: --who made this"
,"exercise, and now we're going to try to work through it. So let's see. It says what are"
,the factors of 9? You can re-size this box
,with 9 dots-- the box has 9 dots-- to help
,you find the factors. BEN EATER: So what
,"you're looking at, is you've got these"
,"9 dots on the screen. And right now, there are"
,just 1 row of 9 dots. And if you grab
,that little thing on the right side of the box and
,"move that around to the left-- SAL KHAN: Oh, that's neat. BEN EATER: --you"
,"still have 9 dots, but they're arranged"
,differently. SAL KHAN: I see. BEN EATER: And so what you
,"can see is, try to get them so you have the same"
,"number in each row. SAL KHAN: I see, so this one. So if you have-- let's"
,"see, not the same number. BEN EATER: There you go. SAL KHAN: Oh, 3 there. And so you could get"
,to 9 by literally multiplying 3 rows
,times 3 columns. BEN EATER: That's right. SAL KHAN: And you get to 9. BEN EATER: So 3 is a factor. SAL KHAN: And then we would
,write that in this box right over here. BEN EATER: Mm-hm. SAL KHAN: So we'd write 3--
,"do we have to write 3 twice, because we have-- or is"
,just writing 3 once-- BEN EATER: 3 is the factor-- SAL KHAN: 3 is a factor. BEN EATER: --so you
,just put it once. SAL KHAN: We don't
,have to write it. If we wrote it twice
,"would it be wrong? BEN EATER: Uh-huh,"
,"yes, actually. SAL KHAN: It would? OK, so-- BEN EATER: We do"
,mark that wrong. SAL KHAN: --you actually
,"do mark that wrong. OK, so there's 3 and 3. But there was also, right when"
,"you started, you had 9 and 1. BEN EATER: That's right. Both of those are factors. SAL KHAN: And I"
,"don't have to write these in any special order? BEN EATER: No, no. SAL KHAN: 1 and 9. BEN EATER: Just got"
,to get them all. SAL KHAN: And I believe
,that's all there is. And we could look
,"at the other ones, and we can see, look"
,"2 and 8 definitely-- BEN EATER: No. SAL KHAN: No, that's"
,not working out. It's interesting
,for people to think about why these
,"aren't working out. BEN EATER: Right. Yeah, you can't divide 2 into 9. SAL KHAN: And this just"
,"gets us to 1 and 9 again, and we don't want to repeat it. BEN EATER: Those are"
,the same factors. SAL KHAN: Exactly. So let's check our answer. Let's see how we're doing. BEN EATER: OK. SAL KHAN: Let's see. There we go. We got it all right. Let's do one more. BEN EATER: OK. SAL KHAN: Let's do one more. Correct. The next question. You can resize this
,box with 16 dots to help you find the factor. It's 1 and 16. BEN EATER: 1 and 16
,"are factors, sure. SAL KHAN: So me write those. BEN EATER: Those"
,are all its factors. SAL KHAN: So 1 and 16. So let's play with
,this box here. That's not working. That's not working. So I'm trying to figure
,out-- so this is essentially going 2 times-- 2 might be
,"a factor if I could just-- oh look, it is. BEN EATER: There it is, yeah. 2 is a factor SAL KHAN: 2 is a factor. BEN EATER: And so is 8. SAL KHAN: Exactly, exactly. 2 rows of 8 works. And so we could say"
,2 and 8 are factors. BEN EATER: And if
,"you think about it, 2 and 8 both divide into 16. SAL KHAN: Absolutely. BEN EATER: 2"
,divides eight times. SAL KHAN: Yes. BEN EATER: Or 8
,"divides two times. SAL KHAN: Yes, you can that. You can construct. BEN EATER: Right. SAL KHAN: 16 dots, you can"
,divide them into 2 groups of 8. BEN EATER: That's right. SAL KHAN: And I suspect
,"also 8 groups of 2. BEN EATER: Well,"
,"you can see that. SAL KHAN: Let's see,"
,"so that's 2 groups of 8, really, or 2 rows of 8. Let's see, or oh, look at that. 4 times 4. BEN EATER: 4 times 4. SAL KHAN: And I'll"
,just write the 4 once. BEN EATER: So 4 is a factor. SAL KHAN: 4 is a factor. And then I can-- and I've
,"probably-- well, I've already gotten 8 and 2. BEN EATER: Already got that. SAL KHAN: Now I have 8 groups"
,"of 2 instead of 2 groups of 8, but they're still both factors. Then you go back to 16 and 1. BEN EATER: That's right. SAL KHAN: So I think we're done. BEN EATER: I think so. SAL KHAN: Let's"
,check our answer. Oh-- BEN EATER: Very good. SAL KHAN: --very
,"good, very good. Well, thank you. That was fun. BEN EATER: Thank you. SAL KHAN: This was very"
,"neat, very fun to play with. BEN EATER: Well, thanks."

3h4UK62Qrbo,Determine whether the following
,"numbers are prime, composite, or neither. So just as a bit of"
,"review, a prime number is a natural number-- so one of"
,"the counting numbers, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, so on and so forth--"
,that has exactly two factors. So its factors are 1 and itself. So an example of a
,prime factor is 3. There's only two
,natural numbers that are divisible into 3-- 1 and 3. Or another way to think about
,"it is, the only way to get 3 as a product of other"
,natural numbers is 1 times 3. So it only has 1 and itself. A composite number
,is a natural number that has more than just
,1 and itself as factors. And we'll see examples of
,that and neither-- we'll see an interesting case
,of that in this problem. So first let's think about 24. So let's think
,about all of the-- I guess you could think of
,"it as the natural numbers or the whole numbers,"
,although 0 is also included in whole numbers. Let's think of all of the
,natural counting numbers that we can actually
,"divide into 24 without having any remainder. We'd consider those the factors. Well, clearly it is"
,"divisible by 1 and 24. In fact, 1 times"
,"24 is equal to 24. But it's also divisible by 2. 2 times 12 is 24. So it's also divisible by 12. And it is also divisible by 3. 3 times 8 is also equal to 24. And even at this point,"
,we don't actually have to find all of the factors
,to realize that it's not prime. It clearly has more factors
,than just 1 and itself. So then it is clearly
,"going to be composite. This is going to be composite. Now, let's just finish factoring"
,it just since we started it. It's also divisible by 4. And 4 times 6-- had just
,enough space to do that. 4 times 6 is also 24. So these are all of the
,"factors of 24, clearly more than just one and 24. Now let's think about 2. Well, the non-zero whole numbers"
,"that are divisible into 2, well, 1 times 2"
,"definitely works, 1 and 2. But there really"
,aren't any others that are divisible into 2. And so it only has two
,"factors, 1 and itself, and that's the definition"
,of a prime number. So 2 is prime. And 2 is interesting because it
,is the only even prime number. And that might be
,"common sense you. Because by definition, an"
,even number is divisible by 2. So 2 is clearly divisible by 2. That's what makes it even. But it's only
,divisible by 2 and 1. So that's what makes it prime. But anything else
,that's even is going to be divisible by
,"1, itself, and 2. Any other number"
,that is even is going to be divisible by
,"1, itself, and 2. So by definition,"
,it's going to have 1 and itself and something else. So it's going to be composite. So 2 is prime. Every other even number
,"other than 2 is composite. Now, here is an"
,"interesting case. 1-- 1 is only divisible by 1. So it is not prime,"
,"technically, because it only has 1 as a factor. It does not have two factors. 1 is itself. But in order to"
,"be prime, you have to have exactly two factors. 1 has only one factor. In order to be"
,"composite, you have to have more than two factors. You have to have 1, yourself,"
,and some other things. So it's not composite. So 1 is neither
,"prime nor composite. And then finally we get to 17. 17 Is divisible by 1 and 17. It's not divisible by 2,"
,"not divisible by 3, 4, 5, 6. 7, 8, 9 10, 11, 12,"
,"13, 14, 15, or 16. So it has exactly two"
,factors-- 1 and itself. So 17 is once
,again-- 17 is prime.

Df9h5t64NlQ,What we're going
,to do in this video are some real quick tests to see
,if these three random numbers are divisible by any
,of these numbers here. And I'm not going to focus a
,lot on the why of why they're divisible-- we'll do that in
,other videos-- but really just to give you a sense
,of how do you actually test to see if this is
,divisible by 2 or 5 or 9 or 10. So let's get started. So to test whether any of
,"these are divisible by 2, you really just have to"
,look at the ones place and see if the ones
,"place is divisible by 2. And right over here,"
,"8 is divisible by 2, so this thing is going"
,to be divisible by 2. 0 is considered to
,"be divisible by 2, so this is going to"
,be divisible by 2. Another way to think
,about it is if you have an even number
,over here-- and 0 is considered to be
,an even number-- then you're going to
,"be divisible by 2. And over here, you do not have"
,a number that is divisible by 2. This is not an even
,"number, this 5, so this is not divisible by 2. So I won't write any 2 there. So we've gone through the 2s. Now, let's work through the 3s. So to figure out if       "
,"you're divisible by 3, you really just have to"
,add up all the digits and figure out if the
,sum is divisible by 3. So let's do that. So if I do 2 plus 7 plus 9
,"plus 9 plus 5 plus 8 plus 8, what's this going"
,"to be equal to? 2 plus 7 is 9. 9 plus 9 is 18, plus 9 is 27,"
,"plus 5 is 32, plus 8 is 40, plus 8 is 48. And 48 is divisible by 3. But in case you're not sure--"
,so this is equal to 48-- in case you're not sure whether
,"it's divisible by 3, you can just add"
,"these digits up again. So 4 plus 8 is equal to 12, and"
,12 clearly is divisible by 3. And if you're not
,"even sure there, you could add those"
,"two digits up. 1 plus 2 is equal to 3, and"
,"so this is divisible by 3. This right over here,"
,let's add up the digits. And we can do this one in
,our head pretty easily. 5 plus 6 is 11. 11 plus 7 is 18. 18 plus 0 is 18. And if you want to add the 1
,"plus 8 on the 18, you get 9. So the digits add up to 9. So these add up to 9. Well, they add to 18, which"
,"is clearly divisible by 3 and by 9, and these two"
,things will add to 9. So the important
,"thing to know is when you add up all the digits,"
,the sum is divisible by 3. So this is divisible by 3
,"as well, divisible by 3. And then finally, Let's"
,"add up these digits. 1 plus 0 plus 0 plus 7 is 8,"
,"plus 6 is 14, plus 5 is 19. So we summed up the digits. 19 is not divisible by 3. So this one, we're not going"
,to write a 3 right over there. It's not divisible by 3. Let's try 4. And to think about
,"4, you just have to look at the last"
,two digits and to see-- are the last two
,digits divisible? Are the last two
,"digits divisible by 4? Immediately, you can look"
,"at this one right over here, see it's an odd number. If it's not going to"
,"be divisible by 2, it's definitely not going"
,to be divisible by 4. So this one's not divisible by
,"any of the first few numbers right over here. But let's think about one, 88. Is that divisible by 4? And you can do"
,"that in your head. That's 4 times 22. So this is divisible by 4. Now, let's see. 4 goes into 60 15 times. And then to go from 60 to 70,"
,"you have to get another 10, which is not divisible by 4. So that's not divisible by 4. And you can even try to"
,"divide it out yourself. 4 goes into 70,"
,"let's see, one time. You subtract, you get a 30. 4 goes into 30 seven times. You multiply, then you subtract. You get a 2 right over"
,"here as your remainder, so it is not divisible by 4. Now, let's move on to 5. Now, you're probably already"
,very familiar with this. If your final digit is a 5 or
,"a 0, you are divisible by 5. So this one is not"
,"divisible by 5. This one is divisible by 5. You have a 0 there, so"
,"this is divisible by 5. And this, you have a"
,5 as your ones digit. So once again-- finally-- this
,"is divisible by something. It's divisible by 5. Now, the number 6. The simple way to think"
,about divisibility by 6 is that you have to be
,"divisible by both 2 and 3 in order to be divisible by 6,"
,"because the prime factorization of 6 is 2 times 3. So here, we're"
,"divisible by 2 and 3, so we're going to be"
,divisible by-- let me do that in a new
,"color-- so we're going to be divisible by 6. Here, we're"
,"divisible by 2 and 3, so we're going to"
,be divisible by 6. And if you were just divisible
,"by 2 or 3, just one of them, then you wouldn't"
,be able to do this. You have to have
,"both a 2 and a 3, divisibility by both of them. And here, you're divisible"
,"by neither 2 nor 3, so you're not going"
,"to be divisible by 6. Now, let's do the test for 9. The test for 9 is very"
,similar to the test for 3. Sum up all the digits. If that sum is divisible
,"by 9, then you're there. Well, we already summed"
,"up the digits here, 48. 48 actually is not"
,"divisible by 9. If you're not sure, you can"
,add up the digits there. You get 12. 12 is definitely
,not divisible by 9. So this thing right over
,"here is not divisible by 9. And this one over here, if"
,"you added up all the digits, we got 18, which is divisible. It is divisible by 9. And I'm running out of colors. So this one is divisible by 9. All the digits added "
,"up to 18. And this one over here, you"
,"don't even have to add them up, because we already know"
,"it's not divisible by 3. If it's not divisible by 3,"
,it can't be divisible by 9. But if you did
,"add up the digits, you get 19, which is"
,not divisible by 9. So this also is
,"not divisible by 9. And then finally,"
,divisibility by 10. And this is the easiest one
,"of all, because you just have to see if you have"
,a 0 in the ones place. You clearly do not have a
,0 in the ones place here. You do have a 0 in
,"the ones place there, so you are divisible by 10 here. And then finally, you don't"
,"have a 0 in the ones place here, so you're not going"
,to be divisible by 10. Another way you
,"could think about it, you have to be divisible by both"
,"2 and 5 to be divisible by 10. Here, you are divisible"
,"by 5 but not by 2. But obviously,"
,the easiest one is to just see if you have
,a 0 in the ones place.

yJ-T8z2-Zg4,factors for the first time in this short tutorial you will find out what factors are and how to find factors using multiplication factors are whole numbers that you 
,multiply together to get another number so in this example two times five is ten the factors are two and five you will often be given a number and told to list all its factors well you could just think of any numbers that multiply together to give 12 in this example but a better plan is to use the same simple way every time take a look the first thing you do is find the simplest way of multiplying to 12 and you start with 1 so 1 and the number itself are always the first factors you list right the factors down in pairs 1 here and 12 over here we will fill in the space between with other factors as we go along for each factor pair use an arc to show which factors multiply together it helps keep your thinking clear and stops you from accidentally forgetting to write a factor down ok now you try 2 times number to make 12 well 2 times 6 is 12 list the 2 and the 6 and put the arc in then 3 times a number 3 times 4 is 12 list the 3 and the 4 put the arc in 3 & 4 are consecutive numbers so we know we finish because there's no whole number between those two we've just found all the factors of 12 notice that because we worked from the outside in 
,the factors are in order this is the clearest way of showing all the factors of a number and using the arc for each factor pair shows you're thinking we'll do one more example we'll find the factors of 16 start with one and the number itself 1 + 16 use the ark now go to to two times number well 2 times 8 is 16 what about three times a number is three a factor well 3 times 5 is 15 we can't get to 16 3 is not a factor of 16 now 4 times a number 4 times 4 is 16 when a number is multiplied by itself like before times 4 we just put it in the factor listing once without any ark and there are no more factors we found them all when you're listing all the factors of a number remember always start with 1 and the number itself with a good space between then using multiplication try 2 times 3 times 4 times 5 times a number and up and when your numbers meet in the middle you have finished always use the arc to show your thinking and now it's your turn to practice have fun with this and become fantastic at factors created using powtoon

TXDyU5f5WR8,prime and composite numbers prime numbers and composite numbers are natural numbers they're factors are natural numbers to natural numbers just means the counting numbers 1 2 3 4 5 and so on no negative numbers and no fractions all whole numbers greater than 1 can be classified as either prime numbers or composite numbers let's 
,start by finding out what a prime number is we say that a prime number has only two factors 1 and itself and we can also say that a prime number can be evenly divided by only two numbers 1 and itself so we know that the only way to multiply up to a prime number is to say 1 times the number itself let's take an example the number 3 is it a prime number to find out I say to myself what numbers can be multiplied together to give me 3 well I can say 1 3 is 3 or 3 ones or 3 there is no other way to multiply up to 3 using natural numbers if you prefer you can use division 3 divided by 1 is 3 or 3 divided by 3 is 1 I cannot use any other number to divide up 3 I can't use 2 because I get a remainder 1 left over you can see the only factors of 3 are 1 & 3 itself this makes three a prime number you can use multiplication or division to help you find prime numbers it's up to you which you choose but always write down your math thinking like I did your teacher is going to give you some numbers and tell you to decide whether each one is a prime number or a composite number so first let's try an example together eight say to yourself what numbers can 
,be multiplied together to give me eight we know one eight is eight but can we do it without using the factors 1 or 8 we can use two two fours or eight the factors of eight are two and four as well as one and eight itself eight has more than two factors so eight cannot be a prime number if it isn't a prime number what is it have 
,you worked it out already this program is about prime numbers and composite numbers if a whole number greater than one is not prime then it must be composite let's give it a definition a composite number has more than two factors like we just saw with our example of eight I think you've got this my last example is a very special number to the first even number is it prime or composite say to yourself what numbers can be multiplied together to give me two one two is two or two ones or two there is no other way to multiply up two two two has two factors one and two itself so that means two is a prime number the cool fact I want you to get about two is that 2 is the only even prime number every even number can be divided by two so anytime you are given an even number you can always say that two is going to be one of 
,the factors and that means every even number higher than two is always a composite number remember a prime number has exactly two factors one and the number itself and a composite number has more than two factors now it's your turn to practice with prime and composite numbers remember to prove your answer by showing your math thinking just like I did have fun exploring prime and composite numbers
,
tW97UU01ShY,prime factorization factor trees before we get into prime factorization there are two key ideas to review first that factors are the numbers you multiply together to get another number as the product second a prime number has exactly two factors 1 and itself and since you've worked with prime numbers before you should remember that the first few prime numbers are 2 3 5 7 11 and 13 mathematicians call prime numbers the building blocks of all positive whole numbers because every whole number 
,greater than 1 is either a prime number or a composite number the word composite means made up of various parts each composite number is made up of a single set of prime factors in other words you can get to every composite number by multiplying a single set of prime numbers together we call these the prime factors of a number I'll show you how this idea stacks up for the numbers up to 15 prime numbers in red and composite numbers in blue 2 is prime 3 is prime for comes from 2 times 2 5 is 
,prime we get 6 from 2 times 3 7 is prime 8 comes from 2 times 2 times 2 9 is from 3 times 3 we get 10 from 2 times 5 11 is prime 12 is from 2 times 2 times 3 13 is prime 14 is from 2 times 7 and we get 15 from 3 times 5 prime factorization means finding that single set of prime numbers that multiply up to a given composite number to do a prime factorization we can use a factor tree to help us split each composite number apart into its prime factors let's do an example 18 we split 18 into factors until we can't split any more I am using red for prime numbers and blue for composite numbers I say to myself 18 comes from 2 times 9 I circled 2 as a prime number I will come back to it later 9 is a composite number so I split it down I get 9 from 3 times 3 3 is a prime number so I circle both of them - I have no composite numbers left so now I know I have found all the prime factors next to the factor tree I restate the prime factors 2 times 3 times 3 is 18 it's correct but it's not quite finished to do a really great job on prime factorization we show a factor that is repeated by using exponents we call it using exponential notation it sounds 
,fancy but it's easy enough check it out how many 3's have I got - so I say 2 times 3 to the power 2 because 3 is used twice is 18 it makes the final answer very tidy notice that I listed the prime factors from smallest to largest that is the standard way of listing prime factors and you should do that too here's something cool it doesn't matter how you split your composite numbers down you always come out with the same prime factors I could have done it differently and said 18 is from three times six six is from two times three I still get the same prime factors of 2 times 3 times 3 or 2 times 3 to the power 2 different way of getting there but it's still the same result one more example and then it's your turn we will do the prime factorization of 48 I know that 4 times 12 is 48 this time I have 2 composite numbers to work on the 4 and the 12 4 comes from 2 times 2 2 is prime so I Circle them both and move on to the 12 12 comes from 2 times 6 and 6 is from 2 times 3 I circle all the primes no more composite numbers are left so I'm ready next we collect all the primes we circled 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 3 is 48 and for a great final answer we use our exponential notation to tidy up those repeated factors to came up 4 times so we say 2 to the power 4 times 3 is 48 and that's all you need to do now it's over to you have fun with prime factorization you

NtkjbVb3Zv8,GCF is the partner to l see em you have learned how to find the lowest common multiple now we learn how to find the greatest common factor if you've practiced LCM and have used prime factorization to find it then you are ready for GCF which is also known as H CF or highest common factor what is GCF the greatest common factor is 
,the largest value that divides exactly into two or more numbers let's explore it using a problem like you'll see in school we'll find the LCM and the GCF of 36 and 44 first we do the LCM you know what to do get the prime factors 36 is from 3 times 12 12 is from 3 times 4 4 is from 2 times 2 then lists the prime factors in a table 2 times 2 times 3 times 3 clear the area 44 is from 4 times 11 4 is from 2 times to put those prime factors into the table aligning like factors 2 times 2 times 11 now get the factors of our mystery LCM 2 times 2 times 3 times 3 times 11 work it out 2 times 2 is 4 times 3 is 12 times 3 is 36 times 11 well 10 36s are 360 and add another 36 on that makes 11 36 s is 396 that's our LCM now let's do the greatest common factor if a prime factor is common to both the numbers listed then it is used in our greatest common factor 2 is in both lists of prime factors here and here three is not common nor is eleven list the common factors two and two then we multiply the common prime factors to get the GCF so two times two the GCF is four isn't that easy I think it's beautifully simple and it's really fast after doing the LCM if you use the prime factors Table two to help organize yourself as you're working through you're going to find it very clear and you'll be least likely to make a 
,mistake there's one last point you need to be aware of before you have a go at GCF for yourself at some point your teacher is going to give you a pair of numbers bit like this where when you do the prime factorization you find that there are no prime factors that are common to the two numbers so how do we list the GCF if there are no factors common to the two numbers then the GCF the greatest common factor is one why because every number always has one as a factor and now you are good to go on GCF check the links here to look at my videos on LC and if you want to refresher you you

XWq8bplP-_E,"We're asked, what is the"
,prime factorization of 36? Let me get my little
,scratch paper out. So the prime
,factorization of 36. So let's start with the
,"smallest prime number we know, and that is 2. And think about,"
,"does 2 go into 36? Well, sure, it does. 36 is 2 times 18. So we can write that down. 36 is 2 times 18. So now we have 36 as a"
,"product of a prime number, and 18 is clearly"
,a composite number. It has factors
,other than 1 and 18. So let's try to
,factor this further. So is this divisible by 2? Sure. 18 is 2 times 9. So now 9 is a composite number
,"that we haven't fully factored. Obviously, the 2's"
,"are both prime. 9 is not divisible by 2,"
,but it is divisible by 3. 9 is 3 times 3. So we can say that 36 is equal
,to 2 times 2 times 3 times 3. This is its prime factorization. All of these numbers are prime. So now let's input that to
,make sure we got it right. 2 times 2 times 3 times 3. And you can check yourself. If you have the product of
,numbers that are all prime and the product actually is
,"36, you have successfully prime factorized the number. Let's do a couple more of these. What is the prime"
,factorization of 30? So I'll get my scratch
,"paper out again. So we'll do the same process. So 30-- well, it's"
,divisible by 2. So we can write
,that as 2 times 15. 15 isn't divisible by 2. But it is divisible by 3. It's the same
,thing as 3 times 5. And both 3 and 5
,are prime numbers. They are only divisible
,by 1 and themselves. So the prime factorization
,of 30 is 2 times 3 times 5. Let's enter that in. So it is 2 times 3 times 5. Let's do one more of these. What is the prime
,"factorization of 73? Now, 73 is interesting. I'll get my scratch"
,"paper out for this. We could try to factor 73. So you might try 2. Well, this is clearly"
,an odd number. So 2 isn't going to
,"be divisible into 73. You might try 3. You would immediately see,"
,"well, 3 is divisible into 72. If you divide into 73,"
,"you have a remainder of 1. Well, 4 isn't a prime number,"
,"so we wouldn't even try. 5 isn't divisible into 73. It doesn't end in a 5 or 0. 7 is not divisible into 73. 7 goes into 70, so you'd"
,have a remainder of 3. 11 isn't divisible into 73. It's divisible into
,"66 or 77, so not 73. As I test more and"
,"more numbers, it doesn't look like there's"
,any easy thing that divides into 73. So I'm willing to go with
,73 itself is a prime number. So this is its
,"prime factorization. It's just 73. So let's write that down. So the answer here,"
,let's just write 73. And you don't want
,"to write 1 times 73, because 1 is not a prime number. Remember, 1 only has"
,"one factor, itself. A prime number has two"
,"factors, 1 and itself. Two different prime"
,factors-- 1 and itself. And itself is not one. So we just want to write
,prime numbers here. 73 is a prime number. Let's check our answer. And we got it right
,
1Vb8t7Y-pI0,William and Luis are in
,different physics classes at Santa Rita. Luis's teacher always gives
,"exams with 30 questions on them, while William's"
,teacher gives more frequent exams with
,only 24 questions. Luis's teacher also assigns
,three projects per year. Even though the two classes
,"have to take a different number of exams, their"
,teachers have told them that both classes-- let me
,underline-- both classes will get the same total number
,of exam questions each year. What is the minimum
,number of exam questions William's or Luis's class can
,expect to get in a given year? So let's think about
,what's happening. So if we think about
,"Luis's teacher who gives 30 questions per test,"
,"so after the first test, he would have done 30 questions. So this is 0 right over here. Then after the second test,"
,"he would have done 60. Then after the third test,"
,"he would have done 90. And after the fourth test,"
,"he would have done 120. And after the fifth test,"
,"if there is a fifth test, he would do-- so this is if"
,they have that many tests-- he would get to 150
,total questions. And we could keep
,going on and on looking at all the multiples of 30. So this is probably a hint
,of what we're thinking about. We're looking at
,multiples of the numbers. We want the minimum multiples
,or the least multiple. So that's with Luis. Well what's going
,"on with William? Will William's teacher,"
,"after the first test, they're going to"
,get to 24 questions. Then they're going to get
,to 48 after the second test. Then they're going to get
,to 72 after the third test. Then they're going to get to 96. I'm just taking multiples of 24. They're going to get to
,"96 after the fourth test. And then after the fifth test,"
,"they're going to get to 120. And if there's a sixth test,"
,then they would get to 144. And we could keep going
,on and on in there. But let's see what
,they're asking us. What is the minimum
,number of exam questions William's or Luis's class
,can expect to get in a year? Well the minimum
,number is the point at which they've gotten the
,"same number of exam questions, despite the fact"
,that the tests had a different number of items. And you see the point at which
,they have the same number is at 120. This happens at 120. They both could have
,exactly 120 questions even though Luis's teacher
,is giving 30 at a time and even though William's
,"teacher is giving 24 at a time. And so the answer is 120. And notice, they had a"
,"different number of exams. Luis had one, two,"
,"three, four exams while William would have to"
,"have one, two, three, four, five exams. But that gets them both"
,to 120 total questions. Now thinking of it in terms
,of some of the math notation or the least common multiple
,"notation we've seen before, this is really asking us what is"
,the least common multiple of 30 and 24. And that least common
,multiple is equal to 120. Now there's other
,ways that you can find the least common multiple
,other than just looking at the multiples like this. You could look at it
,"through prime factorization. 30 is 2 times 15,"
,which is 3 times 5. So we could say that 30 is
,equal to 2 times 3 times 5. And 24-- that's a different
,color than that blue-- 24 is equal to 2 times 12. 12 is equal to 2 times 6. 6 is equal to 2 times 3. So 24 is equal to 2
,times 2 times 2 times 3. So another way to come up with
,"the least common multiple, if we didn't even do this"
,"exercise up here, says, look, the number has to be"
,divisible by both 30 and 24. If it's going to
,"be divisible by 30, it's going to have to"
,have 2 times 3 times 5 in its prime factorization. That is essentially 30. So this makes it
,"divisible by 30. And say, well in order"
,"to be divisible by 24, its prime factorization is"
,"going to need 3 twos and a 3. Well we already have 1 three. And we already have 1 two,"
,so we just need 2 more twos. So 2 times 2. So this makes it--
,let me scroll up a little bit-- this right over
,here makes it divisible by 24. And so this is essentially
,the prime factorization of the least common
,multiple of 30 and 24. You take any one of
,"these numbers away, you are no longer going to be"
,"divisible by one of these two numbers. If you take a two away, you're"
,not going to be divisible by 24 anymore. If you take a two
,or a three away. If you take a three
,"or a five away, you're not going to be"
,divisible by 30 anymore. And so if you were to
,"multiply all these out, this is 2 times 2 times 2 is 8"
,times 3 is 24 times 5 is 120. Now let's do one more of these. Umama just bought one
,package of 21 binders. Let me write that number down. 21 binders. She also bought a
,package of 30 pencils. She wants to use all of
,the binders and pencils to create identical
,sets of office supplies for her classmates. What is the greatest
,number of identical sets Umama can make using
,all the supplies? So the fact that we're
,talking about greatest is clue that it's probably
,going to be dealing with greatest common divisors. And it's also dealing with
,dividing these things. We want to divide these
,both into the greatest number of identical sets. So there's a couple of ways
,we could think about it. Let's think about what the
,greatest common divisor of both these numbers are. Or I could even say the
,greatest common factor. The greatest common
,divisor of 21 and 30. So what's the largest number
,that divides into both of them? So we could go with
,the prime factor. We could list all of
,their normal factors and see what is the
,greatest common one. Or we could look at the
,prime factorization. So let's just do the prime
,factorization method. So 21 is the same
,"thing as 3 times 7. These are both prime numbers. 30 is, let's see,"
,"it's 3-- actually, I could write it this"
,way-- it is 2 times 15. We already did it
,actually just now. And 15 is 3 times 5. So what's the largest
,number of prime numbers that are common to both
,factorizations? Well you only have a
,three right over here. Then you don't have a
,three times anything else. So this is just going
,to be equal to 3. So this is essentially
,"telling us, look, we can divide both"
,of these numbers into 3 and that will give
,us the largest number of identical sets. So just to be clear
,of what we're doing. So we've answered
,"the question is 3, but just to visualize"
,"it for this question, let's actually draw 21 binders. So let's say the 21 binders so"
,"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,"
,"16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. And then 30 pencils, so"
,"I'll just do those in green. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,"
,"6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Let me just copy and paste that. This is getting tedious. So copy and paste. So that's 20 and then"
,"paste that is 30. Now, we figured out that 3"
,is the largest number that divides into both
,of these evenly. So I can divide both of
,"these into groups of 3. So for the binders, I could"
,do it into three groups of 7. And then for the
,"pencils, I could do it into three groups of 10. So if there are"
,three people that are coming into
,"this classroom, I could give them each seven"
,binders and 10 pencils. But that's the greatest
,number of identical sets Umama can make. I would have three sets. Each set would have seven
,binders and 10 pencils. And we essentially
,are just thinking about what's the number that we
,"can divide both of these sets into evenly, the"
,largest number that we can divide both of
,these sets into evenly.

1qPfLkOEuYY,welcome to math with mr j in this video i'm going to cover multiples verse factors so the difference between multiples and factors and we have two examples that we're going to go through together in order to get this down so let's jump right into number one here where we have eight and we'll start with multiples so we need to list some multiples of eight now multiples are the result of multiplying the given number by integers so no fractions or decimals and we can think of this as skip counting let's make sense of that by writing out some examples here so the multiples of eight we can start with eight eight times one equals eight so we multiplied eight by the integer of one now we can multiply by the integer of two so eight times two is sixteen then three eight times three is twenty-four and you can see how this is turning into just counting by eights or skip counting eight times four is thirty-two eight times five is forty and so on and so forth so those multiples will continue on forever so it's all the numbers that 8 will hit if we count up by 8. or think of it as we multiplied 8 by integers starting with 1 and then going 2 3 4 5 6 7 
,8 and again it goes on forever now multiples can be positive and go up in value or multiples can decrease in value there are negative multiples but we are only going to be working with positives in this video so let's move on to factors and factors are all of the numbers that the given number can be divided by evenly so no remainders or you can think of factors as the numbers that can be multiplied in order to get that given number factors are numbers that are multiplied to get a product i 
,like to think of factors as all the numbers that can go into a given number that's not the most mathematical or technical way of thinking about it but it can help with determining the difference between multiples and factors so let's find all the factors of eight and when we find factors i like to start with two numbers for two 
,factors for every number and those factors are one and then the number itself so one and eight i can do eight divided by one and get a um that will divide evenly i will not get a remainder and i can do eight divided by eight or you can think of it as one times eight equals eight so all the math facts all the multiplication facts that will equal eight and we can think of this as a factor pair here so we'll start with 1 and 8 and for some numbers those are the only factors 1 and the number itself those numbers are called prime numbers but 8 is composite so it has other factors involved here so what other numbers can go into eight you can think of it as or a multiplication fact to equal that given number of eight well i could do eight divided by two right 2 can go into 8 so that's my next factor and i know 2's partner is 4 because 8 divided by 2 equals 4. or i could do 8 divided by 4 equals 2 or think of it as 2 times 4 equals 8. so different ways of thinking about factors but it's all the numbers that can divide evenly aka no remainders as far as 8 goes now when i wrote my factors list i put 1 and 8 and then i put a big gap in the middle there that way i could fit any other factors that would be between 1 and 8 and they would all go in order you'll get better with spacing the more you do of those let's go to number two and write out the multiples of 15. so we'll start with 15 times 1 or just start with 15 and skip count however you like to think about this 15 times 2 30 3 is 45 4 is 60 5 is 75 and again those do continue on forever but we'll cut it off right there as far as factors remember we start with 1 and the number itself because 1 can go into 15 and then 15 can go into 15. i like to leave a little gap there that way if there are any other factors i can list them in between 1 and 
,15 and they're all in order so think about 15 what other numbers go into 15 or can multiply to get 15 well i know 15 divided by 3 and 3's partner is 5 right because 
,let me start with this 1 and 15 are partners and then 3 and 5 are factor pairs or partners and those are all the factors of 15. so there you have it there's the difference between multiples and factors i hope that helped thanks so much for watching until next time peace

HpdMJaKaXXc,Let's try to learn a thing
,or two about ratios. So ratios are just expressions
,that compare quantities. So that might just be a fancy
,way-- let me just --of saying something that you may
,or may not understand. So let me give you
,actual examples. If I have 10 horses
,and I have 5 dogs. And someone were to come to
,"me and say Sal, what is the ratio is of horses to dogs? So I want to know how many"
,horses do I have for some number of dogs. So I could say I have 10
,horses for every 5 dogs. So I could say the ratio of
,horses to dogs is 10:5. Or I could also write
,that as a fraction. I could say the ratio of
,horses to dogs is 10/5. Or I could just write it out. I could say it is 10 to 5. These all are saying
,"the same thing. And the thing I write first,"
,"or the thing that I write on top, is the number of horses. So this is the number"
,of horses right there. That's the number of horses. And that's all the
,number of horses. If I wanted to talk about the
,"number of dogs, this is the number of dogs, that's the"
,"number of dogs, or that's the number of dogs. I'm just-- These are all"
,"just expressions that are comparing two quantities. Now, I just said I have 10"
,horses for every 5 dogs. But what does that mean? That means I have 5
,horses for every 1 dog. Sorry. Not 5 horses for every 1 dog. It means I have 2 horses
,"for every 1 dog, right? If for 5 dogs I have 10, that"
,"means that for every 1 of these dogs, there are 2 horses. For every one of-- every 2 of"
,"these horses, there's 1 dog. I just kind of reasoned"
,through that. So this is-- I have 2
,horses for every 1 dog. But how do you get there? How do you get
,from 10:5 to 2:1? Well you can think of what's
,the biggest number that divides into both of these numbers? What's their greatest
,common divisor? I have a whole video on that. The biggest number that divides
,into both of these guys is 5. So you divide both of them by 5
,"and you can kind of get this ratio into a reduced form. And if I write it here, it"
,would be the same thing as 2/1 or 2 to 1. And so what's interesting about
,"ratios, it isn't literally, or doesn't always have to be"
,"literally, the number of horses and the numbers of"
,dogs you have. What a ratio tells you
,is how many horses do I have for every dog. Or how many dogs do I
,"have for every horse. Now, just to make things clear,"
,what if someone asked me what is the ratio of dogs to horses? So what's the difference
,"in these two statements? Here I said horses to dogs. Here I'm saying dogs to horses. So, since I've switched the"
,ratio-- What I'm looking for-- I'm looking for the ratio
,"of dogs to horses, I switch the numbers. So dogs-- For every 5"
,"dogs, I have 10 horses. Or if I divide both of"
,"these by 5, for every 1 dog, I have 5 horses. So the ratio of dogs to"
,horses is 5:10 or 1:5. Or you could write it this way. 1 to-- I can write it-- Let
,me write it down here. 1/5. Or I could write 1 to 5. And the general convention--
,This wouldn't be necessarily incorrect. That's not wrong. But the general convention is
,"to get your ratio or your fraction, if you want to call"
,"it that, into the simplest form or into this reduced"
,form right there. Let's just do a couple
,of other examples. Let's say I have 20 apples. Let's say I have 40 oranges. And let's say that I
,have 60 strawberries. Now what is the ratio of apples
,to oranges to strawberries? I could write it like this. I could write what is the ratio
,of-- I'll write it like this --apples:oranges:strawberries? Well I can start off by
,"literally saying, well for 60 strawberries-- for every 60"
,"strawberries, I have 40 oranges and I have 20 apples. And this would be legitimate. You could say the ratio"
,"of apples to oranges to strawberries are 20:40-- Sorry. 20:40:60. And that wouldn't be wrong. But we saw before, we could"
,put into reduced form. So we think of what's the
,largest number that divides into all three of these? We can't just do it into two of
,these now because now my ratio has three actual quantities. Well the largest number
,"that divides into all of these guys is 20. If we divide all of them by 20,"
,"we can then say for every 1 apple, I now have-- you divide"
,"this guy by 20 --I have 2 oranges, and I have"
,3 strawberries. So the ratio of
,"apples to oranges to strawberries is 1:2:3. And I got that, in every"
,"case, by just dividing these guys all by 20. I divided by 20. I think you get"
,the general idea. If someone were to ask you
,what's the ratio of-- Let me just write it down because it
,never hurts to have a little bit more clarification. If someone wanted to know
,the ratio of strawberries to oranges-- Let me get
,into my orange color. Strawberries to
,oranges to apples. I thought I was going
,"to do that in yellow. To apples. What is this ratio going to be? Well for every 3 strawberries,"
,I have 2 oranges and I have 1 apple. So then it would be 3:2:1. The general idea is whatever
,"order someone asks you for the different items, you put-- the"
,"ratio is going to be in that same exact order. Now, in all of the examples so"
,far I gave you the number of quantity-- the quantity of
,things we had and I-- we figured out the ratio. What if it went the other way? What if I told you a ratio? What if I said the ratio of
,boys to girls in a classroom is-- Let's say the ratio
,of boys to girls is 2/3. Which I could've also written
,"as 2:3 just like that. So for every 2 boys, I have"
,"3 girls or for every 3 girls, I have 2 boys. And let's say that there are"
,40 students in the classroom. And then someone were to ask
,you how many girls are there? How many girls are
,in the classroom? So this seems a little
,bit more convoluted than what we did before. We know the total number of
,students and we know the ratio. But how many girls
,are in the room? So let's think
,about it this way. The fact that the ratio
,of boys to girls-- I'll write it like this. Boys-- Maybe I'll be
,stereotypical with the colors. The ratio of boys to
,"girls is equal to 2:3. Hate to be so stereotypical,"
,but it doesn't hurt. 2:3. The ratio of boys
,to girls is 2:3. So this stands for every
,"3 girls, there's 2 boys. For every 2 boys,"
,there's 3 girls. But what does it also say? It also says for every 5
,"students, there are what? There are 2 boys and 3 girls. Now why is this"
,statement helpful? Well how many groups of
,5 students do I have? I have 40 students in my
,"class right there, right? I have 40 students in my class. And for every 5 students,"
,there are 2 boys and 3 girls. So how many groups of
,5 students do I have? So I have a total
,of 40 students. Let me do it in
,this purple color. I have 40 students and then
,there are 5 students per group. And I figured out that group
,"just by looking at the ratio. For every 5 students, I"
,have 2 boys and 3 girls. How many groups of 5
,students do I have? So that means that I have 8
,groups-- 40 divided by 5 --I have 8 groups of 5 students. Now we're wondering how
,many girls there are. So each group is going
,"to have 3 girls. So how many girls do I have? I have 8 groups, each"
,of them have 3 girls. So I have 8 groups times 3
,girls per group is equal to 24 girls in the classroom. And you could do the same
,exercise with boys. How many boys are there? There's a couple of
,ways you could do it. You could say for every
,"group, there are 2 boys. There's 8 groups. There's 16 boys. Or you could say"
,there's 40 students. 24 of them are girls. 40 minus 24 is 16. So either way you
,get to 16 boys. And if you want to pick
,"up a fast way to do it. It would be identical. You'd say look, 2 plus 3 is 5. For every 5 students,"
,"2 boys, 3 girls. How many groups are there? You say 40 divided by 5"
,is equal to 8 groups. Every group has 3 girls. So you do 8 times 3 is
,equal to 24 girls. Let's do one that's a little
,bit harder than that. Let's do one where I say that
,the ratio of let's say-- Well let's go back
,to the farm example. The ratio of sheep--
,I'll do sheep in white. The ratio of sheep to--
,I don't know --chickens to-- I don't know. What's another farm animal? --to pigs. The ratio of sheep to chicken
,to pigs-- Maybe I should just say chicken right there. The ratio of sheep to chicken
,to pigs-- Or chickens. I should say chickens. Is-- Let's say the
,"ratio is 2:5:10. And notice, I can't"
,reduce this anymore. There's no number that
,divides into all of these. So this is the ratio if
,sheep to chickens to pigs. And let's say that I have
,a total of 51 animals. And I want to know how
,"many chickens do I have. Well we do the same idea. For every 2 sheep, I have 5"
,chickens and I have 10 pigs. That tells me for every 17
,"animals-- So every group of 17 animals, what do I have? And where did I get 17 from? I just added 2 plus 5 plus 10. For every 17 animals,"
,"I'm going to have-- Let me pick a new color. I'm going to have 2 sheep,"
,"5 chickens, and 10 pigs. Now, how many groups of"
,17 animals do I have? I have a total of 51 animals. So if there's 17 animals per
,"group, 51 animals divided by 17 animals per group. I have 3 groups of 17 animals. Now I want to know"
,how many chickens. Every group has 5 chickens. We already know that. And I have 3 groups. So I have 3 groups. Every group has 5 chickens. So I'm going to have 3     
,"times 5 chickens, which is equal to 15 chickens. Not too bad. All I did is add these up and"
,"say for every 17 animals, I've got 5 chickens. I've got 3 groups of 17. So for each of those"
,"groups, I have 5 chickens. 3 times 5 is 15 chicken. You could use the same process"
,to figure out the number sheep or pigs you might have.

rUrLuTMq-sw,what are the multiples of a number say we have a number seven what are its multiples how many multiples does it have seven x one is seven this seven is one of the multiples of seven seven x two is 14 14 is another multiple of seven the word says it all a multiple if a number is multiplied with seven we get sevens multiple and seven x 3 is 21 and the list would continue forever the multiples of seven are 7 14 21 28 and so on this proves that the list of multiples of a number is infinite for 
,us the number of factors of a number is always finite concept of multiples gives us a very important result let us find the multiples of 2 2 times 1 is 2 2 times 2 is 4 2 times 3 is 6 and the multiples of 2 continue what's special about the multiples of 2 all the multiples of 2 are called even numbers yes all the multiples of 2 
,are even and what about the numbers which are not multiples of 2 the numbers which are not multiples of 2 are called odd numbers so the numbers 1 3 7 9 and so on are odd numbers this concept of even and odd numbers is very important no matter which grade you are in multiples of 2 even non multiples of 2 odd and now we come to a 
,very interesting question how our factors and multiples related let's understand the relation with the help of a random number sit 12 to find the factors of 12 we try writing it as all possible products of two numbers 12 can be written as 1 multiplied by 12 it can be written as 2 multiplied by 6 and 3 x 4 these are the only possible combinations each of these numbers are factors of 12 the factors of 12 are 1 2 3 4 6 and 12 now observe the number 12 in relation with these numbers 1 multiplied by 12 gives us 12 so 12 is a multiple of 1 2 multiplied by 6 gives us 12 so 12 is also multiple of 2 3 times 4 gives us 12 and so on what does this imply the number 12 is a multiple of all its factors yes this is always true a number is always a multiple of all its factors you

2G_Jr_XpnY4,Determine whether 380 is
,"divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9 or 10. They skipped 7 and 8"
,"so we don't have to worry about those. So let's think about 2. So are we divisible by 2? Let me write the 2 here. Well, in order for something to"
,"be divisible by 2, it has to be an even number, and to be"
,"an even number, your ones digit-- so let me rewrite 380. To be even, your ones digit"
,"has to be even, so this has to be even. And for this to be even, it has"
,"to be 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8, and this is 0, so 380 is even, which"
,"means it is divisible by 2, so it works with 2. So 2 works out. Let's think about the"
,"situation for 3. Now, a quick way to think about"
,3-- so let me write just 3 question mark-- is to add
,the digits of your number. And if the sum that you get is
,"divisible by 3, then you are divisible by 3. So let's try to do that. So 380, let's add the digits. 3 plus 8 plus 0 is equal to--"
,"3 plus 8 is 11 plus 0, so it's just 11. And if you have trouble figuring"
,"out whether this is divisible by 3, you could then"
,"just add these two numbers again, so you can actually add"
,"the 1 plus 1 again, and you would get a 2. Regardless of whether you look"
,"at the 1 or the 2, neither of these are divisible by 3. So not divisible by 3, and maybe"
,"in a future video, I'll explain why this works, and"
,maybe you want to think about why this works. So these aren't divisible by
,"3, so 380 is not divisible. 380, not divisible by 3,"
,"so 3 does not work. We are not divisible by 3. Now, I'll think about the"
,"situation for 4, so we're thinking about 4 divisibility. So let me write it in orange. So we are wondering about 4. Now, something you may or may"
,"not already realize is that 100 is divisible by 4. It goes evenly. So this is 380. So the 300 is divisible by 4, so"
,"we just have to figure out whether the leftover, whether"
,"the 80, is divisible by 4. Another way to think about it"
,is are the last two digits divisible by 4? And this comes from the fact
,"that 100 is divisible by 4, so everything, the hundreds place"
,"or above, it's going to be divisible by 4. You just have to worry"
,"about the last part. So in this situation, is"
,"80 divisible by 4? Now, you could eyeball that. You could say, well, 8 is"
,"definitely divisible by 4. 8 divided by 4 is 2. 80 divided by 4 is 20,"
,so this works. Yes! Yes! So since 80 is divisible
,"by 4, 380 is also divisible by 4, so 4 works. So let's do 5. I'll actually scroll"
,down a little bit. Let's try 5. So what's the pattern when
,"something is divisible by 5? Let's do the multiple of 5? 5, 10, 15, 20, 25. So if something's divisible by"
,5-- I could keep going-- that means it ends with either
,"a 5 or a 0, right? Every multiple of 5 either has"
,a 5 or a 0 in the ones place. Now 380 has a 0 in the
,"ones place, so it is divisible by 5. Now, let's think about"
,the situation for 6. Let's think about what
,happens with 6. So we want to know are
,"we divisible by 6? So to be divisible by 6, you"
,"have to be divisible by the things that make up 6. Remember, 6 is equal"
,"to 2 times 3. So if you're divisible by 6,"
,that means you are divisible by 2 and you are
,divisible by 3. If you're divisible by both
,"2 and 3, you'll be divisible by 6. Now, 380 is divisible by 2, but"
,"we've already established that it is not divisible by 3. If it's not divisible by 3, it"
,"cannot be divisible by 6, so this gets knocked out. We are not divisible by 6. Now, let's go to 9. So divisibility by 9. So you can make a similar"
,argument here that if something is not divisible by
,"3, there's no way it's going to be divisible by 9 because"
,"9 is equal to 3 times 3. So to be divisible by 9, you"
,have to be divisible by 3 at least twice. At least two 3's have to go
,"into your number, and this isn't the case, so you could"
,already knock 9 out. But if we didn't already know
,"that we're not divisible by 3, the other way to do it is a very"
,similar way to figure out divisibility by 3. We can add the digits. So you add 3 plus 8 plus
,"0, and you get 11. And you say is this"
,divisible by 9? And you say this is not
,"divisible by 9, so 380 must not be divisible by 9. And for 3, you do the same"
,"thing, but you test whether the sum is divisible by 3. For 9, you test whether"
,"it's divisible by 9. So lastly, we have"
,"the number 10. We have the number 10, and"
,this is on some level the easiest one. What do all the multiples
,"of 10 look like? 10, 20, 30, 40, we could just"
,"keep going on and on. They all end with zero. Or if something ends with zero,"
,"it is divisible by 10. 380 does end with zero, or its"
,"ones place does have a zero on it, so it is divisible by 10. So we're divisible by all"
,"of these numbers except for 3, 6 and 9."

0IZyGB1qQmM,today let us revise factors and multiples let us start with factors what do we mean by a factor a factor of a number divides that number exactly let us look at an example find the factors of 58 the first pair is 1 into 50 8 is equal to 58 here when we divide 58 by 1 we get the quotient as 58 and when we divide 58 by 58 we get the quotient as 1 in both the cases the remainder is 0 thus it means that 58 is divisible by 1 and 58 the second pair of numbers which gives the product 58 is 2 into 29 thus the factors of 58 are 1 to 29 and 58 let us solve one more example find the factors of 81 the pairs of numbers which give the product a t1r1 into 81 is equal 
,to 81 3 into 27 is equal to 81 9 into 9 is equal to 81 thus the factors of 81 are 1 3 9 27 and 81 as each of these number divides 81 exactly did you notice we counted the repeated factor only once remember every number has 1 as a factor every number is a factor of itself thus every number except one has at least two factors one 
,and the number itself the factor of a number is always equal to or less than the number now let us look at multiples a multiple of a number is the product obtained when the number is multiplied by the same or any other number let us find the multiples of 12 it is easy when we multiply 12 by zero one two three four five six seven eight nine ten and so on we get 0 12 24 36 48 60 70 to 80 for 96 108 120 and so on as the products so here the products obtained are nothing else but the multiples 
,of 12 let us look at another example find the multiples of 19 when we multiply 19 by 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and so on we get 0 1938 5770 695 114 133 152 171 190 and 
,so on thus the multiples of 19 are 0 1938 5770 695 114 133 152 171 190 and so on remember a number is a multiple of itself every number is a multiple of one every multiple of a given number is equal to or greater than the number itself every number has an infinite number of multiples zero is a multiple of every number but zero is not a factor of any number except zero revising factors and multiples was fun you

HL2v6rF4zhU,hello children today i'm here to teach you chapter 4 part 1 and 2 in your syllabus factors and multiples so we'll see what are factors and multiples and any integer 
,how you can find out whether it is divisible by 2 3 4 like that so we'll find out more about factors and multiples at this number 274 how can we find out whether the number is divisible by 2 you already know that if it's an even number it's divisible by 2. so we'll look at 274 is an even number divide by 2 2 times 1 2 times 3 6 
,1 remaining and then 7. so it's divisible take this number 358 we know that last digit is an even number so that means this whole thing is even number 2 times 1 2 for 15 that's 7 for 18 that's 9. divide this by 2 2 1 3 divide this by 2 510 2 times 2 4 1 remaining 5 10 1 remaining and 5. so 255 divide this by 2 1 and for 12 that's 6 and 1. so all these are even numbers so we know that it's divisible by 2. all above numbers are divided by 2 without a remainder without a remainder look at the 
,last digit of each above numbers what can you say you you get 0. 6 4 8 2 2 4 6 8 or either 0 or even numbers when the last digit of any large number is either 0 or an even number it can be divided by 2 without a remainder so remember how we identify whether the number is divisible by 2 look at the last digit last digit should be either 0 or any one number look at these numbers if it's divisible by 2 you can put a tick mark and if it's not you can put a cross you have to look at the last digit 4 so it's divisible by 2 9 not divisible 0 yes it is divisible 8 even number yes it's divisible 3 no that's not an even number it's not divisible by 2. look at this one 4 yes it is divisible 6 again it is divisible one not divisible zero yes it's divisible and seven it's not divisible find whether the following numbers are divisible by 5 now so we'll take these numbers and divide by 5. 5 times 7 35 for 25 that's 5. so it's divisible 5 times 840 for 20 that's 4 that's also divisible look 
,at this one 5 times 1 and 3 remaining 34 that's 6 45 that's 9 that's also divisible 5 times 1 5 1 remaining 5 times 3 15 and for 20 that's 4. so all these numbers are divisible by 5. so how we identify look at the last digit of the above numbers they are either 5 or zero five zero here five zero they can be divisible by five without a remainder so how we identify whether the number is divisible by five last digit should be zero or five now put tick mark for numbers divisible by five without a remainder and cross mark for numbers not divisible by 5 in the cage in front of each given number so what we do you we look at the last digit 5 so it's divisible 
,by 5 0 yes it is divisible eight no because only zero and five for the last digit the number is divisible by five eight no seven no zero years five years and this one also correct so you have to only look at the last digit look at this one find out whether the following numbers are divisible by 10 now without a remainder take a 
,look at all these numbers 360. so 10 times 330 for 60 that's 6. 580 10 times 550 for 80 that's 8. this one 10 times 440 for 70 that's 7. 810 here 810 divided by 10 you get 8 and for 10 that's 1. all these are divisible by 10. now we'll see the last digit of the above numbers is 0. look at all the numbers last digit is zero so if the last digit is zero the number is divisible by 10. play a stick mark if they are divisible by 10 without a remainder and place cross mark if not divided so last 
,digit is zero so it's divisible by 10 here 5 not divisible 3 also not divisible in this number 0 is there it's divisible by 10 here not in this one yes 0 is there so it's divisible by 10 5 no here's 0 yes and this one also years here also divisible by 10 so how we identify whether the number is divisible by 10 look at the last digit if it is 0 it's divisible by 10. complete the following table if divided without a remainder put correct while cross mark if not divided so look at this number 
,last digit 0 divisible by 5 without a remainder last digit 0 of 5 it's divisible by 5 divisible by 10 yes last digit is 0 that's divisible by 10 this one 5 so 5 means divisible by 5 but not divisible by 10 0 divisible by 5 as well as 10. here 2 it's not divisible by 5 or 10. here 0 divisible by 5 as well as 10. here also 0 it's 
,divisible by 5 and 10. here 5 is there it's divisible by 5 but not divisible by so look at this one if zero or an even number is the last digit in the ones place then that number can be divided by two without a remainder if 0 5 is that last digit in the ones place that number can be divided by 5 without a remainder and if 0 is the last digit in the ones place that number can be divided by 10 without a remainder so we did divisible by 2 5 and 10. now we'll see what is the digital root of a number sometimes we call this is the lucky number so look at this one gaura's birthday is on 11 2 that means february 2002 find out the digital root so how can we find out the digital root we add all the digits so here 1 plus 1 plus 0 plus 2 plus 2 not not 2. so you have to add all digits and see what's your lucky number one plus one two two plus two four four plus two six six plus two eight till you get one digit you have to add so lucky number is eight that's called the digital root birthday of gaura's grandfather is 12 11 that's november 1948. find out the digital root of his birthday so we'll add all the digits 1 plus 2 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 9 4 eight so one plus two three three plus one four four plus one five five plus one six six plus nine fifteen 15 plus 4 19 19 plus 8 27 now you get two digit number so again you have to add these two digits 2 plus 7 you get 9. so gaura's grandfather's lucky number is 9. here we get two numbered figure as the answer so they should be once again added to get the answer so here 27 we can find out taking 2 plus 7. find the digital root of the following numbers so we'll add it 2 plus 7 is 9. so lucky number is 9. 3 not 8. eight plus three eleven but eleven is two digit number so you have to add it again one plus one that's two five thousand one hundred and twenty 
,seven add all the digits five plus one six six plus two eight eight plus seven fifteen now add the two digits one plus five that's six this one four plus eight twelve twelve and ten twenty-two twenty-two means two plus two you get 4. here 6 plus 7 13 13 plus 7 20 and 9 29 now add the two digits 2 plus 9 11. again you have to add 1 plus 1 2 till you get one digit you have to add 3 plus 7 10 18 and 18 plus 4 22 22 plus 5 27 and 2 and 7 you get 9. 488 8 and 8 16 16 plus 4 20. so add 2 and 0 you get 2. that's the digital root 99999 so 4 9s you get 36 and three and six you get nine how many fours are there one two three four five six six fours you get 20 4 
,2 plus 4 you get 6. this one the 335 704 three plus three six six plus five eleven eleven plus seven eighteen eighteen plus four twenty two two plus two you get find whether the following numbers are divisible by 3 without a remainder now we'll check out these numbers we'll divide by 3 3 times 1 nothing for 2 for 21 that's 7. so it's divisible 612 divided by 3 you get 2 here nothing there 3 times 4 12. 102 3 times 3 9 for 12 that's 4. 201 this is 3 times 6 18 for 21 that's 7 67 that's divisible by 3. now we'll find out the digital root of all these numbers and see three two one five five plus one six six hundred and twelve six plus one seven 7 plus 2 9 here 102 1 plus 2 3 and 201 that's 3. now look at the digital root when you get 3 6 9 as the digital rule the number is divisible by 3. so you need to remember how 
,you identify whether the number is divisible by 3 the digital root should be either 3 6 or 9. find out the digital root of the following numbers and find whether they are divisible by 3 without a remainder so we'll find out the digital root 8 will straight away add this 8 plus 1 9 9 plus 3 12. so 12 means 1 plus 2 you get 3 408 
,8 plus 4 12 2 plus 1 3 this one 3 plus 1 4 4 plus 7 11 11 plus 2 13 3 plus 1 4 plus one six six plus two eight eight plus two ten eleven twelve so one plus two three three plus four seven seven plus five 12 12 plus 7 19 and 21 2 plus 1 again that's 3. 6 plus 7 13 13 plus 5 18. eight plus one nine seven plus two nine nine plus nine eighty and one nineteen and twenty four so 2 plus 4 again 6. now we found out digital root now check whether this number is divisible by 3 without a remainder so 
,what's the condition if the digital root is 3 6 9 the number is divisible by 3 so this is 3 this is divisible by 3. here also this is divisible by 3 but 4 is not here 3 again yes yes 9 also possible here 6 also possible so only this number is not divisible by 3. look at these numbers write the numbers divisible by 3 without a remainder from the above numbers within the set of 8 so what you have to do you have to find out the digital root 2 plus 1 3 so that's divisible by 3 3 plus 1 4 it's not divisible 4 plus 1 5. it's not divisible but here 5 plus 1 yes it's divisible 51 6 plus 1 again not divisible 7 plus 1 8 not divisible but 8 81 8 plus 1 9 that's 
,divisible by 3 9 plus 1 10 that's 1 plus 0 again 1 so that's not divisible so only 21 51 81 are divisible by 3. look at these numbers write the numbers divisible by 
,3 without a remainder from the above numbers within the set b again check the digital root 5 plus 2 7 that's not divisible five plus one six six plus two eight not divisible five plus two seven seven plus two nine that's divisible by three five plus three eight eight plus two ten not divisible five plus four nine nine plus two eleven eleven means one and one again two not divisible here 10 12 12 means 2 plus 1 again 3 that's divisible by 3 562 6 5 11 11 plus 2 13 13 means 1 and 3 you are getting 4 5 plus 7 12 12 plus 2 14 14 means 5. not divisible 5 plus 8 13 13 plus 2 15 15 means 6 that's divisible by 3 so these are the numbers divisible by three identify the numbers that are divisible by four without a remainder we'll take these numbers and divide by four four times six so that's divisible by 4 here 4 times 1 4 
,for 22 that's 5 and for 24 that's 6. that's also divisible 4 times 8 32 for 28 that's 7. 300 4 times 7 28 for 20 that's 5 that's also divisible this one 4 times 6 24 for 10 that's 2 8 and for 20 that's 5. 4 times 8 32 then 32 38 for 38 you get 9 36 remainder 2 5 times 1 4 times 1 4 1 remaining for 10 4 times 2 8 for 21 that's 4 
,times 5 20 and for 14 4 times 3 12 and remainder 2. this one divide by 4 4 times 1 4 for 3 nothing for 31 that's 7 28 so you get 30 so again 7 28 for 20 that's 5. so these two numbers are not divisible by 4. now look at the last two digits and see we'll look at last two digits so this is 24 here also 24 48 zero zero fifty eight 
,fourteen zero zero so how we identify whether the number is divisible by four if the final two digits of the above numbers are either 0 0 24 48 64 28 32 that means the numbers are divisible by 4 so you have to only look at the last two digits so here 58 is not divisible by 4 so the whole number is not divisible 14 also not divisible by 4 so that means 5014 is not divisible by 4. select and write the numbers divisible by 4 without a remainder from the following numbers so what we do we take 
,the last two digits 75 not divisible by 4 44 yes so 344 is divisible by 4 here 0 0 if it's 0 0 also it's divisible 84 divisible by 4 so 1284 divisible by 4 72 4 times 1 4 32 so that's divisible by 4 972 55 it's not divisible by 4. but 0 0 yes it's divisible by 4 here also 0 0 it's divisible by 4 36 yes it is divisible by 4 so 5 
,4 536 divisible by 4. what about 58 4 times 1 and for 18 it's not divisible by 4 so you can't write that number write three numbers beginning from 5 ending with 2 and having four numbers so you can create anything so numbers beginning from five so five but ending with two four digits ending with two write three numbers so four having four numbers four digit numbers so you can put any number in between seven three five and two you can put nine and one five and two eight and three another one now you asked to write only three numbers so these are the three numbers starting from five and ending with two look at this one write down all the numbers less than 100 divisible by 4 without a remainder and 6 at the ones place last digit is 6 and the number should be less than 100 that means only 2 digit numbers you can write how we identify whether the number is divisible by 4 the last 2 digit should be divisible by 4. so we can put 16 because that's less than 100 16 is divisible by 4 then 26 is not divisible 36 yes 46 no 56 56 is this divisible by 4 1 and for 16 you get 14 so that's divisible 66 it's not divisible 76 check 76 and see 76 divided by 4 1 and here 36 that's nine it's d it's divisible so 76 is okay what else 86 it's not divisible because 4 times 2 86 is not divisible 96 divisible by 4 4 times 2 8 
,for 16 that's 4 it's divisible so 96 so these are the numbers less than 100 last digit is 6 and all the numbers are divisible by 4. look at this one write 6 even numbers that do not divide by 4 without a remainder a1 means even means last digit either 0 or even number so we'll put 0 and it's not divided by 4 so what's the condition you can't put 0 there uh what about 30 is 30 divided by 4 no so you can put 30 and any number so 30 or you can put any number here 330. it's not divisible by 4 another one you can put 2 as the last digit and what about this can be 2 22 should be there because it's not divisible by 4 and here we'll put any number here 122. then another number 8 and 18 it's not divisible by 4 and you can put any number here 3. so you asked to write six even numbers another even number you can put 6 but if you put 2 26 is not divisible by 4 and then here you can put any number 526 1 2 3 4 another 2 so 2 and 32 is divisible 42 it's not divisible by 4. so put any number here 5 another one more we'll put 8 and 18 is not divisible by or we'll put 28 is divisible 38 it's not divisible by 4 so you can put any number here 600 or any number here it's not mentioned to write only three digit numbers you can write any number that you like but only condition is the last two numbers it's not divisible by four write six numbers with the last digit as zero and not divisible by three and four without a remainder so you need to be careful now 0 is there last digit is 0 
,not divisible by 4 that means this can be 30 last 2 digits 30 and not divisible by 3 means the digital root cannot be 3 6 9. so here 3 so we can put 1 there 1 plus 3 4 digital root is 4 so that's not divisible by 3 or 4. another one put 0 for last digit and 10 10 is not divisible by 4 so if you put 2 it's divisible by 3 so we can put 3 3 plus 1 4 4 is not divisible by the digital root four means not divisible by three another one you can put any number of digits zero we'll put last two digits 30 40 divisible 50 it's not divisible so 50 then 5 plus 1 6 6 plus 1 7 now digital root is 7 not divisible by 3 and 50 not divisible by 4 another one last digit is zero and we'll put 60 it's divisible 70. it's not divisible because 4 times 1 for 30 it's not divisible so 70 is the last two digits then now think about the digital root 7 plus 1 8 8 plus 2 10 so 10 is not divisible by 3 digital root 10 is not divisible by 3. another one we'll write a big number 1 2 three four we need two more zero and eighty eight is divisible by four ninety you can put ninety there and now put numbers in front 9 plus 1 10 10 plus 1 11 11 plus 2 13 that's 4 digital root is 4 so 2190 is also possible another one more one two three four five one more zero we'll put ten now see the digital root 1 5 1 6 6 plus 2 8 8 plus 2 10 10 plus 1 11 so 11 means digital root is 2 so not divisible by 3. so what's this number 122 510 is also not divisible by 3 or 4. finding a number divisible by 6 without a remainder how we do that we can check whether the number is divisible by 2 or 3 if it satisfy definitely that number is divisible by 6. so we can check it's a it's an even number yes it's divisible by 2. what's the digital root 7 plus 2 9 9 plus 6 15 15 means 6 that means it's also divisible by 3. so definitely if these two are okay that means it's divisible by six as well look at this one five last digit is five means not divisible by 2 digital root 11 plus 5 that's 16 so 6 plus 1 7 7 is not 
,divisible so definitely this is not divisible by 6 last digit is 8 divisible by 2 digital root 3 3 plus 4 7 7 plus 8 15 that means 6 6 means divisible by 3 then definitely this is divisible by 6 as well last digit is 4 divisible by two digital root eight eight plus four twelve twelve means three it's divisible by three so definitely it's divisible by six last digit is 4 divisible by 2. now the digital root 7 plus 4 is 11 11 plus 4 15 that's 6. it's divisible by 3 that means divisible by 6 as well last digit is 5 not divisible by 2 1 plus 8 9 9 plus 5 14 14 means 5. it's not divisible by 3 so definitely it's not divided by 6. last digit is 6 that's even number yes it's divisible by 2. digital root 9 9 plus 6 15 that's 5 plus 1 6. it's divisible by 3 so that means it's divisible by 6 as well if the digital root is divisible by 3 the number is divided by 3. if the number is an even number it can be divided by 2 without a remainder all those numbers divisible by 2 and 3 without a remainder can be divided by 6 as well finding a number divided by 9 without a remainder so we did so far two three four ten five six now nine look at the following 
,multiples of nine all these multiples of 9 take 9 so digital root is 9 18 1 plus 8 digital root is 9 2 7 digital root is 9 36 3 plus 6 that's 9. so take any number 7 plus 1 8 plus 1 9 here 4 plus 4 8 8 plus 1 9 all multiples of 9 you get the digital root 9 so that means you can look at the digital root and see whether the number is divisible by 9 45 4 plus 5 that's nice 117 seven plus one eight eight plus one nine 135 eight and nine here seven plus one all these digital roots are nine ten 8 plus 1 9. so 9 is the digital root of all the above numbers so any number whose digital rule digital index or digital root is 9 it is divided by 9. select and write the numbers that is divisible by 6 without a remainder from the following numbers so have you identify whether this is divisible by 6 first check whether this is a 
,this is an even number this is not so it's not divisible by 6 690 it's an even number now we'll check the digital route 9 plus 6 15 that's 5 1 6 6 means it's divisible by 3 as well so 609 divisible by 2 and 3 that means divisible by 6. this one even number correct digital root 10 10 plus 3 13 13 plus 1 14 that means 4 plus 1 that's not divisible by 3. is an even number check whether this is divisible by three eight plus four twelve twelve plus one thirteen thirteen plus two fifteen so five 
,plus one six it's divisible by two and three that means divisible by 6 as well check the digital route 10 12 12 means it's divisible 774 even number digital road 14 
,plus 4 80 8 plus 1 9 so that's divisible by 3 as well 916 10 10 plus 6 16 that means 7 so not divisible by 3 4 plus 4 8 8 plus 1 9 it's divisible by 3 and 2. that's 
,divisible by 6. this one even yes then digital root nine ten sixteen six plus one seven so that's not divisible by three this one even number look at the digital root three three plus 7 10 10 plus 2 12. it's divisible by 3 as well as 2 so definitely divisible by 6. if a certain number is divided by another whole number without a remainder what you call that number that is a factor of the first number so what are factors if a number can be written as a multiple of two whole numbers they are 
,considered as factors of the first number take look take a look at 24 what are the factors if we take one that's 1 times 24 so 1 and 24 both are factors 2 is also a 
,factor 2 times 12. you can write the same thing as 3 times 8 4 times 6 and 6 times 4 again you can write this way so what are the factors of 24 1 2 3 4 6 8 12 24 so 
,all these numbers we call those are factors so you can create that number by multiplying the two numbers so those are factors write the set of factors of 36 1 times 
,36 2 times 18 3 times 12 4 times 9 6 times 6. so what are the factors of 36 always 1 and the number itself are factors 2 3 4 6 9 12 18 36 so these are the set of factors of 36 all numbers are there all factors are there write the set of factors of 60 1 times 60 2 times 30 divide by 2 and see when you divide by 3 you get 20. divide by 4 1 and for 20 that's 5 15 times 4 divided by 5 you get 12 and here divide by 6 you get 10. so what are the factors of 60 starting from 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 here and 
,then 10 12 15 20 30 and 60. so those are the factors of 60. now we'll look at what are prime numbers take a look at 2 what are the factors of two one and two so factors of two one and two take three one times three factors of 3 1 times 1 and 3. what about factors of 5 1 times 5 so you get 1 and 5. look at carefully what are the 
,factors seven means one and one times seven factors of here seven factors of seven you get one and 7 so take a look at all the factors 1 and the number itself so what are prime numbers if a number has only two factors and the factors are one and itself so those numbers are called prime numbers select and underline the number out of the following numbers divided by 9 without a remainder so how you identify a number is divisible by 9 the digital root should be nine so we'll look at three plus six nine that means divided by nine so one plus five twelve twelve plus six eighteen eight plus one nine two plus two four four plus four eight eight plus one nine 
,that's divisible by nine nine and nine eighteen eight plus one nine two plus three five 5 7 12 12 6 18 that's also divisible by 9. take a look at this one 4 plus 5 9 9 plus nine eighteen that's also divisible by nine here also eight plus one nine this one eight eight plus eight sixteen sixteen plus two eighteen eighteen means nine all the numbers are divisible by nine this one ten ten plus eight eighteen eight plus one nine seven plus seven fourteen 14 plus 1 15 15 means 5 plus 1 6 is not divisible by 9. so all the other numbers except 177 is divisible by 9. select and underline the numbers out of the following numbers divided by 6 and 9 without a remainder how you identify we have to check the digital root and this should be an even number because to check whether the number is divisible by 6 it should be definitely divided by 2. so definitely out of this we can cross out this because this is an odd number this is an odd number not divisible by 6 these numbers we can cross out now for the other numbers we have to check the digital root 10 10 plus 8 18 it's divisible by nine as well as six six plus two eight eight plus one nine nine is divisible by nine as well as 3. here 15 that means 5 plus 1 6 it's not divisible by 9 so you can't select that 7 plus 1 8 8 plus 2 10 10 plus 8 18 18 means 9 that's divisible by 9 as well as 6. this one 7 7 plus 8 15 15 means not divisible by 9 here 16 20 27 divisible by 9 as well as 6. 384 12 12 plus 3 15 15 means 1 plus 5 not divisible by 9. now we'll look at this question factors 24 glass marbles should be packed with similar number leaving any remainder write down all the ways it can be 
,done so you can do one glass marble in each 24 that means one packet two glass marbles in each two times twelve then you get two packets three glass marbles in each 
,three times eight so you can make eight packets four glass marble in each four times six and you get six packets eight glass marbles eight times three you get three 
,packets with six glass marbles six times 4 that's 4 here and with 12 12 times 2 24. so you can make two packets and with 24 again one packet here according to the above information the set of numbers that can be divided by 24 without a remainder so 1 2 3 4 and 6 12 what is 12 24 these are factors now we looked at prime numbers now what are composite numbers we'll take a look at 4 what are the factors of 4 1 into 4 2 times 2. so factors of 4 you can write 1 2 4 factors of 6 1 times 6 or 2 times 3. so what are the factors of 6 you can write 1 two three six one two three six what are the factors of eight eight means one times eight so eight you can write 
,2 times 4 as well so what are the factors of 8 you get 1 2 4 8. now take a look at all the factors here if a certain number has more than two factors it is a composite number prime factors you get only two factors one and the number itself so composite numbers you get more than two factors then we can identify that number is a composite number write the set of composite numbers less than 21 so not prime numbers so one you can't take one just one factor is there two three four is a composite number five is a prime number 6 is a composite number 7 is prime 8 is composite 9 composite 10 11 is a prime number 12 is a composite 13 is prime 14 15 16 17 is prime 18 19 19 is prime 20 is the last number less than 21 means you can't write 21. so these are the composite numbers less than 21 finding prime factors of a number write number 24 in every way as a product of two numbers 1 times 24 2 times 12 3 times 8 4 times 6 so what are the prime factors out of these so write all the factors here we can write the factors of 24 is 1 2 3 4 6 8 12 24 out of these factors what are the prime factors the factors are prime numbers so what are the prime numbers there 2 3 that's all so prime factors of 24 is either 2 or 3 and write all the prime factors so you can write 2 and 3 and write 24 as a product of prime factors how can you write down as a product of prime factors you can take the number divide by only the prime numbers take 2 you get 12. another 2 6 2 3 so 3 1 till you get 1 you have to divide now how many times you multiply by 2 2 2 2 and 1 3. or you can write how many twos three twos into one three so this is a product of prime factors 
,so 2 to the power 3 n 3. now take 36 and write down everywhere as a product of numbers 1 times 36 two times eighty three times twelve four times nine and six times six so what are the factors of 36 you can write 1 2 3 4 6 9 12 18 36 those are the factors out of the factors what are the prime factors 2 3 that's all 2 and 3. now product as prime factors how can you do you can divide by two two times eighteen again divide by two nine you have to divide by three now three times three and again 
,divide by 3 you get 1. so what are the factors 2 times 2 4 4 times 3 12 12 times 3 36 so here 2 times 2 times 3 times 3 or you can write 2 to the power 2 because twice are there and 3 to the power 2 here also twice are there so that's the value 36 as a product of prime factors right all the prime numbers from 1 to 40 starting from 2 3 5 7 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 is 5 18 19 20 21 22 23 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 a prime number 30 31 is a prime number 32 33 34 35 36 30 7 is a prime number 38 and 
,39 it's not and 40. so these are the prime numbers 1 to 40. write all the composite numbers from 1 to 30 composite means you get more than 2 factors one two three four five six seven is prime eight nine ten eleven 12 13 14 15 16 17 here 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 and 30 1 2 30 means you can include 30 as well so those are composite numbers finding highest common factor so we'll take the number numbers 18 and 30. now what are the factors of 18 it's one divisible by two so two is a factor it's divisible by three three is a factor three times six then four five six six times 3 7 8 9 times 2 then 10 11 all these again finally 18. so those are the 
,factors of 18. what are the factors of 30 starting from 1 divisible by 2. it's divisible by 3 3 times 10 4 5 5 times 6 also a factor 7 8 9 10 is a factor then 15 times 2 so 15 is a factor and 30. now what are the common factors of eighteen and thirty one two three six what else that's all so out of these what's the highest one highest common factor of 18 and 30 is 6. that's the highest one now take these two these three numbers 28 42 and 63 and see what's the highest common factor factors of 28 one it's divisible by two three three times no three four four times seven six seven eight nine ten and two times fourteen so fourteen is a factor 4 times 7 and then finally 28 factors of 42 what are the factors of 42 1 it's divisible by two three three times four thirty three times what three times uh fourteen four five six six times seven so seven is a factor eight nine ten eleven and if it's two you get twenty one and if it's three three times one three three times four fourteen is 
,a factor and what is 6 times 7 and again 42 last digit is 42. now what are the factors of 63 1 it's divisible by 3. so 3 times so 63 comes that's the last number 3 times 21 and what else 63 9 times 6 6 and 9 those are the factors of 63. now what are the common factors out of those we'll find out common ones one is common 2 is not 6 no 9 21 it's not common so only one so what's the highest common factor of this so you get only one so the highest common factor of 28 42 and 63 is 1. finding highest common factor using prime factors so this is another way of finding highest common factor find the highest common factor of 36 so we'll find out 36 you can divide by 2 18 divide by 2 now divide by 3 3 divided by three you get one two times two times three times three forty five divide and see you can divide by three divide by three again and divide by five you get one three times three times five fifty-four divide by 2 then divide by 3 3 3 2 times 3 3 3. now these are the factors prime factors so how we find out the highest common factor we'll find out the common ones and multiply what's common two is not common three yes you get three a common one that's all another three another three is common so you get three two times so the highest common factor we take three times three you get three comma twice so three times three that's 9. so how we find out the highest common factor using this way so you find out the prime factor separately and see what are the common ones for all the numbers and then you multiply those find the highest common factor of 64 960 divide by 2 divide by 2 again divided by 2 divided by 2 divided by 2 and 1. so what are the factors 2 2 1 2 3 4 5 six three four five six ninety six divided by three thirty two divided by two sixteen divided by 2 8 divided by 2 4 divided by 2 
,and again 1. so what are the factors 1 2 3 4 5 2 3 4 five and three sixty divide by two get thirty divided by two fifteen divided by three five divide by 5 you get 1. so what are the factors of 60 2 and 2 and 3 and 5. now what are the common factors we'll take what are common two another two then 3 is not common 5 is not common 
,only these two so what's the highest common factor 2 times 2 that's 4. find the highest common factor of 16 36 48 and 60. we'll divide and see 2 times 8 2 times 4 2 
,times 2 2 times 1. so 16 is 2 4 times 36 divided by 2. you get 18 divide by 2 again 9 divided by three three divided by three one two times two three times three 48 
,divided by two 24 divided by 2 12 divided by 2 6 3 3 1. so you get 1 2 3 4 2 3 four and three sixty divided by two thirty divide by two again fifteen divided by three that's five divided by 5 you get 1 2 times 2 times 3 times 5. now find out the highest one what's the highest one 2 is common another 2 is common what else that's 
,all so what's the highest common factor of 16 36 48 and 60 that's 2 times 2 4. now finding least common multiple finding the least common multiple of 4 6 eight what 
,are the multiples of four four times one four four times two eight four times three twelve four times four sixteen 4 times 5 20 24 28 you can write but we'll stop here we'll put three dots that means we it's continuing multiples of six six times one six times two twelve six times three eighteen six times four twenty four six times 5 30 36 42 we'll put three dots multiples of eight eight times one eight eight times two 16 24 8 times 4 32 8 times 5 40 48 like that it's continuing so what are 
,the common multiples of all these will identify common multiples what are the common ones 20 is not there can you see 24 and then what else so 48 comes here so when 
,you do this 48 next you will get 48 like that so 48 also common for all so this is like 24 48 like that common months we need the lowest one so least one is 24 so that's the least common multiple of four six eight so 24 is the answer find the least common multiple of four six eight from prime factors so how can you write four two times two six two times three eight two times two times two so this is how we can do so how many 2s are there here 2 2's here 2 1 and 3 1 here 2 to the power 3 there so we are taking different numbers with maximum power greatest power of them so if you take two's maximum is 2 to the power 3 and then you get 3 here so that's the least common multiple now what's 2 to the power 3 that's 8 times 3 you get 24. so previous one also we got 24 as the least common multiple and there's another way 
,of doing that so how you do that way so here we will try it out you can write down the numbers at once and try to divide by prime numbers so that you get once 2 times two four six divided by two you get three eight divided by two four now you can divide by two this is one three you can't divide so you write down the number as it is this is four so you can divide by two now there's another two so you can divide by two one you can write as it is 3 you can't divide right as it is and this becomes 1. now 3 is there you need to divide this by 3 so you get all ones till you get once you can divide so from this also you can find out the lowest common multiple so 2 times 2 4 4 times 2 8 8 times 3 24 so that way is easier to find out the lowest common multiple find the least common multiple dividing method of the numbers four six eight so here that's what i did before so what are the numbers we got 2 2 2 3. so we get 2 2 2 3. so 2 times 2 4 4 times 2 8 8 times 3 24 as the least common multiple so here divide by prime numbers so here 2 also possible 3 5 7 like that least common multiple of 4 6 8 is 24 so the answer you get as the least common multiple should be eligible for dividing without a remainder by each number again number given find the least common multiple of 72 9608 so we'll use the factor method first 72 divide by 2 36 divided by 2 you get 18 and 9. now you can divide by 3. so what are the factors of 72 1 2 3 and 2 3's 2 to the power 3 3 squared 96 we'll do 96 divided by 2 48 divided by 2 divided by two again till you get one one two three four five and one three two to the power five and one three hundred and eight you 
,need to divide by three till you get one two twos and three threes two twos and three threes now we take the highest power with different numbers when you consider 2 2 to the power 5 is the maximum when you take 3 3 to the power 3 is the maximum so that's the least common multiple 2 to the power 5 32 3 to the power 3 3 times 3 times 3 27 now when you multiply these two what you get 32 into 27 20 and 7 21 plus 1 22 when you add it 964. so what's the least common multiple of 72 968 is 964 find least common multiple of 64 96 and 128 now divide by 2 32 divide by 2 again 16 divided by 2 here 8 4 2 and 1. so how many tools 1 2 3 4 5 6 2 to the power 6. 96 48 divided by 2 24 divided by 2 12 6 3 one two three four five two to the power five and three 168 is not 120 868 2 8 4 42 21 7 and 1 so 2 to the power 3 and 3 and 7. 
,now when you take different numbers when you take 2 the maximum power is 2 to the power 6. if you take 3 that's 1 power 1 and 7 2 to the power 6 is 60 4 3 times 7 21 so 64 times 21 what's the answer add it together thousand three hundred and forty four is the lowest or least common multiple fine least common multiple of 14 28 42 by applying dividing method so you write the numbers at once and divide 2 times 7 2 times 14. 2 times 24 again you can divide by 2 but 7 you can't divide so you write as it is 7 you're 12. again you can divide by 2 you get 6. again divide by 2 you get 3. now you can divide by 3 and finally by 7 till you get 1. so what's the least common multiple you multiply all these numbers two times two times two three four and three and seven two times two four four times two eight eight times two sixteen times twenty one what's sixteen times twenty one twenty and one here and 16 you get 336. that's the least common multiple look at this question the bells a in every 20 minutes be in every 30 minutes and see in every 40 minutes respectively rings if all three bells were ringing at the same time at eighteen when we all three bells be wrong once again so if you take multiples of twenty just see you get 20 20 and 20 40 then 60 80 80 plus 20 hundred hundred plus 20 hundred and twenty like that 140 if you take every 30 minutes it's ringing then multiples of 30 30 60 60 30 90 90 30 120 120 plus 30 150 150 plus 30 180 so and if it's 40 minutes interval what are the multiples of 40 40 80 80 plus 40 120 and 40 160 200 like that now what's the lowest common one look at these values and see what's the lowest common value 
,is comma and the lowest one so that means after 120 minutes it will ring again so 120 minutes means how many hours divided by 60 you get two hours so what's the time again the bell is ringing eight for the first time and 8 plus 2 10 a.m so again the bell will ring at 10 a.m so this is one way of solving this problem or you can do using factors 20 how can you write 2 times 10 10 again 2 and 5 30 how can you write 2 times three six six times five forty two times twenty again two times two ten two times two eight eight times five so forty those are the factors so how do you find out the lowest one when you take least common multiple of twenty thirty forty this is 2 to the power 2 and 5 here 2 3 5 here 2 to the power 3 and 5. so when you take power 2 to the power 3 is the maximum 3 to the power 1 is the maximum and 5 
,to the power 1. 2 to the power 3 is 8 8 times 3 24 24 times 5. 120 so least common multiple also 120 so which one is easy this way is easier than finding multiples so we'll find using least common multiple finding factors and take the highest factor now we'll look at exercise in your textbook exercise 4.1 without dividing select the numbers which are divisible by 9 how we identify digital root if the digital root is 9 that means divisible by nine five plus four now so 504 is divisible by nine six plus five eleven eleven plus two thirteen thirteen means you can't five plus six eleven eleven plus seven eighteen that means yes it's divisible by nine six plus five eleven eleven plus 8 19 that's not possible 2 2 plus 4 6 6 plus 3 9 that's possible 1 plus 3 four four plus five nine nine plus one ten that's not possible 
,two plus seven nine nine plus one ten ten plus nine ninety that's not possible and the last one four plus five nine nine plus three twelve twelve plus six eighteen eighteen means yes it is divisible by s nine because the digital root is nine look at question number two without dividing select and write down the numbers which are divisible by three so what's the condition we find out the digital root if it is three six nine the number is divisible by three so we'll look at the digital root eight one eight plus one nine so nine means divisible so you can select eighty-one hundred and two one plus zero plus two you get three that's also divisible by 3 164 1 plus 6 plus 4 7 plus 4 11 11 means again 1 plus 1 that's 2. not divisible so you can't select that 189 10 18 that means 1 plus 8 9. so that's divisible by 3 189 352 3 5 2 8 8 plus 2 10 that means 1 plus 0 that's 1. so you can't select 352. 372 372 99 plus 3 12 12 means 1 plus 2 you get 3 that means okay 372 466 466 12 12 4. sixteen one plus six that's seven so you can't take 466 756 75 six eleven eleven plus seven eighteen one plus eight nine that's divisible by three so 756 is also okay 951 951 15 15 means one plus five that's also possible so 951 also divisible by 3 last one 1 plus 0 plus two plus nine ten twelve twelve means two plus one three that's also divisible by 3. so 1029 is divisible by 3. so these are the numbers that are divisible by three question number three 3 divides the number 6 5 something such as 2 digits suitable for the empty space so what's the condition the digital root should be 3 6 or 9. what's 6 plus 5 11 11 means 1 plus 1 that's 2. so you need one more to get the digital root 3 so you can put 1 here so 651 you get digital root three then another one if this is six also it's divisible by three how you get six what's the next number you need to add this is 2 3 4 5 6 4 digit number you have to add so what's the other number 6 5 4 check 11 11 plus 4 15 means 1 plus 5 you get 6 as a digital root so that's possible so either 1 or 4 you can put you can check like that till you get nine also possible four five six six another three you can put seven also then six plus five eleven eleven plus seven eighteen that means 9 that's also possible 1 4 and what's the other number 7 6 plus 3 so that's 7. question number 4 pencils were brought to be distributed among nimal's friends on his birthday party the number of pencils was less than 150 but close to it nimal observed that each friend could be given nine pencils what is the maximum number of pencils that maybe may have been brought so from this we identify the number should be divisible by nine and as well as it is less than 150 so what's the condition to identify whether it is divisible by 9 the digital root should be equal to 9 now we'll 
,check with first the number less than 150 means 149 and c what's the digital root 1 plus 4 plus 9. you get 13 plus 1 14 again 1 plus 4 that's 5. we'll take another number to see the pattern 148 1 plus 4 plus 8 13 that means 1 plus 3 you get 4 so likewise now you need to get digital root 9 what are the possibilities you are getting the next number three two one zero zero means that's divisible by nine so till you get this number you have to find out so 148 here so this becomes 147 146 145 144 so we'll check 144 what's the digital root of 144 1 plus 4 plus 4 you get 9 digital root 9 and the number is less than 150 so what is the number number is 144 pencils question number five the following quantities of items were brought to make gift packs to be given to the winners of a competition 131 exercise books 130 pencils 128 platinums and 131 ballpoint pens if each gift pack should contain three units of each item write down the minimum extra amount needed from each item so that means this these numbers should be divisible by 3. so we'll take the first one exercise book exercise books 131 what what's the digital root 1 plus 3 plus 1 4 4 plus 1 
,5. how you check whether the number is divisible by 3 the digital root should be three six nine so to get six here you need one more exercise book so need one more exercise book to get digital roots now we'll look at pencils pencils 130. then 130 pencils means 1 plus 3 plus 0 3 plus 1 4 digital root is 4 what should be the digital root to see the number is divisible by 6 you need 2 more so to get the number divisible by three you need two more pencils so here you need two more pencils there now we'll look at the next one 128 platinum pens 128 plating no what's the digital root of this 1 plus 2 plus 8 10 10 plus 1 11 that means 1 plus 1 you get 2. so you need digital root 3 so you need one more platinum so you need one more now what's the other one we did platinums now 131 ballpoint pens 131 ball point pence so what's the digital root there 1 plus 3 plus 1 4 4 plus 1 5 to get 6 you need one more ball point so those are the items that need extra to get a number divisible by 3 exercise 4.2 from the following select and write down the numbers which are divisible by 6 which are divisible by 4. so we'll do the first part divisible by 6. so what's the condition it should be any one number because it's divisible by 2 then if the digital root is 3 6 9 it's divisible by 3 then definitely it's divisible by 6. 
,so here we can cross out this one that's odd number this one this one those three because those are odd numbers not divisible by 2 now we'll take the digital root 1 
,62 1 plus 6 plus 2 9. so that means it's divisible by 2 as well as 3. so this is correct 912 9 plus 1 plus 2 12 12 means 2 plus 1 3 that's also correct 966 9 plus 6 
,plus 6 9 plus 6 15 15 plus 6 21 2 plus 1 3 that's also possible 2 1 one eight two plus one plus one plus eight twelve that's two plus one three it's also possible two four seven two two plus four six six plus seven thirteen thirteen plus two fifteen fifteen means 6 so that's also possible 3024 3 plus 0 plus 2 plus 4. four plus two six six plus three nine so that's also divisible by three and two three three naught eight three plus three plus zero plus eight eleven eleven plus three fourteen fourteen means one plus four that's five not divisible three three three two nine nine plus 2 11 that means 2 not divisible 4 800 is 4 plus 8 12 12 means 1 plus 2 3 that means it's divisible by 3 so these are the numbers divisible by 2 and 3 therefore it's divisible by 6. now we'll take part 2. now we want to check whether this is divisible by 4 how we identify whether this is divisible by 4 you have to take the last two digits 62 is it divisible by 4 4 times 1 4 for 22 that's not divisible so you can't take that 87 it's not divisible by 4 12 yes it's divisible by 4 so 912 is divisible by 4. 66 last two digits you have to check 4 times 1 4 26 it's not divisible this one 18 not divisible by 4 23 not divisible by 4 72 2 times 4 times 1 4 32 4 times 8 that's divisible by 4 so 2 4 7 2 is divisible by 4 41 again not divisible by 4 24 yes it is divisible by 4 4 times 6 so 3024 is also divisible by 4 0 8 yes divisible by four three three not eight thirty two yes it's divisible by four four thousand eight hundred years when you get zero zero it's divisible by four so the other number divisible by four is four thousand eight hundred so these numbers are divisible by four question number two write the following numbers in the appropriate column of the table given below a number may be written in both column 
,1 and 2 1 and 3. so you need to check number of which 4 is a factor that means divisible by 4 and here reason numbers of which 6 is a factor and give the reason so what's the reason to identify it's a factor of four last two digit last two digits should be divisible by four that's the condition for divisibility of 4 what about 6 what's the reason reason is it should be an even number it should be an even number and the digital root should be three six nine if it's satisfied we can say this 
,is divisible by six now we'll check each one 348 last two digits 48 so divisible by 4 now check whether it's divisible by 6 it's an even number what's the digital root eight plus four twelve twelve plus three twelve plus three fifteen fifteen means one plus five six so digital root is there so you can write this number again here 496 96 is it divisible by 4 4 times 2 yes it is divisible by 4 what about the digital root 9 plus 6 15 15 plus 4 19 so it's not divisible by three 288 yes it is divisible by four what about divisible by three even number okay but what's the digital root 8 and 8 16 16 plus 2 18 18 means 1 plus 8 9 that's okay so that's divisible by 3 as well so definitely it is divisible by 6 414 it's not divisible by last two digits not divisible by four what's a digital root four plus four eight eight plus one nine and also an even number it's divisible by six thousand twenty four it's divisible by 20 uh it's divisible by 4 because last two digits 24 divisible by 4. digital root 4 plus 2 6 6 plus 1 7 it's not divisible by 3 so then it's not divisible by 6 as well this one 72 yes it's divisible by 4 4 times 1 4 32 that's eight so thousand two hundred and seventy two then digital root seven plus two nine nine plus two eleven eleven plus one twelve two plus one three so that's divisible by 6 
,as well 306 not divisible by 4 because last 2 digit is not divisible by 4. digital root 6 plus 3 9 so that means divisible by 6 then we'll do the next one there so the other two numbers 200 other three numbers 258 58 not divisible by 4. so you can't write it there digital root 8 plus 2 10 10 plus 5 15 15 means 1 plus 5 6 yes it 
,is divisible by it is divisible by 6 so 258 so you can write down the same reason that we did before thousand eight last two digits eight that's divisible by 4. so that is here digital root 9 9 is divisible by 6 as 9 means divisible by 3 so definitely divisible by 6 as well 0 0 there are last two digits that means divisible by 4 digital root six plus seven thirteen three plus one four that's not divisible by three the number six two something and then six is divisible by both 4 and 6 find the suitable digit for the empty space what's the condition satisfy for 4 this should be the last two digits should be div divide by four this one six means divisible by six means which this should be an even number and the digital root should be 3 6 9. now it's easy to first find the digital root here 6 plus 2 plus 6 here 12 12 
,plus 2 fourteen fourteen means one plus four you get five you need to get digital root six or what's the other one nine possible when you take now you need one more 
,to get six so if we put 1 here definitely it's divisible by 4 as well because 16 is divisible by 4. can we find out another digit you need 3 not 3 4 to get 9 46 is it divided by 4 you can't put 4 there so only possibility is 6 2 1 6 question number four a drill team arranges themselves in the following manner on one location they form lines consisting of three members each and on another occasion line consisting of four members they also make circles of nine members each if the drill team must have more than 250 members more than 250 members use the divisibility rule to find the minimum number of members that could be in the t so that means the number 
,should be divided by 3 divided by 4 and divided by 9 without a remainder so how we identify without a remainder here digital root should be nine here also possible how you get four divided by four last two digits should be divisible by four so we check last two digits now we'll take more than 250 so 2 5 is there we'll check up to 259 2 plus 5 you get 7. now you need another 2 to that so if this is 2 you get 252 but now check whether last two digits divisible by 4 4 times 1 and 4 times 3 you can divide that by 4 as well so digital root 9 so what's the number it can be 252. and it says minimum number you can find several numbers more than that so minimum number is 252. question number five determine whether 126 is divisible by 2 3 4 5 6 9 and 10. 126 it's an even number can divided by two how we identify for three digital root one plus two plus six nine so that's okay so that means divided by 3 as well next one last two digits these two digits not divided by 4 so not divided by 4. 5 how we identify 5 here last digit should be either 0 or 5 so not divided by 5 six how we identify with this divided by six even number digital root should be three six nine digital root is nine so that means definitely it's divided by 6 without a remainder how we identify it is divided by 9 digital root is 9 so that's correct you can divide by 9 is it divisible by 10 no last digit should be zero so this is not divided by 10. so this is the end of part 1 in your textbook so what's the 
,divisibility rule if 2 divides the ones place digit of a whole number then that number is divisible by 2. basically that means an even number if the digital root of 
,a whole number is divisible by 3 then the number is divisible by 3. so 3 6 9. if the last two digits of a whole number consisting of two or more digits is divisible 
,by 4 then the whole number is divisible by 4. how we identify whether it's divisible by 5 the last digit once place digit should be 0 or 5. if a whole number is divisible by both 2 and 3 then it is divisible by 6. if the digital root of a whole number is 9 then that number is divided by 9. if one's place digit of a whole number 
,is 0 then the number is divisible by 10. so remember all these rules then you can identify whether any number is divisible by these numbers now exercise 4.3 factorize so how we find out the factors we'll take the first one you can divide and find the factors two times seven and two times five three times two three times five then five times five now we can see what are the factors 1 with 150 first and the last number always a factor it's divisible by 2. two times seventy-five then three times fifty and what else five times 30 and 6 times 6 times 25 and what is 10 15 you you can get 15 10 you do 10 10 times 50. so these are the factors of 105 so when you're asked to factorize you can find out what are the possible products now we'll take 204 what are the factors you can divide and see divide by 2 divide by 2 again 
,divide by 3 and 17. so i can write 204 as 1 times 204 it's divisible by 2. so i can write 2 times 102. then three times three times six eighteen for twenty-four three times eight sixty-eight it's divisible by four times 5 and 1 51 then it's divisible by 6 6 times 3 18 for twenty four six times four what else twelve two times two four four times three twelve twelve times seventy or 17 times 12 what tips then what about these two 17 times 2 34 17 times 3 51. so all these are we have already taken 4 4 times 3 12 12 also there so those are the factors of 200 165 you can divide by 3 divided by 5 and 11. so you can write 165 as 1 times 165 then 3 times 3 times 55 then 5 times 33 and what else 11 times 15 or 15 times 11. here again when you combine you get all the other numbers so those are the factors of 165 284 you can divide by 2 again so 2 times 7 1 so 71 is a prime number so you can divide by 71 that's 1. so what are the factors 284 to 1 times 284 then 2 times 142 then 4 times 
,71 and here what else when you multiply these two you get 142 and here 142. so that's all four that's all those are the factors of 284 write down the 10 factors of 770 below 100 770 we can divide by 2. and you can divide by 5 35 again 7 divide by 7 and you get 11 and 1. so what are the factors of 770 less than 100 you can write 
,1 2 then 5 7 11 what else then 5 times 2 10 you have let's start right 10 and then 11. five times to ten seven times two fourteen then seven times five thirty five then 55 11 times 5 what else 7 times 11 77 do we need more one two three four five six seven eight nine ten you need ten factors so those are the ten factors less than hundred write five multiples of 36 36 36 times 2 72 36 times 3 108 36 times 4 144 4 times 6 24 4 times 3 12 plus 2 40. then 5 5 times 6 30 3 there 5 times 3 15 plus 3 18. so those are the 5 multiples of 36 5 multiples of 112 so you are adding 112 so starting from 112 multiplied by 2 224 multiplied by 3 336 multiplied by 4 multiplied by 5 160 5 times 2 10 1 remaining 5 times 1 5 plus 1 6 and 5 times 1 5 right 5 multiples of 53 below 500. so first number is 53 multiplied by 2 multiplied by 
,3 multiplied by four again four times three twelve one remaining four times five twenty twenty-one five times this 5 times 3 15 1 remaining 5 times 5 25 plus 1 2 6 2 3 4 5 so those numbers are below 500. look at this question 180 chairs in an examination hall have to be arranged such that each row has an equal number of chairs if the minimum number of chairs that should be in a row is 10 and the maximum that could be in a row is 15. find how many possible ways there are to arrange the chairs so 180 just so check whether this number is divisible by 2 3 like that so here we'll start from this is 10 so the next number is 11. now look at 180 and see what are the factors of 180 divide by 2 divide by 2 and divide by 3 and divide by 5. so what are the factors so we can't take less than 10 so 180 we can write as if it's 10 10 with 18 so that's one possibility to arrange the chairs then 12 3 2 2 12 with 15 then what else 12 with 15 and 1 more 9 eighteen three times three nine nine times two eighteen with ten we did that another possibility fifteen we took it we need to get less than 15 18 you can't because 18 there that's all those are the possibilities can we get one more 2 times 2 four four times three twelve four times nine four times nine 36 so that's more than that so those are the only possibilities so here 12 times 15 or you can write as 15 times 12. so these are the rows the minimum number of chairs that should be in a row in a row it can be 10 12 or 15 chairs example number one write 63 as a product of its prime factors so what you do you divide and see 21 7 and 1 so what how can you write 63 3 times 3 times 7 or you can rewrite as 3 squared into 7. exercise 4.4 find the prime factors of each of the following numbers 81 you can divide by 3 27 divided by 3 divided by 3 again divided by 3. so you are only dividing by prime numbers so 81 you can write 3 3 3 3 4 times or 3 to the power 4 84 how can you divide divide by 2 divide by 2 again divide by 3. i can write 2 times 2 times 3 times 7 or 2 to the power 2 3 and 7 96 and divide by 2 divide by 2 again divide by 2 again again 2 2 and 3. one two three four five one two three four five and one three so you can write as two to the power one two three 5 into 3 those are the prime factors express each of the following numbers as a product of its prime factors 12. divisible by 2 and you get 3 here so 2 times 2 times 3 15 you can divide by three and five so three times five sixteen and divide by two 2 again 2 again and 2 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 18 you can divide by 2 and 3 and three so two times three and three so those are the prime factors twenty divided by 2 divided by 2 and 5. 2 times 2 times 5 28 divide by 2 divided by 2 again and 7 2 times 2 times 7. take 59 it's not divisible by any other number just 1 and 
,itself so that's a prime number so you can't write factors there so 1 and 59 so prime number because it's prime number only 1 and itself are factors 65 divisible by 
,five and thirteen so five times thirteen so you are asked to write in prime factors 5 and 13 both are prime factors 77 7 with 11. 7 times 11 91 you can divide by 7 and 13. so 7 into 30 exercise 4.5 find six factors of each of the following numbers by considering their prime factors divisible by two again two and five so you need six factors each of the following numbers by considering they are prime factors so you need prime not only prime factors any six factors so one is definitely a factor 2 then you get 4 and 5 what else 10 and 5 times 2 10 4 times 5 we did and 20 times 1 that's 20 6 factors are there 42 can divide by 2 divide by 3 and 7 so 1 is a 
,factor 2 3 7 and then you can do multiply 6 is also 5 and 2 times 7 14 is a factor one two three four five six you can write more 21 42 any number only you asked to 
,write 6 factors 70 divided by 2 divide by 5 and 7. so 1 is a factor 2 5 7 then 10 2 times 5 then what is 3 times or not three times five five times seven thirty five or seventy one and last number always are factors 84 divisible by 2 divisible by 2 again so 3 and 7. now what are the factors one is a factor two three seven and two times two four two times three six likewise you can write any number 4 times 3 12 then 21 any number but you need only 6 factors 66 divisible by 2 3 and 11. so 1 2 3 11 then 6 is a factor what else is 22 is the first box then 3 times 11 33 is a factor 66 so you can write 86 99 divided by 3 3 and 11. so 1 3 then 9 11. what is 11 times 3 33 and 9 times 9 times 11 1199 six factors are there example number one find the highest common factor of 72 108 we'll use three methods first one write down separate factors so 72 how can you write 72 divide and see you get 3 and 3 so 2 into 2 into 2 into 3 into 3 factors of 72 you can write like that what are the factors of 108 you can divide and see nine three three again so i can write two twice three tries what's the highest common factor so highest common factor you can take the common ones out one two and three here another three so what's the highest common factor let's see if 2 times 2 times 3 times 3. 2 times 2 4 4 times 3 12 12 times 3 36 so that's the highest common factor this is one method we'll take another method now we'll look at another method so what are the two numbers 72 and 108 72 and 108 we'll find out all the factors of 72. y then it's divisible by 2. when we have factors it's easy nine three times three one so two one two three then four six what else nine eight so we'll put eight first nine two times three six six times two twelve what else then six times three eighteen also possible eight times nine twelve and then two times two four four times two eight eight times three eight times three twenty-four twenty-four times three seventy-two so we can write down all the factors of 72. now we'll try to write down all the factors of 108. first we'll divide and see so what are the factors one two three then two times two four then two times three six then three times three nines what else 12 2 times 2 4 4 times 3 12 is a factor then 3 times 2 6 6 times 3 18 is a factor then 2 times 2 4 4 times 
,3 12 12 times 3 12 times 3 30 6 is also factor and 108 is the other one three times three nine nine times three 27 is also factor this way twenty three times three nine nine times three twenty seven 27 27 times 2 54 and then 108 now when you take all the factors what are common one 2 3 4 6 9 12 18 and here this is also divisible by 36 we forgot to write down 36 times 2. so 36 or so common seven to two and hundred other numbers are not common out of these common numbers what's the highest common factor out of these the highest one is 36 so that's the second method now we'll take another method so we can write 72 and 108 in a row and find out the common 
,factors we can divide both the numbers by 2. again by two now this one you can divide both the numbers by 3 again by 3. now we can't divide because 2 and 3 there are no common factors till you get these common factors and then you can multiply these common ones 2 times 2 times 3 times 3 9 9 times 2 18 18 times 2 36 so highest common factor is 36 so we did three ways to find out the highest common factor example number two three types of items were brought in the following quantities to be offered at an arms giving 30 cakes of soap 24 tubes of toothpaste 18 bottles of ointment 30 24 and 18. parcels were made such that each contain all three items every 
,parcel had the same number of items of a particular type what is the maximum number of parcels that can be made accordingly write down the quantity of each item in a single parcel so what you have to find out the highest common factor of 30 24 and 18. so what's the easiest way to do we can write down separately and see the common ones 30 how can you write and divide by two divide by three and five two times three times five twenty-four you can divide by 2 and do divide by 2 again 2 again and 3. so 2 times 2 times 2 times 3 then 18 how can you divide divide by two and three two times three times three now what are the common ones two three that's all so that means highest common factor is six that means you can make six parcels so six parcels are there so how many you can put in each parcel 30 divided by six so you can put in one parcel if it's one parcel what are the things six thirty divided by six five cakes of salt divided by six six times four twenty-four so six times four four what's that toothpaste and six you divide by this one 18 divided by six you get three three bottles of ointment three bottles of ointment so those are the things you can include in one parcel and you can make six puzzles like that exercise 4.6 fill in the blanks to obtain the highest common factor by writing down all factors of the given numbers factors of 8 1 2 4 and 8 factors of 12 1 divided by 2 divided by 3 4 and 6 and 12 factors common to 8 and 12 1 too common what is and what's the highest common factor out of all these three factors common factors 4 is the highest one part 2 54 written as a product of its prime factors so it's easy first 
,divide and see twenty-seven divided by three and divide by three so you can write two times three times three threes then what about 90 you can divide and see 45 and divide by 3 get 15 divide by 3 again 5 divide by 5 you get 1 2 times 3 twice and 5 and 72 how can you write 72 divide by 2 divided by 2 again 2 and 3 and 1. so 2 3 
,times and 3 twice now the highest common factor of all three numbers how can we find out we can use the common one two and here three and another three can you see another three there another three common so what's the highest common factor 2 times 3 6 6 times 3 80. so highest common factor of all three numbers is 18. find the highest common factor of each pair of numbers by writing down all their factors so you need to write down all factors and find out the highest one twelve what are the factors one two three four six what is then 12 50 what are the factors 1 3 5 and 15 now out of these what are the what's the highest one highest one three three is 
,the highest common factor next one 24 24 how can you write you can divide by one two then three four what is six six times two twelve and six times three eighteen six times four twenty four do we get do we get another one four times three twelve four times two eight six times four so that's all 24 what about 30 1 2 3 it's not divisible by 4 5 6 seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen so two times three six six times five thirty do we get 15 15 and 30 now see the highest one what's the highest common one six is the highest common one that's all so highest common factor is six 60 72 so we can find out all factors of 60 1 two and three it's divisible by four as well four five 6 what is 7 0 8 9 10 yes 10 is a factor 12 what else 12 times 5 13 14 15 is a factor 15 times 4 then 30 and 60 factors of 72 1 2 three if you can't figure out it's easy to do this way and find out okay so two three then four six what is eight you can multiply and see what are the other factors 
,8 9 9 times 2 18 is a factor but before that four four times three twelve what else six six times two twelve nine nine times two eighteen then 4 4 times 3 12 12 times 2 24 36 36 times 2 and 72. now what's the common one and the highest highest common factor look at carefully and see what's the highest one 24 not that 18 12 12 is this that's the highest one so that's the highest common factor so hcf is 12 this is not easy this way is the hardest one to find out the all factors and then find 
,the highest one it's easy to find out taking separate factors four and five four what are the factors one two and four five one and five so what's the highest one that's one highest common factor is one here 72 we did that before we do 96 divide by 2. divided by 2 again divide by 2 2 again and finally with 3. so what are the factors of 96 one two three four six then eight what else three four five six eight twelve twenty-four three times two six six times two twelve twelve times two twenty-four twenty-four times two forty-eight ninety-six did we miss anything 32 we missed that 32 16 we miss that and 16 times 3 it's 48 it's there now see from 72 this and it is what's the highest common factor 24 24 is there 72 32 is not there so 24 here and 24 here so highest common factor is 24 there now we'll do the last part 54 
,and 35 so 54 divided and see 2 times 2 4 7 and then you get 9 3 3. so what are the factors of 54 1 2 3 and then 2 times 3 6 9 then 9 times 2 18. what is 3 times 3 9 
,9 times 3 27 and then 54 times 1. check again 6 9 we wrote 9 times 2 18 yeah and 35 what are the factors of 35 1 and it's divisible by 5 7 and 35 only few factors are there so what's the highest one out of these 1 5 is not there 7 not there 35 so what's the highest common factor for these two that's only one so highest common factor is one look at question number three find the highest common factor of each pair of numbers by writing each number as a product of its prime factors so this is 
,the easiest way to find out the highest common factor so 24 you divide and see you get 2 times 6 again divide by 2 so you can write 2 times 2 times 2 times 3 36 how 
,can you write 2 times 18 9 3 times 3 2 times 2 times three times three so what's the common one two two three so what's the highest common factor two times two times three you get 4 times 3 12 45 3 times 50 3 times 5 and 5. so what are the prime factors of forty-five three three and five fifty-four you can divide by two you can 
,divide by three and another three finally from three again two times three times three times three now see the common factors three is common another three is common that's all so highest common factor is three times three that's nine thirty two forty eight 32 we know that 2 times 2 4 4 times 2 8 8 times 2 16 16 times 2 32 48 2 
,then you get 24 again divide by 2 12 divide by 2 6 divide by 2 again that's three you get three so what are the common factors two two two two so two four times so highest common factor is 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 that's 16 48 so 48 we have already done we can take that one two fours you get two four times and then 3. now we'll take 72 divide by 2 you get 36 36 divided by 2 18. 18 divided by 2 9 9 you can write 3 and 3. now what are the common factors 2 another 2 2 again and one three so what's the highest common factor two times two four four times two eight eight times three twenty four 18 and 36 18 how can you write 2 that's 9 3 and 3 36 divided by 2 you get 18. 18 divided by 2 again 9. 9 is 3 times 3. so what's the highest common factor you get 2 and three and another three so two times three six six times three eighteen so highest common factor is 80. find the highest common factor by any method you like so which one is the easiest using separate factors that's the easiest way to find out highest common factor eighteen you can write two times three times three twelve six six you can write two times three fifteen three times five now find out the common ones three so highest common factor is three twelve eighteen twenty four two six is two times three eighteen divided by two nine nine is three 
,times three twenty-four divided by two twelve twelve divided by two six six you can write two and three so what's the highest common factor here two is common three 
,is common two times three that's six 24 32 48 divided by 2 12. divided by 2 6 divided by 2 and 3. 32 we know that 2 5 times 48 divided by 2 you get 24 divided by 2 you get 12. divide by 2 you get 6 2 and 3. so what's the highest common factor 2 another 2 another 2 3 is not common so 2 times 2 times 2 that's 8. this one 18 27 36 
,2 times 9 9 is 3 times 3 27 3 3 times 36 divided by 2 18 divided by 2 9 9 is 3 times 3 what's the highest common factor 1 3 is common another 3 is common here that's all 3 times 3 that's 9. question number five a basket contains 96 apples and another basket contains 60 oranges 96 apples and 60 oranges if these fruits are to be packed into bags such that there is an equal number of apples in every bag and an equal number of oranges too in every bag and no fruits remain after they are packed 
,into the bags what is the maximum number of such bags that can be prepared so that means highest common factor of 96 and 60. so we'll find out so 96 divided by 2 you get 48 divide by 2 again 24. divided by 2 again 12 divided by 2 we get 6 that means 2 times 3. 60 divided by 2. 30. 30 divided by 2 15 15 divide by 3 get 5 then divide by 5 you get 60. so what's the highest common factor of these two numbers two two three two two three four times three twelve so that means we can make 12 bags so in one bag how many apples 96 divided by 12 what's the number eight eight apples and 60 divided by 12 you get five five oranges you can keep five oranges so how many bags twelve bags each 8 apples and 5 oranges example number 1 find the lowest common multiple of 8 6 and 16. how we find out the lowest common multiple we'll first find out all factors and see which one is the lowest eight how can you write 2 times 2 times 2 i can write 2 to the power 3 6 2 times 3 2 to the power 1 and 3 to the power 1 16 2 4 times so when you're finding lowest common multiple you take the different numbers with maximum power when you take 4 when you take 2 2 to the power 4 is the maximum what else 3 only once so the lowest common multiple is 2 to the power 4 is 16 times 3 48 so that's 48 now we'll use another method second method we can write 8 6 16 in a row and divide divide by 2 divide by 2 again here 3 you can't divide you write as it is divide by 2 again and divide by 2 till you get 1 you 
,have to divide divide by 3 so you get 1 1 1 now we multiply all these numbers that's the lowest common multiple 2 times 1 2 3 4 and 3. so you get the same answer 16 
,times 3 48 as the lowest common multiple example number two two bells ring at interval of six minutes and eight minutes respectively if they both ring together at eight a.m what time they will ring together again so we'll take all multiples of 6 first 6 12 18 24 30 36 6 times 6 6 times 7 42 what are 6 times 7 6 times 8 48 like that those are multiples of 6 multiples of 8 8 16 24 8 times 4 32 8 times 8 times 5 40 so like that now what's the common one when you look at carefully can you see 24 is the next common one so that means after 24 minutes it will ring again so 24 minutes that means what's the time 8 24 so it will ring at 8 24 8 now same thing second method so you need to find out the lowest common multiple of 6 and 8. so how we find out the lowest common multiple of 6 and 8 we write down like this divide by 
,2 divide by 2 again here 2 again and 3. till you get 1 you divide and multiply these two so lowest common multiple is 2 times 2 times 2 times 3 8 times 3 24 this is 
,in minutes so 8 plus 24 minutes means 8 24 it will ring again exercise 4.7 find the lowest common multiple of each of the following triples of numbers we can take at once and find out the lowest common multiple divide by 2 divide by 2 again divide by 2. divided by 3 and finally again by 3 so what's the lowest common multiple 2 times 2 4 4 times 2 8 8 times 3 24 24 times 3 3 times 4 12 1 remaining 3 times 2 6 plus 1 seventy two now this one eighteen eight fourteen and twenty eight divide by 
,two divide by 2 again divide by 2 and divide by 7. until you get 1 you have to divide so what's the lowest common multiple 2 times 2 times 2 8 8 times 7 you get 56 is the lowest common multiple 20 30 40. you can divide by 2 divided by two again divide by two divide by three and finally divide by 5 get all once so what's the lowest common multiple 2 times 2 4 4 times two eight five times three fifteen so eight times fifteen eight times five forty eight times one eight plus four twelve so hundred twenty nine twelve twenty seven you can divide by two divide by two again now you can divide by 3 3 again and 3 again so what's the lowest common multiple two times two four four times three twelve three times three nine twelve times nine hundred eight two three five you can divide by two divide by three and divide by five 
,so what's the lowest common multiple two times three times five six times five thirty thirty six 54 24 divide by 2 80 divide by 2 7 divided by 2 here 12 again divide by 2. can divide by 2 again i'll divide by 3. divide by 3 again and three again till you get one now what's the lowest common multiple two times two four four times two eight eight times three twenty four and three times 9. 9 times 4 36 3 remaining 9 times 2 18 plus 3 21. so the lowest common multiple is 216. question number two at a military function three cannons are fire at intervals of 12 seconds 16 seconds and 18 seconds respective if the three cannons are fired together initially after how many seconds will they will be they all be fired together again so how many seconds so that means we need to find out the lowest common multiple in seconds so we'll find out the lowest common multiple of 12 16 and 18. divide by two divide by two again divide by two divide by two divide by three and three again so what's the lowest common multiple two times two four four times two eight eight times two sixteen and three times three nine nine times 9 times 6 54 5 remaining 9 times 1 9 
,plus 5 that's 14. so after again 144 seconds again you can see the three can again three cannons at the same time miscellaneous exercise without dividing determine whether the number 30 35 343 is divisible by 3. how we find out digital root 3 plus 5 8 8 plus 3 11 11 plus 4 15 15 plus 3 18 means 1 plus 8 9. so digital root is 9. 
,so that's divisible by three four last two digits not divisible by four so that means not divisible by 4 what about 6 how we identify whether it's divisible by 6 it 
,should be an even number so this is not an even number so not divisible by 6 and 9 digital root is 9 so that's divisible by 9 as well fill in the blanks the highest 
,common factor of 2 and 3 what's the highest common factor there's no common factor so we write only one the lowest common factor of 4 and 12 what's the lowest common multiple of 4 and 12. you can find out 3 times 2 6 6 times 2 12 that's the highest number the highest common factor of two prime numbers is so like this always when you get two prime factors highest common factor is always one the lowest common multiple of two three and five two three again and five two times three six six times five thirty find the highest common factor and lowest common multiple of twelve 42 and 75 so we'll use the factor method because for highest common factor anyway we need the factors 12 2 times 6 6 you get 2 times 3 42 divide by 2 21 3 and 7. divide by 3 you get 25 that's 5 and 5. highest common factor we just see what's highest common ones only three lowest common multiple we can write down two twice and three ones here here two ones three ones and seven ones here you get three ones and five twice so for lowest common multiple you take different numbers with the highest power 2 when you take 2 to the power 2 is the highest 3 just 3 to the power 1 5 5 to the power 2 is the highest and you get 7 to the power 1. now multiply 4 4 times 3 12. 5 times 5 25 and 7. so 12 times 7 we'll multiply these two 84 times 25 what's 84 times 20 5 20 and 5 00 or 8 16. five times four twenty five times eight forty plus two forty two two thousand 100 is the lowest common multiple it is proposed 
,to distribute books among 45 students in a class such that each student receives no less than 5 books and no more than 10 books if this is 5 books what's the if this is 5 books how many books all together 45 into 5 225 and it is no more than 10 books if it's 10 how many books are there 400 so the number of books should be in between 225 and 450 but that should be divisible by 45 because there are 45 students so what's the lowest number it can be 225 then add 45 to that okay 10 7 270 then add 45 again 350 45 again 360. another 45 405 another 45 450 so the number of books can be in between 225 and 450 you can get any number here so we covered the second 
,part of chapter 4 in this lesson and what did we do we identify what are prime numbers and highest common factor lowest common multiple so we explained several methods to identify highest common factor and the lowest common multiple so you can choose the easiest one to solve problems
,
0IZyGB1qQmM,today let us revise factors and multiples let us start with factors what do we mean by a factor a factor of a number divides that number exactly let us look at an example find the factors of 58 the first pair is 1 into 50 8 is equal to 58 here when we divide 58 by 1 we get the quotient as 58 and when we divide 58 by 58 we get the quotient as 1 in both the cases the remainder is 0 thus it means that 58 is divisible by 1 and 58 the second pair of numbers which gives the product 58 is 2 into 29 thus the factors of 58 are 1 to 29 and 58 let us solve one more example find the factors of 81 the pairs of numbers which give the product a t1r1 into 81 is equal 
,to 81 3 into 27 is equal to 81 9 into 9 is equal to 81 thus the factors of 81 are 1 3 9 27 and 81 as each of these number divides 81 exactly did you notice we counted the repeated factor only once remember every number has 1 as a factor every number is a factor of itself thus every number except one has at least two factors one 
,and the number itself the factor of a number is always equal to or less than the number now let us look at multiples a multiple of a number is the product obtained when the number is multiplied by the same or any other number let us find the multiples of 12 it is easy when we multiply 12 by zero one two three four five six seven eight nine ten and so on we get 0 12 24 36 48 60 70 to 80 for 96 108 120 and so on as the products so here the products obtained are nothing else but the multiples 
,of 12 let us look at another example find the multiples of 19 when we multiply 19 by 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and so on we get 0 1938 5770 695 114 133 152 171 190 and 
,so on thus the multiples of 19 are 0 1938 5770 695 114 133 152 171 190 and so on remember a number is a multiple of itself every number is a multiple of one every multiple of a given number is equal to or greater than the number itself every number has an infinite number of multiples zero is a multiple of every number but zero is not a factor of any number except zero revising factors and multiples was fun you
,
qc8LHRMs6FQ,today we will learn about factors first let us understand what we mean by the factor of a number let us take the number 12 to begin with let us find out the pairs of numbers that give 12 as their product 1 into 12 is equal to 12 2 into 6 is equal to 12 3 into 4 is equal to 12 so we get 3 pairs of numbers that give us the product 12 no other pair of numbers when multiplied will give the product 12 now let us take each pair of number separately and understand what it means let us take the first pair 1 into 12 is equal to 12 here when we divide 12 by 1 we get the quotient as 12 and when we divide 12 by 12 we get the quotient as 1 in both the cases the remainder is 0 thus it means that 12 is divisible by 1 and 12 pair to 2 into 6 is equal to 12 here when we divide 12 by 2 we get the quotient as 6 and if we divide 12 by 6 we get the quotient as 2 in both the cases the remainder is 0 thus it means that 12 is divisible by 2 and 6 pair 3 3 into 4 is equal to 12 here if we divide 12 by 3 we get the quotient as 4 and if we divide 12 by 4 we get the quotient as 3 here also we get the remainder as 0 in both the divisions thus it means that 12 is divisible by 3 and 4 thus we now understand that 12 is divisible by 1 2 3 4 6 and 12 hence we see that the numbers 1 2 3 4 6 and 12 are the factors of 12 hence we can define factor of a number as a number which exactly divides the given number or we can see that factors are numbers you can multiply together to get given number now 
,let us look at certain points which we need to understand related to a factor with the help of some examples point 1 1 is a factor of every number look at the examples 1 into 6 is equal to 6 8 divided by 1 is equal to 8 thus 1 multiplied by any number gives the number itself as the product and any number divided by 1 also gives 
,the number itself as the quotient hence we conclude that 1 is a factor of every number point to every number is a factor of itself we know that 6 into 1 is equal to 
,6 8 divided by 8 is equal to 1 thus any number multiplied by 1 gives the number itself as the product and any number divided by itself gives 1 as the quotient hence 
,every number is a factor of itself 3 the factor of a number is always less than or equal to the number look at the factors of 12 which we found out earlier they are 
,1 2 3 4 6 and 12 note that the factors 1 2 3 4 & 6 are less than 12 and the last factor 12 is equal to 12 thus it shows that the factor of a number is always less than or equal to the number for every number except one has at least two factors one and the number itself let us look at the factors of 7d are one and seven no other 
,pair of numbers when multiplied together will give the product seven that is the number seven has at least two factors one and seven that is number one and the number seven itself hence we can see that every number except one has at least two factors one and the number itself do remember these points properly they will help you 
,to find the factors as we go further now let us find the factors of one more number let us take the number 30 the pairs of numbers which give the product 30 are 1 into 30 is equal to 30 2 into 15 is equal to 33 into 10 is equal to 30 5 into 6 is equal to 30 thus the factors of 30 are 1 2 3 5 6 10 15 and 30 now look at these factors and remember these points 1 a factor of a number exactly divides that number to one is a factor of every number three every number is a factor of itself for the 
,factor of a number is always less than or equal to the number five every number except one has at least two factors one and the number itself wasn't it easy to learn about factors why don't you try to find the factors of some numbers yourself

lzXv84rO9JI,today let us learn about the highest common factor also called 8 CF we have already studied factors now let us understand the meaning of the term common factor if two or more numbers have the same numbers as their factors those factors are called common factors now let us see what do we mean by the highest common factor to understand it in a better way let us solve an example find the 8 CF of 15 and 25 we will follow a three-step process to find the highest common factor step 1 find all the factors of the given numbers here the pairs of factors of number 15 are 1 into 15 is equal to 15 3 into 5 is equal to 15 thus the factors of 15 are 1 3 5 and 15 next are the pairs of factors of the number 25 1 into 25 is equal to 25 5 into 5 is equal to 25 thus the factors of 25 are 1 5 and 25 step 2 identify the common factors of the given numbers here the factors of numbers 15 and 25 ar-15 step 3 the largest of the common factors is the H CF of the given numbers here the largest of the common factors is 5 thus the highest common factor is 5 hence we define the highest common factor as the largest common factor that two or more numbers have now let us solve one more example find the 8 CF of 6 12 and 18 here the pairs of factors of number 6 are 1 into 6 is equal to 6 2 into 3 is equal to 6 thus the factors of 6 are 1 2 3 & 6 the pairs of factors of the number 12 are 1 into 12 is equal to 12 2 into 6 is equal to 12 3 into 4 is equal to 12 thus the factors of 12 are 1 2 3 4 6 
,and 12 the pairs of factors of the number 18 are 1 into 18 is equal to 18 2 into 9 is equal to 18 into six is equal to 18 thus the factors of 18 are 1 2 3 6 9 and 18 here the common factors of numbers 6 12 and 18 are 1 2 3 & 6 here the largest of the common factor is 6 thus h CF is 6 did you notice that one particular number is 
,a common factor for all the numbers do you know which number is that yes 1 is a common factor of all the numbers wasn't it easy finding the highest common factor or 
,HCF you

41eVMYPCWTQ,today let us learn prime and composite numbers before we begin let us understand what do we mean by natural numbers the set of numbers 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and so on are 
,called natural numbers natural numbers can be divided into prime numbers and composite numbers before we proceed ahead remember that any given number will always have one and itself as its factors now let us start with prime numbers look at the examples the factors of 3 are 1 and 3 the factors of 11 are 1 and 11 the factors of 17 are 1 and 17 all these numbers have only two factors one and the number itself such numbers are called prime numbers thus prime numbers are natural numbers that have only two factors one and the number itself composite numbers look at the examples the factors of 6 are 1 2 3 & 6 the factors of 14 are 1 2 7 and 14 the factors of 20 are 1 2 5 10 and 20 all the above numbers have more than two factors these numbers are called composite numbers thus composite numbers are natural numbers that have more than two factors remember these points one is neither prime nor composite as it has only one factor two is the smallest and the only even prime number three is the smallest odd prime number now why don't you list all the prime and composite numbers from 1 to 100

CIkDcENjzBA,today let us learn about the least common multiple or you can call it LCM to let us understand the meaning of the term common multiple when two or more numbers have 
,the same numbers as their multiples those multiples are said to be common multiples now let us see what do we mean by the least common multiple the least common multiple of two or more numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of those numbers to understand it in a better way let us solve an example find the least common multiple of 5 and 10 we will follow a three-step process to find the least common multiple step 1 list the multiples of all the given numbers the multiples of 5 are 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 and so on the multiples of 10 are 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 and so on step 2 identify the common multiples of all the given numbers the common 
,multiples of 5 and 10 are 10 20 30 40 and so on step 3 right the least common multiple of all the given numbers here the least common multiple is 10 thus LCM is 10 which is the smallest number of the common multiples now let us solve one more example find the LCM of 6 8 and 12 the multiples of 6 are 6 12 18 24 30 36 42 48 54 60 
,and so on next the multiples of 8 are 8 16 24 32 40 48 56 64 72 80 and so on finally the multiples of 12 are 12 24 36 48 60 70 to 80 for 96 108 120 and so on here the common multiples of 6 8 and 12 are 24 and 48 and so on thus LCM is 24 now kids I am sure all of you must be wondering why we did not list 0 as a multiple for any of the numbers that is because we do not consider 0 when we have to find the LCM as otherwise the LCM of all the numbers would always be 0 remember kids it is important to learn the tables to find the multiples and the least common multiple

CqrYYiffPr0,good morning students today let us study the rules of divisibility these rules will help us determine whether a number is divisible by another number without actually carrying out the division process let us have a look at different divisibility tests divisibility by two if the number is even that is it ends in two four six eight or zero we say that the given number is divisible by two for example 26 ends in 6 thus it is divisible by 2 divisibility by 3 if the sum of the digits of the number is divisible by three we say that the given number is divisible by three for example look at the number 384 when we add up all the digits that is three plus eight 
,plus four we get the sum as fifteen we know that 15 is divisible by three thus we conclude that 384 is divisible by three divisibility by 4 if the number formed by the last two digits of the given number is divisible by four we see that the given number is divisible by four for example look at the number 164 its last two digits 
,"form the number 64 which is divisible by 4 thus the whole number 164 is divisible by 4 divisibility by 5 if the number ends in 5 or 0 we say that the given number is divisible by 5 for example 525 ends in 5 thus it is divisible by 5 look at this another example 330 ends in 0 hence it is also divisible by 5 divisibility by 6 if the number is divisible by both 2 and 3 we see that the given number is divisible by 6 for example look at the number 408 is it divisible by 2 the number ends in 8 thus it is divisible by 2 is it divisible by 3 4 plus 0 plus 8 is equal to 12 which is divisible by 3 which makes the number 408 divisible by 3 as well hence 408 is divisible by 6 divisibility by 8 if the number formed by the last three digits of the given number is divisible by 8 we see that the given number is divisible by 8 for example look at the number 50 3888 its last three digits form the number 8 on eighty-eight which is divisible by 8 thus 53,000 888 is divisible by 8 divisibility by nine if the sum of the digits of the number is divisible by nine we see that the given number is divisible by nine for example look at the number seven lakh twenty "
,nine thousand six hundred thirty-nine here on adding the digits seven two nine six three and nine we get the sum as 36 which is divisible by nine thus seven lakh twenty nine thousand six hundred thirty-nine is also divisible by nine finally let us look at divisibility by ten if the number ends in a zero we say that the given number is divisible by ten for example 8620 ends in zero thus it is divisible by ten kids now it is time for you to remember all these divisibility tests and find out the answer
,
dWhavMeUi5E,divisibility today let us revise and learn few more divisibility tests a number is divisible by another number if the conditions required are met let us understand these conditions better with examples divisibility by two if the number is even that is it ends in two four six eight or zero we say that the given number is divisible by two for example 26 ends in 6 thus it is divisible by two divisibility by three if the sum of the digits of the number is divisible by three we say that the given number is divisible by three for example look at the number 384 when we add up all the digits that is three plus eight plus four we get the sum as fifteen we know 
,"that 15 is divisible by three thus we conclude that 384 is divisible by three divisibility by four if the number formed by the last two digits of the given number is divisible by four we see that the given number is divisible by four for example look at the number 160 for its last two digits form the number 64 which is divisible by four thus the whole number 164 is divisible by four divisibility by five if the number ends in five or zero we say that the given number is divisible by five for example 525 ends in five thus it is divisible by five look at this another example 330 ends in zero hence it is also divisible by five divisibility by six if the number is divisible by both 2 and 3 we see that the given number is divisible by 6 for example look at the number 408 is it divisible by 2 the number ends in 8 thus it is divisible by 2 is it divisible by 3 4 plus 0 plus 8 is equal to 12 which is divisible by 3 which makes the number 408 divisible by 3 as well hence 408 is divisible by 6 divisibility by 7 take the last digit of the number double and subtract it from the rest of the digits if the difference is divisible by seven then the number is divisible by seven for example look at the number 672 firstly double the last digit 2 that is 2 plus 2 is equal to 4 now subtract 4 from 67 so we get 63 here the number 63 is divisible by 7 thus we say 672 is divisible by 7 kids repeat the process for larger numbers for example let us take a larger number 3934 double the last digit 4 to get 8 and subtracted from 393 which is 385 now again double 5 to get 10 and subtracted from 38 which is equal to 28 we know that 28 is divisible by 7 so the number 3934 is divisible by 7 divisibility by 8 if the number formed by the last three digits of the given number is divisible by 8 we see that the given number is divisible by 8 for example look at the number 50 3888 its last three digits form the number 888 which is divisible by 8 thus 53,000 888 is divisible by 8 divisibility by 9 if the sum of the digits of the number is divisible by 9 we see that the given number is divisible by 9 for example look at the number 7 lakh 29,000 639 "
,"here on adding the digits 7 2 9 6 3 & 9 we get the sum as 36 which is divisible by 9 thus 7 lakh twenty nine thousand six hundred thirty-nine is also divisible by nine let us look at divisibility by ten if the number ends in a zero we say that the given number is divisible by 10 for example 8620 ends in zero thus it is divisible by 10 next is divisibility by 11 a number is divisible by 11 if the difference of the sums of the alternate digits is 0 or a multiple of 11 for example look at number 3729 here by adding the alternate digits 7 & 9 we get the sum as 16 and 3 plus 2 is equal to 5 now the difference between the two sums that is 16 minus 5 is equal to 11 therefore the number 3729 is divisible by 11 let us take one more example number four thousand five hundred seventy six we add the digits four plus seven to get 11 and 5 plus 6 gives 11 here the difference between the two Psalms is zero hence the number 4570 6 is divisible by 11 divisibility by 12 a number is divisible by 12 if it is divisible by both 3 & 4 for example look at the number for lack 79,000 628 here by adding the digits 4 plus 7 plus 9 plus 6 plus 2 plus 8 we get the sum as 36 36 is divisible by 3 thus we see 4 lakh 79,000 628 is divisible by 3 and the last two digits form the number 28 which is divisible by 4 thus we see four lakh "
,seventy-nine thousand six hundred twenty-eight is divisible by four also therefore four lakh seventy-nine thousand six hundred twenty-eight is divisible by 12 lastly divisibility by fifteen a number is divisible by 15 if it is divisible by both three and five for example look at the number five lakh sixty thousand nine hundred fifty-five here by adding the digits five plus six plus 0 plus nine plus five plus five we get the sum as thirty thirty is divisible by three therefore we see five lakh sixty thousand nine hundred fifty five is divisible by three also the number ends in five thus five lakh sixty thousand nine hundred fifty five is even divisible 
,by five hence five lakh sixty thousand nine hundred fifty five is divisible by 15 kids now you can use these divisibility tests while dividing numbers

qd9zBIl_iE0,h CF by successive division method continued division method today let us learn h CS by successive division method which is also called as the continued division method before that let us revise 8zf by prime factorization method with an example find the 8 CF of 80 96 and 108 step 1 find the prime factorization of each number so 
,we get 80 is equal to 2 into 2 into 2 into 2 into 5 96 is equal to 2 into 2 into 2 into 2 into 2 into 3 lastly 108 is equal to 2 into 2 into 3 into 3 into 3 step to 
,underline the common factors occurring in all the numbers here the common factors are 2 & 2 step three find the product of the common factors to get the HCF therefore 8 CF is equal to 2 into 2 is equal to 4 now we can also write the prime factorization using the index form let us see how a t is equal to 2 raised to the power of 
,4 into 5 96 is equal to 2 raised to the power of 5 into 3 108 is equal to 2 squared into 3 cubed now underline the common base in all the three numbers which is two 
,finally we take the base with the minimum par as 8 CF which is 2 squared is equal to 4 now let us see how to find 8 CF by the successive division method also known as the continued division method find the 8 CF of 34 + 85 step 1 divide the bigger number by the smaller number so here we divide 85 by 34 34 into 2 is equal to 68 now here subtract 68 from 85 to get the remainder 17 step 2 the remainder becomes the divisor and the previous divisor becomes the dividend thus here 17 becomes the divisor and the previous divisor that is 34 becomes the dividend step 3 continue this process till you get 0 as the remainder here 17 into 2 is equal to 34 34 minus 34 we get 0 as the remainder step 4 last divisor is the H CF here the last divisor is 17 therefore 8 CF is 17 hence the 8 CF of 34 + 85 is 17 let us solve another example by successive division method find the 8 CF of 125 175 and 225 step 1 arrange the numbers in increasing order here the numbers are already arranged in the increasing order step to carry out successive division for the first two numbers and find their 8 CF here the first two numbers are 125 and 175 so we perform the division 
,between them we know 125 into 1 is equal to 125 175 - 125 gives the remainder 50 now here 50 becomes the divisor and 125 becomes the dividend we know 50 into 2 is equal to 100 125 minus 100 gives 25 now 25 becomes the divisor and 50 becomes the dividend 95 into 2 is equal to 50 50 minus 50 is equal to zero here we got the remainder as 0 the divisor we get at the end is the 8 CF which is 25 here therefore the 8 CF of 125 and 175 is 25 step 3 now carry out successive division for the 8 CF of 
,the first two numbers and the third number that is 225 divided by 25 here on dividing 225 by 25 we get the last divisor as 25 hence 8 CF of 125 175 and 225 is 25 remember one if two numbers do not have any common factor other than one then their 8 CS is 1 to the 8 CF of 2 numbers of which one is the multiple of the other is the 
,smaller number kids do not get jumbled up while you find the 8 CF by the continued division method have fun

yJ-T8z2-Zg4,factors for the first time in this short tutorial you will find out what factors are and how to find factors using multiplication factors are whole numbers that you 
,multiply together to get another number so in this example two times five is ten the factors are two and five you will often be given a number and told to list all its factors well you could just think of any numbers that multiply together to give 12 in this example but a better plan is to use the same simple way every time take a look the first thing you do is find the simplest way of multiplying to 12 and you start with 1 so 1 and the number itself are always the first factors you list right the factors down in pairs 1 here and 12 over here we will fill in the space between with other factors as we go along for each factor pair use an arc to show which factors multiply together it helps keep your thinking clear and stops you from accidentally forgetting to write a factor down ok now you try 2 times number to make 12 well 2 times 6 is 12 list the 2 and the 6 and put the arc in then 3 times a number 3 times 4 is 12 list the 3 and the 4 put the arc in 3 & 4 are consecutive numbers so we know we finish because there's no whole number between those two we've just found all the factors of 12 notice that because we worked from the outside in 
,the factors are in order this is the clearest way of showing all the factors of a number and using the arc for each factor pair shows you're thinking we'll do one more example we'll find the factors of 16 start with one and the number itself 1 + 16 use the ark now go to to two times number well 2 times 8 is 16 what about three times a number is three a factor well 3 times 5 is 15 we can't get to 16 3 is not a factor of 16 now 4 times a number 4 times 4 is 16 when a number is multiplied by itself like before times 4 we just put it in the factor listing once without any ark and there are no more factors we found them all when you're listing all the factors of a number remember always start with 1 and the number itself with a good space between then using multiplication try 2 times 3 times 4 times 5 times a number and up and when your numbers meet in the middle you have finished always use the arc to show your thinking and now it's your turn to practice have fun with this and become fantastic at factors created using powtoon

fZFwHpiAVE0,let's understand the concept of multiplication with the help of these little fish there are four fish bowls there are two fish in each Bowl to get the total number of fish we add the number of fish in all the four bowls that is two plus two plus two plus two is equal to eight there are eight fish in all here we repeatedly added 
,to four times this is called multiplication operation multiplication is repeated addition we can do this multiplication operation in an easier way let's see how there are four fish bowls each bowl has two fish in it now four times two is eight so there are eight fish in all let us use the multiplication symbol to write this statement this is called the multiplication sentence it can be read as 4 multiplied by 2 is 8 4 times 2 is 8 or 4 twos are eight now let's look at another example there 
,are three bird houses there are five birds in each birdhouse how many birds are there in all to get the total number of birds we add the number of birds in all the three bird houses that is five plus five plus five is equal to 15 that is three times five is fifteen using the multiplication sign we write it as 3 multiplied by 5 is 15 so there are 15 birds in all now let's look at the ways to write multiplication this is called horizontal multiplication this is called vertical multiplication 
,certain terms are also used for the numbers in a multiplication sentence the number that is multiplied by another number is called multiplicand the number by which another number is multiplied is called the multiplier the number obtained by multiplying two numbers is called the product let's look at one more example there are two leaves there are five ladybugs on each leaf how many ladybugs are there in all here by adding we get five plus five is equal to ten and by multiplying we get 2 multiplied by 5 is 10 hence there are 10 ladybugs in all hope it was fund alone the concept of multiplication with the fish birds and ladybugs you

tER-YslAY-8,hello friends I am Ola today I will teach you the relation between multiplication and division before we start let us revise the terms used in multiplication and division look at the example 5 into 4 is equal to 20 here the numbers which are multiplied are called the factors so in this example the numbers 5 & 4 are the factors the number obtained by multiplying the two factors is called the product and number 20 is the product here now look at the division example 20 divided by 4 is equal to 5 here the number to be divided is called the dividend here number 20 is the dividend the number that divides another number is called the divisor the divisor here is number 4 finally the answer we get on dividing the numbers is called the quotient which is number 5 here now when we are clear about the terms studying the relation between the two operations multiplication and division will become simpler multiplication and division are very closely related let see how there are five boxes 
,and each box has three pencils in all how many pencils are there in five boxes to get the product we multiply the numbers 5 & 3 5 into 3 is equal to 15 now let us look at it in another way there are 15 pencils if each box can accommodate 3 pencils then how many boxes are needed for 15 pencils so here we need to divide 15 by 3 to find the quotient therefore 15 divided by 3 is equal to 5 given that there are 5 boxes and 15 pencils how many pencils are there in each box here we divide 15 by 5 
,to find the quotient so 15 divided by 5 is equal to 3 from the same example used we got to know an interesting fact about multiplication and division which is division is the inverse of multiplication that is when we divide the product with one of its factors the quotient that we get is the other factor now let us take another example look there are five kids each kid has nine balloons how many balloons are there in all with the five kids so here we multiply the numbers five and nine to get the answer so five into nine is equal to 45 if we look at the same example in a different way there are 45 balloons if each kid has nine balloons then find the number of kids such that the balloons are distributed equally here we need to divide 45 by nine to find the quotient we get 45 divided by 9 is equal to five now if there are five kids and forty five balloons in all how many balloons does each kid get here we divide 45 by five to find the quotient 45 divided by five is equal to nine 
,look here we got both multiplication and division facts from the same example woohoo Ola is great company to learn with

lRN63PPCnxs,prime factorization today let us revise prime factorization before that let us review prime and composite numbers a prime number is a natural number that has only two factors one and the number itself look at these examples the factors of 3 are 1 & 3 the factors of 11 are 1 and 11 the factors of 17 are 1 and 17 here you can see 
,these numbers have only two factors one and the number itself such numbers are called prime numbers a composite number is a natural number that has more than two factors look at these examples the factors of 6 are 1 2 3 & 6 the factors of 14 are 1 2 7 and 14 the factors of 20 are 1 2 5 10 and 20 here all the above numbers have more than two factors these numbers are called composite numbers kids remember one one is neither a prime nor a composite number - - is the only even prime number three two consecutive odd primes which differ by two are called twin primes examples three five five seven 11 13 17 19 for any two numbers that have only one as a common factor are called Co prime numbers examples 3 4 five nine eleven twenty now let us revise prime factorization when a number is expressed as a product of prime numbers it is called prime factorization let us solve an example Express eighty-four as the product of its prime factors by repeated division we always begin with the smallest prime number which divides the given number 84 is an even number so divide eighty-four by 2 to get 42 again divided 42 by two to get 21 now 21 can be divided 
,by three so divide 21 by three to get seven lastly divide seven which is a prime number by itself now we have one as a quotient let us write the answer thus the prime factorization of 84 is 2 into 2 into 3 into 7 which can also be written as 2 squared into 3 into 7 remember we always divide by the least prime number which can divide the given number to get prime factors today revising was so much fun

FslcXS-SJ4g,hello children today i'm here to teach you chapter 11 in your textbook that's factors and multiples so in this lesson we are finding factors and multiples of a whole number and we are trying to solve problems related to factors and multiples and examine where the whole number is divisible by 2 5 and 10. look at this one multiples of 2. you already know multiples of 2. so what are the multiples of 2 2 times 1 2 2 times 2 4 2 x 3 6 two times four eight two times five ten two times six twelve 
,two times seven fourteen two times eight sixteen two times nine eighteen 2 times 10 20. write down the last digit of the multiples of 2. so when you look at the last digit i see 0 what else 2 then 4 6 eight these are the last digit of the multiples of two these are even numbers if the last digit is an even number or 0 the number is divisible by 2 without a remainder because these are multiples of 2. so look at the last digit if the last digit is 0 or even number the number is divisible by 2 without a remainder multiples of five five times one five five times two ten five times three fifteen five times four twenty five times five twenty five five times 
,six thirty five times seven thirty-five five times eight forty five times nine forty-five and five times ten 50 now write down the last digit of the multiples of 5 when you look at the last digit you can see either 0 or 5. so if the last digit is 0 or 5 the number is divisible by 5 without a remainder so how we identify the whether a number is divisible by 5 look at the last digit if the last digit is 0 or 5 the number is divisible by 5 without a remainder multiples of 10 10 times 1 10 10 times 2 20. 10 times 3 30 10 times 4 40. 10 times 5 50 10 times 660 ten times seven seventy ten times eight eighty ten times nine ninety and ten times ten hundred look at the last digit zeros so how we find out whether a number is divisible by 10 look at the last digit if the last digit is 0 the number is divisible by 10 without 
,a remainder now underline the numbers that are divisible by 2 without a remainder so how we identify look at the last digit the last digit is 0 or even number the number is divisible by 2. so here this is 4 it's divisible by 2 without a remainder but this is odd number this is again even it's divisible here 0 it's possible and 7 is an odd number it's not divisible 9 also odd number 4 again yes it is an even number and 672 the last digit is an even number underline the numbers that are divisible by 5 without a remainder so if the last digit is 0 or 5 it is divisible so this one this one here this this one here these are the numbers that are divisible by 5 without a remainder 5 or 0 as the last digit underline the numbers that are divisible by 10 without a remainder so that means the last digit should be zero so 240 this number here possible this is possible and you can't take the other two underline the three digit numbers that are divisible by 2 5 and 10 without a remainder so what's the condition this should be an even number if it's divisible by 2 5 means either 0 or 5 but 10 only 0 that means if we want to find out a number that's divisible by 2 5 10 the last digit should be zero so we'll find out what are the numbers with last digit zero this is divisible this is divisible here it's divisible these are okay but other numbers you can't take give the reason that 360 is divisible by 2 5 and 10 without a remainder as 360 is an even number it is divisible by 2 as last digit is 0 it is divisible by 5 or 10. look at this one 10 20 30 40 50 those are multiples of 10 as last digit is 0 is it divisible by 2 yes because it said the last digit is 0 it's divisible by 2 so we say yes is it divisible by 5 yes last digit is 0 0 or 5 it is divisible by 5. is it divisible by 10 yes because the last digit is zero write down 10 multiples of 3 so starting from 3 times 1 three three times two six three times three nine three times four twelve three times five fifteen so three times six eighteen three times 7 21 24 so how many we need another 3 24 3 times so this is 3 times 8 3 times 9 27 3 times 9 27 and 3 times 10 30. so all together 10. now write down 10 multiples of 4 times table 4 times 1 4 4 times 2 8 4 times three twelve four times four sixteen four times five twenty four times six twenty-four four times seven twenty-eight four times eight thirty-two four times 9 36 and 4 times 10 40. write down the common multiples of 3 and 4 look at carefully what are the common numbers so i'll highlight those common terms can you see 12 then what are the other numbers 24 then according to this one that's all write down the lowest common multiple out of these common multiples what is the lowest one that's 12. look at this one write down 12 multiples of 4. so we write it again four 
,times one four times two four times three four times four four times five four times six four times seven four times eight four times nine four times nine and four times ten four times eleven and 4 times 12 so we need 12 multiples write down 10 multiples of 6 6 times 1 6 times 2 six times three six times four six times five six 
,times six six times seven six times eight six times nine and six times ten sixty so we need ten multiples of six write down the common multiples of 4 and 6 by looking at these factors you can write down common one what are the common ones i can see 12. then what's the next one 24 next one 36 and you get forty eight now write down the lowest common multiple out of this the lowest one is 12 now what are factors can we divide 18 mangoes between two three four five six friends without a remainder so we'll figure out eighteen when you divide by two you get nine so it's a whole number so you can divide then divide by 3 so we'll divide by 3 now 18 divided by 
,3 so you get 6 18 divided by 4 can you divide 4 times 4 16 and there's a remainder remainder two eighteen divided by five you get five times three fifteen remainder 
,3 18 divided by 6 you get 6 times 3. so can we divide 18 man goes between two yes three yes but you can't divide it by four can we divide it by five no but we can divide it by six numbers that are divisible without a remainder that's two three and six numbers that are not divisible without a remainder that's four and five if a number divisible by another number without a remainder then the second number is a factor of the first number so here we can say 2 is a factor and 9 is also a factor 
,3 is a factor 6 also a factor 6 is a factor and 3 also a factor now we found out 18 you can divide by 1 that's 80. divide by 2 that's 9. divide by 3 that's 6 divide 
,by 6 you get 3 divide by 9. you get 2 18 divided by 18 also possible you get 1 all are whole numbers without a remainder so those are called factors of 18. so what are the factors starting from 1 then you get 2 it's divisible by 3 is divisible by what are 6 9 and then 18. so we call these are factors of 18. look at carefully you see one and the number itself also a factor look at this number 12 we'll find out what are the factors we know 12 we can write 1 times 12. if you take 2 2 times 6 3 times 4 so 12 can be written as multiplication of two numbers all the whole numbers are called factors of twelve so all these numbers we call factors so what's the 
,lowest one one then two three 4 and what are 6 and 12. those are factors of 12 write down the set of factors of 36 so 36 i can write 1 times 36 36 is again 2 times what you can divide by 2 you get 2 times 18 three times divide by three you get 12 4 times 9 36 and 6 times 6. now what are the factors so you have to write or one two three four what else now six twice is there but we don't write six twice in the set only once so we can write 6 only once and then 9 12 18 and 36 so those are the 
,factors of 36 write down the set of factors of the following numbers factors of one one means one times one so just 1 factors of 2 1 times 2 or 2 times 1. so 1 and 2. factors of 3 1 times three three times one factors of four one two times two and four times one so one two four factors of five one times five and what about factors of six one two times three so 3 is there and 6 times 1 factors of 7 1 times 7 1 and 7 factors of 8 two times four so two four and then eight times one factors of 
,nine what are the factors of nine one three times three we only write once and nine times one factors of ten we can write one then five times two so two times 5 and 
,10 factors of 11 1 times 11 it's 1 and 11. and factors of twelve one times twelve two times six three times four and here two times six and 12 times 1. so these are 
,the factors of all these numbers now when you look at carefully always 1 and the number itself are the factors of any number so look at carefully 11 is there 12 is there 10. so 1 and the number itself is always a factor so what are the factors of 12 so if you can't figure out you can divide also two times six two times three three times one so what are the possible factors one two times six three times four so four is also yeah then six times two and then twelve times one factors of 12 factors of 18. when you divide by 2 you get 9. so 1 2. when you divide by 3 you get 3 times 6 then 3 times 6 then 6 also possible 2 times 9 so 9 is also possible and 18 
,times 1 18. so these are the factors of 80. some numbers have factors one and the number itself only look at these numbers two only one and two three is one and three five is one and five seven one and seven and eleven only 1 and 11 13 also 1 and 13 17 1 and 17 19 1 and 19 23 1 and 23 29 1 and 29 so these numbers we call as prime prime numbers so what are prime numbers the factors are only one and itself only two factors are there what is the number that only has factors of 1 and 31 that's 
,only 31 because 31 is a prime number what is the number that only has factors of 1 and 73 73 is a prime number that's 73. now we'll look at how we can solve problems using factors and multiples price of a pen is 16 rupees find the price of seven such pens so what we do we take the multiples of 7 multiples of 16. so price of 7 pence 16 times 7 so 7 times 6 42 4 remaining and 7 times 1 7 plus 4 11. so 112 rupees so what's the this answer that's the seventh multiple of 16. so 16 32 like that you take the seventh multiple of 16. fill in the blanks one kilo price is given for sugar what about the price for 3 kilos you multiply 115 multiplied by 3 3 times 5 
,15. 1 remaining so 3 times 1 three three plus one four three times one three three hundred and forty five rupees one kilo of flies seventy rupees what about four kilos you multiply 4 times 0 0 4 times 7 28 280 rupees now what about dal 1 kilo is 150 we need two and a half kilos so we can do separately if it's 150 for one kilo what about half a kilo we divide by 250 divided by 2 you get 75 and 2 kilos means you multiply by 2 150 times 2 you get 300. so 300 plus 75 you get 300 375. one kilo of rice is 80 rupees and what about 3 kilos multiplied by 3 3 times 0 0 3 times 8 24. what about this one 117 is 150 what about 3 so 3 times 150 zero three times five fifteen and three times one three plus one four four hundred fifty rupees now how we find out the total just add all these together five plus 5 10 1 remaining 5 5 8 13 13 plus 7 20 25 and 29 two remaining five plus two seven seven plus three ten ten plus four fourteen fourteen plus two sixty so thousand six hundred and ninety rupees is the total cost now this table shows 10 by 10 multiplication 10 by 10. using the table we can write the factors of twelve can you see three times eight three times eight twenty-four again four times six and 24 again six times four and eight times three so it shows some factors of 24 so what are the factors we can write all these numbers so it's 1 times that one not given here the table only shows 10 by 10 so up to 10. so factors of 24 by looking at this table we can see 3 four six eight three four six eight those are the factors we can get it from this table using the previous table show that the ways you get 18 so we'll look at 18 and see where you get 18 here 9 and 2 what else 18 is here eighteen is here and here that's all so two times nine two times nine then three times six six times three and nine times 2 6 times 3 9 times 2. so what are the factors of 18 using that table we get two three six nine two three six nine that's all we can see from that table now we'll look at the exercises and example in your textbook example one find the factors of 20 how we find out the factors of 20 so 20 i can write one times twenty then divide by two two times ten then can we divide by three four four times five five times four is also same six not possible seven not possible 8 9 10 10 times 2 so what 
,are the factors of 20 we can write down 1 2 what else 4 5 10 and 20. so those are the factors of 20 and remember zero is not a factor of a whole num exercise point one fill in the blanks with the appropriate whole numbers four i can write one times four what about two times two so one two and four are the factors of 4 look at 7 
,7 i can write 1 times 7 so what are the factors 1 and 7 this one 8 i can write 1 times 8 2 times 4 so what are the factors 1 2 4 and 8 are the factors of 8 15 one times fifty and i can write three times five so what are the factors here one three five and fifty twenty-four what are the factors one times twenty-four and two times twelve three times eight four times six so what are the factors 1 2 3 4 6 8 12 and 24 when the factors of 18 are written we obtain what are the factors of eighteen 
,one times eighteen two times nine and three times six so one two three six nine eighteen when the factors of forty are written so one times four t two times twenty then four times ten and five times four and eight times five so we can write eight also now look at question number two find the factors of each of the following numbers five five is a prime number so what are the factors one and 5 5 times 1 only 27 we can write 1 1 times 27 so 27 is also a factor so you can divide by 3 3 times 9. so 1 3 9 and then 27 so you can divide and 27 divided by 3 you get 9 divided by 3 you get 3 here so 3 with 9 and 9 with 3 and 27 so those are the factors of 27 17 
,is a prime number so what are the factors of 17 1 and the number itself 17. 22 so 1 is a factor 1 times 22 2 times 11 so you get 1 2 11 and 22 21 you can divide by 1 1 times 21 3 times 7 so that's all and 31 31 is a prime number so 1 and the number itself 31. thirty-two one times thirty-two two times sixteen four times eight then 2 times you get 16 and then 1 times 32 45 you get 1 this is divisible by 3 3 times 15 then 5 times 9 45 so 3 times 15 and then 1 times 45 so those are the factors 
,of 45 50. so what are the factors divide by one you get one times fifty two times twenty five five times ten ten times five and 2 times 25 and 1 times 50. 60 how can we find out factors 1 is always a factor two times thirty three times twenty four four times also possible sixty divide by four get four times one four for twenty that's five so fifty then six five also possible twelve times five then 6 times 10. now we'll write down the other numbers 5 times twelve so six times ten five times 
,twelve four times fifteen and three times twenty what does 3 times 20 and 2 times 30 and then 60. so those are the so those are the factors of 60. now we'll look at 
,example number one what are the factors of 72 that can be found using the above multiplication table so we'll look at the table and see how we get 72 where you get 72 1 is here and another one is here so 72 means 9 times 8 and 8 times 9 so i can write 72 is 9 times 8 or 8 times 9 so that means factors of 72 factors of 72 i can take a ten nine from the table example number two what are the factors of 18 that can be found using the above multiplication table 18 one is here another one is here this one what else this one so what are the possibilities two times nine then three times six 6 times 3 same and 9 times 2 same so from this table what are the factors of 18 i can write factors of 18 that's 2 3 6 9 exercise 11.2 what are the factors of each of the following numbers that can be found using the 10 by 10 multiplication table so we have to refer this table 48 where you get 48 1 2 so two possibilities so what are the factors i can write 6 8 that's all 6 and 8 81 here only one possibility nine times 9 so i can say 9 is a factor 2 this one this one that's all 2 into 1 2 into 1 so 1 and 2 28 this one what else here and that's all so 28 means 
,four and seven seven times four four and seven forty here and you'll get 40 here and here so 10 times 4 and what else 5 times eight so four five eight forty so four 
,five eight and ten so those are the factors of 40 from the table obtain different ways in which 36 can be written as a product of two whole numbers using the 10 times 10 tables and fill in the blanks 36 so we need to find out what are the possibilities we can get 36 check this one nine times four six times six and four times nine so six and six four and nine so nine and four four and nine six and six those are the three possibilities write down in ascending order the factors of 36 which can be obtained from the above products so ascending means smallest to highest so what's the smallest number that's four the next number is six and 9. so those are the 
,factors of 36 obtain different ways in which 9 can be written as a product of two numbers using 10 by 10 multiplication table and fill in the blanks nine one possibility is there so nine times one or one times nine what else nine is here three times three so those are the possibilities another one one times nine nine times 1 so 
,these are the possibilities so what are the factors if you are asking to write down the factors we can write 1 3 9 write down the different ways in which 30 can be written as a product of two whole numbers using 10 by 10 multiplication table thereby write down factors of 30 30 where you get 30 here and here what else so when you look at the table carefully you get three ways so three times ten oh five times six or 3 times 10 or 10 times 3 that's the same thing so what are the factors of 30. of 30 3 5 6 and 10 3 5 6 10. is 4 a factor of 9 explain the reason for your answer so 9 what are the possibilities here here and here so nine you can write three times three and 1 times 9 9 times 1 the same thing so is 4 is there 4 is not there so 4 is not a factor because you can't divide cannot divide by 4 without a remainder so when you divide you get a remainder so that's not a factor example number one find three factors of 30 by using the method of division thirty you can divide by one you get one times thirty thirty divided by two 2 times 50 30 divided by 3 3 times 10. so they're asking only 3 factors so you can write without writing 1 and the 
,number itself will take 2 3 10 so we need only 3 you can write 2 3 10 are factors of 30. example number 2 is 9 a factor of 12 explain the reason for answer so we'll 
,divide and see nine times one we'll do long division 9 times 1 9 and 3 is the remainder you get a remainder there so is 9 a factor of 12 it's not so you can write 9 
,is not a factor factor of 12 because we get a remainder three exercise 11.3 find three factors of each of the following numbers using the method of division 28 i can divide by two you get 40. again 28 i can divide by 4 7. so you need only three factors so i can write 2 4 7 and 14 also possible so i'll write 14 as well 32 32 i can divide by two you get 16. again 32 i can divide by 8 8 times 4 so what are the factors of 32 2 4 8 16 you can write 54 54 divided by 2 2 times 2 4 that's 7. then 20 again 54 divided by 6 6 times 9 54. so what are the factors of 54 i can write 2 6 9 54 27 90 i can divide by 2 that's 45 and i can divide this by 3 3 times 30. so 
,what are the factors 2 3 30 45 90 those are factors i'm only writing 3 21 i can divide by 3 i get 7 what is and 21 i can divide by 1 so 3 one so i can write 1 3 7 21 question number two is 6 a factor of 84 will divide and see 84 divide by 6 6 times 1 6 2 remaining for 24 that's 4 6 times 4 24 and the remainder is 0. so explain the answer by the method of division so we can say 6 is a factor of 84 because the remainder i'll write as remainder is 0. is 5 a factor of 48 explain the reason for 
,your answer so we'll divide and see 48 divided by five five times eight forty five times nine five times nine forty five and three remaining so the remainder is three we can write as remainder is three 5 is not a factor of 48. example number one check whether 14 is a multiple of 2 by dividing 14 by 2 2 times 7 14 and you get the remainder 0. so that means you can say check whether 14 is a multiple of 2 by dividing so 14 i can write two times seven so that's a multiple so you can write multiple of 2 of 2 by 7 is 40. check whether 42 is a multiple of 3 by dividing 42 by 3 3 times 1 3. for 12 that's 14. that's 4 three times four twelve and the remainder is zero so remainder is zero so you can write 42 is three times fourteen so that's the multiple exercise 11.4 write down 5 multiples of 2 which are greater than 10. so what are the multiples two times five ten two times six that's twelve two times seven fourteen two times eight sixteen two times nine eighteen and two times 10 20. so we need to write numbers greater than 10. write down 4 multiples of 3 between 1 and 20. multiples of 3 3 times 1 3 3 times 2 6 3 times 3 9 3 times 4 12. so 1 2 3 4 only 4 multiples write down all the multiples of 4 between 1 and 25 4 times 1 4 4 times 2 8 4 times 3 12 4 x 4 16 4 x 5 20 4 x 6 24 so those are the multiples of 
,4 in between 1 and 25 from the following numbers select and write down the multiples of 3. so multiples of 3 means it should be divisible 60 3 times 20. now we'll check 150 it's not divisible by 3 so we can show that 115 is not divisible 3 times 3 9 for 25 that's 8 24 and the remainder is 1. so it's not divisible 48 it's divisible just check 3 1 3 times 1 3 four eighteen that's six so you can write three times sixteen twenty six you can't divide by three 14 also not divisible by 27 we know 
,that that's three times nine so that's also a multiple of three how many multiples of nine are they are between one and hundred we'll check nine what else nine times two nine times three nine times four nine times five nine times six nine times seven nine times eight nine times nine nine times ten nine times eleven now how many 
,are there one two three 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 multiples are there of these numbers which is the greatest multiple of 9 what's the greatest one that's 99 so the greatest 
,multiple is 99 write down three multiples of 18 18 times one eighteen eighteen times two two times eight sixteen two times one two plus one is thirty six then multiply by three three times 8 24 2 remaining 3 times 1 3 plus 2 that's 5 54. what is the largest multiple of 9 which is less than 150 so we'll divide and see 150 divide 
,by 9 and see what's the number 9 times one nine so you get six for sixty nine times nine times six 54. that's the remainder is 6. so 9 times 16 is what that's the largest number you can get so 16 times 9 you get 9 times 6 54 5 remaining 9 times 1 9 plus 5 14. so 144 is the largest possible value now 9 times 654 9 times 1 9 plus 
,5. 14 so 144 is the largest multiple of nine write down five multiples of each of the following numbers four times one four times two four times three four times four four times five so we need five only thirteen times one thirteen times two thirteen times three thirteen times four four times three twelve four times one four plus one five then five five times three fifteen one remaining five times one five plus one six so those are the five fifteen fifteen times one fifteen times 2 30 15 times 3 45 you can add 15 to that 45 plus 15 or 4 times 15 that's 60 then 6 times 15 2 3 4 5 we'll do 5 first 5 times 5 25 2 remaining 5 times 1 5 plus 2 7. so 1 2 3 4 5 eighteen eighteen times one eighteen eighteen times two thirty six eighteen times three three times eight twenty-four three times one three three plus two five fifty-four then four four times eighteen thirty-two four times one four plus three seven one two three four we need another more one more five times eight forty five times one five plus four nine so ninety twenty twenty times one twenty times two twenty times three twenty times four 20 times 5 so add 20 to each number question number 9 fill in the blanks any multiple of 10 is necessarily a multiple of because last digit is 0 that means divisible by 2 and 10 means it's divisible by 5 as well 11 times 7 is 77 so therefore 77 is a multiple of 11 and of 7 7 times 11 or 11 times seven write down two numbers which are multiples of both three and four three times four twelve four times three twelve then multiples any multiple is possible so you can write 24 write down a number which is a multiple of 2 3 4. so you can take 
,12 or 24 so 12 is divisible by 2 so that means 2 times 6 three times four four times three so you can write 12 or 24 any number example number one there are 30 apples in a bag they are separated into bags such that each bag has an equal number of apples find out the number of apples in a bag and the number of bags in each instance the total number of apples is obtained by product of the number of apples in the bag and the number of bags hence we find out the number of bags and the number of apples in each bag by considering the products of two factors of thirty so one times thirty two times fifteen three times ten and five times six six times five ten 
,times three fifteen times two and 30 times 1. so accordingly there are 8 ways of grouping 30 uppers in the back containing the same number of apples 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8. bags with one apple in a bag and bags with two wrappers in a bag bags with three apples in a bag and bags with 6 10 15 30. so if there are bags with one apple how many bags are there so you get 30 bags 2 apples in a bag 2 times 15 you can make 15 bags and 3 apples in a bag you can make ten bags out of that and five times six so you get six bags six times five so five backs and ten ten times three so three bags you can create with three apples in each 50 apples in a bag you can take two bags and if there are 30 apples inside it only you can get one back exercise 11.5 the price of a ballpoint pen is 12 rupees find the price of eight such pens is it a multiple of eight and twelve so we'll check so price of one pens is 12 rupees and price of 8 pens 8 times 12 8 times 2 16 and 8 times 1 8 plus 1 9 so 96 rupees so is it a multiple of 8 and 12 yes it's a multiple of 8 and 12 so 8 times 12 is 96 or 12 times 8 is 96 so yes a multiple of 8 10 12. question number two a water pump takes a day to fill a household tank of capacity 75 gallons what is the number of times and the total volume of water it can fill during a week so each day a day 75 gallons so you can write one day 75 then week means how many days you get seven days for a week so multiply it by seven so what's the answer 7 times 5 35 3 remaining 7 times 7 49 plus 3 52 so 525 gallons now it says just to find out the wallet what is the number of times and the total volume of water it can fill during a week question number three the prize offer rambutan is six rupees five children bought two three four five and six rambutans respectively find the amount each student spent one 
,rambutan is six rupees and five children bought two three four five like that so two rambutan multiplied by two twelve rupees three rumble time six times three eighteen rupees four rambutans six times four 24 rupees and five rambutan six times five thirty rupees and six rambutans six times six 36 rupees so these are the values each child's pen find the amount each student spends so there is 6 12 18 24 30 and 36 rupees question number four a parcel containing the following items needs to be 
,given to each student who participated in a certain event find how much it will cost to give 50 students a parcel each there are three gingerly rolls talaguli one fish ball two bananas and a packet of milk in each parcel the price of one packet of milk is 30 rupees the price of gingerly roll is five rupees and the price of fish 
,bun is 30 rupees and the price of banana is 10 rupees so we'll check out for each puzzle how much we need to spend so there are three gingerly rows so we'll multiply this by 3 so five times three fifteen rupees then one fish one price of fish one is thirty so thirty times one thirty rupees then 2 bananas 2 bananas means 10 times 2 that's 20 rupees and a packet of milk in each parcel so one packet is 30 so you get 30 rupees now we need to find out the total for all this is one packet five three plus one four four plus three seven seven plus 2 95 rupees per packet so how many students are there 50 students so we need the cost for 50 students total cost is 50 times 95 so what's the total cost we put a 0 and multiply by 5. 5 times 5 25 2 remaining 5 times 9 45 plus 2 47. so we need 4 750 rupees for 50 students question number five separate 50 pupils into groups such that each group has an equal number of pupils what are the numbers which can be taken in each group that means factors so in two groups so you can divide by one 1 times 50. so that means one group you can make with 50 students then it's divisible by 2 2 times 25 two groups with 25 students in each group and this is divisible by 5 5 times 10 5 groups each 10 students then 10 times 5 25 so those are the possibilities and other way round is also possible 10 times 5 10 groups with 5 students each and 25 times 2 that means 25 groups with two students each and other way around 50 times 1 that means 50 groups 
,each with one student so those are the possibilities that we can group exercise 11.6 from the following select and write down the numbers which are divisible by two 
,so what's the condition the last digit should be an even number or zero so 42 64 126 148 250 and this number is possible and here and here so you have to look at the last digit what are the digits that the blank box in this number can be filled with if this number consisting of four digits is divisible by two so last digit should be an even number or zero so it can be zero two six eight those are the possibilities question number three select and write down the numbers which are suitable for the blank boxes to the right of the box containing numbers a number could be included in more than one box numbers which are divisible by two so select even numbers the last digit is even 212 or zero possible 310 256 and 420 860 1236 and 5180 800 because all are even numbers numbers which are divisible by five so look at the last digit either five or zero 105 300 and 125 375 420 860 3200 forty five five thousand one hundred and eighty thousand eight hundred numbers which are divisible by 
,ten that means last digit should be a 0 value 310 and 420 860 five thousand one hundred eighty and thousand eight hundred now look at the same question are there numbers which are common to all three of the boxes on the right in question three above what are these numbers so look at carefully we see all these numbers in this box ah here as well so 310 420 860 5180 000 800 then second part are the numbers in box c essentially in boxes a and b yes what are the numbers that are common to both 
,boxes a and b in question three above a and b what are the numbers common what are the numbers comma what are the numbers common 310 then 400 860 5180 and 1 800 so that means either the last digit is 0 the last digit is 0 only so in question 3 examine whether these numbers are in box c as well accordingly write down the conclusion that you can draw so here we can say what are the numbers that are common to both boxes a and b in question three above so i can write 310 420 860 thousand one hundred and eighty and thousand eight hundred examine whether these numbers are in boxy as well accordingly write down the conclusion that you can draw when the last digit is zero it is divisible by 2 5 10 either 2 5 10 without a remainder so that's the conclusion then we can say divisible by all three numbers 2 5 10. question number five join the points relevant to the numbers which are divisible by two in ascending order then join the points relevant to the small number and the largest number you join so starting from the smallest divisible by 2 so that means even numbers 2 4. then what's the next number six six eight then ten what's the next number we can 12. 14 16 and we can join the largest and the smallest one so this is the shape of a house join the points relevant to the numbers which are divisible by five in ascending order smallest two largest then join the points relevant to the smallest number and the largest number you join so we'll start from 5 then you get 10. then you get 15. and then 20 then 35 35 after that 40 40 then you get around that 75 before 75 you get 65 65 then 75 then 90 105 and then you get 110 110 100 20. and then 135 and 100 then 155 and then you can join the first and the last so this is a fish join the points relevant to the numbers which are divisible by 10 in ascending order then join the points relevant to the smallest number and the largest number you join so multiples of 10 starting from 10 10 20. then 50 50 is the next number and 70 80 90 then 120 and that's the largest and this is the smallest we can chop so this is a boat now we look at the miscellaneous exercise give reasons why 7 is 
,not a factor of 45 we can divide and see when you divide by 7 you get 7 times 6 42 and the remainder is 3 so we can say 7 is not a factor as the remainder is three question number two all the factors of a certain number apart from the number itself are one two three four and six what is this number so what can you say if you take 12 12 is divisible by 2 you get 6 12 is divisible by 3 you get 4 12 is divisible by 6 that's 2 6 times 2 3 times 4 apart from apart from the number itself that means 1 and 12 so what is this number you get 12. the number of marbles in a certain box is a multiple of 6 when this number is rounded off to the nearest multiple of 10 the value obtained is 40. write down the two values that the number of marbles in the box can take so rounded to the nearest multiple of ten so you can when you round it to the nearest ten it can be above this this can be can we take 40 something you can't take 40. 6 46 above 46 or 45 you can't take so what are the numbers you can take you can take 41 42 43 44 up to 44 and below what are the numbers you can get when you round it to nearest 10 you need to get 40 39 is okay 38 37 36 and 35 
,you can't take 34 then that number becomes 30 when you round it to the nearest ten now this is a multiple of six so what are the multiples of six either 36 or 42. so write down the two values that the number of marbles in the box can take 36 or 42. question number four the number of biscuits there are in a certain packet of biscuits is a multiple of 4 which is less than 20 when this number is rounded off to the nearest multiple of 10 the value obtained is 20. how many biscuits are there in 
,the packet so this number is less than 20. so what are the possibilities you can get 19 18 17 16 and 50. but you can't take 40 because when you round 14 to the nearest 10 it becomes 10. so these are the possibilities and this number is a multiple of four only you get 16. you can't take 20 because that's less than 20. so how many biscuits are there in the packet it's 16. now we covered all theory related to factors and multiples a whole number is divisible by each of its factors when a whole number is multiplied by another whole number multiple of the initial number is obtained if the value of the digit in the ones place of a number is divisible by 2 then the number is divisible by 2 that means the last digit the digit in the ones place of a number which is divisible by 5 is either 0 or 5 the digit in the ones place of a number which is divisible by 10 is 0. so remember all these to identify whether any number is divisible by 2 5 and 10.

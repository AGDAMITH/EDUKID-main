Directed Numbers,cLP7INqs3JM,So let's talk a little bit
,,about rational numbers. And the simple way to think
,,about it is any number that can be represented as
,,"the ratio of two integers is a rational number. So for example, any integer"
,,is a rational number. 1 can be represented as 1/1 or
,,"as negative 2 over negative 2 or as 10,000/10,000. In all of these cases, these are   "
,,"all different representations of the number 1,"
,,ratio of two integers. And I obviously can
,,have an infinite number of representations
,,"of 1 in this way, the same number over"
,,the same number. The number negative 7 could be
,,"represented as negative 7/1, or 7 over negative 1, or"
,,"negative 14 over positive 2. And I could go on, and"
,,"on, and on, and on. So negative 7 is definitely"
,,a rational number. It can be represented as
,,the ratio of two integers. But what about things
,,"that are not integers? For example, let us imagine--"
,,"oh, I don't know-- 3.75. How can we represent that as"
,,"the ratio of two integers? Well, 3.75, you"
,,"could rewrite that as 375/100, which is the"
,,"same thing as 750/200. Or you could say, hey,"
,,3.75 is the same thing as 3 and 3/4-- so let
,,me write it here-- which is the same
,,"thing as-- that's 15/4. 4 times 3 is 12, plus 3 is"
,,"15, so you could write this. This is the same thing as 15/4. Or we could write this as"
,,negative 30 over negative 8. I just multiplied the
,,"numerator and the denominator here by negative 2. But just to be clear,"
,,this is clearly rational. I'm giving you multiple
,,examples of how this can be represented as
,,"the ratio of two integers. Now, what about"
,,"repeating decimals? Well, let's take"
,,"maybe the most famous of the repeating decimals. Let's say you have 0.333, just"
,,"keeps going on and on forever, which we can denote by"
,,putting that little bar on top of the 3. This is 0.3 repeating. And we've seen--
,,and later we'll show how you can convert
,,any repeating decimal as the ratio of two integers--
,,this is clearly 1/3. Or maybe you've seen things like
,,"0.6 repeating, which is 2/3. And there's many, many,"
,,many other examples of this. And we'll see any
,,"repeating decimal, not just one digit repeating. Even if it has a million"
,,"digits repeating, as long as the pattern"
,,starts to repeat itself over and over and
,,"over again, you can always represent that as"
,,the ratio of two integers. So I know what you're
,,"probably thinking. Hey, Sal, you've"
,,just included a lot. You've included all
,,of the integers. You've included all of finite
,,"non-repeating decimals, and you've also included"
,,repeating decimals. What is left? Are there any numbers
,,that are not rational? And you're probably
,,"guessing that there are, otherwise people"
,,wouldn't have taken the trouble of trying to
,,label these as rational. And it turns out-- as you
,,can imagine-- that actually some of the most famous
,,numbers in all of mathematics are not rational. And we call these numbers
,,irrational numbers. And I've listed there
,,just a few of the most noteworthy examples. Pi-- the ratio of
,,the circumference to the diameter of a circle--
,,is an irrational number. It never terminates. It goes on and on and on
,,"forever, and it never repeats. e, same thing-- never"
,,"terminates, never repeats. It comes out of continuously"
,,compounding interest. It comes out of
,,"complex analysis. e shows up all over the place. Square root of 2,"
,,"irrational number. Phi, the golden ratio,"
,,irrational number. So these things that
,,"really just pop out of nature, many of these"
,,"numbers are irrational. Now, you might say, OK,"
,,are these irrational? These are just these
,,special kind of numbers. But maybe most
,,"numbers are rational, and Sal's just picked out"
,,some special cases here. But the important thing to
,,"realize is they do seem exotic, and they are exotic"
,,in certain ways. But they aren't uncommon. It actually turns out
,,that there is always an irrational number between
,,"any two rational numbers. Well, we could go on and on. There's actually"
,,"an infinite number. But there's at least one,"
,,so that gives you an idea that you can't
,,really say that there are fewer irrational numbers
,,than rational numbers. And in a future
,,"video, we'll prove that you give me two rational"
,,"numbers-- rational 1, rational 2-- there's going to be"
,,"at least one irrational number between those, which"
,,"is a neat result, because irrational"
,,numbers seem to be exotic. Another way to think about it--
,,"I took the square root of 2, but you take the square root"
,,"of any non-perfect square, you're going to end up"
,,with an irrational number. You take the sum
,,of an irrational and a rational number-- and
,,we'll see this later on. We'll prove it to ourselves. The sum of an irrational
,,and a rational is going to be irrational. The product of an
,,"irrational and a rational is going to be irrational. So there's a lot, a lot, a"
,,lot of irrational numbers out there.

Directed Numbers,C38B33ZywWs,Welcome to the presentation
,,on adding and subtracting negative numbers. So let's get started. So what is a negative
,,"number, first of all? Well, let me draw"
,,a number line. Well it's not much of a
,,line but I think you'll get the picture. So we're used to the positive
,,"numbers, so if that's 0, you have 1, you have 2, you have 3,"
,,"you have 4, and you keep going. And if I were to say what's 2"
,,"plus 2, you'd start at 2 and then you'd add 2 and"
,,you'd get to 4. I mean most of us
,,it's second nature. But if you actually drew
,,it on a number line you'd say 2 plus 2 is 4. And if I asked you what's
,,2 minus 1 or let's say what's 3 minus 2? If you start at 3 and
,,"you subtracted 2, you would end up at 1. That's 2 plus 2 is equal to 4"
,,and 3 minus 2 is equal to 1. And this is a joke for you. Now what if I were to
,,"say what is 1 minus 3? Huh. Well, it's the same thing. You start at 1 and we're going"
,,"to go 1 -- well, now we're going to go below 0 --"
,,what happens below 0? Well then you start going
,,"to the negative numbers. Negative 1, negative 2,"
,,"negative 3, and so on. So if I start at 1 right here,"
,,"so 1 minus 3, so I go 1, 2, 3, I end up at negative 2. So 1 minus 3 is equal"
,,to negative 2. This is something that you're
,,"probably already doing in your everyday life. If I were to tell you that boy,"
,,"it's very cold today, it's 1 degree, but tomorrow it's going"
,,"to be 3 degrees colder, you might already know intuitively,"
,,well then we're going to be at a temperature of
,,negative 2 degrees. So that's all a
,,negative number means. And just remember when a
,,"negative number is big, so like negative 50, that's actually"
,,"colder than negative 20, right? So a negative 50 is actually"
,,even a smaller number than negative 20 because it's even
,,further to the left of negative 20. That's just something you'll
,,get an intuitive feel for. Sometimes when you start you
,,"feel like oh, 50's a bigger number than 20, but it's a"
,,"negative 50 as opposed to a positive 50. So let's do some problems, and"
,,I'm going to keep using the number line because I
,,think it's useful. So let's do the
,,problem 5 minus 12. I think you already might
,,have an intuition of what this equals. But let me draw a
,,"line, 5 minus 12. So let me start with minus 10,"
,,"minus 9, minus 8 --I think I'm going to run out of space --"
,,"minus 7, minus 6, minus 5 -- I should have this pre-drawn --"
,,"minus 4, minus 3, minus 2, minus 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,"
,,I'll put 5 right here. 5 minus 12. So if we start at 5 -- let me
,,use a different color -- we start at 5 right here and we're
,,"going to go to the left 12 because we're subtracting 12. So then we go 1, 2, 3, 4,"
,,"5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. Negative 7. That's pretty interesting. Because it also happens"
,,"to be that 12 minus 5 is equal to positive 7. So, I want you to think a"
,,little bit about why that is. Why the difference between 12
,,"and 5 is 7, and the difference between -- well, I"
,,guess it's either way. Because in this situation we're
,,"also saying that the difference between 5 and 12 is negative 7,"
,,"but the numbers are that far apart, but now we're starting"
,,with the lower number. I think that last sentence just
,,"completely confused you, but we'll keep moving forward. We just said 5 minus 12"
,,is equal to minus 7. Let's do another one. What's negative 3
,,"plus 5 equals what? Well, let's use the"
,,same number line. Let's go to negative 3 plus 5. So we're going to
,,"go to the right 5. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. It's a 2. It equals 2. So negative 3 plus"
,,5 is equal to 2. That's interesting because 5
,,"minus 3 is also equal to 2. Well, it turns out that 5 minus"
,,"3 is the same thing, it's just another way of writing 5"
,,"plus negative 3 or negative 3 plus 5. A general, easy way to always"
,,do negative numbers is it's just like regular subtraction
,,"and addition and subtraction, but now when we subtract we"
,,can go to the left below 0. Let's do another one. So what happens when you get
,,"let's say 2 minus minus 3? Well, if you think about how"
,,it should work out I think this will make sense. But it turns out that the
,,"negative number, the negative signs actually cancel out. So this is the same thing"
,,"as 2 plus plus 3, and that just equals 5. Another way you could say is --"
,,let's do another one -- what is negative 7 minus minus 2? Well that's the same thing
,,"as negative 7 plus 2. And remember, so we're doing to"
,,start at negative 7 and we're going to move two to the right. So if we move one to the right
,,"we go to negative 6, and then we move two to the right"
,,we get negative 5. That makes sense because
,,"negative 7 plus 2, that's the same thing as 2 minus 7. If it's 2 degrees and it gets 7"
,,"degrees colder, it's minus 5. Let's do a bunch of these. I think the more you do the"
,,"more practice you have, and the modules explain it pretty well,"
,,probably better than I do. So let's just do a
,,ton of problems. So if I said
,,"negative 7 minus 3. Well, now we're going"
,,to go three to the left of negative 7. We're going to get 3 less
,,"than negative 7 so that's negative 10, right? That makes sense, because if we"
,,had positive 7 plus 3 we're at 7 to the right of 0 and we're
,,going to go three more to the right of 0 and we
,,get positive 10. So for 7 to the left of 0 and
,,go three more to the left we're going to get negative 10. Let's do a bunch more. I know I'm probably confusing
,,"you, but practice is what's going to really help us. So say 3 minus minus 3, well,"
,,"these negatives cancel out so that just equals 6. What's 3 minus 3? Well, that's easy"
,,that's just 0. What's minus 3 minus 3? Well now we're going to get
,,"three less than minus 3, well that's minus is 6. What's minus 3 minus minus 3? Interesting. Well, the minuses cancel out"
,,"so you get minus 3 plus 3. Well, if we start three to the"
,,"left of 0 and we move three to the right we end up at 0 again. So that makes sense, right? Let me do that again. Minus 3 minus minus 3. Anything minus itself        "
,,"should equal 0, right? That's why that equals 0. And that's why it makes sense"
,,that those two negatives cancel out and that's
,,"the same thing as this. Let's do a bunch more. Let's do 12 minus 13. That's pretty easy. Well, 12 minus 12 is 0, so"
,,12 minus 13 is negative 1 because we're going to
,,"go one the left of 0. Let's do 8 minus 5. Well, this one is just a"
,,"normal problem, that's 3. What's 5 minus 8? Well, we're going to go all the"
,,"way to 0 and then 3 more to the left of zero, so it's minus 3. I could draw a"
,,"number line here. If this is 0 this is 5, and now"
,,"we're going to go to left 8, then we end up and negative 3. You could do that"
,,for all of these. That actually might
,,be a good exercise. I think this will give you good
,,introduction and I recommend that you just do the modules
,,"because the modules actually, especially if you do the hints,"
,,it has a pretty nice graphic that's a lot nicer than
,,anything I could draw on this chalkboard. So try that out and I'm going
,,to try to record some more modules that hopefully won't
,,confuse you as badly. You could also attend the
,,seminar on adding and subtracting negative numbers. I hope you have fun. Bye.

Directed Numbers,qW-Ce44ll0Q,#NAME?
,,"number lines here, and on each number line they mark off a couple of these marks,"
,,"this is negative two this is negative 10,"
,,"negative five, negative 11, and then we need to figure out"
,,"what the blue dot represents. And as a little bit of a hint, each mark here is not"
,,"necessarily incrementing by one, it could be by more than one. So I encourage you to pause this video, and to try it on your own. Try to figure out what number      "
,,does this blue dot represent on these different number lines? So let's tackle this first one. So we're gonna go where
,,"they gave us this mark is negative two, this is negative 10, and we need to figure out this blue one that's further to the left of negative 10. Well just going from "
,,"negative two to negative 10, what has to happen to negative"
,,"two to get to negative 10? Well we'll have to subtract eight. And so if we move two to the left, that's the equivalent"
,,"of subtracting eight. So if we move two to the left again, that's subtracting eight again. So this must be negative 18 and so if we move two to the left again, that "
,,"also must be subtracting eight. Negative 18 minus eight,"
,,"would get us to negative, that gets us to negative 26. Now another way we could"
,,"have thought about it is, if we jump two to the left"
,,"and that's negative eight, then one jump to the left"
,,"is gonna be negative four. So you could say ""Well"
,,"this is negative four"", that would get you to negative six, then negative four again"
,,"gets you to negative 10, then this would be"
,,"negative 14, negative 18, negative 22, negative 26. Now let's tackle this one. So here we're gonna, we have to figure out what this blue dot here is on the right. So if we started at 11, you make two jumps to go to negative five. So what do I have to add to negative 11 to get to negative five? Well I have to add six. So if I add six over two jumps, that means that each of these jumps, that must be plus three, and this one must be plus three. So now each mark we just add three. So negative five plus three... So plus three is gonna"
,,"get us to negative two. Plus three gets us to positive one, negative two plus three is positive one, plus three gets us to four. So here we got to negative 26, here "
,,"we get to four. Now let's tackle this one. So we're at negative seven, or this is negative seven this is one and then we have to figure"
,,"out this mark right over here. So if you take two jumps to the right, from negative seven to one, how much did we have to add? Well to get from negative seven to one, you have to add eight. You have to add eight. So then if we make another two"
,,jumps to the mystery number that means we added eight again. So one plus eight is nine. Another way we could
,,"have thought about it, if we added eight over two jumps that means we added four on each jump. So this one must be negative three, add four you get to one, add four "
,,"you get to five, add four you get to nine."

Directed Numbers,jVvvUiExjes,in this video we're going to focus on adding and subtracting integers but in the first half we're just going to focus on adding integers let's start with something simple what is 3 plus 5 intuitively you know what the answer is but let's say if you didn't know what to do here's what you can do you can use a number line to help you add and subtract numbers so let's say this is 0 and we're going to start with 3 so start with the first number anytime you need to add travel on the right using the number line if you need to subtract then move towards the left so we wish to add 5 to 3 so we have to travel 5 spaces to the right 1 2 3 4 5 this is 4 5 6 7 8 that's where we ended up so three plus five is eight let's work on another example 4 plus 3 so if we start with 4 and if we travel three spaces to the right this is going to be 5 6 7 so therefore 4 plus 3 is equal to 7 and so using a number line is very helpful you will never need to add or subtract two integers is another example 
,,what is 8 plus negative 5 by the way 8 plus negative 5 is equivalent to 8 minus 5 if you wish to add a negative number start with the first number 8 add in a negative number you need to travel towards the left so 1 2 3 4 5 this is 7 6 5 4 3 so 8 plus negative 5 is positive 3 that's the same as 8 minus 5 which will give you the same answer now what about this one what is 7 plus negative 2 so for you to pause the video and try that so if we start with 7 all we need to do is travel two spaces 
,,to the left so this is 6 and this is 5 7 plus negative 2 is the same as 7 minus 2 which is 5 a positive times a negative will give you a negative sign if you multiply two positive signs this will give you a positive number if you multiply two negative numbers you will get a positive number but if you multiply a positive and the 
,,negatives together it will give you a negative number let's work on some more examples what is negative 6 plus 4 and what is negative 7 plus 8 so take a minute and pause the video and work on those examples so I'm going to use the number line technique once more so let's say negative 6 is on the last one looks at add 4 to it so 
,,we got to travel 4 spaces to the right 1 2 3 4 so this is negative 5 negative 4 negative 3 and negative 2 so therefore negative 6 plus 4 is negative 2 by the way you can reverse the numbers if you want negative 6 plus 4 is the same as positive 4 minus 6 but you have to put the positive in front now 4 minus 6 intuitively you can 
,,see that this is going to be negative 2 now what about negative 7 plus 8 that's equal to 8 minus 7 which is going to be positive 1 but let's use the number lines to 
,,confirm it so let's start with negative 7 and let's travel 8 units to the right since we're adding 8 to negative 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 this is negative 6 negative 5 negative 4 negative 3 two negative one zero positive one so negative seven plus eight is positive one go ahead and try these negative 7 plus negative five and negative three plus negative four so what is a negative seven plus negative five when you add in two negative numbers you're going to get a negative number as well 7 plus 5 is 12 negative 7 plus negative 5 that's going to be negative 12 but let's confirm it using a number line so we're going to start with negative 7 and we're going to add negative 5 to it so if you're adding a negative number you need to move towards the left if you're adding a positive number you need to travel towards the right so 
,,let's travel 5 units to the left this is negative 6 negative 5 negative 4 actually and take that back to the left the negative numbers should be getting bigger this 
,,is negative 8 negative 9 negative 10 negative 11 negative 12 so that's our answer now if 3 plus 4 is positive 7 negative 3 plus negative 4 is equal to negative 7 so 
,,now let's start with negative 3 and let's add negative 4 to it so let's travel 4 units to the left so this is negative 4 and negative 5 negative 6 negative 7 sometimes you may need to add three numbers as opposed to two numbers so what is five plus a negative three plus six five plus negative three that's equal to positive two if you have a number line and if you start with five you need to travel three units to left so going this way that's going to take you to positive two next we need to add two and six so we have to travel six units to the right started from two so this will take us to eight 2 plus 6 is 8 if you can it this is starting from 2 this 
,,is 1 2 3 4 5 6 so 2 plus 6 is 8 and that's the final answer here's another similar example what's negative 7 plus 4 plus negative 5 negative 7 plus 4 that's going to be negative 3 and negative 3 plus negative 5 whenever you're adding two negative numbers you're going to get a negative result so think of 3 plus 5 which is 8 but just add a negative sign to it so it's negative 8 now let's use the number line to confirm everything so we're going to start with negative 7 and we're going to add 4 to it 1 2 3 4 so this is negative 6 negative 5 negative 4 negative 3 so we're currently at negative 3 at this point and then we're going to add negative 5 to it so 
,,we got to go back 5 units that way so 1 2 3 4 5 so the final answer is negative 8 now let's focus on subtracting integers what is 8 minus 3 so if you're subtracting 
,,you need to travel towards the left let's start with the first number eight now we're going to travel three spaces to the left this is seven six five so eight minus 
,,three is positive five and it's just that simple so let's try 4 minus 9 so we're going to start with positive 4 we're going to travel in 9 spaces towards the left 1 
,,2 3 the 0 makes 4 5 6 7 8 9 so notice that we ended at negative 5 so 4 minus 9 is negative 5 now what is negative 3 minus 6 what is that equal to if you see a situation like this you can basically add 3 & 6 and then make it negative 3 plus 6 is 9 but this is going to be negative 9 but if this confuses you you can always just use the number line so we're going to start with negative 3 and we're going to subtract it by 6 so let's travel 6 units to left 1 2 3 4 5 6 so this is negative 4 negative 5 maybe 6 2 negative 7 negative 8 negative 9 so therefore negative 3 minus 6 is negative 9 try this one what is negative 7 minus 6 7 plus 6 is 13 so this is going to be negative 13 so let's start with negative 7 we're going to travel 6 units to the left and as you can see it's going to give us the same result now what is six 
,,minus negative four and also what's seven minus negative two whenever you have two negative signs next to each other you can make it equal to a positive sign six minus negative four is the same as 6 plus four which is 10 and 7 minus negative 2 is 7 plus 2 which is 9 now what would you do if you see a problem with three negative 
,,signs go ahead and try that now the first thing I will do is convert these two negative signs which are right next to each other into a positive sign so negative 4 minus negative 8 is equal to negative 4 plus 8 which is the same as 8 minus 4 which turns out to be 4 so using a number line I would focus on this portion now let's start with negative 4 let's add 8 to it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and as you can see we get the same final answer of positive 4 so negative 4 minus negative 8 is 4 so try a similar example what's negative 5 minus negative 6 so let's convert the two negative signs into a positive sign so this is negative 5 plus 6 which is the same as 6 minus 5 and that's positive 1 so using the number line let's add 6 to negative 5 so this is negative 4 negative 3 and this is going to go all the way to positive 1 so we're going to get the same answer so now you know how to add and subtract positive and negative integers by the way for those of you who want to find more similar videos in pre-algebra check out the description section of this video below and you can find my pre-algebra playlist

Directed Numbers,Hlal9ME2Aig,"In this video, I want"
,,"to familiarize ourselves with negative numbers,"
,,and also learn a bit of how do we
,,add and subtract them. And when you first
,,"encounter them, they look like this deep"
,,and mysterious thing. When we first
,,"count things, we're counting positive numbers. What does a negative"
,,number even mean? But when we think
,,"about it, you probably have encountered negative"
,,numbers in your everyday life. And let me just give
,,you a few examples. So before I actually
,,"give the example, the general idea is"
,,a negative number is any number less than the 0. And if that sounds strange
,,"and abstract to you, let's just think about it in a"
,,couple of different contexts. If we're measuring the
,,temperature-- and it could be in Celsius
,,or Fahrenheit. Let's just assume we're
,,"measuring it in Celsius. And so, let me"
,,draw a little scale that we can measure
,,"the temperature on. And so, let's say this"
,,"is 0 degrees Celsius. That is 1 degree Celsius,"
,,"2 degrees Celsius, 3 degrees Celsius. Now let's say that it's"
,,"a pretty chilly day, and it's currently"
,,3 degrees Celsius. And someone who
,,predicts the future tells you that it
,,is going to get 4 degrees colder the next day. So how cold will it be? How can you represent
,,"that coldness? Well, if it only"
,,"got 1 degree colder, we would be at 2 degrees. But we know we have to"
,,"go 4 degrees colder. If we got 2 degrees colder,"
,,we would be at 1 degree. If we got 3 degrees
,,"colder, we would be at 0. But 3 isn't enough. We have to get 4 degrees colder. So we have to actually"
,,"go one more below the 0. And that one below 0,"
,,"we call that negative 1. And so, you can kind of"
,,"see that the number line, as you go to the right"
,,"of 0 on the number line, it increases in positive values. As you go to the left"
,,"of the number line, you're going to have negative 1. Then you're going"
,,to have negative 2. And you're going
,,to have negative 3. And you're going
,,to have-- depending on how you think
,,about it-- you're going to have larger
,,negative numbers. But I want to make it
,,very clear-- negative 3 is less than negative 1. There is less heat in
,,the air then negative 1. It is colder. There's less temperature there. So let me just
,,make it very clear. Negative 100 is much
,,"smaller than negative 1. You might look at 100,"
,,"and you might look at 1, and your gut reaction"
,,"is to say, wow, 100 is a much larger"
,,number than 1. But when you think
,,"about it, negative 100 means there's a"
,,"lack of something. If it's negative 100 degrees,"
,,there's a lack of heat. So there's much less heat here
,,then if we had negative 1. Let me give you another example. Let's say in my bank
,,"account today, I have $10. Let me do this in a new color. So let's say today I have $10. Now let's say I go"
,,out there-- because I feel good about my $10-- and
,,let's say I go and spend $30. And for the sake of
,,"argument, let's say I have a very flexible"
,,"bank, one that lets me spend more"
,,money than I have-- and these actually exist. So I spend $30. So what's my bank account
,,going to look like? So let me draw a
,,number line here. And you might already have
,,"an intuitive response. I will owe the bank some money. So let me write this over here. So tomorrow, what"
,,is my bank account? So you might immediately
,,"say, look, if I have $10, and I spend $30,"
,,there's $20 that had to come from
,,"someplace, and that $20 is coming from the bank. So I'm going to"
,,"owe the bank $20. And so, in my bank account,"
,,"to sure how much I have, I could say $10 minus $30"
,,"is actually negative $20. So in my bank account tomorrow,"
,,"I'm going to have negative $20. So if I say I have negative $20,"
,,that means that I owe the bank. I don't even have it. Not only do I have
,,"nothing, I owe something. It's going in reverse. Here, I have something to spend. If my $10 is in my bank, that"
,,means the bank owes me $10. I have $10 that I
,,"can use to go spend. Now all of a sudden,"
,,I owe the bank. I've gone in the
,,other direction. And if we use a
,,"number line here, it should hopefully make"
,,a little bit of sense. So that is 0. I'm starting off with $10. And spending $30 means I'm
,,moving 30 spaces to the left. So if I move 10 spaces to the
,,"left-- if I only spend $10, I'll be back at 0. If I spend another $10,"
,,I'll be at negative $10. If I spend another
,,"$10 after that, I will be at negative $20. So each of these distances--"
,,"I spent $10, I'd be at 0. Another $10, I'd"
,,"be at negative $10. Another $10, I would"
,,be at negative $20. And this whole distance right
,,"here is how much I spent. I spent $30. So the general idea, when"
,,you spend or if you subtract or if we're getting
,,"colder, you would move to the left"
,,of the number line. The numbers would get smaller. And we now know they
,,can get smaller than 0. They can go to
,,"negative 1, negative 2, they can even go to"
,,"negative 1.5, negative 1.6. You're getting more and more"
,,negative the more you lose. If you're adding-- if I
,,"go and get my paycheck, I will move to the right"
,,of the number line. Now with that out of
,,"the way, let's just do a couple of more"
,,pure math problems. And just think
,,"about what it means if we were to say 3 minus 4. So once again, this is"
,,exactly the situation that we did here
,,"with the temperature. We're starting at 3,"
,,and we're subtracting 4. So we're going to
,,"move 4 to the left. We go 1, 2, 3, 4. So that gets us to negative 1. And when you're"
,,"starting to do this, you really understand what"
,,a negative number means. I really encourage you to
,,"visualize the number line, and really move"
,,along it depending on whether you're
,,adding and subtracting. Now let's do a couple more. Let's say I have 2 minus 8. And we'll think about more ways
,,"to do this in future videos. But once again, you just"
,,want to do the number line. You have a 0 here. Let me draw the
,,"spacing a little bit. So we have 0 here. We're at 1, 2. If we're subtracting"
,,"8, that means we're going to"
,,move 8 to the left. So we're going to go 1
,,"to the left, 2 the left. So we've gone 2 to"
,,the left to get to 0. We have to move how
,,"many more to the left? Well, we've already"
,,"moved 2 the left. To get to 8, we have to"
,,move 6 more to the left. So we're going to have to
,,"move 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 more to the left. Well, where is that"
,,"going to put us? Well, we were at 0. This is a negative 1, negative"
,,"2, negative 3, negative 4, negative 5, negative 6. So 2 minus 8 is negative 6. 2 minus 2 would be 0. When you're subtracting 8,"
,,you're subtracting another 6. So we'd go up to negative 6. We go 6 below 0. Let me do one more example. And this one will be a little
,,"less conventional for you, but hopefully it"
,,will make sense. And I'll do this in a new color. Let me take negative 4 minus 2. So we're starting at
,,"a negative number, and then we're"
,,"subtracting from that. And if this seems confusing,"
,,"just remember the number line. So this is 0 right here. This is negative 1, negative"
,,"2, negative 3, negative 4. So that's where we're starting. Now we're going to"
,,subtract 2 from negative 4. So we're going to
,,"move 2 to the left. So if we subtract 1, we"
,,"will be at negative 5. If we subtract another 1, we"
,,are going to be at negative 6. We are going to
,,be at negative 6. So this is negative 6. Let's do another
,,interesting thing. Let's start at negative 3. Let's say we have negative 3. Instead of subtracting something
,,"from that, let's add 2 to it. So where would this put"
,,us on the number line? So we're starting at negative
,,"3, and we're adding 2, so we're going to"
,,"move to the right. So you add 1, you"
,,become negative 2. But if you add another
,,"1, which we have to do, you become negative 1. You move 2 to the right. So negative 3 plus"
,,negative 2 is negative 1. And you can see for
,,yourself but this all fits our traditional notion
,,of adding and subtracting. If we start at negative
,,"1, and we subtract 2, we should get negative 3--"
,,kind of reverse of this thing up here. Negative 3 plus 2 gets us there. Then if we start
,,"then, we subtract 2, we should get back to negative"
,,"3, and we see that happens. If you start at negative"
,,"1 right over here, and you subtract 2--"
,,"you move 2 to the left-- you get back to negative 3. So hopefully, this"
,,starts to give you a sense of what it means to
,,"deal with, or add and subtract, negative numbers. But we're going to give"
,,a lot more examples in the next video. And we're actually
,,going to see what it means to subtract
,,a negative number.

Directed Numbers,NQSN00zL5gg,Let's have some practice
,,adding and subtracting negative numbers. So the first example I want
,,to look at is 2 minus 3. So right now I'm just
,,subtracting a positive number from another positive
,,"number, but you might already see that I'm subtracting a"
,,"larger number from a smaller number. So I'm probably, or"
,,"I will, definitely end up with a negative number. But let's just think"
,,about this a little bit. And I'm going to do
,,it with a number line. So there's my number
,,"line right over there. Now this is 0, this is 1,"
,,"this is 2, this is negative 1, this is negative 2. We could view this"
,,as starting at 2. So this is 2 right over
,,"here, and then we're going to subtract 3 from that 2. So we're going to move 3 to"
,,the left on the number line. So we're going to move
,,"3 to the left, 1, 2, 3. And that gets us to negative 1. This is equal to negative 1. Now let's mix it up"
,,a little bit more. Let's imagine what would happen
,,if we had negative 2 minus 3. So this was positive 2 minus 3. Now let's think about
,,"negative 2 minus 3. So once again, let's"
,,"draw our number line. And I'll put 0 over here. So this is 0, this is 1, this"
,,"is negative 1, negative 2, negative 3, negative 4,"
,,"negative 5, negative 6, and I could keep going. But we're starting"
,,"at negative 2, and then we're"
,,"subtracting 3 again. So once again, we're"
,,"going to move three to the left of negative 2. So we go 1, 2, 3. We end up at negative 5. So this is negative 5. So notice in both"
,,"situations we subtracted 3, we moved 3 to the left"
,,on the number line. It's just here we started
,,2 to the right of 0. Here we started 2
,,to the left of 0. This is negative 2. Let's do another example
,,with these same numbers. Let's imagine negative 2 plus 3. I encourage you to
,,"pause this video, and try to think about"
,,this on your own. So we could draw
,,the number line-- I could draw a straighter
,,number line than that-- so draw the number line again. And let's say that
,,"this is negative 2, negative 1, 0, 1, and 2 again. We're starting at"
,,"negative 2, we're starting 2 to the left of zero. So we're starting at negative"
,,"2, and we're going to add 3. So we're going to"
,,"go 3 to the right now, 1, 2, 3, and we"
,,end up at positive 1. Now let's think about
,,"2, so positive 2, and we're going to"
,,subtract a negative 3. And other videos we've
,,"already talked about this. In fact, there's a video"
,,explaining why this actually makes sense. But when you
,,"subtract a negative, this is the same thing"
,,as adding the positive. So 2 minus negative 3 is
,,the exact same thing as 2 plus 2 plus positive 3. These two statements
,,"are equivalent, and this just boils down"
,,"to, this right over here, is just going to be 5. Now, let's mix it up"
,,a little bit more. Let's imagine negative
,,"2 minus negative 3. Now, this might seem"
,,really intimidating to have all of these negatives
,,"in place here, but you just have to"
,,"remember subtracting a negative, like this, is"
,,going to get you a positive. So this is the exact same
,,"thing as negative 2 plus 3, and negative 2 plus"
,,"3, we've already seen it right over here. You start at negative 2, you"
,,"start 2 to the left of 0, and then we're going"
,,"to go 3 to the right, we're adding 3, 1, 2, 3."

Directed Numbers,_BgblvF90UE,"Hi, welcome to Math Antics. In our last video, we learned what negative numbers are, and we learned that they're part of a special set of numbers called ‘integers’. "
,,"Next, we need to learn how to do arithmetic with those integers. In this video, we’re gonna learn how to add and subtract integers. In the next video we’ll learn how to multiply and divide integers. Adding and subtracting whole numbers is pretty easy because there’s really only two possibilities: you’re either adding two positive numbers, or subtracting two positive numbers. But adding and subtracting integers is more complicated, because with negative numbers in the mix, there’s a lot more possibilities. Fortunately, you don’t need to memorize all these possibilities. Instead, we’re gonna learn some simple rules and strategies that will make the process a lot easier . Let’s start by learning two key rules that are really helpful to know when working with negative numbers. The first rule is this:  Adding a negative is the same as subtracting a positive. To visualize what that means, suppose I give you positive two cupcakes, You’d be pretty happy, right? But what if I ‘give’ you negative two cupcakes instead? That’s the same as taking two cupcakes away from you. Would you still be happy? When it comes to math, this rule means that if you "
,,"have a problem like this: 5 + -1 (where you’re adding a negative number), you can just change it to subtraction. Instead of 5 + -1, you can just write 5 ? 1. They’re different ways of writing the same thing. Okay, so rule #1 is:  Adding a negative is the same as subtracting a positive. Now what about rule number #2? Well the second rule is this:  Subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive. Let’s say you have negative two cupcakes.  Like if you have a debt… you OWE me two cupcakes. You wouldn’t be too happy having that negative, would you? But, what if I subtract that negative from you? Taking away the negative two made you more positive, right? Subtracting the negative gives you less debt! When it comes to math, this rule means that if you have a problem like 5 ? (-1), where you’re subtracting a negative number, you can just change it to addition. Instead of 5 ? (-1), you can just write 5 + 1, and that’s a problem you already know how to solve. Alright, now that "
,,"you know our two rules, I want to show you that there’s really only four different types of problems (or 4 cases) when adding or subtracting integers. In case 1, you start with a positive number and you make it more positive. In case 2, you start with a positive number and you make it more negative. In case 3, you start with a negative number and you make it more negative. And in case 4, you start with a negative number and you make it more positive. The key to getting the right answer to the problem is to figure out which of these cases you’re dealing with, so let’s look at each case in more detail. In case 1, you start with a positive number and you "
,,"make it more positive. The good news is that you already know how to do that!  That’s just what regular addition is. For example, when you have the problem 7 + 3, you’re starting with a positive 7 and you’re making it more positive by adding positive 3 to it, to get the answer of positive 10. But, what if instead of 7 + 3, you're given the problem 7 ? (-3)?  That seems a lot harder, right? Well, if you remember rule #2, it’s not harder at all. In fact, it’s exactly the same problem because "
,,"rule #2 says subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive. We can change the “minus minus 3” into “plus 3” and we get the same answer: positive 10. So case 1 is just addition like you’re used to doing, but now that we have negative numbers, there’s a new way that it could be written that you need to be on the lookout "
,,"for. Oh, and in this case (starting with a positive and making it more positive), you know your answer will always be positive because you stay on that side of the number line. In case 2, you start with a positive number, but you make it more negative. That is, you do something to it that makes its value smaller (or moves it to "
,,"the left on the number line). But that’s just like regular subtraction like you already know how to do. For example, here we have the problem 8 ? 5. We start with a "
,,positive 8 but we make it more negative by subtracting 5 from it. Subtracting 5 moves it to the left on the number line down to 3 as our answer. Our answer is still 
,,"a positive number, but it’s less positive than it was before. And that raises an interesting question: What if we subtract even more, to move it further in the negative direction? Like, what if we subtract 8 instead of 5?  That would take us all the way back down to zero on the number line. And before you knew about negative numbers, back when you thought the number line just stopped at zero, you probably thought that’s all we could take away.  But watch this… Let’s start with positive 8 but then subtract 10 from it!  Can we do that? Can we subtract a bigger number from a smaller one? Now we can!  It just means that the answer we get will be a negative number. Starting with positive 8 and subtracting 10 takes us past zero, and down to negative 2 on the number line. So our answer is negative 2. As you can see, case 2 is a little more complicated, because the answer can be positive, negative or even zero, depending on the numbers you’re subtracting. And it’s even more complicated than that because there’s also another way this type of problem can be written, thanks to rule #1. Rule #1 says that adding a negative is really the same as subtracting a positive. And that means our original subtraction problem (8 ? 5) could have been written like this instead (8 + -5). But either way it’s written, you’re starting with a positive and making it more negative. Now on to case 3…  In case 3 you start with a negative number and you make it more negative. That’s really just the opposite of case 1 where we started on the positive side of the number line and made it more positive. For example, let’s say that you’re given the problem: -7 + "
,,"-3. That means that you start with negative 7 and then you make it even more negative by adding negative 3 which gives you negative 10 as the answer. And as you might have guessed by now, thanks to our rules, there’s another way we could write this type of problem. Because of rule #1, we know that adding a negative 3 is the same as subtracting 3. So this problem could also be written like this: -7 ? 3. But either way it’s written, in this case you’re starting with a negative number and making it even more negative. And because of that, you know that your answer will always be negative for case 3 since you stay on the negative side of the number line. And finally, in case 4, you also start with a negative number, but this time you’re gonna make it more positive. Here’s an example of a problem like that: -8 + 5. This problem starts with negative 8 but then we add positive 5 which makes it more positive, or moves us to the right on the number line, up to -3 which is our answer. "
,,"Our answer is still negative, but it’s less negative than what we started with. Ah, but this looks similar to case 2, right? Imagine what would happen if you made it even more positive. You could add 8 (instead of 5) and that would move you all the way up to zero. And if you added even more, like -8 + 10, that would take you to "
,,"the positive side of the number line and give you the answer of positive 2. So just like in case 2, the answer here can be positive, negative or even zero depending "
,,"on the numbers you‘re adding. And, just like before, there’s another way this type of problem can be written. Remember rule #2? …that subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive. Because of that rule, -8 + 5 could also be written as -8 ? (-5). That’s a LOT of negatives, but thanks to rule #2, we can write our “minus "
,,"minus” as a “plus”. But either way it’s written, in this case, we start negative and move in the positive direction. Okay, now that we’ve learned our two rules and we’ve seen that there’s really just four types of problems (or 4 different cases) that you’ll need to solve, I want to give you a basic strategy that will help when you’re adding or subtracting integers. This strategy involves asking 3 simple questions: The first question is, “Am I starting with a positive or a negative number?” "
,,"This question is easy to answer because all you have to do is look at the sign in front of the first number of the problem. If there’s no sign, then you’re starting "
,,"with a positive number. But if there’s a minus sign, then you’re starting with a negative number. Once you know what you’re starting with, the next question to ask is, “Am I making it bigger or smaller?” In other words, is what you’re adding or subtracting going to make the value move in the positive direction of the number line or the negative direction? If you’re subtracting a positive or adding a negative (Rule #1) then you're making the value smaller, which is moving to the left on the "
,,"number line. If you’re adding a positive or subtracting a negative (Rule #2) then you're making the value bigger, which is moving to the right on the number line. And the last question that you need to ask is, “Will my answer be positive, negative, or zero?” The answer to this will depend on which case you have and what values you’re working with. If it’s a case 1 problem, you know the answer will always be positive, and if it’s a case 3 problem, then you know the answer will always be negative. But you’ll remember that in cases 2 and 4, the answer could change between positive, negative or zero depending on the difference between the two numbers that "
,,"you’re working with. So asking these three questions will help you visualize what’s happening in the problem that you’re trying to solve, and it’ll help you get the "
,,right answer. But the most important thing that you can do to get good at integer arithmetic is to practice. It’s important that you try a lot of problems that you have an answer key for so that you know if you’re doing it right. And don’t get discouraged if it’s confusing at first.  You’ll get it if you practice! And you might

Directed Numbers,mbc3_e5lWw0, If you're
,,watching a movie and someone is attempting to do fancy
,,"mathematics on a chalkboard, you'll almost always see a"
,,symbol that looks like this. This radical symbol. And this is used to show the square root and we'll see other
,,"types of roots as well, but your question is, well, what does this thing actually mean? And now that we know a"
,,"little bit about exponents, we'll see that the square"
,,root symbol or the root symbol or the radical is not
,,"so hard to understand. So, let's start with an example. So, we know that three to"
,,"the second power is what? Three squared is what? Well, that's the same"
,,"thing as three times three and that's going to be equal to nine. But what if we went the other way around? What if we started with the nine, and we said, well, what "
,,times
,,"itself is equal to nine? We already know that answer is three, but how could we use a"
,,"symbol that tells us that? So, as you can imagine,"
,,"that symbol is going to be the radical here. So, we could write the"
,,"square root of nine, and when you look at"
,,"this way, you say, okay, what squared is equal to nine? And you would say, well,"
,,"this is going to be equal to, this is going to be equal to, three. And I want you to really look at these two equations right over here, because this is the essence "
,,"of the square root symbol. If you say the square root of nine, you're saying what times"
,,"itself is equal to nine? And, well, that's going to be three. And three squared is equal"
,,"to nine, I can do that again. I can do that many times. I can write four, four"
,,"squared, is equal to 16. Well, what's the square"
,,"root of 16 going to be? Well, it's going to be equal to four. Let me do it again. Actually, let me start"
,,"with the square root. What is the square root of 25 going to be? Well, this is the number that"
,,"times itself is going to be equal to 25 or the number,"
,,"where if I were to square it, I'd get to 25. Well, what number is that, well, that's going to be equal to five. Why, because we know that"
,,"five squared is equal to, five squared is equal to 25. Now, I know that there's a nagging feeling that some of you might be having, because if I were to take negative three, and square it, and square"
,,"it I would also get positive nine, and the same"
,,thing if I were to take negative four and I were
,,"to square the whole thing, I would also get positive"
,,"16, or negative five, and if I square that I"
,,"would also get positive 25. So, why couldn't this thing"
,,"right over here, why can't this square root be positive"
,,"three or negative three? Well, depending on who you talk to, that's actually a reasonable"
,,thing to think about. But when you see a
,,"radical symbol like this, people usually call"
,,"this the principal root. Principal root. Principal, principal square root. Square root. And another way to think"
,,"about it, it's the positive, this is going to be the"
,,positive square root. If someone wants the
,,"negative square root of nine, they might say something like this. They might say the negative,"
,,"let me scroll up a little bit, they might say something like the negative square root of nine. Well, that's going to be"
,,equal to negative three. And what's interesting
,,"about this is, well, if you square both sides"
,,"of this, of this equation, if you were to square both"
,,"sides of this equation, what do you get? Well negative, anything negative"
,,squared becomes a positive. And then the square root
,,"of nine squared, well, that's just going to be nine. And on the right-hand side,"
,,"negative three squared, well, negative three times"
,,"negative three is positive nine. So, it all works out. Nine is equal, nine is equal to nine. And so this is an"
,,"interesting thing, actually. Let me write this a little"
,,"bit more algebraically now. If we were to write, if we were to write the principal root of nine is equal to x. This is, there's only one"
,,"possible x here that satisfies it, because the standard convention, what most mathematicians"
,,"have agreed to view this radical symbol as, is that this is a principal square root, this"
,,"is the positive square root, so there's only one x here. There's only one x that"
,,"would satisfy this, and that is x is equal to three. Now, if I were to write x"
,,"squared is equal to nine, now, this is slightly different. X equals three definitely satisfies this. This could be x equals"
,,"three, but the other thing, the other x that satisfies this is x could also be"
,,"equal to negative three, 'cause negative three squared"
,,"is also equal to nine. So, these two things,"
,,"these two statements, are almost equivalent,"
,,"although when you're looking at this one, there's two"
,,"x's that satisfy this one, while there's only one x"
,,"that satisfies this one, because this is a positive square root. If people wanted to write"
,,something equivalent where you would have two
,,"x's that could satisfy it, you might see something like this. Plus or minus square root"
,,"of nine is equal to x, and now x could take on positive"
,,three or negative three.

Directed Numbers,2Zk6u7Uk5ow,What I want
,,to do in this video is think about what it means to
,,have an opposite of a number. Let me draw a number line here. Let's draw a number line. And let's put some numbers
,,"on this number line. We can start at zero, and if we go to the right"
,,"we have positive numbers. One, two, three, four, five. As we go to the left we"
,,"get more and more negative. So negative one, negative"
,,"two, negative three, negative four, and I can"
,,keep going on and on and on. Let's pick one of these numbers. Let's say that we pick the number three. What is going to be the
,,opposite of the number three? Well the opposite of the
,,number is a number that's the same distance from
,,"zero but on the other side. So three is three to the right of zero. One, two, three. So its opposite is going to"
,,"be three to the left of zero. One, two, three. So the opposite of"
,,"three is negative three. Let me make a little table here. If we have the number, the number. And then we have its opposite. We have its opposite. So we just figured "
,,out that
,,"if you have the number three, its opposite is going"
,,"to be negative three. Now what if your number is negative? What if your number, let's"
,,"say the number negative four. What's the opposite of that? And I encourage you to pause the video and try to think about it on your own. Well, you say, okay, negative"
,,"four is right over here. That's negative four. It is four to the left of zero. One, two, three, four to the left of zero. So its opposite is going to"
,,"be four to the right of it. So one, two, three, four. It's going to be positive. It's going to be positive four. So you're probably starting"
,,"to see a pattern here. The opposite of a number is going to be the opposite sign of that number. If you have a positive three here, its opposite is going"
,,"to be negative three. If you start with negative four, its opposite is going to be positive four. One way to think about"
,,"it, it's going to have the same absolute value but"
,,"have a different sign. Or another way to think about it is, however if this is three"
,,"to the right of zero, its opposite is going to be"
,,three to the left of zero. Or if the number is four
,,"to the left of zero, its opposite is going to be"
,,"four to the right of zero. So we'll do one last one. What is the opposite of... What's going to be the opposite of one? Well one is one to the right of zero, so its "
,,opposite is going to
,,"be one to the left of zero, or negative one. Or another way to think"
,,"about it, one is positive so its opposite is where you're"
,,going to change the sign. Instead of being positive
,,it's going to be negative. It's going to be negative one. Either way that you can think about it.

Directed Numbers,47wjId9k2Hs,"to multiply 2 times 3, that would give us positive 6. And since we're going"

,,"had negative 2 times 3? Well, one way to think"
,,"about, and we'll talk more about the intuition in this"
,,"video and in future videos, is, well, you could"
,,view this as negative 2 repeatedly added three times. So this could be negative 2 plus
,,negative 2 plus negative 2-- not negative 6--
,,"plus negative 2, which would be equal to-- well,"
,,negative 2 plus negative 2 is negative 4 plus another
,,negative 2 is negative 6. So this would be
,,equal to negative 6. Or another way to think about
,,"it is if I had 2 times 3, I would get 6. But because one of these"
,,"two numbers is negative, then my product is"
,,going to be negative. So if I multiply a
,,"negative times a positive, I'm going to get a negative. Now, what if we swap the"
,,order in which we multiply? So if we were to multiply
,,"3 times negative 2. Well, it shouldn't matter. The order in which"
,,we multiply things shouldn't change the product. Whether we multiply 2
,,"times 3, we'll get 6, or if we multiply 3"
,,"times 2, we'll get 6. And so we should have"
,,the same property here. 3 times negative 2 should
,,give us the same result. It's going to be
,,"equal to negative 6. And once again, we say"
,,3 times 2 would be 6. One of these two
,,numbers is negative. And so our product is
,,going to be negative. So we could write
,,a positive times a negative is also
,,going to be a negative. And both of these are
,,just the same thing with the order in which we're
,,multiplying switched around. But this is one
,,"of the two numbers are negative, exactly one. So one negative, one positive"
,,number is being multiplied. Then you will get
,,a negative product. Now let's think about
,,the third circumstance when both of the
,,numbers are negative. I'll just switch
,,colors for fun here. If I were to multiply
,,negative 2 times negative 3-- and this might
,,be the least intuitive for you of all. And here I'm just going to
,,"introduce you to the rule. And in future videos,"
,,we'll explore why this is and why this makes mathematics
,,"more all fit together. But this is going to be,"
,,"you say, well, 2 times 3 would be 6, and I have a"
,,negative times a negative. And one way you
,,can think about it is that the
,,negatives cancel out. And so you will actually
,,end up with a positive 6. I actually don't have to
,,"write a positive here, but I'll write it here"
,,just to reemphasize. This right over here
,,is a positive 6. So we have another
,,rule of thumb here. If I have a negative
,,"times a negative, the negatives are"
,,going to cancel out. And that's going to give
,,"me a positive number. Now, with these out"
,,"of the way, let's just do a bunch of examples. I encourage you to try"
,,"them out before I do them. Pause the video, try"
,,"them out, and see if you get the same answer. So let's try negative"
,,"1 times negative 1. Well, 1 times 1 would be 1,"
,,and we have a negative times a negative. They cancel out. Negative times a negative
,,"give me a positive, so this is going"
,,"to be positive 1. I could just write 1,"
,,or I could literally write a plus sign
,,there to emphasize that this is a positive 1. What happens if I did
,,"negative 1 times 0? Now, this might say,"
,,"wait, this doesn't really fit into any of"
,,these circumstances. 0 is neither positive
,,nor negative. And here you just
,,have to remember anything times 0
,,is going to be 0. So negative 1 times
,,0 is going to be 0. Or I could have said
,,"0 times negative 783, that is also going to be 0. Let me do some interesting ones. What about-- I'll pick a new"
,,"color-- 12 times negative 4? Well, once again, 12 times"
,,positive 4 would be 48. And we're in the circumstance
,,"where one of these two numbers right over here is negative,"
,,this one right over here. If exactly one of the
,,"two numbers is negative, then the product is"
,,going to be negative. We are in this circumstance
,,"right over here. We have one negative, so"
,,the product is negative. You could imagine this as
,,repeatedly adding negative 4 twelve times. And so you would
,,"get to negative 48. Let's do another one. What is 7 times 3? Well, this is a bit of a trick. There are no negative"
,,numbers here. This is just going to be 7 times
,,"3, positive 7 times positive 3, the first circumstance,"
,,which you already knew how to do
,,before this video. This would just be equal to 21. Let's do one more. So if I were to say negative
,,"5 times negative 10, well, once again,"
,,"negative times a negative, the negatives cancel out. Then you're just left"
,,with a positive product. So it's going to be 5 times 10. It's going to be 50. The negative and the
,,negatives cancel out. Your product is
,,going to be positive. That's this situation
,,right over there.
,,
Directed Numbers,s03qez-6JMA,We're asked to simplify
,,"the principal square root of negative 52. And we're going to assume,"
,,because we have a negative 52 here inside of the
,,"radical, that this is the principal branch of the"
,,"complex square root function. That we can actually put,"
,,"input, negative numbers in the domain of this function. That we can actually get"
,,"imaginary, or complex, results. So we can rewrite negative"
,,52 as negative 1 times 52. So this can be rewritten as
,,"the principal square root of negative 1 times 52. And then, if we assume that"
,,this is the principal branch of the complex square root
,,"function, we can rewrite this. This is going to be equal to"
,,"the square root of negative 1 times-- or I should say,"
,,the principal square root of negative 1 times the
,,"principal square root of 52. Now, I want to be"
,,"very, very clear here. You can do what we just did. If we have the principal square"
,,"root of the product of two things, we can rewrite that"
,,"as the principal square root of each, and then"
,,we take the product. But you can only do
,,"this, or I should say, you can only do this if"
,,"either both of these numbers are positive, or only"
,,one of them is negative. You cannot do this if both
,,"of these were negative. For example, you"
,,could not do this. You could not say the
,,principal square root of 52 is equal to negative
,,"1 times negative 52. You could do this. So far, I haven't"
,,said anything wrong. 52 is definitely negative
,,"1 times negative 52. But then, since these"
,,"are both negative, you cannot then say that this"
,,is equal to the square root of negative 1 times the
,,"square root of negative 52. In fact, I invite"
,,you to continue on this train of reasoning. You're going to get
,,"a nonsensical answer. This is not OK. You cannot do this,"
,,right over here. And the reason why you cannot do
,,this is that this property does not work when both of
,,"these numbers are negative. Now with that said, we"
,,can do it if only one of them are negative or both of
,,"them are positive, obviously. Now, the principal square"
,,"root of negative 1, if we're talking about"
,,the principal branch of the complex square
,,"root function, is i. So this right over here"
,,does simplify to i. And then let's think
,,"if we can simplify the square root of 52 any. And to do that, we can think"
,,"about its prime factorization, see if we have any perfect"
,,"squares sitting in there. So 52 is 2 times 26,"
,,and 26 is 2 times 13. So we have 2 times
,,"2 there, or 4 there, which is a perfect square. So we can rewrite this as equal"
,,"to-- Well, we have our i, now. The principal square"
,,root of negative 1 is i. The other square root of
,,negative 1 is negative i. But the principal square
,,root of negative 1 is i. And then we're going
,,to multiply that times the square
,,root of 4 times 13. And this is going to be equal
,,"to i times the square root of 4. i times the square root of 4,"
,,or the principal square root of 4 times the principal
,,square root of 13. The principal square
,,"root of 4 is 2. So this all simplifies, and"
,,"we can switch the order, over here. This is equal to 2 times"
,,the square root of 13. 2 times the principal square
,,"root of 13, I should say, times i. And I just switched"
,,around the order. It makes it a little
,,bit easier to read if I put the i after
,,the numbers over here. But I'm just multiplying i times
,,2 times the square root of 13. That's the same thing
,,as multiplying 2 times the principal square
,,root of 13 times i. And I think this is about as
,,simplified as we can get here.

Directed Numbers,sEU5uaf-Tu4,hello John Zimmerman from Taba class comm and what I want to do here in this video is just quickly go over the rules for positive and negative numbers many of you out there may know and maybe you've experienced yourself your solutions your math solutions you know becoming incorrect because you messed up on one of these integer rules one of these rules that involve positive and negative numbers it's just so easy too easy to confuse some of these rules but you absolutely have to learn these to really master you know middle school and high school mathematics let's just go through very quickly and we'll start with the easy stuff first I want to take a look at the multiplication rules okay so here anytime you're multiplying two numbers where the signs the signs are the same in other words a positive times a positive or negative times a negative okay the answer is always positive okay so two times positive two times positive eight positive 16 okay so once again negative two times negative eight the signs are the same I both negative positive answer positive 16 now in multiplication when you're multiplying two numbers and where one of the signs are opposite ie ones pause and ones negative here I have a positive times a negative doesn't make a difference it could be a negative times a positive the product the answer is going to be negative okay so that's multiplication right there and these are the multiplication rules now division is the same thing okay so multiplication and division pretty straightforward so 16 divided by 4 of course will be a positive 4 negative 16 divided by a negative 4 would be okay once again signs are the 
,,same so the answers gonna be positive that's a positive 4 and now here I have a negative 16 divided by a positive 4 right opposite signs so the answer ok is going to be negative negative 4 alright so this is the easy stuff now let's get to the more challenging or what seems to give students I think a little bit more problems understanding Nishal e is addition now I'm going to kind of change colors here I'm going to tell you if you know how to add positive negative numbers then you'll be able to subtract and you'll see what I'm talking about here in a second all right so eight plus two K two positives the signs are the same okay so you keep the sign obviously it's gonna be a positive ten right all of us probably knew that now let's take a look at this okay we have a negative eight plus a negative two the signs are 
,,the same so you're going to add these values right here and you're going to keep the same sign so this is going to be negative ten all right so right here when you're adding numbers with the same sign you could tell we're just adding adding the numbers and keeping the sign so no problem there here's where it gets a little interesting to think for students right here we have we're adding two numbers with different signs so we have a negative eight plus a two all right so let me ask you which number here don't look at the sign just look at the positive version of the number which one is larger okay the eight or the - all right well clearly this one would be large we call that the absolute value but I don't want I don't want to throw out too many technical terms here okay so between the eight and a two we said that eight is a larger number okay we think of it as a larger number that's positive version and you can tell they here that a has the negative sign so here's what you do 
,,anytime you have two different signs okay you're going to end up subtracting alright so let's actually do that now okay eight and two if I took the difference I'm going to get six right I just kind of forget about that negative sign for a second but now the sign that is associated with the answer is going to have or you're going to be associated with that largest number ie the eight okay so this is you be a negative six all right so it makes sense let's let's try another one here so we have eight plus and negative two okay the signs are different so when the signs are different you're going to end up subtracting okay so subtract just the whole version 
,,or the positive versions of these numbers okay eight and two so if I just told you to subtract them or find the difference you would say okay that's six now out of the eight and two which one has a larger sign or which one is the larger number the eight is a larger number and this eight right here is a positive eight so my answer is going to be a positive six okay all right so once again I'm just kind of quickly trying to refresh some of these rules and of course you know in a few minutes I would expect you to master all this stuff but hopefully this is making sense to most you out there all right so let's talk about subtraction okay here's a deal with subtraction I said if you know how to add you could subtract positive negative numbers so what we're going to do with subtraction problems is turn them into addition problems by doing something called plus negative so here I have 7 minus 10 what I want you to do is to take that subtraction sign and you're going to turn it into 
,,an addition sign and they're going to put that little negative sign and attack it on to the number to the right of that of that addition symbol okay so you see what 
,,I did there I said seven instead of 7 minus 10 I'm going 7 plus negative 10 and then now of course I'm going to go ahead and do this addition problem the signs are different so I'm going to subtract the numbers okay and then here 10 is the larger number and it has a negative sign so I'm going to go ahead and make that a negative 3 for my answer okay and by the way too what I'm trying to do is just give you kind of a procedural some rules here I'm trying to teach you all the concepts involved in integers which are very important by the way just trying to get you some simple rules so you don't mess this up when you're actually doing calculations okay let's take a look at this last one in here we have 3 minus a minus 6 so I'm going to go ahead and turn this into a positive or excuse me an addition problem and then I'm going to tack on out negative sign to the number to the right but now I have a negative of a negative 6 or the opposite of a negative 6 okay so if I told you what's the opposite of negative 6 you would say oh that's positive six this really turns into this problem three plus a positive six or three plus six and that is nine okay so pretty much a real fast review listen if you need a lot more information on this and other topics come on over to tablet class comm we have a 30 day free trial tons of stuff we have full courses the whole idea with our products it's clear and understandable we we really design our lessons to be explained and that's the key word explained not taught down too but explain in a way that you understand so hopefully and come over and check us out at Taba class comm take one hour 30 day free trials and learn and master this stuff so your headaches and mathematics go away good luck to yourself
,,
Directed Numbers,5NI0VX_KqFo,or so here what you're doing you can start off at the first number two okay so let's start right over here at two and when you subtract okay that means you're taking away right so when you subtract that means you're actually gonna be going backwards okay but when you work with negative numbers see the negative three here negative numbers actually tell you to do the opposite okay so if you're subtracting normally we would go backwards one two three because it's getting smaller but the negative number tells us to do the opposite so we're actually going to go instead of going backwards three we're going to go forwards three one two three and you can see we end up at five okay so we understand about negative numbers doing the opposite we understand how subtraction normally takes us backwards on the number line but I'm going to show you a shortcut and this will help you as you do more complicated problems what you can do is when you see a subtraction problem think of it as an addition problem so what we're going to do is subtraction is really like adding the opposite so if you change this from subtraction to addition you want to change this sign to the opposite if it's positive you make it negative if it's negative you make it positive now you can see we have a simple problem here it's just two plus three which we learned a long time ago that's just five right okay let's go to the next one negative three minus one okay one way to think about this is the number line 
,,you could start at negative three subtraction says we're gonna go to the left one place and we're at negative four right easy the other way to do it is we could say 
,,hmm subtraction is like adding the opposites if I change this I don't want to change the overall value of the problem I have to change this to the opposite so negative three plus negative one we can talk about the scale like we talked about in the previous video about comparing you know positive and negative numbers if we have a negative three plus negative one it's like stacking up three bricks on the left side plus another brick on the left side the scale is going to tilt to the left because it's heavier by 4 bricks okay there's nothing on the right to counterbalance it so we have negative four over here in this example negative four minus negative - so what I would do okay if you wanted to think of the number line we'd start off over here at negative four okay if we subtract we would go to the left right because subtracting is making the numbers smaller but we're working with a negative two negative numbers tell us to do the opposite so instead of going left - we're gonna 
,,go right - and that's gonna put us at negative two now it gets a little bit more complicated when you start having all these negatives in your problem so what I suggest and recommend after you have a feel for how positive and negative numbers work is just take this little shortcut and make subtraction like adding the opposite if you change this sign change this to the opposite and you've got it so we've got negative 4 plus 2 think about putting 4 bricks on this side 2 bricks on this side which way is it going to tilt well it's going to tilt to the heavier side right why because it's heavier by 2 okay 2 of these are gonna cancel out with two of these that would be balanced but it's actually heavier on that side by 2 and so you can see you're gonna have negative 2 it's tilting towards a negative side ok the last example here we're subtracting so that's like adding the opposite we have a negative 700 plus a negative 100 okay so you spend $700 + you spend another hundred dollars 
,,so far you've spent $800 so you've decreased whatever was in your account let's say by $800 so these are just some simple and easy and direct ways to work with positive and negative numbers when you're subtracting just think about changing it to adding the opposite and then you can use that scale analogy that I was showing you and you'll you'll have it so I'll see you in the next video
,,
Directed Numbers,-QHff5pRdM8, So we have a
,,"bunch of numbers listed up here, and my goal, in this video,"
,,is to see if we can classify them into different types
,,"of number categories, and let me draw the categories. So this circle, over here, this represents all of the numbers that can be represented as the fraction of two integers, and, of"
,,"course, the denominator can't be equal to zero,"
,,because we don't know what it means to put a
,,"zero in the denominator. So, let's call these, or the standard way of calling these things. These things can be"
,,"represented as a fraction of two integers, we call"
,,these rational numbers. Rational numbers. And if something cannot be
,,"represented as a fraction of two integers, we"
,,call irrational numbers. Irrational numbers. Irrational numbers. And the size of these circles don't show how large these sets are. There's actually an
,,infinite number of rational and an infinite number
,,"of irrational numbers. So, these are the irrational numbers. Irrational. So, these cannot be"
,,"represented as a fraction of two integers. And then, within rational numbers, you have integers themselves. So, I'll do that in, let me"
,,"do that in this blue color. Integers. So, integers are numbers that don't have to be represented as a"
,,"fraction or a decimal. So, these are integers, right over here. Integers. And then a subset of"
,,"integers are whole numbers. So, if you essentially say"
,,"the non-negative integers, you're then talking about whole numbers. So let me do that subset, right over here. So, these are going to"
,,"be the whole numbers. So, whole numbers. Whole numbers, right over here. And, actually, let me just label it all. These are rational... Let me do that in the same color. Rational numbers. And, of course, irrational numbers. Irrational numbers. Irrational numbers. An integer. Well, if I could say,"
,,"Look, that is an integer. Let's think about the integers."" But I wouldn't say, ""Let's"
,,"just think about the rational."" I'd say, ""Let's think about"
,,"the rational numbers."" All right, now that we have"
,,"these categories in place, let's categorize them. Like always, pause the video. See if you can figure out what category these numbers fall into. Where would you put "
,,"them on this diagram? So, let's start off with three. This is positive three. It can be definitely"
,,"represented as a fraction. You can represent it as three over one. But, it doesn't have to be"
,,"represented as a fraction. It, literally, could be just"
,,"a three, right over there, but it's also non-negative. So three is a whole number. So three, and maybe I'll do it"
,,"in the color of the category. So, three is a whole number. So, it's a member of that set. But if you're a whole number,"
,,"you're also an integer, and you're also a rational number. So, three is a whole"
,,"number, it's an integer, and it's a rational number. Now, let's think about negative five. Now, negative five, once"
,,"again, it can be represented as a fraction, but it doesn't have to be, but it is negative. So, it's not gonna be a whole number. So, negative five is going"
,,"to sit right over here. It's an integer, and if you're an integer, you're definitely going"
,,"to be a rational number, but it's not a whole number"
,,"because it is negative. Now we have 0.25. Well, this, for sure, can be"
,,"represented as a fraction. This is 25-hundredths, right over here. So, we can represent that as a fraction of two integers, I should say. It's 25-hundredths. But there's no way to represent this except using a fraction of two integers. So, 0.25 is a rational number, but it's not an integer"
,,"and not a whole number. Now what about 22 over seven. Well, here it's clearly"
,,"represented, already, as a fraction of two integers, but I don't think I can"
,,"represent this any other, except as a fraction of two integers. I can't somehow make this without using a fraction"
,,"or some type of decimal that might repeat. So, this, right over here, this would also be a rational number, but it's not an integer,"
,,"not a whole number. Now this over here. 0.2713. Now the 13 repeats. This is the same thing as 0.27131313, that's what line up there represents. Now, you might not realize it yet, but any number that repeats eventually, this one does repeat eventually, you have the .1313, or you have the 0.27131313, any number like this can be   "
,,"represented as a fraction. For example, and I'm"
,,"not going to do it here, just for the sake of time, but, for example, 0.3, repeating, that's the same thing as one-third. And later on, we're gonna see techniques of how do you convert this to"
,,"a fraction of two integers. But, for our sake, we just know that this can be represented"
,,"as a fraction of two integers just the way that 0.3, repeating, can be. And so, we would put this"
,,"under rational numbers. 0.2713, repeating. But you have to represent"
,,"it either as a decimal or a fraction of integers. If you didn't have to, then"
,,"it could have been an integer, but we'll throw it up"
,,"there in rational numbers. Now the square root of ten. Square root of ten. This is interesting. So, any square root of"
,,"a non-perfect square is going to be irrational. So, this is gonna be irrational. I'm not proving it to you here, but you cannot represent this as the ratio of two integers, or a"
,,"fraction with two integers, with an integer in the numerator and an integer in the denominator. This will be, if you were to represent it as a decimal, it will not repeat. It'll just keep being new and new digits. It will not repeat over time. So, this, right over here,"
,,is an irrational number. It's not rational. It cannot be represented as
,,"the ratio of two integers. All right, 14 over seven. This is the ratio of two integers. So, this, for sure, is rational. But if you think about it, 14 over seven, that's another way of saying, 14 over seven is the same thing as two. These two things are equivalent. So, 14 over seven is"
,,"the same thing as two. So, this is actually a whole number. It doesn't look like a whole number, but, remember, a whole number is a non-negative number that doesn't "
,,need to be represented as the
,,"ratio of two integers. And this one, even though"
,,we did represent it as the ratio of two
,,"integers, it doesn't need to be represented as the"
,,"ratio of two integers. You could have represent this as just two. So, that's going to be a whole number. 14 over seven, which is"
,,"the same thing as two, that is a whole number. Now, two-pi. Now pi is an irrational... Pi is an irrational number. So if we just take a multiple of pi, if we just take a integer multiple of pi, like that, this is also going"
,,to be an irrational number. If you looked at its
,,"decimal representation, it will never repeat. So that's two-pi, right over there. Now what about... Let me do that same, since"
,,"I've been consistent, relatively consistent, with the colors. So, this is two-pi right over there. Now, what about the"
,,"negative square root of 25. Well, 25's a perfect square. Square root of that's just gonna be five. So, this thing is going to be, this thing is going to be"
,,"equivalent to negative five. So, this is just another representation of this, right over here. So, it is an integer. It's not a whole number"
,,"because it's negative, but it's an integer. Negative square root of 25. These two things are actually... These two things are"
,,"actually the same number, just different ways of representing them. And then you have, let's"
,,"see, you have the square root of nine over... The square root of nine over seven. Well, what's the principal root of nine? This thing is gonna be the same thing, this thing is the same... Let me do this in a different color. This is the same thing as, square root of nine is three, it's the principal root of"
,,"nine, so it's three-sevenths. So, this is a ratio of two integers. This is a rational number. Square root of nine over seven is the same thing as three-sevenths. Now, let me just give you"
,,"one more just for the road. What about pi over pi? What is that going to be? Well, pi divided by pi is"
,,"going to be equal to one. So, this is actually a whole number. So I could write pi over"
,,"pi, right over there. That's just a very"
,,fancy way of saying one.

Directed Numbers,-8KVaw3T9JU,welcome to math with mr. J in this video we're going to be covering subtracting negative numbers and as you can see there are four problems on your screen that we're going to solve there are also two number lines that are going to help us visualize and see exactly what we're doing when we subtract negative numbers so let's jump 
,,right in to number one so for number one we have two minus negative three and subtraction tells us to go backwards on a number line right so for example if we had ten minus three we know that equals seven right we start at ten and we take away one two three and we end at seven now when we're working with negative numbers they actually tell us the opposite so if we do ten my art I'm sorry two minus negative three we start at two here and we're going to take away negative three and again that negative tells us to do the opposite so we're not going to go backwards on the number line we're actually going to go forwards three one two three and we end at a positive five now a simpler way or easier way to think of these problems without writing it out on a number line the number line initially helps us visualize and see 
,,what we're doing but eventually you need to get to a point where you don't need the number line and whenever we're subtracting negative numbers all we need to do is 
,,add the opposite so for number one we keep two as is we change this to addition and we need to switch the sign of the second number the opposite so instead of negative three we're going to have a positive three and that gives us five same answer as when we wrote it out on a number line so when you add the opposite make sure you 
,,don't just change this to addition that completely changes the problem in order to switch it to addition you have to have that the opposite of that second number in 
,,the problem so let's go to number two let's add the opposite first so we have negative four and let's add the opposite of positive two we have a positive two here so the opposite would be a negative two so negative four plus a negative two gives us a total of negative six let's write it out on the number line so we start at negative four and we're subtracting this positive two here which means we go to the left on the number line we're taking away two so one two and we end at negative six so our number line gave us the same answer number three let's add the opposite here so we have a negative nine plus what's the opposite of negative three well a positive three and this is going to give us negative nine plus that three a negative six let's go over to this number line here the bottom left will start at negative nine and we're subtracting a negative three and remember this negative three tells us to do the opposite because of this negative sign so instead of going to the left when we subtract we go to the right three one two three and we end at negative six so the same as when we added the opposite so number four we have negative twenty-five change to addition and change the negative eight to the opposite which would give us a positive eight add the opposite so negative 25 plus that positive 8 gives us a negative 17 so there you have it that's subtracting negative numbers and just remember add the opposite and it will make that problem easier to tackle thanks so

Directed Numbers,JnpqlXN9Whw,We already know that
,,2 to the fourth power can be viewed as
,,starting with a 1 and then multiplying
,,"it by 2 four times. So let me do that. So times 2, times"
,,"2, times 2, times 2. And that will give us, let's"
,,"see, 2 times 2 is 4, 8, 16. So that will give us 16. Now I will ask you a more"
,,interesting question. What do you think 2 to
,,the negative 4 power is? And I encourage you to pause
,,"the video and think about that. Well, you might be"
,,"tempted to say, oh maybe it's negative 16 or"
,,"something like that, but remember what the exponent"
,,operation is trying to do. One way of viewing it
,,is this is telling us how many times are we going to
,,multiply 2 times negative 1? But here we're going to
,,"multiply negative 4 times. Well, what does negative"
,,traditionally mean? Negative traditionally
,,means the opposite. So here this is how many times
,,you're going to multiply. Maybe when we make it
,,"negative this says, how many times are"
,,"we going to, starting with the 1, how many times"
,,are we going to divide by 2? So let's think about
,,that a little that. So this could be
,,"viewed as 1 times, and we're going to"
,,"divide by 2 four times. Well, dividing by 2 is the same"
,,thing as multiplying by 1/2. So we could say that
,,"this is 1 times 1/2, times-- let me just"
,,"do it in one color. So 1 times 1/2, times"
,,"1/2, times 1/2, times 1/2. Notice multiplying"
,,by 1/2 four times is the exact same thing as
,,dividing by 2 four times. And in this situation
,,"this would get you, well 1/2, well 1 times 1/2 half"
,,"is just 1/2, times 1/2 is 1/4, times 1/2 is 1/8,"
,,times 1/2 is 1/16. And so you probably see
,,the relationship here. If you're-- this is essentially
,,you're starting with the 1 and you're dividing
,,by 2 four times. You could also say that 2-- I'm
,,going to do the same colors-- 2 to the negative 4 is
,,the same thing as 1/2 to the fourth power. Let me color code
,,it nicely so you realize what the
,,negative is doing. So this negative
,,right over here-- let me do that in
,,"a better color, I'll do it in magenta,"
,,something that jumps out. So this negative
,,"right over here, this is what's causing"
,,us to go one over. So 2 to the negative
,,"4 is the same thing, based on the way we've"
,,"defined it just up right here, as reciprocal of 2 to"
,,"the fourth, or 1 over 2 to the fourth. And so you could view this as"
,,"being 1/2 times 2 times 2 times 2, if you just view"
,,2 to the fourth as taking four 2's
,,and multiplying them. Or if you use this
,,"idea right over here, you could view it"
,,as starting with a 1 and multiplying it
,,"by 2 four times. Either way, you are"
,,going to get 1/16. So let's do a few
,,more examples of this just so that we make sure
,,things are clear to us. So let's try 3 to the
,,"negative third power. So remember, whenever"
,,"you see that negative, what my brain"
,,always does is say I need to take the
,,reciprocal here. So this is going
,,"to be equal to, I'm going to highlight"
,,"the negative again, this is going to be 1"
,,over 3 to the third power. Which would be equal to 1/3
,,"times 3 times 3, or 1 times 3 times 3 times 3,"
,,"is going to be 27. So this is going to be 1/27. Let's try another example,"
,,I'll do two or three more. So let's take a negative number
,,"to a negative exponent, just to see if we can"
,,confuse ourselves. So let's take the
,,"number negative 4, and let's take it-- I don't want"
,,my numbers to get too big too fast. So let's just take
,,negative 2 and let's take it to the negative 3 power. I'll make my negatives in
,,"magenta, negative 3 power. So at first this"
,,"might be daunting, do the negatives cancel? And that will just be the"
,,remnants in your brain that are trying to think
,,"of multiplying negatives. Do not apply that here. Remember, you see a"
,,"negative exponent, that just means the reciprocal"
,,of the positive exponent. So 1 over negative 2
,,"to the third power, to the positive third power. And this is equal to 1"
,,over negative 2 times negative 2 times negative 2. Or you could view it as
,,1 times negative 2 times negative 2 times
,,"negative 2, which is going to give you 1 over"
,,negative 8 or negative 1/8. Let me scroll over
,,"a little bit, I don't want to have to"
,,start squishing things. So this is equal
,,"to negative 1/8. Let's do one more example,"
,,just in an attempt to confuse ourselves. Let's take 5/8 and raise
,,"this to the negative 2 power. So once again, this negative,"
,,oh I got at a fraction is a negative here. Remember this just means 1
,,over 5/8 to the second power. So this is just going
,,"to be the same thing as 1 over 5/8 squared,"
,,which is going to be the same thing-- so this
,,"is going to be equal to-- I'm trying to color code it, 1 over"
,,"5/8 times 5/8, which is 25/64. 1 over 25/64 is just"
,,going to be 64/25. So another way to
,,"think about it is, you're going to take"
,,the reciprocal of this and raise it to the
,,positive exponent. So another way you could
,,have thought about this is 5/8 to the negative 2 power. Let me just take the
,,"reciprocal of this, 8/5 and raise it to the"
,,positive 2 power. So all of these
,,statements are equivalent. And that would have
,,applied even when you're dealing with
,,"non-fractions as your base right over here. So 2, you could say well this"
,,is going to be the same thing. 2 to the negative
,,4 is going to be the same thing as
,,taking my reciprocal. So this is going to
,,be the same thing as taking the reciprocal
,,"of 2, which is 1/2 and raising it to"
,,the positive 4 power.

Directed Numbers,CfkaifC7tGY,welcome to math with mr j in this video i'm going to cover how to add integers now when it comes to adding integers there are different strategies you can use in order to solve these so as we go through the four examples i'll give you a couple of different ways to think through these problems and get to that final answer so let's jump into number one where we have negative five plus seven and the strategy we're going to use first is at the top of the screen so the first thing we need to do 
,,is see if we have different signs or the same signs in the case of number one we have a negative five and a positive seven so we have different signs so we're going 
,,to look right here so what we need to do we need to find the absolute value of our integers and then we'll take the greater absolute value and subtract the smaller absolute value that's going to give us our answer we'll use the sign of the greater absolute value for that final answer so let's find our absolute values and remember absolute value is the distance from 0 the absolute value of negative 5 is 5 and the absolute value of 7 a positive 7 is 7. so we take the greater absolute value which would be 7 and subtract the smaller absolute value which is five seven minus five is two now we need to use the sign of the greater absolute value so the greater absolute value would be this seven here and in the original problem this 7 it's a positive 7 so that means our answer is going to be a positive 2. now the other strategy we can use would be using our overall number sense and knowledge of integers in order to solve this using mental math so let me rewrite the problem we have negative five plus seven so one way to think through this problem using mental math would be thinking okay we're starting at negative five and we're adding a positive seven so we are increasing in value well negative five plus a positive five gets us to zero but we have seven which is two more than that positive five so let's go two more than zero and we land on positive two now i do wanna mention i have a video that goes through how to add integers using a number line and this really helps visualize what's going on within these problems and it's going to help with mental math when it comes to adding integers i'll drop that link down in the description so let's move on to number two where we have a positive 20 plus a negative 12. so again we have different signs so let's find the absolute value of our integers here so the absolute value of 20 is 20 and the absolute value of negative 12 is 12. so we need to do the greater absolute value 20 minus the smaller absolute value of 12 and we get 8. so we need to use the sign of the greater absolute value so the greater absolute value is 20 and in the original problem it was a positive 20. so our answer is a positive 8. let's think through this using mental math as well so i'll rewrite the problem 20 plus negative 12. so we are starting at a positive 20 and we're adding a negative 12. so we are decreasing in value by 12 from 20. so we can almost think of this as 20 and we are taking away or subtracting 12 because we are decreasing in value so we would end up at a positive eight again we are going from a positive 20 and we are decreasing in value by 12 so we would land on a positive eight for our answer on to number three where we have negative 13 plus a negative four so we have the same signs here so we will look right here so we need to add the 
,,absolute values and use the same sign from the problem so let's find our absolute values here so the absolute value of negative 13 would be 13 and the absolute value of negative 4 would be 4. so we need to add the absolute values there so 13 plus 4 is 17. and we use the sign from the problem so the sign from the problem well negative 13 and negative 4 both negatives so our answer is negative 17. now using mental math well let's think negative 13 plus a negative 4. we are starting at a negative number negative 13 right and we are adding a negative 4. so we are decreasing in value or going down in value by 4. so if we start at negative 13 and decrease in value by 4 go down the number line to the left by 4 we end up at negative 17. and lastly number four we have negative 25 plus a negative eight so same signs again so we need to add the absolute values negative 25 has an absolute value of 25 and negative 8 has an absolute value of 8. so add those and we get 33 and use the same sign from the problem which they are both negative so our answer is negative so negative 33 mental math same thing as number three we are starting at a negative 25 and we're adding a negative eight so we are decreasing in value going further left on the number line and we end up at negative 33. so there you have it there are a couple of different strategies that you can use in order to add integers i hope that helped thanks so much for watching until next time peace

Directed Numbers,-4bTgmmWI9k,What I
,,hope to do in this video is go through a bunch of examples that will hopefully give us
,,"an even better understanding of what it means to add or subtract a positive or a negative number. And as I go through these, I encourage you to keep pausing the video and"
,,"try to solve it on your own and then see how we can solve it together. So let's start. If I were to say that negative one is equal to seven minus blank, what should "
,,"be in that blank? What number, either positive or negative, I guess it could be zero,"
,,"what would that number be? Alright, let's work through it together. So let me throw a number line here. So let me put a number"
,,line right over here. Now let's just think
,,"about what's going on. So we are trying to get to negative one. We're trying to get to negative one and we are starting at seven. So seven; this is five, six, seven. So we're starting at seven. So what do we have to subtract from seven to get to this negative one here. Well, we have to move"
,,"one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Eight to the left. So what we just did is we just subtracted eight from seven to get to negative one. So what are we "
,,going to subtract? We need to subtract eight. Let's do another one of
,,"these, this is kind of fun. Let's say we need to figure out, let's say we have negative 10 plus blank is equal to negative five. What would the blank be in this case? Let's give ourselves a number line again. Let's give ourselves a number"
,,"line again and let's see. We are going to start at negative 10, so let's see, this is"
,,negative 10 right over here. So we're gonna start at negative 10 and we're gonna add something
,,"to it to get to negative five. Remember, negative five"
,,is right over here. So if we're adding that
,,"means we're going to be going to the right on the number line. That is if we're adding a positive number. And we see here we're going to the right, we're going from "
,,negative
,,"10 to negative five, so we are going to be"
,,adding a positive number. If we added a negative number
,,"we would move to the left. So how much are we adding? Well, let's just count. We're gonna add one,"
,,"two, three, four, five. So we just added positive five. So that would be a five right there. Negative 10 plus five is"
,,equal to negative five. We just became five less negative is one way to think about it. Let's do another one! Alright. So let's say we had four is equal to negative 
,,two plus blank. Four is equal to negative two plus blank. We could do this the same
,,way we've been doing others. Let's get our number line out here. Let's get our number line
,,"out here and let's see. One way to think about it,"
,,"our goal, is to get four. Our goal is four right over here. So this is one, two, three,"
,,"four, get to positive four. That's positive four right there. We're starting at negative two... Let me do this in a different color. We're starting at negative two. "
,,We're saying four is the
,,"same thing as negative two, negative two is right over here, negative two plus some amount. And it's clear we're gonna"
,,"be moving to the right by, let's see, we're gonna"
,,"move to the right by one, two, three, four, five, six. So we moved to the right by six. So we added six. So negative two plus six is equal to four. This is fascinating. Actually, let's just do several"
,,"more of these, I can't stop. (laughs)"
,,"Alright. So let's say we wanted to figure out, I have six plus blank. Six plus blank is equal to negative eight. Like always, try to pause the video and figure out what this"
,,"blank is going to be. Let me throw my number line back here. So my number line. And one way to think about it is I am starting at six. So it's five, this is six right over here. And I'm gonna add something"
,,to get to negative eight. To get to negative eight
,,"this is negative five, negative six, negative"
,,"seven, negative eight. I want to get right over here, I want to get to negative eight. So what do I have to do to get"
,,from six to negative eight? To go from six to negative eight. We're clear I have to go to
,,"the left on the number line. And how much do I have to go to the left? Well, let's count it. I have to go one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. So going 14 to the left, you could say that I just subtracted 14. And if we phrase it as six plus what is equal to negative eight? Well, six plus negative 14. If this said six minus something I could have just said six minus 14, but if it's saying six plus what it's going to be six plus negative 14."

Directed Numbers,bQ-KR3clFgs,"Now that we know a little bit about multiplying positive and negative numbers, Let's think about how how we can divide them. Now what you'll see is that it's actually a very similar methodology. That if both are positive, you'll get a positive answer. If one is negative, or the other, but not both, you'll get a negative answer. "
,,"And if both are negative, they'll cancel out and you'll get a positive answer. But let's apply and I encourage you to pause this video and try these out yourself and then see if you get the same answer that I'm going to get. So eight (8) divided by negative two (-2). So if I just said eight (8) divided by two (2), that would be "
,,"a positive four (4), but since exactly one of these two numbers are negative, this one right over here, the answer is going to be negative. So eight (8) divided by negative two (-2) is negative four (-4). Now negative sixteen (-16) divided by positive four (4)-- now be very careful here. If I just said positive sixteen (16) divided by positive four (4), that would just be four (4). But because one of these two numbers is negative, and exactly one of these two numbers is negative, then I'm going to get a negative answer. Now I have negative thirty (-30) divided by negative five (-5). If I just said thirty (30) divided by five (5), I'd get a positive six (6). And because I have a negative divided by a negative, the negatives cancel out, so my answer will still be positive six (6)! And I could even write a positive (+) out there, I don't have to, but this is a positive six (6). A negative divided by a negative, just like a negative times a negative, you're gonna get a positive answer. Eighteen (18) divided by two (2)! And this is a little bit of a trick question. This is what you knew how to do before we even talked about negative numbers: "
,,"This is a positive divided by a positive. Which is going to be a positive. So that is going to be equal to positive nine (9). Now we start doing some interesting things, here's kind of a compound problem. We have some multiplication and some division going on. And so first right over here, the way this is written, we're gonna wanna multiply the numerator out, and if you're not familiar with this little dot symbol, it's just another way of writing multiplication. I could've written this little ""x"" thing over here but what you're gonna see in Algebra is that the dot become much more common. Because the X becomes used for other-- People don't want to confuse it with the letter X which gets used a lot in Algebra. That's why they used the dot very often. So this just says negative seven (-7) times three (3) in the numerator, and we're gonna take that product and divide it by negative one (-1). So the numerator, negative seven (-7) times three (3), positive seven (7) times three (3) would be twenty-one (21), but since exactly one of these two are negative, this is going to be negative twenty-one (-21), that's gonna be negative twenty-one (-21) over negative one (-1). And so negative twenty-one (-21) divided by negative one (-1), negative divided by a negative is going to be a positive. So this is going to be a positive twenty-one (21). Let me write all these things down. So if I were to take a positive divided by a negative, that's going to be a negative. If I had a "
,,"negative divided by a positive, that's also going to be a negative. If I have a negative divided by a negative, that's going to give me a positive, and if obviously "
,,"a positive divided by a positive, that's also going to give me a positive. Now let's do this last one over here. This is actually all multiplication, but it's interesting, because we're multiplying three (3) things, which we haven't done yet. And we could just go from left to right over here, and we could first think about negative two (-2) times negative seven (-7). Negative two (-2) times negative seven (-7). They are both negatives, and negatives cancel out, so this would give us, this part right over here, will give us positive fourteen (14). And so we're going to multiply positive fourteen (14) times this negative one (-1), times -1. Now we have a positive times a negative. Exactly one of them is negative, so this is going to be negative answer, it's gonna give me negative fourteen (-14). Now let me give you "
,,"a couple of more, I guess we could call these trick problems. What would happen if I had zero (0) divided by negative five (-5). Well this is zero negative fifths So zero divided by anything that's non-zero is just going to equal to zero. But what if it were the other way around? What happens if we said negative five divided by "
,,"zero? Well, we don't know what happens when you divide things by zero. We haven't defined that. There's arguments for multiple ways to conceptualize this, so we traditionally do say that this is undefined. We haven't defined what happens when something is divided by zero. And similarly, even when we had zero divided by zero, this is still, this is still, undefined."

Directed Numbers,1DKWG5CBeek,welcome to math with mr j in this video i'm going to cover how to subtract integers now when it comes to subtracting integers we're actually going to add the opposite and we have four examples here that we're going to go through together in order to get this down so let's jump into number one where we have six minus negative four so let's add the opposite so we start with a positive six and we add the opposite of negative 4 which is a positive 4 and 6 plus 4 gives us 10 and that's our final answer of positive 10. now that answer may look incorrect because if you think about it we started with a positive 6 and this is a subtraction problem and we somehow ended up with a positive 10. so we increased in value although this was a subtraction problem so that kind of goes against what we typically think when it comes to subtraction and that's because when you subtract a negative you are increasing in value and you can think of it like this and i still remember this from when i learned about subtracting integers so when you subtract a negative think of it like this taking away or subtracting debt which is a positive or a good thing so you are increasing in value so something to think about and i do have a video where i go through subtracting integers using number lines and that video can help with visualizing what's going on within these problems and just give a better overall understanding of subtracting integers so let's move on to number two where we have a negative five minus three so let's add the opposite so negative five plus the opposite of a positive three is a negative three so we're starting at negative five and we're 
,,adding negative three so we are decreasing in values so we are going to end up with an answer of negative eight let's move on to number three where we have negative 
,,one minus negative nine negative one and then add the opposite so the opposite of negative nine is a positive nine negative 1 plus 9 well that's going to give us a positive 8 for our answer so remember when we subtract a negative we actually increase in value from what we started with for example number three negative one we started with and we increased by a positive nine there we increased by nine to give us an answer of a positive eight and lastly number four negative eight minus negative seven add the opposite the opposite of negative seven is a positive seven so negative eight plus seven gives us a negative one so there you have it there's how you subtract integers use the strategy of adding the opposite i hope that helped thanks so much for watching until next time peace
,,
Directed Numbers,bAerID24QJ0,Welcome to level one
,,linear equations. So let's start
,,doing some problems. So let's say I had the equation
,,"5-- a big fat 5, 5x equals 20. So at first this might look"
,,"a little unfamiliar for you, but if I were to"
,,"rephrase this, I think you'll realize this"
,,is a pretty easy problem. This is the same thing as
,,saying 5 times question mark equals 20. And the reason we do the
,,notation a little bit-- we write the 5 next
,,"to the x, because when you write a number right"
,,"next to a variable, you assume that you're"
,,multiplying them. So this is just
,,"saying 5 times x, so instead of a question"
,,"mark, we're writing an x. So 5 times x is equal to 20. Now, most of you all could"
,,"do that in your head. You could say, well, what"
,,"number times 5 is equal to 20? Well, it equals 4. But I'll show you a way to do"
,,it systematically just in case that 5 was a more
,,complicated number. So let me make my pen
,,"a little thinner, OK. So rewriting it, if"
,,"I had 5x equals 20, we could do two things"
,,and they're essentially the same thing. We could say we just divide
,,"both sides of this equation by 5, in which case, the left"
,,"hand side, those two 5's will cancel out, we'll get x. And the right hand side,"
,,"20 divided by 5 is 4, and we would have solved it. Another way to do it, and this"
,,"is actually the exact same way, we're just phrasing"
,,"it a little different. If you said 5x equals 20,"
,,"instead of dividing by 5, we could multiply by 1/5. And if you look at that, you can"
,,realize that multiplying by 1/5 is the same thing
,,"as dividing by 5, if you know the difference"
,,between dividing and multiplying fractions. And then that gets the
,,"same thing, 1/5 times 5 is 1, so you're just"
,,left with an x equals 4. I tend to focus a
,,little bit more on this because when we start having
,,"fractions instead of a 5, it's easier just to think about"
,,"multiplying by the reciprocal. Actually, let's do one"
,,of those right now. So let's say I had negative
,,"3/4 times x equals 10/13. Now, this is a harder problem. I can't do this one in my head. We're saying negative"
,,3/4 times some number x is equal to 10/13. If someone came up to you on
,,"the street and asked you that, I think you'd be like me,"
,,and you'd be pretty stumped. But let's work it
,,"out algebraically. Well, we do the same thing. We multiply both sides"
,,"by the coefficient on x. So the coefficient, all that"
,,"is, all that fancy word means, is the number that's"
,,being multiplied by x. So what's the
,,"reciprocal of minus 3/4. Well, it's minus 4/3 times,"
,,"and dot is another way to use times, and"
,,"you're probably wondering why in algebra, there"
,,are all these other conventions for doing times
,,as opposed to just the traditional
,,"multiplication sign. And the main reason is, I think,"
,,just a regular multiplication sign gets confused
,,"with the variable x, so they thought of either using"
,,"a dot if you're multiplying two constants, or just writing"
,,it next to a variable to imply you're
,,multiplying a variable. So if we multiply the left
,,"hand side by negative 4/3, we also have to"
,,do the same thing to the right hand
,,"side, minus 4/3. The left hand side, the"
,,"minus 4/3 and the 3/4, they cancel out. You could work it out on"
,,"your own to see that they do. They equal 1, so we're just"
,,"left with x is equal to 10 times minus 4 is minus 40, 13 times"
,,"3, well, that's equal to 39. So we get x is equal"
,,to minus 40/39. And I like to leave
,,my fractions improper because it's easier
,,to deal with them. But you could also view
,,that-- that's minus-- if you wanted to write it
,,"as a mixed number, that's minus 1 and 1/39. I tend to keep it like this. Let's check to make"
,,sure that's right. The cool thing about algebra is
,,you can always get your answer and put it back into
,,the original equation to make sure you are right. So the original equation
,,"was minus 3/4 times x, and here we'll substitute"
,,"the x back into the equation. Wherever we saw x, we'll"
,,"now put our answer. So it's minus 40/39, and"
,,"our original equation said that equals 10/13. Well, and once"
,,"again, when I just write the 3/4 right next to"
,,"the parentheses like that, that's just another"
,,way of writing times. So minus 3 times minus
,,"40, it is minus 100-- Actually, we could do"
,,something a little bit simpler. This 4 becomes a 1
,,and this becomes a 10. If you remember when you're
,,"multiplying fractions, you can simplify it like that. So it actually becomes"
,,"minus-- actually, plus 30, because we have a minus times"
,,"a minus and 3 times 10, over, the 4 is now 1, so all"
,,"we have left is 39. And 30/39, if we divide the"
,,"top and the bottom by 3, we get 10 over 13, which"
,,is the same thing as what the equation said
,,"we would get, so we know that we've got"
,,the right answer. Let's do one more problem. Minus 5/6x is equal to 7/8. And if you want to
,,"try this problem yourself, now's a"
,,"good time to pause, and I'm going to start"
,,doing the problem right now. So same thing. What's the reciprocal
,,"of minus 5/6? Well, it's minus 6/5. We multiply that. If you do that on"
,,"the left hand side, we have to do it on the"
,,"right hand side as well. Minus 6/5. The left hand side, the"
,,minus 6/5 and the minus 5/6 cancel out. We're just left with x. And the right hand
,,"side, we have, well, we can divide both"

,,3 is minus 21/20. And assuming I haven't
,,"made any careless mistakes, that should be right. Actually, let's just"
,,"check that real quick. Minus 5/6 times minus 21/20. Well, that equals"
,,"5, make that into 1. Turn this into a 4. Make this into a 2. Make this into a 7. Negative times"

Directed Numbers,Ksu1lo312BM,Consider the numbers
,,"1/3, 7, and negative 15. To which sets of"
,,"numbers, listed below, does each of these"
,,numbers belong? And they give us a bunch of
,,"different sets of numbers. And we could just review these. The natural numbers,"
,,and you'll see this used in different
,,"contexts in different places, but for the sake of"
,,"this video, we'll assume this is counting numbers,"
,,"and it does not equal 0. So the natural numbers are 1,"
,,"2, 3, 4, and so on and so forth. We'll assume that the whole"
,,"numbers are essentially the natural numbers plus 0. So the whole numbers are 0, 1,"
,,"2, 3, 4, so on and so forth. The integers we'll assume"
,,it's the whole numbers plus the opposite of
,,"the natural numbers, or the negative version"
,,of the natural numbers. So we would go from
,,"very negative values to maybe negative 4,"
,,"negative 3, negative 2, negative 1, 0, 1, 2, 3,"
,,"4, so on and so forth. Rational numbers. These are numbers"
,,that can be expressed as the ratio of two integers. So a rational number
,,"can be expressed as m over n, where both m"
,,"and n are integers. And of course n cannot be 0,"
,,"because anything divided by 0 is not defined. M could be 0, and in fact,"
,,"0 is a rational number, because 0 can be"
,,"represented as 0 over 1. Or really 0 over 2, or 0 over 3. I think you get the idea. Or 0 over negative 537. These are all"
,,"representations of 0, and you have an integer"
,,"in the numerator, integer in the denominator. So 0 is definitely"
,,"a rational number. You just can't have n, you can't"
,,"have the denominator, be 0. Irrational numbers are numbers"
,,that cannot be expressed in this way. And so common versions
,,of irrational numbers are numbers that you will never
,,"see digits that repeat on, go on and on forever, or have"
,,series of sequences of numbers that keep repeating
,,on and on and on. And examples of irrational
,,"numbers are square root of 2, or pi. And the ratio of the"
,,"circumference, the diameter of a circle, or you might learn"
,,"about the irrational number e, which is 2.71. And it keeps going,"
,,and it doesn't repeat. And then real numbers are
,,really all of these combined. If you combine the
,,irrational numbers and the rational
,,"numbers, then you are talking about"
,,the real numbers. Every real number is either
,,rational or irrational. So let's classify
,,what we have up here. 1/3 over here-- let me do that
,,"in a different color-- so 1/3, is it a natural number? Well no, it's not. It's not just a natural"
,,"counting number. Is it a whole number? No, it's not a whole number,"
,,"it's in fact a fraction. Is it an integer? No once again, it"
,,is not an integer. Is it a rational number? Well sure it is. It can be represented
,,"as 1 over 3. Both 1 and 3 are integers. So 1/3 is rational. And if something is rational,"
,,it cannot be irrational. There's nothing that's both
,,rational and irrational. This literally
,,means not rational. And it is also a real number. Pretty much all of these are
,,"going to be real numbers. Now, let's try 7 out. So the number 7, it"
,,is a natural number. It is just a regular
,,counting number. It is a whole number. Any natural number is also
,,going to be a whole number. And anything that is a
,,natural number that's also going to be a whole number
,,is also going to be an integer. So this is also an integer. And anything that is a natural
,,"number, a whole number, and integer, is also going"
,,"to be a rational number. And to see that, you"
,,"can write 7 as 7 over 1. In fact, you can"
,,"write any integer as that number over 1, which"
,,hopefully makes it obvious that that is also
,,"a rational number. And if it's rational,"
,,you can't be irrational. That literally
,,"means not rational. And then of course,"
,,you're going to be real. It's going to be a real number. And you're going
,,to appreciate later on in your mathematical
,,careers why we even go through the trouble of
,,saying it's a real number. Because as far as
,,"it seems right now, this kind of includes"
,,all the numbers. What you're going to
,,"see in the future is, we're going to start"
,,defining numbers that don't fall into this category. And they're a little bit
,,"philosophically interesting as well. But anyway, back to the problem. We have a negative 15. Negative 15 is not a natural"
,,"number, it's a negative number. So it's not a natural"
,,"number, natural number is only the positive"
,,"integers, we could say. Whole number, it's"
,,"not a whole number, because that's just the"
,,natural numbers and 0. It is an integer. It is the opposite
,,"of positive 15. It is an integer. It is rational, it can be"
,,"represented as 15 over 1. So it is a rational. And because it is rational,"
,,"it cannot be rational. And of course, it is also real. And we are done."

Directed Numbers,DBSviXhkubg,"With all of the rules and scenarios, remembering how to add and subtract negative numbers can be difficult. Here's a little trick to help you remember. Let's say we "
,,"want to solve 3 plus -7. First, imagine a number line with a bird sitting on our first number, 3. The operation plus or minus tells you which end of the number line "
,,"to look at. Since we're adding, our little bird will look right toward the positive end. Our second number tells us how far to move and which direction to move. We'll move forward if it's positive and backwards if it's negative. Since our second number is a -7, our little bird is going to move backwards seven spaces. Since he landed at -4, that's our answer: 3 plus -7 equals -4. Let's try another one. What about -2 minus -4? Our first number is -2, so that's where we'll start. Our operation is a minus, so our bird will look left towards the negative end. Our second number is a -4; therefore, our bird will move backwards 4 spaces. Our bird landed at +2, and that's our answer: -2 minus -4 equals 2. Let's recap. The first number is where you start. The operation tells you where to look: Plus, right, or minus, left. The second number tells you how far to move and in which direction: positive, forward, or negative, backwards. Where you land is your answer. That's it! You now know "
,,a trick for adding and subtracting negative numbers.

Directed Numbers,3i2i9nmkG24,in our daily life we count various things for various purposes we count things using counting numbers the numbers 1 2 3 4 5 and so on are called counting numbers or 
,,natural numbers the numbers zero one two three four five and so on are called whole numbers zero has no value if placed before a natural number but it has a significant value and placed after a natural number although zero is the first whole number the first counting number is one but numbers like 1 upon to 1.8 and 2.2 are not whole numbers whole numbers on a number line on a number line numbers are represented as points and distances to represent whole numbers on a number line draw a straight horizontal ray label one end of the line as zero mark another point to the right of zero and label it as 1 the distance between 0 & 1 is the unit distance now mark points two three four and so on to the right side of 0.1 at unit distance this is how the number line will look like when we represent the whole numbers starting 
,,from the point zero negative numbers let us first understand what negative numbers are we know that zero means nothing but there are instances in real life when we use numbers that are less than zero for example in a few cold regions in the world the temperature goes below zero degrees Celsius that is negative 4 degrees Celsius 
,,or even below negative 40 degrees Celsius the numbers negative 4 and negative 40 are less than zero and are called negative numbers a negative number is any number that is less than zero for example negative eight is a number that is eight less than zero a negative number is represented with a negative sign any number without a 
,,negative sign is called a positive number which means a number that is greater than zero so while negative eight is negative eight seven is positive 7 or simply 7 integers the numbers one two three and so on the opposites negative one negative two negative three and so on and the number zero together form a different set of numbers let us understand the set of integers with the help of the following diagram in this combination each shape represents a particular number or set of numbers the 
,,circle represents zero this shape represents natural numbers the rectangle represents whole numbers the triangle represents negative numbers and this ship represents integers representation of integers on a number line integers can be represented on a number line that extends to the left to the right it is indicated by arrows and the positive integers are represented to the right of 0 and the negative integers are represented to the left of 0 positive 1 positive 2 positive 3 and so on are called positive integers the number value increases as they move away from zero negative one negative two negative three and so on are called negative integers the number value decreases as they move away from zero the integer zero is neutral it is neither positive nor negative positive integers do not need the positive sign before the number for example positive 2 can be written as just two negative integers need the negative sign before the number in the sign is not included that number is considered as positive two integers are opposites if they are each the same distance away from zero but on opposite sides of the number line one will have a positive sign the other a negative sign in the number line shown here positive three and negative three are opposite numbers now let us look at different situations where we mark our number either as positive or negative money earned or deposited is marked as positive whereas money owed or spent or withdrawn is marked as negative height above sea level is marked as positive whereas depth below sea level is marked as negative climbing up is marked as positive whereas coming down is marked as negative

Directed Numbers,6U1kCOuNpR4,"Negative numbers are any number less than zero. Imagining something less than zero can be difficult. Suppose you have a bowl of oranges and someone takes them away until you have zero left. When there's nothing it's hard to imagine being able to take away more; however, there are instances in real life where we use numbers less "
,,"than zero. For example, did you know the average temperatures at the top of Mount Everest range from negative 19 degrees Celsius to negative 36 degrees Celsius? Wow, that's cold. Negative numbers also appear in finances to show debt. Suppose you have $50 in your bank account, but then you accidentally spend $60. Your account balance is now negative $10. This means you owe the bank $10. To understand this more, let's look at a number line. For every positive number, there is a negative number. Negative numbers can also be thought of as the opposite of a positive number, so the opposite of 5 is negative 5. You might also notice that as we go further down the number line the negative numbers appear to get larger. However, the numbers are really getting smaller. For example, negative 10 is smaller than negative 5. This can be confusing, but think about it in terms of temperature. Suppose on a winter's day it's negative 25 degrees Celsius in Barrow, Alaska, and negative 35 degrees Celsius in Stanley, Idaho. Stanley would be colder than Barrow because negative 35 is lower than negative 25. Now you know the basics of negative numbers."

Directed Numbers,_BgblvF90UE,"Hi, welcome to Math Antics. In our last video, we learned what negative numbers are, and we learned that they're part of a special set of numbers called ‘integers’. "
,,"Next, we need to learn how to do arithmetic with those integers. In this video, we’re gonna learn how to add and subtract integers. In the next video we’ll learn how to multiply and divide integers. Adding and subtracting whole numbers is pretty easy because there’s really only two possibilities: you’re either adding two positive numbers, or subtracting two positive numbers. But adding and subtracting integers is more complicated, because with negative numbers in the mix, there’s a lot more possibilities. Fortunately, you don’t need to memorize all these possibilities. Instead, we’re gonna learn some simple rules and strategies that will make the process a lot easier . Let’s start by learning two key rules that are really helpful to know when working with negative numbers. The first rule is this:  Adding a negative is the same as subtracting a positive. To visualize what that means, suppose I give you positive two cupcakes, You’d be pretty happy, right? But what if I ‘give’ you negative two cupcakes instead? That’s the same as taking two cupcakes away from you. Would you still be happy? When it comes to math, this rule means that if you "
,,"have a problem like this: 5 + -1 (where you’re adding a negative number), you can just change it to subtraction. Instead of 5 + -1, you can just write 5 ? 1. They’re different ways of writing the same thing. Okay, so rule #1 is:  Adding a negative is the same as subtracting a positive. Now what about rule number #2? Well the second rule is this:  Subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive. Let’s say you have negative two cupcakes.  Like if you have a debt… you OWE me two cupcakes. You wouldn’t be too happy having that negative, would you? But, what if I subtract that negative from you? Taking away the negative two made you more positive, right? Subtracting the negative gives you less debt! When it comes to math, this rule means that if you have a problem like 5 ? (-1), where you’re subtracting a negative number, you can just change it to addition. Instead of 5 ? (-1), you can just write 5 + 1, and that’s a problem you already know how to solve. Alright, now that "
,,"you know our two rules, I want to show you that there’s really only four different types of problems (or 4 cases) when adding or subtracting integers. In case 1, you start with a positive number and you make it more positive. In case 2, you start with a positive number and you make it more negative. In case 3, you start with a negative number and you make it more negative. And in case 4, you start with a negative number and you make it more positive. The key to getting the right answer to the problem is to figure out which of these cases you’re dealing with, so let’s look at each case in more detail. In case 1, you start with a positive number and you "
,,"make it more positive. The good news is that you already know how to do that!  That’s just what regular addition is. For example, when you have the problem 7 + 3, you’re starting with a positive 7 and you’re making it more positive by adding positive 3 to it, to get the answer of positive 10. But, what if instead of 7 + 3, you're given the problem 7 ? (-3)?  That seems a lot harder, right? Well, if you remember rule #2, it’s not harder at all. In fact, it’s exactly the same problem because "
,,"rule #2 says subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive. We can change the “minus minus 3” into “plus 3” and we get the same answer: positive 10. So case 1 is just addition like you’re used to doing, but now that we have negative numbers, there’s a new way that it could be written that you need to be on the lookout "
,,"for. Oh, and in this case (starting with a positive and making it more positive), you know your answer will always be positive because you stay on that side of the number line. In case 2, you start with a positive number, but you make it more negative. That is, you do something to it that makes its value smaller (or moves it to "
,,"the left on the number line). But that’s just like regular subtraction like you already know how to do. For example, here we have the problem 8 ? 5. We start with a "
,,positive 8 but we make it more negative by subtracting 5 from it. Subtracting 5 moves it to the left on the number line down to 3 as our answer. Our answer is still 
,,"a positive number, but it’s less positive than it was before. And that raises an interesting question: What if we subtract even more, to move it further in the negative direction? Like, what if we subtract 8 instead of 5?  That would take us all the way back down to zero on the number line. And before you knew about negative numbers, back when you thought the number line just stopped at zero, you probably thought that’s all we could take away.  But watch this… Let’s start with positive 8 but then subtract 10 from it!  Can we do that? Can we subtract a bigger number from a smaller one? Now we can!  It just means that the answer we get will be a negative number. Starting with positive 8 and subtracting 10 takes us past zero, and down to negative 2 on the number line. So our answer is negative 2. As you can see, case 2 is a little more complicated, because the answer can be positive, negative or even zero, depending on the numbers you’re subtracting. And it’s even more complicated than that because there’s also another way this type of problem can be written, thanks to rule #1. Rule #1 says that adding a negative is really the same as subtracting a positive. And that means our original subtraction problem (8 ? 5) could have been written like this instead (8 + -5). But either way it’s written, you’re starting with a positive and making it more negative. Now on to case 3…  In case 3 you start with a negative number and you make it more negative. That’s really just the opposite of case 1 where we started on the positive side of the number line and made it more positive. For example, let’s say that you’re given the problem: -7 + "
,,"-3. That means that you start with negative 7 and then you make it even more negative by adding negative 3 which gives you negative 10 as the answer. And as you might have guessed by now, thanks to our rules, there’s another way we could write this type of problem. Because of rule #1, we know that adding a negative 3 is the same as subtracting 3. So this problem could also be written like this: -7 ? 3. But either way it’s written, in this case you’re starting with a negative number and making it even more negative. And because of that, you know that your answer will always be negative for case 3 since you stay on the negative side of the number line. And finally, in case 4, you also start with a negative number, but this time you’re gonna make it more positive. Here’s an example of a problem like that: -8 + 5. This problem starts with negative 8 but then we add positive 5 which makes it more positive, or moves us to the right on the number line, up to -3 which is our answer. "
,,"Our answer is still negative, but it’s less negative than what we started with. Ah, but this looks similar to case 2, right? Imagine what would happen if you made it even more positive. You could add 8 (instead of 5) and that would move you all the way up to zero. And if you added even more, like -8 + 10, that would take you to "
,,"the positive side of the number line and give you the answer of positive 2. So just like in case 2, the answer here can be positive, negative or even zero depending "
,,"on the numbers you‘re adding. And, just like before, there’s another way this type of problem can be written. Remember rule #2? …that subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive. Because of that rule, -8 + 5 could also be written as -8 ? (-5). That’s a LOT of negatives, but thanks to rule #2, we can write our “minus "
,,"minus” as a “plus”. But either way it’s written, in this case, we start negative and move in the positive direction. Okay, now that we’ve learned our two rules and we’ve seen that there’s really just four types of problems (or 4 different cases) that you’ll need to solve, I want to give you a basic strategy that will help when you’re adding or subtracting integers. This strategy involves asking 3 simple questions: The first question is, “Am I starting with a positive or a negative number?” "
,,"This question is easy to answer because all you have to do is look at the sign in front of the first number of the problem. If there’s no sign, then you’re starting "
,,"with a positive number. But if there’s a minus sign, then you’re starting with a negative number. Once you know what you’re starting with, the next question to ask is, “Am I making it bigger or smaller?” In other words, is what you’re adding or subtracting going to make the value move in the positive direction of the number line or the negative direction? If you’re subtracting a positive or adding a negative (Rule #1) then you're making the value smaller, which is moving to the left on the "
,,"number line. If you’re adding a positive or subtracting a negative (Rule #2) then you're making the value bigger, which is moving to the right on the number line. And the last question that you need to ask is, “Will my answer be positive, negative, or zero?” The answer to this will depend on which case you have and what values you’re working with. If it’s a case 1 problem, you know the answer will always be positive, and if it’s a case 3 problem, then you know the answer will always be negative. But you’ll remember that in cases 2 and 4, the answer could change between positive, negative or zero depending on the difference between the two numbers that "
,,"you’re working with. So asking these three questions will help you visualize what’s happening in the problem that you’re trying to solve, and it’ll help you get the "
,,right answer. But the most important thing that you can do to get good at integer arithmetic is to practice. It’s important that you try a lot of problems that you have an answer key for so that you know if you’re doing it right. And don’t get discouraged if it’s confusing at first.  You’ll get it if you practice! And you might

Directed Numbers,5oHJcmYbHvA,"We have seen what natural and whole numbers are. The whole numbers comprise of the entire set of natural numbers and zero. So what are integers then? Let's zoom in a bit. Along with whole numbers, the set of integers also includes negative numbers like minus 1, minus 2, minus 3 and so on. We have numbers like 1, 2 ,3 and so on, "
,,"so that we can count. We also know why we have a 0. Now the question, why negative numbers? The most basic example would be temperature. The temperature can go below '0' degrees and the temperature below '0' degree is negative. Like 'minus 10 degrees'. Let us see a different example. Suppose you gave your friend 100 rupees, and "
,,"that friend returned just 50 rupees. What is the net amount you have now? The net amount you have is 'minus 50 rupees'. We know there is no note available in the market which amounts to 'minus 50 rupees'. But a negative sign tells us that you are in a loss. Coming back to integers. All these numbers are integers. We zoom out slightly to understand another interesting concept. The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and so on are called positive integers. And numbers minus 1, minus 2, minus 3 and so on are called negative integers. We can also define natural numbers, as positive integers. Then what about '0'? Well, it's neither positive nor negative. Now look at all "
,,"three of them together. It tells us that all natural numbers and whole numbers are integers. The set of integers, would look something like this. And the set of integers are represented by the letter 'Z'. Now we know what integers are and why they are used."

Directed Numbers,mlNHIzV4x8Y,hello kids we already know what integers are today let us learn addition and subtraction of integers using a number line let's begin addition of the integers using a number line let us look at a few examples example 1 add positive 5 plus positive 3 firstly start from 0 and move 5 places to the right we reach positive 5 now move 
,,three places to the right from positive 5 and reach positive 8 look we found the answer yes it is positive 8 hence positive 5 plus positive 3 is equal to positive 8 
,,example to find negative 5 plus negative 4 start from 0 and move 5 places to the left that is in the negative direction we reach negative 5 now on moving another 4 places to the left from negative 5 we reach negative 9 hence negative 5 plus negative 4 is equal to negative 9 example 3 find 3 plus negative 5 firstly start from 0 and move 3 places to the right we reached positive 3 now we move 5 places to the left that is in the negative direction from positive 3 and reach negative 2 therefore three plus negative five is equal to negative two lastly example four find negative five plus positive two start from zero and move five places to the left that is 
,,in the negative direction look we have reached negative five from negative five we move two places to the right and reach negative three thus we get the answer as negative five plus positive two is equal to negative three coming to subtraction of integers using a number line let us solve a few examples to understand in a better 
,,way example 1 find negative 3 minus 4 step 1 change the subtraction problem into an addition problem that is change the sign of subtrahend from positive to negative 
,,or negative to positive so here on changing we get the addition problem as negative 3 plus negative 4 step two follow the rules used for addition using the number line start from zero and move three places to the left that is in the negative direction look we have reached negative three from negative three we move four places again to the left and reach negative seven which is the answer example to find negative 5 minus negative 3 so here on changing the subtraction problem into addition problem we get the new question as negative five plus positive three now let us use the number line to solve this problem start from zero and move five places to the left that is in the negative direction from this point we move three places to the right and reach negative two thus we get the answer as negative two

Directed Numbers,SQ4cB9yXkHM,All of us know what a number line is. And the numbers we see here on the number line are called integers. On the right side of zero we have positive integers and on 
,,"its left we have negative integers. Integers, we are familiar with. But what about numbers like these? 1 by 3, 5 by 6 or 'minus 7' by 12. Each of these are numbers, "
,,but we don't use them as often as we use counting numbers. Such numbers are called Rational numbers. But we need to define them well! We cannot say numbers like these are rational numbers. We say that they are of the form 'p' by 'q'. One number in the numerator and one in the denominator. But there are a few conditions we need to know. 'p' and 'q' should be integers. We can have only integers in place of 'p' and 'q'. And there is another important condition 'q' should not be equal to 'zero'. Why do we have the second condition? Say I asked you to calculate 3 divided by 0. What would be the quotient? '0' multiplied by what will give you 3? There is no such number. This value is undefined. So this is the basic definition of rational numbers. It is a number of the form 'p' by 'q' where 'p' and 'q' are integers. And 'q' is not equal to '0'? There are many questions that should pop up in your head when you see this definition. What is the difference between rational numbers and fractions? Are integers classified as rational numbers? What about '0'? How do we plot such numbers on a number line? And how do we compare two rational numbers? For example if you are asked to compare 1 and 5 you could easily say that 5 is greater of the two. But what if you are asked to compare numbers like 6 by 7 and 13 by 15? 
,,How would you find out which one is greater? Don't worry about it! All these questions will be answered in our videos on Rational numbers.

Directed Numbers,Slw5SCy9P14,hi friends if you watch this whole video you'll find the topic real easy the topic will seem natural to you so what's the topic for today that's right this video is 
,,about numbers in this video we'll explore the different type of real numbers such as natural numbers whole numbers integers rational and irrational numbers and then 
,,we'll finish off with our top three test oriented questions on this topic let's go back to the kindergarten days and start with counting numbers remember the Rhine one two three four five once I caught a fish alive well these numbers such as 1 2 3 and so on are called natural numbers and they are denoted by the letter M let's draw a circle to represent the set of natural numbers now whole numbers includes all the natural numbers and zero so we can draw the whole number circle around the natural numbers integers include all the whole numbers and negative numbers such as minus 1 minus 2 minus 3 and so on so we can draw the integer circle around the whole numbers one important thing for you to keep in mind is that zero is considered neither positive nor negative let's place the diagram we just did on our concept board now the question is are there any numbers between any two integers let's say between 0 & 1 yes and we use them all the time for example half one-third point seven 
,,point eight so between any two integers you have these non integer numbers which are known as fractions or decimals and this entire set of integers and fractions and decimals are called rational numbers and they are denoted by the letter Q any rational number can be written as a fraction P by Q where P and Q are integers the only restriction is that Q should not be 0 since division by zero is undefined now is the natural number 3 also a rational number what do you think so 3 can be written 
,,as 3 by 1 it can be written as a fraction you know P by Q form so 3 is also a rational number now what about 2.5 so we can write it as 25 by 10 and if you simplify the fraction you get 5 by 2 so 2.5 is also a rational number so any rational number can be expressed in a P by Q form that is in this fraction form the only restriction is Q should not be equal to 0 and typically P and Q don't have any common factor except 1 so we write the fraction in its simplified form let's add the non integers to our set diagram the integers and non integers that is fractions and decimals together are called rational numbers let's talk more about rational numbers that are not integers as we learned rational numbers are fractions represented by the P by Q form you can calculate the fraction by dividing and we end up with a decimal number for example 7 by 10 is 0.75 by 2 is 2.5 7 by 4 is 1.75 these are all examples apples of terminating decimal numbers that is the decimal digits stop or terminate after a point because on dividing by the denominator the remainder is zero but there are other fractions which on dividing don't terminate for example two by three is zero point six six six six and it just goes on so we write it as zero point six with a dot or a line on top to represent that the digit six is recurring which means repeating let's take another example one by seven so if you look at the answer here can you see the repeating pattern that's right it's zero point one four two eight five seven recurring let's take a look at another example one by six so that's going to be zero point one six six six six and it just keeps repeating but notice that we write it with a dot or a bar only on top of six because only the six is repeating so these are called recurring decimal numbers well on dividing by the denominator the remainder is never zero and the digits in the quotient keep repeating if you take any fraction how do you determine that on division you're going to get 
,,a terminating decimal number or a recurring decimal number of course one simple way is to actually do the division but there's another trick where you don't need to 
,,divide now what's the trick you need to take a look at the denominator and if the denominator has factors of two and five only then you're going to get a terminating decimal number otherwise it's going to be a recurring decimal number let me pull up some examples to illustrate this let's start with the example of seven by for now what are the factors of the denominator for its two into two now our goal is to convert the denominator into multiples of tens so I'm going to multiply 5 into 5 in the numerator and in the denominator so I get 175 by 100 that's 1.75 so this is a terminating decimal number but if we take 37 by 150 so what are the factors of the denominator they are 2 into 3 into 5 into 5 and if you divide we get zero point 2 4 6 6 6 and so on so this is a recurring decimal number and why is that because if you carefully look at the factors in the denominator you can see that there's a three there for it to be a terminating decimal number you need factors of two and five only now our rational question is are there numbers that are not rational the answers yes these are called irrational numbers for example root 2 root 3 cube root 
,,of 10 these are all irrational numbers but we look at these in a separate video let's try to place the different numbers that we've learnt on a number line are you familiar with the number line an everyday example is a ruler or a measuring tape like this with numbers marked on it unlike the measuring tape the number line has both positive and negative numbers so let's draw a number line and try to place the different numbers on it so here's our number line let's mark the natural numbers on 
,,it 1 2 3 and so on let's draw another number line and Mark the whole numbers on it so it's going to be the natural numbers and 0 in our third number line let's mark 
,,the integers so it's going to be all the whole numbers and the negative numbers minus 1 minus 2 minus 3 and so on in the next number line let's mark the rational numbers so it's going to be all the integers and decimals and fractions for example one point five is here midway between one and two two point eight is here and it's closer to three and minus half is midway between 0 and minus 1 we can also visualize the number system by starting from the top that is from the real numbers let me pull up the concept board for you real numbers can be divided into rational and irrational numbers rational numbers can be divided into integers and non integers now 
,,integers can be divided into negative integers and whole numbers whole numbers can be split into zero and positive integers which are natural numbers coming back to 
,,the non integers fractions and decimals these can be divided into terminating decimals and non terminating or recurring decimals now let's say you want to find rational numbers between any two given rational numbers for example between 3 & 5 one simple answer is 4 we can get it by finding the average 3 plus 5 by 2 which is equal to 4 if you want to find more rational numbers then you can do 3 plus 4 by 2 that's 3 point 5 & 4 plus 5 by 2 which is 4 point 5 now let me pull up some more interesting examples for you if you want to find two rational numbers between two fractions for example 1 by 7 & 4 bytes since the denominators here are equal and the numerators have a gap we can fill in the fractions in the gap so our answer is going to be 2 by 7 and 3 by 7 but what if there's no gap for example if we have to find two rational numbers between 1 by 7 and 2 by 7 then what do you do we can create a gap by multiplying the numerator and denominator with a number since we need two rational numbers we will multiply by 2 plus 1 which is 3 multiplying the numerator and denominator of the two fractions by 3 we get 3 by 21 and 6 by 21 again the denominators are the same but can you see that we've got a gap in the numerator so the two fractions we can insert our 4 by 21 and 5 by 21 now let's look at the case where the denominators of the two fractions are not the same for example if we want to insert six rational numbers between 1/2 and 2/3 as you can see the denominators are not equal so the first step is to make the denominators equal so our two fractions become 3 by 6 and 4 by 6 similar to our previous case now the two denominators are equal but there's no gap in the numerators so what should we do that's right we need to multiply by a number and since we need to insert six rational numbers our number is going to be 6 plus 1 which is 7 so let's multiply the numerator and denominator of the two fractions by 7 so here we have 21 by 42 and 28 by 42 so here are 
,,the six rational numbers that we can insert between these two fractions and on simplifying the six rational numbers and that's our answer let's talk about fractions 
,,and decimals how to convert fractions to decimals and decimals to fractions converting fractions to decimals is easy you just need to divide for example 3 by 4 is 0.75 a terminating decimal number 1 by 3 is 0.33 3 recurring a recurring decimal number now if you want to convert 0.75 to a fraction then we can write it as 75 by 100 simplifying we get 3 by 4 so these are simple but a more interesting question is how do you convert a recurring decimal number to a fraction for example 0.333 recurring now we know that 0.3 is 3 by 10 0.33 is 33 by 100 0.333 is 333 by thousand but we are looking for zero point 3 3 3 3 recurring so let me show you the technique 
,,how to convert a recurring decimal number to a fraction coming up for you right now let X be the recurring decimal number which is 0.3 recurring in this case so let's write it as X equal to 0.33 3 3 and so on now we need another number where the part after the decimal is the same so let's multiply X by 10 and we have 10 X equal 
,,to 3 point 3 3 3 and so on so as you can see here X and 10x have the same part after the decimal now let's subtract X from 10x so I'm going to copy the first line here on subtracting we get 9x equal to 3 so X is 3 by 9 and if we simplify we get 1 by 3 so we have converted our recurring decimal number 0.3 recurring to a fraction 
,,1 by 3 let's look at another example again let X be the recurring decimal number which is one point two seven recurring to find another number with the decimal part 
,,matching this time we can't multiply by 10 we need to multiply by 100 and as you can see in hundred X the decimal part matches so once again subtracting X from 100 X we get 99 X equal to 126 and on simplifying we get 14 by 11 so we've converted our recurring decimal number to a fraction now that we are done with the topic of rational numbers let's take a look at the top three questions on this topic coming up for you right now I would like you to pause the video right here and try solving these questions let's make this more interactive than just watching the video so do post your answers in the comments below or if you have any doubts questions feel free to write it in the comments below and I'm going to make a commitment to answer all of them promptly so I'm going to move off and let you solve these questions thanks for watching the whole video I hope the number system is really easy for you now and the numbers seem more rational and natural to you all puns intended in that sentence and do remember to Like comment and share out this video and go and hit the subscribe button for my channel right now you

Directed Numbers,sEU5uaf-Tu4,hello John Zimmerman from Taba class comm and what I want to do here in this video is just quickly go over the rules for positive and negative numbers many of you out there may know and maybe you've experienced yourself your solutions your math solutions you know becoming incorrect because you messed up on one of these integer rules one of these rules that involve positive and negative numbers it's just so easy too easy to confuse some of these rules but you absolutely have to learn these to really master you know middle school and high school mathematics let's just go through very quickly and we'll start with the easy stuff first I want to take a look at the multiplication rules okay so here anytime you're multiplying two numbers where the signs the signs are the same in other words a positive times a positive or negative times a negative okay the answer is always positive okay so two times positive two times positive eight positive 16 okay so once again negative two times negative eight the signs are the same I both negative positive answer positive 16 now in multiplication when you're multiplying two numbers and where one of the signs are opposite ie ones pause and ones negative here I have a positive times a negative doesn't make a difference it could be a negative times a positive the product the answer is going to be negative okay so that's multiplication right there and these are the multiplication rules now division is the same thing okay so multiplication and division pretty straightforward so 16 divided by 4 of course will be a positive 4 negative 16 divided by a negative 4 would be okay once again signs are the 
,,same so the answers gonna be positive that's a positive 4 and now here I have a negative 16 divided by a positive 4 right opposite signs so the answer ok is going to be negative negative 4 alright so this is the easy stuff now let's get to the more challenging or what seems to give students I think a little bit more problems understanding Nishal e is addition now I'm going to kind of change colors here I'm going to tell you if you know how to add positive negative numbers then you'll be able to subtract and you'll see what I'm talking about here in a second all right so eight plus two K two positives the signs are the same okay so you keep the sign obviously it's gonna be a positive ten right all of us probably knew that now let's take a look at this okay we have a negative eight plus a negative two the signs are 
,,the same so you're going to add these values right here and you're going to keep the same sign so this is going to be negative ten all right so right here when you're adding numbers with the same sign you could tell we're just adding adding the numbers and keeping the sign so no problem there here's where it gets a little interesting to think for students right here we have we're adding two numbers with different signs so we have a negative eight plus a two all right so let me ask you which number here don't look at the sign just look at the positive version of the number which one is larger okay the eight or the - all right well clearly this one would be large we call that the absolute value but I don't want I don't want to throw out too many technical terms here okay so between the eight and a two we said that eight is a larger number okay we think of it as a larger number that's positive version and you can tell they here that a has the negative sign so here's what you do 
,,anytime you have two different signs okay you're going to end up subtracting alright so let's actually do that now okay eight and two if I took the difference I'm going to get six right I just kind of forget about that negative sign for a second but now the sign that is associated with the answer is going to have or you're going to be associated with that largest number ie the eight okay so this is you be a negative six all right so it makes sense let's let's try another one here so we have eight plus and negative two okay the signs are different so when the signs are different you're going to end up subtracting okay so subtract just the whole version 
,,or the positive versions of these numbers okay eight and two so if I just told you to subtract them or find the difference you would say okay that's six now out of the eight and two which one has a larger sign or which one is the larger number the eight is a larger number and this eight right here is a positive eight so my answer is going to be a positive six okay all right so once again I'm just kind of quickly trying to refresh some of these rules and of course you know in a few minutes I would expect you to master all this stuff but hopefully this is making sense to most you out there all right so let's talk about subtraction okay here's a deal with subtraction I said if you know how to add you could subtract positive negative numbers so what we're going to do with subtraction problems is turn them into addition problems by doing something called plus negative so here I have 7 minus 10 what I want you to do is to take that subtraction sign and you're going to turn it into 
,,an addition sign and they're going to put that little negative sign and attack it on to the number to the right of that of that addition symbol okay so you see what 
,,I did there I said seven instead of 7 minus 10 I'm going 7 plus negative 10 and then now of course I'm going to go ahead and do this addition problem the signs are different so I'm going to subtract the numbers okay and then here 10 is the larger number and it has a negative sign so I'm going to go ahead and make that a negative 3 for my answer okay and by the way too what I'm trying to do is just give you kind of a procedural some rules here I'm trying to teach you all the concepts involved in integers which are very important by the way just trying to get you some simple rules so you don't mess this up when you're actually doing calculations okay let's take a look at this last one in here we have 3 minus a minus 6 so I'm going to go ahead and turn this into a positive or excuse me an addition problem and then I'm going to tack on out negative sign to the number to the right but now I have a negative of a negative 6 or the opposite of a negative 6 okay so if I told you what's the opposite of negative 6 you would say oh that's positive six this really turns into this problem three plus a positive six or three plus six and that is nine okay so pretty much a real fast review listen if you need a lot more information on this and other topics come on over to tablet class comm we have a 30 day free trial tons of stuff we have full courses the whole idea with our products it's clear and understandable we we really design our lessons to be explained and that's the key word explained not taught down too but explain in a way that you understand so hopefully and come over and check us out at Taba class comm take one hour 30 day free trials and learn and master this stuff so your headaches and mathematics go away good luck to yourself

Directed Numbers,FsKNeU7EFl0,this lesson will strengthen your understanding of adding and subtracting with negative and positive numbers you'll be able to answer questions like this this or this after watching this video let's begin by thinking about the words positive and negative what do they mean to you well positive is something that's usually good it's something you want something you desire negative is used to describe something that is bad something you'd really want to avoid for these reasons let's use the green blocks to represent positives this block is happy and has a very positive attitude let's use this red block to represent negative this block is grumpy and full of 
,,negativity do you want to share some pie with me no I hate pie I'm probably allergic so now we have a way of representing both positive numbers and negative numbers 
,,what do you think will happen if we put them together well I think we're about to find out well isn't that something there is exactly as much positive as there was negative and they just burned each other out what this shows to us is positive 1 and negative 1 equals zero our plan for the next few problems will be to figure out how many green blocks and how many red blocks you'll need based on the size of the numbers and the sign in front of them let's try 23 plus negative 19 let's move these over here so we can have as much space as possible so remember we're going to use green blocks to represent positives and red blocks to represent negatives so we have 23 green blocks and 19 red blocks so remember when one of these positive green blocks meets one of these negative red blocks they equal zero they go away let's do the same thing for all of these there we go yep let's get rid of that one and this one and this one and this one all right we are left with four green blocks what 
,,does that mean well remember the green blocks were positive so we have positive four so 23 plus negative 19 is positive 4 we did this by counting out 23 green blocks and 19 red blocks then we paired them together until we ran out of one color block and counted how many of the other color we had left neat so remember use the green blocks for positive numbers and red blocks for negative numbers make and remove the red green block pairs like this then count how many of whichever color you have left if you have leftover green blocks it's a positive some leftover red blocks is a negative sum well now it's your turn to try one

Directed Numbers,hNk2xr4MUS8,in this video we're gonna talk about rational and irrational numbers so what is the difference between a rational and an rational number what would you say well first what is a rational number a rational number is any number that be that can be written as a ratio of two integers for example a fraction like 3 over 4 is a rational number or negative 7 over 6 these are rational numbers because you can write them as a ratio of two integers and remember integers are basically whole numbers natural numbers or even negative numbers like these these are all integers so here's a question for you is an integer a rational number or an irrational number if example the integer 8 would you put it on a left column or on the right column so can we write 8 as a ratio of two integers we can write 8 as 16 divided by 2 so 8 is a rational number what about a negative number like a negative 5 is that a rational number negative 5 can be written as a ratio of two integers you can write it as negative 10 divided by 2 so negative 5 is a rational number in fact all integers are rational numbers now what about let's say decimal numbers for instance point 25 is that rational or irrational can we write this as a fraction using two integers point 25 is the same as 25 divided by 100 and if you divide the top and the bottom number 
,,by 25 this is the same as 1 over 4 so if you have a decimal number that is finite that comes to an end like point two-five that's a vast remember another example is 
,,0.5 teen this you can write that as 15 divided by a hundred and if you divide the top and the bottom numbers by five you can reduce that to three over twenty now what about repeating decimals for instance let's say if we have 0.666 six repeating which we can write as point six with a line on top is that rational irrational point six repeatin is six over nine which you could reduce that to two over three if you divide by three so repeating decimals are irrational numbers another example is point two repeating this is 2 over nine now what about let's say point 17 repeating is that a rational number in this case we can write it as a ratio of two integers 
,,point 17 repeating is 17 over 99 so whether you have a finite decimal number or one that goes on forever but repeats they're all rational numbers now what about square roots for instance the square root of 9 would you say it's rational or irrational the square root of 9 is 3 and 3 is an integer and all integers are irrational numbers but now what about the square root of 7 is it rational or irrational we can't simplify the square root of 7 to a whole number so if you use a calculator you'll find that the square root of 7 is two point six four five seven five one three one and this can go on for a long time so whenever you see a decimal number that is non repeating and that goes on forever and if you can't write it as a fraction of two integers that's when you have an irrational number so one way to identify them is if you have a square root that can't be simplified to an integer typically that's an irrational number now what about Pi is PI rational or irrational so if you type PI into your calculator you're gonna get a decimal number that looks like this 3.14159265 and this also goes on so pi is an irrational number another example is the number e if you get the decimal value for that it's 2.71828 one eight two and so forth so that's how you can identify irrational numbers it's basically numbers with an infinite number of decimal places it goes on forever and you can't write it as a ratio of two integers and so that's basically it for this video now you know how to identify a rational number and an irrational number thanks again for watching and don't forget to subscribe to this channel

Directed Numbers,fw1kyM0F00Y,integers good day students welcome back to my classroom for today's lesson you will learn how to describe the set of integers and identify real life situations to make use of it and compare integers let us begin integers are whole numbers which consists of zero positive and negative numbers let's take a look at this number line 
,,this number line is divided into right and left part by the number zero zero is an integer that is neither negative nor positive the numbers on the right side of 0 are the positive integers these positive integers are can be written with or without the positive sign while the numbers to the left of zero are the negative integers which must be written with the negative sign remember that integers are whole numbers fractions and decimals are not considered as integers some real-world situations can be modeled by integers let's take a look at this example the sea level represents zero while below the sea level represents negative numbers and above sea level represents by the positive numbers if we say 40 feet above sea level that means it is equivalent to positive 40 feet well if we say 40 feet below sea level it means it is equivalent to negative 40. now let's try another situational phrases which can also be represented by integers we have here 15 feet above the ground our clue word here is the word above which represents positive number this means that it can be represented by positive 15. another one we have ten floors up our key word here is the word up it means that it is positive then next one we have five steps backwards our clue word here is the word buff it means that we are going to move five steps backward so that is negative five and lastly we have decrease of nine points it can be represented by negative nine wonderful now if we are asked this question what is two units to the right of three it means that we need to move two units or two times to the right of the number three let's try it there it means two units to the right of three is positive five this also represents addition where when we add two and three that gives us positive five another example what is five units to the left of zero this means that we need to move five times to the left from zero so let's try great job so that is negative five this also represents subtraction where zero minus five is negative five now let's learn how to compare integers in comparing integers we need to understand that the numbers to the right of zero gets bigger and bigger while the numbers to the left of zero get smaller and smaller therefore zero is greater than negative numbers but less than positive numbers let's try an example let's compare zero and negative five since negative five is a negative integer and it can be found to the left of number zero this means that zero 
,,is greater than negative five let's have another example let's compare zero and positive five since five here is positive and it can be found to the right of zero this means that zero is less than positive five awesome we also need to understand that all positive numbers are greater than negative numbers it means that negative numbers are less than positive numbers let's have an example let us compare positive three and negative five when we take a look at here it seems that negative five is greater than positive three but since all positive numbers are greater than negative numbers it means that positive three is greater than negative five let's have 
,,another one this time let us compare negative four and positive one again all negative numbers are less than positive numbers these means that negative four is less 
,,than positive one now let's have another one what about we compare positive 18 and negative 25 since all positive numbers are greater than negative numbers it means 
,,that positive 18 is greater than negative 25 awesome now let's go to another one now what if we are comparing negative numbers since negative numbers get smaller and smaller it means that the bigger the number the smaller it is sounds confusing right let's have an example let us compare negative three and negative five it seems 
,,that negative five is greater than negative three but here negative three is closer to number zero this means that negative three is greater than negative five let's have another example let us compare negative four and negative two since negative four is bigger than negative two it means that negative four is less than negative two great job how about this one great job negative 40 is less than negative 21. wonderful great job students you made it now here are things that you learned today you

Directed Numbers,CqrYYiffPr0,good morning students today let us study the rules of divisibility these rules will help us determine whether a number is divisible by another number without actually carrying out the division process let us have a look at different divisibility tests divisibility by two if the number is even that is it ends in two four six eight or zero we say that the given number is divisible by two for example 26 ends in 6 thus it is divisible by 2 divisibility by 3 if the sum of the digits of the number is divisible by three we say that the given number is divisible by three for example look at the number 384 when we add up all the digits that is three plus eight 
,,plus four we get the sum as fifteen we know that 15 is divisible by three thus we conclude that 384 is divisible by three divisibility by 4 if the number formed by the last two digits of the given number is divisible by four we see that the given number is divisible by four for example look at the number 164 its last two digits 
,,"form the number 64 which is divisible by 4 thus the whole number 164 is divisible by 4 divisibility by 5 if the number ends in 5 or 0 we say that the given number is divisible by 5 for example 525 ends in 5 thus it is divisible by 5 look at this another example 330 ends in 0 hence it is also divisible by 5 divisibility by 6 if the number is divisible by both 2 and 3 we see that the given number is divisible by 6 for example look at the number 408 is it divisible by 2 the number ends in 8 thus it is divisible by 2 is it divisible by 3 4 plus 0 plus 8 is equal to 12 which is divisible by 3 which makes the number 408 divisible by 3 as well hence 408 is divisible by 6 divisibility by 8 if the number formed by the last three digits of the given number is divisible by 8 we see that the given number is divisible by 8 for example look at the number 50 3888 its last three digits form the number 8 on eighty-eight which is divisible by 8 thus 53,000 888 is divisible by 8 divisibility by nine if the sum of the digits of the number is divisible by nine we see that the given number is divisible by nine for example look at the number seven lakh twenty "
,,nine thousand six hundred thirty-nine here on adding the digits seven two nine six three and nine we get the sum as 36 which is divisible by nine thus seven lakh twenty nine thousand six hundred thirty-nine is also divisible by nine finally let us look at divisibility by ten if the number ends in a zero we say that the given number is divisible by ten for example 8620 ends in zero thus it is divisible by ten kids now it is time for you to remember all these divisibility tests and find out the answer

Directed Numbers,3YwrcJxEbZw,"To understand what real numbers are, all you need to understand is the number line. Positive numbers to the right of Zero. And negative numbers to the left of Zero. "
,,"You will hear various complicated definitions of real numbers but here's the simplest one. Any number, that can be plotted on a number line is called a real number. "
,,"Let's look at a few examples. Say 'minus 2.' Yes, it can be plotted on the number line. It's this point. So minus two is a real number. What about zero point five? Even though it's not an integer, it can be plotted on the number line. It will be somewhere here. Now let's look at another number. Root two. Which is also called as "
,,"square root of two. If we calculate the value of root two, we get it as 1.414 approximately. The digits after the decimal point do not end. These kind of numbers are called non-terminating decimal numbers. And yes, these numbers too can be plotted on the number line. Plotting a non-terminating number might sound weird, but yes, "
,,"it's possible. So 'root two' is also a real number. And what about the special number Pi? it approximately equals 3.14159. Pi is also a non-terminating decimal number. And yes, it can be plotted on the number line, which makes it a real number. So that's our definition. Any number that can be plotted on a number line is called a real number. Now let's talk a bit about the different kinds of numbers we know. The first kind is numbers with terminating decimals. Numbers like 0.375. The number "
,,"stops at a point and does not go on and on. Then we have non-terminating recurring decimals. Numbers like 0.6666 and so on. The sixes don't end. It's called recurring since the same number reoccurs and non-terminating since it reoccurs infinitely. And the third type is non-terminating non-recurring decimals. We just saw an example of this type. Root two. It approximately equals 1.4142. And the digits after the decimal do not end. Hence, it's called non-terminating. It's called non-recurring , since there is no specific pattern of re-occurrence. Broadly, these are the three types of numbers we see in Mathematics. 'Terminating', 'non-terminating recurring'and 'non-terminating non-recurring'. These two categories together are called Rational numbers. and the numbers in this category are called Irrational numbers. These two categories together form Real numbers. This is the other definition of Real numbers. Rational numbers and Irrational numbers together form Real numbers. In the second part of this video, we will look at all categories real numbers comprise off."

Directed Numbers,A_LOsCaRzNA,hewlett to our planet Earth weather and climate weather weather is the condition of the atmosphere off a place at a particular time the weather of a place can change rapidly it may be bright and sunny with a clear sky in the morning while in the evening the sky may be covered with dark clouds it may start raining in the morning 
,,but the afternoon may be bright and sunny the weather of a particular place depends on the temperature the moisture in the air the pressure of air the movement of air event temperature temperature is the extent of hotness and coolness of a place the earth gets heated by the Sun as the sunlight reaches the earth the land and the 
,,Seas heat up and warm the atmosphere this swarming up of the atmosphere raises the temperature moisture of water vapour is always present in the air the amount of moisture in the air rises when the sun's heat converts water from the oceans seas rivers and lakes into water vapour this is the reason why coastal areas get more rainfall than places away from the coast air pressure is the weight of air has experienced from all directions on land when air heats up it rises and creates an area of 
,,low pressure on the Earth's surface the surrounding cool air moves in to replace this rising air this air comes from areas where the pressure is high this movement of air from high pressure area to low-pressure area causes win the wind is sometimes a light pleasant breeze at other times it can be very strong and can cause a storm or a hurricane climate climate is the weather condition of an area over a long period of time climate of a place depends on its average monthly or yearly temperature average amount of rainfall or snow climate influences the type of food people grow and eat the type of clothes they wear the type of homes they live in the types

Directed Numbers,uSXcjhhBSAM,hey guys in a previous lesson we learned about the number line extended after the zero and we've introduced what we have or what we call as negative numbers now we're going to use the number line to learn how to add and subtract directed or negative numbers now at the start you're going to use the number line but after you get the hang of it you're going to become so quick and so good that you're not going to use the number line at all but it's always good always tell my students for the first couple of times that you are using and you are working with these questions even if it takes you one whole exercise or 15 or 20 or even 30 to 40 questions that you need to do using the number line there's nothing wrong with it use it and after you get the hang of it you won't need the number line again but for the start let's use the number line to get an understanding of how it actually works here we have questions and these questions involve negative or directed numbers we're going to go through one by one and you're going to see it's a very easy process using the number line and hopefully by the end of the lesson you can probably even do them without a number line as well okay let's start we have this question saying negative 4 plus 3 negative 4 plus 3 what we do we use the number line we start at negative 
,,4 so we can put our pen or au finger on negative 4 there it is and it says we have to add 3 now a quick rule to remember when we're adding we're moving towards the right we're moving towards the addition we're moving Awards towards the plus direction and if we - thing or we're taking away we're going towards the left remember that rule very important so negative 4 plus 3 we start at negative 4 and we add 3 we're going to the right because we're adding 1 2 3 our answer is negative 1 we started negative for add 3 1 2 3 as you can see I'm caning the moves one move two moves three moves so negative one is our answer then we have another example minus 2 or 
,,negative 2 plus 6 what we do first we start at negative 2 negative 2 we're adding 6 addition meaning we're going towards the right so we're adding 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 so our answer is positive 4 we don't need to write positive we just write 4 because we know 4 means positive 4 and notice when I was counting I started from negative 2 I said 1 2 I had to ensure that I add 0 I've seen students make a mistake where they just move and they go straight to the other side forgetting the 0 very important 
,,the 0 is the number we need to add it part of the process so negative 2 plus 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 our answer is 4 let's see if you can do this one where are we going to start at negative 9 so negative 9 with it says negative 9 plus 7 so we start at negative 9 add we're going towards the right and we're going to add 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 so our answer is negative 2 negative 9 moving 7 times we end at negative 2 minus 5 Plus 8 again we start at negative 5 or minus 5 negative 5 there we're adding 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 we are on the positive was a 3/3 that's our answer now we have something a little bit different we have negative 3 plus negative 2 negative 3 plus negative 
,,2 okay what do we do here we have a plus and a negative whenever we have a plus a negative next to each other side by side they don't like each other they don't like each other at all so what I do they're a big fight they'll fight and they're always the negative will always win the negative will always win so whenever you see a 
,,puss and Nega negative next to each other like that side by side they don't like each other they have a big fight and negative will always win so how do we do it now it becomes negative 3 minus 2 negative 3 minus 2 so we start at negative 3 and we - now we said positive or we addition we go to the right - of course we're going to go to the left - 3 minus 2 or negative 3 - 2 - 3 - 2 1 - our answer is negative 5 the number is getting smaller once again negative 4 plus in brackets negative 3 now the brackets don't get confused it is exactly the same as the top so then get confused because the brackets are there it's just telling us that there is a plus and a minus just to distinguish them sometimes you'll see the brackets sometimes you don't however disregard them - 4 + - 3 + - we said they don't like one another they have a fight so and always - we'll win so - 4 - 3 we start at minus 4 and we go back 3 1 2 3 1 - 4 1 2 3 so our answer negative 4 minus 3 is negative seven another one five plus negative six in brackets we said we disregard the bracket here we notice for a plus and a minus we know what do they do they have a fight and the minus wins so five take away six we start at five notice it's a positive five so we start at five in the positive side minus six one two three four five six at negative 
,,one so we go to the left because we're taking away and our answer is negative one five take away six is negative 1 then we have 7 plus negative seven again a plus and a minus next to each other they don't like one another they have a fight - will always win 7 take away 7 I mean it's too easy but we'll still use the number line we start at 7 minus 7 so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 obviously our answer is going to go and become nothing zero 7 take away 7 is zero so this is the basics of how to use a number 
,,line to add or subtract directed numbers we're going to do a couple more examples that way you get the hang of it and by now you should already have a very good understanding of how to solve these number sentences using the number line and hopefully you probably even now see the pattern where you don't even need the number line 
,,at all now that we know how to use a number line we can actually solve a little bit more harder questions let's see how they're done in this example we have negative 3 minus and in brackets negative 3 plus 5 we know that we have to use brackets of division multiplication addition and subtraction we still have to follow that order in all our number sentences now here we noticed we have brackets so we have to complete what's in the brackets first before we go outside in the brackets we have negative 3 plus five so using the rules negative three plus five where do we start we start at negative three we add five we're going to the right one two three four 
,,five our answer is two now negative three minus two we start at negative three and we - two one two so answer in full negative five minus three minus two is negative five we start from the brackets and we move on here we have nine plus in brackets negative two minus six closed bracket so we follow the order of operations which shows that we have to do the brackets first to do that negative six my or minus two minus six we start at negative 2 and we minus 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 so negative 8 then 9 plus negative 8 9 plus negative 8 we notice a plus and a minus next to each other and we know they don't like one another they have a fight - will always win so it's 
,,9 take away 8 9 take away 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and of course the insert is 198 now answer here is one one last example negative six plus in brackets 2 times 5 again order of operations States we have to complete the brackets first so 2 times 5 is 10 negative six plus 10 so we start at negative six we add 10 so we get to the right one two three four five six seven eight nine ten our answer is positive four or just four so here we've done three examples where we do need to use the order of operations but exactly if we follow the steps we follow the process we won't go wrong the more practice you do with the number line you get the hang of it and hopefully later on you won't even need the number line at all

Directed Numbers,f4c8izcEX4s,hello graduate children today i'm here to teach you chapter four in your textbook that's directed numbers we can call it directed numbers as well so we'll see what are the basics here what is this one what what you call this one this is a number line so starting point is 0 and then towards the right hand side you get positive numbers towards left hand side you get negative numbers so 0 plus 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4 like that towards this side to the right side minus 1 minus 2 minus 3 to the left side of 0. what about in between in between means any decimals or fractions in between the whole numbers but only we mark the integers half 0.5 is in between 0 and 1. so any fraction or decimal in between the integers now what are these plus 1 plus 1.2 plus 3.5 these are directed numbers there's a direction that's why we use plus or minus so here it's better to write directed numbers in brackets because we can see that whether it's towards positive side or towards negative side now here use plus for addition and subtraction we use minus sign so therefore it is better to write directed numbers in brackets so here minus 3 means to the left side of 0 
,,3 units to the left plus 8 means towards right hand side plus 5 towards right hand side minus 4 towards left hand side so when you want to show directed numbers sign is important and make sure that you put brackets now what are the properties in directed numbers magnitude and the direction so what is magnitude means the size of 
,,the directed number just a number direction means whether it's positive or negative so consider plus 3 what's the magnitude there you take only the number plus 3 that is the distance on the number line from 0 to plus 3 this is towards right hand side plus sign represent the number is in the right hand side to zero consider minus five directed number what's the magnitude there magnitude is five so what's the meaning of that magnitude 5 means starting from 0 to -5 distance from 0 to -5 and minus means the number is in the left hand side to zero write down the magnitude and the direction for given directed numbers plus seven so what's the magnitude 7 what's the direction plus plus means to the right minus 8 magnitude is 8 minus means to the left of 0 plus 4 4 is the magnitude this is to the right and minus 10 10 is the magnitude this is to the left 0 that's not moving so magnitude 0 and what's the direction none not moving left or right minus six means six is the magnitude minus means to the left plus 12 plus 12 means magnitude is 12 and plus means to the right now look at this one numbers with the same magnitude and opposite signs are located in equal distance from zero when you add these the answer is zero now what it means now take this one so here i can start minus 3 minus 2 minus 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 like that minus 3 what it means 0 to minus 3 distance plus 3 means 0 to right hand side distance so these two distances are the same when you add what happens opposite 
,,sides get cancel out and you get 0 if this is plus 7 to get 0 you need to add minus 7. if this is 0 plus 8 is there that means you have to add minus a and if this is minus 10 is there you have to add plus 10 to get 0. so we call it's the additive inverse additive inverse means if you take plus 3 minus 3 is the additive inverse of plus 3. now if you take plus 7 what's the additive inverse that's minus 7 minus 12 what's the additive inverse of minus 12 that's plus 12 when you add these you get zero addition of directed numbers so what we do so plus 2 plus 5 so we can start from plus 2 in grade 7 you did starting with 0. now we can start with plus 2. so plus 2 is there here and adding plus 4 so straight away 4 units from here 1 2 3 4 so the answer you are getting here is the final answer so what is plus 2 plus 4 that's plus 6 so the answer is plus 6. start from plus 2 and move 4 places to the right answer is obtained from the last position on the number line let's take this one 
,,minus 3 so start with -3 plus plus means to the right and plus 4 means you are moving 4 places to the right 1 2 3 4 so you're moving to this side so what's minus 3 plus 4 answer is plus 1 this one negative 2 plus negative 3 so starting from negative 2 and adding negative 3 adding means to the right but you are subtracting here another minus three now again you have to go back to left so another three one two three to the left side so what's the final answer minus 2 adding 3 places to the left so final answer is minus 5. so start from minus 2 and move 3 places to the left answer is obtained from the position on the number line find minus 4 plus 7 so starting from minus 4 plus seven that means moves to the right seven places one two three four five six seven so here to here so what's the final position plus 3 here 2 this is 3 so plus 3 is the answer this one plus seven and minus eight so here plus seven starting point is plus seven adding and here minus eight so minus means you have to move eight places to the left one two three four five six seven eight so this is the final position so what's the answer minus one plus 4 plus minus 7 so starting point is plus 4 plus and minus 7 means moves 7 places to the left so what's the answer 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 so here 2 here so the final position is minus 3 write down the answer at once now all are positive and addition so what you do just add the numbers and put the sign positive both numbers are positive answer is also positive and value is the sum of the two numbers so you can do at once 5 plus 3 8 sine is positive 7 plus 2 9 sine is positive 6 plus 4 10 sine is positive 8 plus 6 fourteen sign is positive nine plus one ten sign is positive and four plus four eight sine is positive write down the answer at once now what happens you get both negatives and addition sign is there so what we do both numbers are negative answer is also negative and the value is the sum of the two numbers if both are negative just add it 3 plus 2 5 but the sign is negative 5 and 3 8 here negative 7 plus 6 13 negative 30 5 and 5 10 that's negative 10 9 plus 2 11 that's negative 11 and four plus four eight that's negative eight write down the answer at once now what happens one is positive and the other one is negative so what we do here addition of directed numbers with opposite signs ignore the sign and take the difference between the two values sine of the answer is always the sign of the larger number so what we do take the difference 7 and 2 difference is 5. and which one is a bigger plus 7 so the answer is plus 5. 6 and 3 difference is 3 positive 6 is the bigger one it's plus 3 10 and 4 what's the difference 6 but large number is negative so negative 6 here 11 and 8 what's the difference 3 large number is positive so you put positive 3 subtraction of directed numbers now you are asked to find out plus 4 minus minus 2 using number line so what's the starting value plus 4 here subtraction is left and minus 2 you need to get the opposite direction so that means plus 2 so 2 places to the right so you get 6 is the answer so we can write plus 4 minus minus 2 is plus 6. this one find minus 3 minus minus 5 using number line so minus 3 is the starting point minus means left subtraction and minus 5 you have to consider the opposite that means five places to the right one two three four five so you get plus two so minus three minus minus five is plus 2. find the answer using number line so starting value is plus 3 minus minus means left here plus 4 so left 4 places 1 2 3 4 so you get this number so what's the answer minus 1. 5 minus minus 7 start with minus 5 okay so these are all positive numbers and here minus is left and another minus means opposite direction seven places to the right one two three four five six seven so you get plus 2 as the answer so make sure that you put brackets so the answer is plus 2. this one plus 4 is the starting point minus plus 6 means 6 places to the left 1 2 3 4 5 6. 6 places to the left the final as is minus 2 so you can write -2 there zero minus minus four what's the starting value zero and here minus and another minus get cancel out so you are moving four places to the right one two three four what's the final answer you get plus four so here also plus four is the answer this one 0 that means starting point is 0 minus plus 5 means moves 5 places to the left 1 2 3 4 5. you get minus 5 so what's the answer minus 5 is the directed number plus 2 minus plus 4 starting value is plus 2. this is all positive and minus to the left 4 units 1 2 three four so here this way so the answer is minus two write down the answer at once now you know what you have to do so here 7 and these all this is positive both positive and the subtraction just subtract 7 minus 5 plus 2 8 minus 4 what's 8 minus 4 plus 4 10 minus 6 you get 4 and this is plus 4 9 and plus 5 difference is 4 and this is plus 4 6 and 4 subtraction you get plus 2 11 and 9 
,,you need to subtract 11 minus 9 2 11 minus 9 is 2 that's plus 2 this side minus 3 and plus 4 now so here difference is 1 and look at this one so you have to add starting from minus 3 move 4 places to the left again so what's the answer 4 and 3 you get 7 that's minus 7 this one starting from minus 5 moves 9 places towards left side 9 plus 5 14 that's minus starting from minus 10 you are moving 12 places again to the left side so you are adding these two numbers so 22 and this is minus 8 and 
,,4 addition is 12 and this is minus because starting value is minus 4 you move 8 places to the left starting point is minus 9 move 11 places to the left that means just add these two numbers starting from minus seven subtract plus eight means moves eight places to the left eight plus seven fifteen that's minus additive inverse we know if it's plus 2 when you add minus 2 to both sides what happens you get plus 2 n minus 2 becomes 0 so you get x equals minus 2 so what's the additive inverse of plus 2 that's minus 2 so minus 2 is the additive inverse of plus 2 addition of additive inverse numbers the answer is 0 so when you add additive inverse you get the answer 0. now we'll see these numbers you are getting 0. how you get 0 when you add additive inverse plus 3 when you add additive inverse of plus 3 that's minus 3 you get 0 minus 2 there when you add plus 2 you get 0 minus 8 when you add plus 8 you get 0 plus 9 when you add minus 9 you get 0 minus 3 additive inverse is plus 3 minus 7 additive inverse of that is plus 7 to get 0 plus 11 additive inverse is minus 11 when you add additive inverse values you get 0 write down the additive inverse of given numbers plus 3 or 3 inverse minus 3 minus 8 plus 8 is the additive inverse 9 is minus 9 minus 6 that means plus 6 plus 11 means minus 11 is the additive inverse minus 1.5 plus 1.5 plus three and a half minus three and a half minus six point three plus six point three and plus seven and a half means minus seven and a half minus 2 1 4 means plus 2 and 1 4 so these are the additive inverse of these numbers now when you have two numbers directed numbers to subtract what you can do you can add the additive inverse and change the question for example if the question is plus 5 minus plus 2 that means you can add the additive inverse of plus 2. so this is same as plus five plus of minus two so both cases you get the same answer so here also plus five and minus two phi minus two is plus three then subtraction means moves two places to the left that is also plus three so subtraction of directed numbers means addition of additive inverse of that number write down the following subtractions as addition of additive inverse and find the answer now how can i write this question plus 7 i can write plus of minus 2 adding these two numbers so what we can do 7 and subtract 2 you get plus 5 plus 6 minus becomes plus additive inverse of minus 5 is plus 5. so you get 6 and 5 addition that's plus 11 plus 6 is there minus becomes plus of the additive inverse that's minus 2 that means 6 minus 2 you get plus minus nine and here additive inverse of minus five is plus five so nine and five addition we take the difference and put the sign of the larger number it's minus 4. this one minus 11 is there addition of additive inverse is minus 3 then minus 11 minus 3 both are the same sign add it and put the minus sign so minus 40. here also you can do the same thing minus 8 adding the additive inverse of minus 4 that's plus 4. so take the difference that's 4 put the sign of the bigger number that's minus 4 minus 6 addition of the additive inverse that's minus 3 both signs are the same so add it and put the sign minus 9 plus 11 addition of the additive inverse that's plus 3 11 plus 3 14 that's plus minus 12 additive inverse of plus 
,,3 is minus 3 both negative so add it that's 15 both negative so you get the answer also negative minus 9 adding of the additive inverse of minus 5 that's plus 5. so 
,,this is the difference because 1 is positive and 1 is negative and they put the sign of the larger numbers you get minus 4 for subtraction write down the addition of additive inverse numbers and find the answer same thing i can write minus as the plus of the additive inverse so you get 11 plus 3 40. now we'll do this one minus 6. plus 3 here you can convert to addition of additive inverse of minus 8 that's plus now these two you can add 8 plus 3 11 11 minus 6 you get 5 that's positive this 
,,one minus 9 plus minus 2 and here convert to addition of the additive inverse that's plus 6. so minus 2n minus 9 minus 11 minus 11 and plus 6 means the difference is 5 the bigger number is minus 11 so you get minus 5 minus 1 plus 8 minus becomes additive inverse of that that's plus 3 and plus plus 2. 8 plus 3 11 11 plus 2 plus 30. this one plus 11 and here convert to positive addition of additive inverse of minus 4 is plus 4 and here also adding the additive inverse of minus 2 is plus 2. now all are positive just add the numbers 11 plus 4 15 15 plus 2 17 multiplication of directed numbers so what we do ignore the sign just multiply the two numbers and 
,,then what you do if both signs are the same answer is positive always if the signs are different you get a negative answer 3 times 2 6 plus plus both signs are the same you get plus 6 2 and 2 4 both pluses plus 4 2 and 1 2 both pluses you get plus so remember same sign you get always positive when you multiply by zero what happens multiplication of directed number by zero is always zero now look at this one multiply the directed numbers 3 times 2 6 and this is plus 2 times 2 4 and this is plus 1 times 2 2 same sign you get plus 0 times plus 2 you get 0. so when you look at this side you see a pattern 6 4 2 0 what are these numbers minus 2 minus 4 and minus 6 will check whether it's true both numbers are not the same now same sign 1 is negative and 1 is positive so the answer is negative so 2 times 1 2 you get negative 2 2 times 2 4 you get negative 4 3 times 2 6 negative 6 because 1 is positive the other one is negative so here you need to remember multiplication of positive 
,,numbers answer is always positive multiplication of positive number with a negative number answer is negative write down the answer once answer is positive when multiply two positive numbers so all these are positive numbers so you get positive answer 5 times 3 50 plus 15. 4 times 3 12. so plus 12 two times six twelve plus twelve seven times two fourteen plus fourteen and four times four sixteen that's plus sixteen one times three three that's plus three eight times two sixteen plus sixteen eleven times two twenty two that's plus six times three eighty that's plus 10 times 440 that's plus find the answer 3 times -2 ignore the sign and here 1 is positive and 1 is negative you get the answer negative this is 4 minus 4 1 times 2 2 this is minus 2. 0 times -2 is 0 now look at this one same sign minus and minus so you 
,,get positive 2 2 times 2 plus 4 because both are negative both are negative you get plus 6 so what's the thing you need to remember multiplication of positive number and a negative number is always a negative answer answer is negative multiplication of two negative numbers the answer is positive write down the answer at once answer is negative and multiply a positive and a negative number now plus as minus here all these 1 is positive the other number is negative so always the answer is negative 3 times 2 6 that's negative 6 3 times 2 6 negative 6 4 times 4 16 negative 16 6 times two twelve that's negative twelve eight times five forty that's negative 
,,forty six times three eighteen that's negative eighteen eight times two sixteen negative sixteen here nine times one nine negative nine four times four sixty that's 
,,negative two times 11 22 that's negative one negative and one positive answer is always negative write down the answer at once answer is positive and multiply two negative numbers in all these both numbers are negative so the final answer is positive three times two six five times one five six times two twelve eight times three 
,,twenty-four nine times two eighteen then 4 times 3 12 5 times 3 15 11 times 1 that's plus 11 10 times 2 20 9 times 3 27 so here both negative means the final answer 
,,is positive write down the answer at once yeah you get combination sometimes positive sometimes negative both negative answer is positive one is negative one is positive answer is negative one is positive one is negative answer is negative so you need to multiply separate 9 times to 80. both negative answer is positive 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative so 10 times 3 30. 11 times 3 33 both negative that means plus one negative one positive answer is negative both negative positive answer one negative one positive answer is negative both negative answer is positive 9 times 4 36 both negative means answer is positive 12 times 224 one negative one positive answer is negative write down the answer at once look at all these questions multiplied by zero when you multiply any number by zero what's the answer 
,,you always get zero so what are these answers all these are zeros because you are multiplying by zero any number with zero is always zero find the value now you can 
,,take 2 at a time and find the answer 4 times 3 12 but it's negative now both negative the answer is positive twelve times five sixty plus one minus four and minus two four times two eight both negative means plus plus say ten minus 3 multiplication 8 times 3 24 1 is plus 1 is negative means you get a negative answer this one minus 9 minus 1 both negative means plus 9 now multiply with 4 9 times 4 36 both positive means the answer also positive minus 5 times 2 you get a negative answer because 1 is positive and the other one is negative multiplied by negative both negative now so you get a positive answer again take 2 at a time 8 times 3 24 both positive one is positive one is negative so first multiply four times four sixteen one remaining four times two eight plus one nine one plus and one negative answer is negative both negative you get a plus answer plus 33 and when you multiply by a negative the answer is a negative one both negative you get plus answer 3 times 2 6. here you can do separately these two 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative 4 times 3 12. now 12 times 6 ignore sign and multiply 6 times 2 12 1 remaining and here 72 is it positive or negative 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative here 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is 12 there minus 12 negative 12. both negative answer is positive 4. now 12 times 4 48 what's the sign one negative one positive answer is negative this one again take two at a time negative both you get positive 10 positive both you get positive 6 now multiply both positive you get positive 60. here both negative negative negative you get positive answer here negative negative positive answer now positive positive multiplication you get positive answer 9 times 4 is 30 6. find the value just multiply by two first two times one two two times three six what's the sign one negative one positive answer is negative multiply by two two times one two two times five ten ten point two is the answer both 
,,negative you get plus sign four times this 4 times 3 12 1 remaining 4 times 1 4 plus 1 5 so 5.2 both positive means answer is positive this one multiplied by 2 6 and 2 1 is negative and 1 is positive answer is negative now we look at division of directed numbers now we know multiplication 5 into plus 2 you get plus 10. now what 
,,happens when you take 10 divided by plus 2 you take this one to this side that becomes division so what's the answer you are getting plus 5 divide the numbers ignoring the sign answer is positive when dividing positive number by a positive number so just ignore the sign 10 divided by 2 you get 5. both positive means answer is also positive write down the answer once 8 divided by 2 is 4 how you decide the sign both positive means positive sign 15 divided by 5 is 3 both positive you get the positive answer 10 divided by 10 1 both positive you get 1. 16 divided by 4 4 you get plus 4 8 divided by 2 that's 4 that is also plus 4. 20 divided by 5 20 divided by 5 is 4 both positive you get positive 4. 16 divided by 8 you get 2 that's plus 2. 30 divided by 10 that's 3 you get plus 3. 40 divided by 10 you get 4 both positive means plus 4. 36 divided by 6 you get 6 both positive so when you divide both positive numbers the answer is positive now this one we know plus into minus 4 is negative 4. and when you take this one to this side negative 25 divided by negative 4 you are getting plus 6. so now look at this question both negative answer is positive answer is positive when dividing negative number by a negative number write down the answer at once both negative numbers all in all these questions both negative numbers when you divide both negative numbers the answer is positive just normal division 8 divided by 2 4 answer is plus because both are negatives 16 divided by 
,,4 4 that's plus 4. 20 divided by 5 you get 4 that's plus 4. 18 divided by 6 you get 3 that's plus 3 12 divided by 2 6 that's plus 6 18 divided by 9 you get 2 that's 
,,plus 2. 20 divided by 10 you get 2. ours is plus 2. 30 divided by 10 that's three answers plus 40 divided by 20 you get plus 2 24 divided by 12 you get plus 2 because both the numbers are negative negative number divided by a negative you get a positive answer now what happens here 1 is negative and 1 is positive so minus 8 and 
,,plus 3 we know that's minus 24 when you take plus 3 to this side that means minus 24 divide by plus 3 you need to get minus now what happens 1 is negative 1 is positive answer is negative answer is negative when dividing negative number by a positive number here also both numbers are negative you get positive 24. when you take this one here minus 6 to this side what happens plus 24 divide by this is plus 24 divide by minus 6 the answer is minus 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is always negative answer is negative when dividing positive number by a negative number so it can be positive first number and the divisor is negative or divisor is positive and the number given is negative final answer is negative write down the answer at once plus and minus so you get negative 12 divided by 4 3 plus and minus 18 divided by 6 is 3 you are getting a negative answer again minus n plus 30 divided by 5 is 6 answer is minus 6 negative positive 28 divided by 7 that's 4 you get negative 4. 27 divided by 9 you get 9 times 3 so this is negative now look at this one 12 divided by 4 you get 3 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative 18 divided by minus 6 1 is positive and 1 is negative answer is negative 30 divided by 5 6 1 is positive and 1 is negative so answer is negative 28 divided by 7 you get 4 1 is positive and 1 is negative answer is negative 27 and 9 you get 3 answer is negative 3 so you need to remember when you get same sign pluses you get positive or either same sign negatives the final answer is positive when you divide here this one one positive and one negative always you get negative answer order is not important you can get negative number divide by a positive still the answer is negative so multiplication of different signs answer is negative so in this case you get negative here you get positive for same sign write down the answer at once now combination so first multiply numbers separately and then decide the sign 7 times 2 40 both pluses answer is plus 6 times 2 12 both minus answer is plus now the division 12 divided by 6 answer is 2 this is minus and plus the sign is negative division again 30 divided by 15 you know that's 2 sign is negative because 1 is negative and 1 is positive 32 divided by 8 you get 4 1 is negative 1 is plus means answer is negative 9 times 3 27 1 is positive and 1 is negative that's minus 16 divided by 4 you get 4 both negative answer is positive 18 divided by 18 you get 1 both negative answer is positive 40 divided by 20 ans is 2. both negative means you get plus 27 divided by 3 you get 9. one negative and one positive you get minus again eight times eight multiplication 64. both negative you get plus now division 64 divided by 8 that's 8 1 positive 1 negative answer is negative 12 times 3 multiplication you get 36 1 positive 1 negative answer is negative 36 divided by 12 you get 3 both negative here you get plus 48 divided by 2 that's 24 1 negative 1 positive answer is negative 8 times 4 32 both negative answer is positive here division negative negative division you get 4 divided by 4 1 both negative means the sign is plus 18 divided by 1 you get 18. both negative that's plus 40 divided by 8 that's 5. one negative 1 positive means you get minus 9 times 3 27 and both positive means answer is positive so that's not hard you can just multiply the numbers and then decide the sign simplify following directed numbers so we can do the numerator first and then the denominator 4 times 3 12 but this is negative because 1 is positive and 1 is negative now 12 divided by 6 is 2 one negative and one positive answer is negative 8 times 4 32 is this plus or minus minus minus both means this is plus 2 times 2 4 1 minus and 1 positive means you get minus 4. now division 32 divided by 4 is 8 plus and minus the answer is minus this one we'll do these two first 5 and 2 10 minus minus becomes plus and then here three times one three one positive one negative is minus three now you can do ten times three 30 but this is negative and divide by negative 30 divided by 3 is 10 both negative means the final answer is positive this one we'll 
,,do these two 8 times 2 16 that's positive and multiplied by a negative value here 6 times 2 12 and you get a negative answer no numerator multiply you get 3 times 6 
,,18 1 remaining 3 times 1 3 plus 1 48 that's negative because 1 is positive and 1 is negative now divide by -12 both negative answer is positive 48 divided by 12 is 4. so you get plus 4 as the answer do this we'll do these two separately 9 times 3 27 that's minus and then 12 times 3 36 that's minus because 1 is negative and 1 is 
,,positive now 27 times 4. 108 that's negative negative that's positive divide by minus 36 the answer is negative 1 is positive 1 is negative how many times are there 
,,36 times what's the answer 3 3 times so you get 3 times 36 is 108 so you get negative 3 as the final this one you can do these two minus 8 and 4 minus 32. multiplied by plus 2 here 4 times 4 16 and this is minus minus plus now numerator separately 32 times 2. that's plus into minus minus 64. divide by plus 16 minus n plus minus 
,,how many 16s are there for sixty-four four so answer is minus four this one 12 times 4 you get 48 that's minus 3 times 2 6 minus minus plus now divide 48 divided by 
,,6 8 but this is minus because 1 is negative well 1 is positive 12 times 8 96 plus into minus that's minus 3 times 2 6 both minus that means plus 6. how many sixes are there divide by six you get one for 36 that's 16. is it positive or negative one is negative one is positive answer is negative these two what is eighteen times three 24 3 times 1 3 plus 2 54 but the answer is negative 6 times 3 18 answer is positive now divide how many 18s are there for 54 3 so the answer is 3 minus and plus 
,,different signs you get negative so the answer is negative 3. here we'll take these two first 4 times 3 plus 12 and then with minus 6. here 18 times 2 you get 36 that's minus 1 is positive 1 is negative now multiply these two 72 12 times 6 but the answer is negative now both negative 72 divided by 36 is 2. both negative means answer is positive now we'll look at example number one find the value of minus 3 plus minus 2 by using the number line so number line is given what's the starting point minus 3 so this is the starting point and then what we do plus minus 2 means 2 places to the left so 2 places to the left means answer is minus 5 review exercise 
,,now we'll take the review exercise find the value of each of the following by using the number line plus 2 and plus 6. so we'll take the number line okay so what's the starting value plus 2 so here i'll take minus 2 minus 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and we'll put 8 here these are pluses that's the number line starting point is plus 2 and 
,,plus 6 means 6 places to the right one two three four five six so what's the answer plus eight plus eight and minus 5 so we'll take the number line again so plus 8 is there so we need 8 i'll mark this one as 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 minus 1. now start from plus 8 and plus minus 5 means moves 5 places to the left so 1 two three four five what's the answer plus three minus two n plus three we'll take it minus two so that means i'll take this one as minus 3 minus 2 minus 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 these are pluses so starting value is minus 2 plus plus 3 means move 3 places to the right 1 2 3 answer is plus 1. this one take the number line and starting value is minus 3 so 
,,you need to check minus three but here minus means moves left so we'll start from here plus one you need to decide what are the numbers you need so here minus 3 is the starting point and here this is left means you need more minus values so four places to the left one two three four answer is minus seven this one plus 4 and minus 6 is there that means towards left side so we'll take plus 4 here starting point is plus 4 6 to the left 1 2 3 4 5 6. so you get minus 2. find the value of each of the following you can do it at once what's the condition both pluses means just add the two numbers 3 plus 2 5 so you get plus 5 now both negative that's also adding two numbers four plus two six you put a negative sign here one is positive one is negative you take the difference five and three difference is two but bigger number is positive you put plus 2 plus and minus take the difference that's 6 bigger number is negative so you put negative 6 here this is additive inverse addition so what's the answer negative 7 and 7 difference is 0. so when you add additive inverse you get 0. these two all positive so that means adding the numbers 5 plus 2 7 7 plus 3 now here all these negative numbers so that means adding negative numbers 3 plus 1 4 4 plus 4 8 what this is negative 8. all these two these two positive and the other one is negative so what is this one plus two plus four you get plus six now you have to take the difference because 1 is positive and 1 is negative so 9 and 6 difference is 3 bigger number is negative so minus 3. here you have to take the difference because 1 is positive and the other one is negative so 5 over 7 minus 2 over 7 that's 3 over 7. so answer is 3 over 7. how you decide the sign the bigger one is this that's positive 1 is positive 1 is negative 2 so take the difference when you subtract you get 8 and here 1. so 1.8 is the answer which one is bigger 5.2 that's negative so the answer also negative here what are these two additive inverse so additive inverse addition is zero example number one find the value of plus 2 minus minus 3 by using the number line so here first look at it plus 2 and minus minus that means you have to move towards right side so starting with plus 2. so we can take plus 2 somewhere here so this is plus 1 0 minus 1 minus 2 plus 3 plus 4 plus 5 plus 6 plus 7 so start with plus 2 here move three places to the right one two three so what's the final answer that's plus five find the value of minus 2 minus plus 3 by using the lambda line so before we mark the numbers just see minus 2 that means starting value is minus 2 moves to the left 3 units so when you are marking the number line we can take i'll take minus 6 minus 5 minus 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 starting with minus 2 moves left by 3 units 1 2 3. so the answer is minus five example number three find the value of minus two minus minus three by using the number line so we'll take the number line now here before we mark the points you have to look at carefully starting point is minus 2 minus minus means you have to move to the right side by 3 units so we can take minus 3 minus 2 minus 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6. these are positive values so starting value is minus two moves three places to the right one two three that's the answer plus one exercise 4.1 find the value by using the number line so we'll take the number line and now how we label you have to look at starting value is plus 4 and minus means you are moving to the left so plus 4 will mark it somewhere here and starting value is plus 4 moving towards left side by 2 units so final answer is plus two take a number line for this now how we label this so here starting point is plus 1 and here minus minus means moves towards right side so we can start from here i'll take plus 1 here plus 2 plus 3 plus 4 plus 5 
,,plus 6 like that and here this is 0 minus 1. so start from plus one and moves two places to the right one two so what's the final answer final answer is plus three this one using number line so we'll take the number line and starting with minus 2 and here minus means moves to the left so we'll start -2 somewhere here it's easy first you decide otherwise you can't put all the numbers so this is plus 1 minus 3 minus 4 minus 5 minus 6 like that starting value is minus 2 3 places to the left one two three so you get minus five this one minus one and minus minus 3 so what you have to do starting with minus and minus minus means moves towards right side so i'll start minus 1 somewhere here these are pluses so starting value is minus 1 moves three places to the right one two three one two three so answer is plus two this one starting value is minus 6 and you have to move towards right side because minus minus towards right side so we'll start from -6 here so starting value is minus 
,,6 5 places to the right 1 2 3 4 5 answer is minus 1 this one starting point is plus 2 minus minus means towards right hand side so i can start with plus 2 here here 
,,plus 1 and 0 starting with 2 and 2 places to the right this is plus 4. example number four find the value of plus two minus minus four so we can use addition of additive inverse i can change the question to adding the additive inverse of minus 4 that's plus 4. now both positive 4 plus 2 addition is plus 6. find the value of minus 5 minus plus 2. so convert this to additive inverse adding the additive inverse of plus 2 that's minus 2 now this is both minus addition so just add it and put the sign so you get minus 7. find the value of minus 7 minus minus 3 so how you do minus 7 is there adding additive inverse of minus 3 is plus 3 now difference 7 and 3 
,,difference is 4 and put the sign of the bigger number that's minus 4. example 7 find the value of minus 12 minus minus 15 minus plus 5. so these two i can convert minus 12 addition of additive inverse of that plus 50 and here also adding additive inverse that's minus 5. now these two take the difference minus 12 and 15 take the 
,,difference you get 3 that's positive now again consider this one now 1 is positive and 1 is minus you take the difference difference is 2 and the bigger number is minus you get minus 2. example eight find the value of plus three fifths minus so you can do the additive inverse of plus one over 5 means minus 1 over 5. now this is 
,,difference so you take 3 over 5 minus 1 over 5 that's 2 over 5 is the difference which one is bigger positive answer is bigger so the answer is plus 2 over 5. example 9 minus five and a half minus plus two so what you do i can rewrite this as adding the additive inverse of plus 2 that's minus 2. so this means both minus now edit 5 and 2 7 and you get 7 and a half both minus means the answer is minus example 10 minus 3.2 minus i can write plus of the additive inverse of plus 1.4 that's minus 1.4 now both negative negative means adding so 3.2 and 1.4 just add it you get 4.6 but both negative means the answer also negative example number 11 find the value of minus 8.4 minus minus i can change it to plus with the additive inverse of minus 2.5 that's plus 2.1 now 1 is negative 1 is positive take the difference 6.3 so which one is the bigger number minus so you put a minus psi exercise 4.2 fill in each cage with the suitable directed number here minus 5. we can convert to additive 
,,inverse of plus 3 that's minus 3. now both negative add the two numbers 5 plus 3 8 so you put minus eight this one convert to additive inverse so this is plus with plus four one is positive one is negative take the difference four and three difference is 1 bigger number is positive plus 1. convert to additive inverse plus 7 plus minus 1 additive inverses plus 1 7 and 1 both positive you get plus 8. this one plus 7 additive inverse of minus 2 that's plus 2 and both pluses 7 plus 2 you get plus 9. find the value of each of the following so 4 you can write this one as adding the additive inverse of this 4 minus 1 you get 3 positive number because the higher number is positive minus 8 plus additive inverse of minus 2 that's plus 2. take the difference 8 and 2 difference is 6 bigger number is minus answer is minus 6 convert to addition plus of additive inverse that's plus 7 take the difference because 1 is negative and 1 is positive so you get 4 bigger number is positive that's plus 4 here also you can start from plus 9 addition of the additive inverse that's plus 6 9 and 6 addition 15 that's plus minus 5 addition of additive inverse plus 5 yeah minus 5 and plus 5 difference is 0 this one adding the additive inverse that's minus 3 so 0 and minus 3 answer is minus 3 here minus 11 addition of additive inverse of plus 4 that's minus 4 both negative so add it so 15 answer is negative this one convert the question plus 2 plus minus 1 adding of the additive inverse that's plus 4 2 minus 1 take the difference you get plus 1. plus 1 and plus 4 you get plus 5 this one i can take minus 5 convert to addition additive inverse of this is minus 2 again convert this one plus with additive inverse that's plus 6. now these two both negative so just add it and put the sign this is plus 6 now 1 is positive and 1 is negative take the difference 7 and 6 difference is 1 bigger number is negative so you get negative 1 this one plus 4 and here adding the additive inverse that's minus 2 again adding the additive inverse that's minus 8. now 4 and 2 take the difference that's 2 that's plus 2. and now again take the difference 8 and 2 difference is 6. bigger number is negative so you put negative six this one four and a half adding the additive inverse of minus 2 that's plus 2 now this means adding these two numbers 4 and 2 6 6 and a half that's positive this one minus 6 and 1 4 is there adding of the additive inverse that's 1 4 plus 1 over now you have to take the difference so we'll take the difference six one fourth minus one fourth so one fourth one fourth get cancel out you get six what's the sign the bigger number is negative so the answer is negative 6 this one plus 15.7 adding the additive inverse that's plus 2.3 now this is addition 15.7 and 2.3 adding 7 plus 3 10 and 6 plus 2 8. so 18.0 so plus 18.0 this one will take first minus 2. adding the additive inverse of plus 3.5 that's minus 3.5 adding 4.5 4.1 now these two both negative that means adding you get 5.5 that's negative and adding plus 4.1 again the difference one is positive one is negative so take the difference you get 1.4 which number is bigger negative number so answer is negative 1.4 this one plus three and a half adding the additive inverse of minus 2 that's plus 2 here also adding additive inverse of this is plus one third now look at all of this all are adding so three plus two five that's the whole part half plus one third what's half plus one third convert to the same denominator lowest common multiple is six three times two so three times one three two times three six so two times one two so you get five over six so what's the final answer 5 and 5 over 6 so that's positive example number one simplify so here multiplication what you do just multiply the two numbers and same sign you get plus multiplication here 6 and 2 12. 1 is positive and 1 is negative answer is negative simplify the following here first one two times five ten one is positive the other one also positive both positive means ansi is positive second one three times two six 1 is negative 1 is positive answer is negative third one 5 times 3 
,,15 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative 15. here 4 times 3 12 12 times 2 24. now we'll decide the sign both negative you get plus again plus with plus answer is plus example number four plus 2.5 into minus 5. just multiply by 5 first 5 times 5 25 5 times 2 10 plus 2 12. so 12.5 how do you decide the sign one is positive one is negative answer is negative here multiplied by 12 first 3.4 multiplied by 12. 10 and 2 4 and 3 2 times 4 8 2 times 3 6. when you add it you get 4 0 8 and here 1 decimal place so 40.8 is the answer but how you decide the sign minus minus both the final answer is positive find the value exercise 4.3 so straight away you can do 5 times 420 both positive means answer is positive 5 times 420 1 is negative 1 is positive answer is negative 10 times 550 both negative answer is positive 7 times 3 21 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative both negative just multiply 1 times 4 4 both negative means you get a positive answer here 11 times 0 when you multiply any number by 0 always you get answer 0 6 times 4 24 1 is negative and 1 is plus answer is negative 12 times 3 you get 36 1 is positive one is negative answer is negative here we'll multiply first two times two four four times five twenty now we'll decide the sign one is negative one is positive answer is negative that's negative and this negative both negative means the answer is plus here 3 times 1 3 3 times 2 6 6 times 5 30 decide the sign negative negative positive here positive negative you get negative now again positive negative means the final answer is negative multiplied by 2 you get 5 both positive answer is positive now here you need to multiply by 20 3 now 20 and 3 times one two two times four eight three times one three three times four twelve when you add it you get ninety four point three now one is positive one is negative means answer is negative example number one now it's division same thing you divide and finally you can put the sign 6 divided by 2 you get 3 both negative you get positive 3 6 and 2 division you get 3 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative this one 15 divided by 5 answer is 3 both 
,,positive you get positive 3 9 divided by 3 is 3 1 is negative 1 is positive you get a negative answer 15 divided by 3 you get 5 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative 9 divided by 3 3 both negative you get positive answer exercise 4.4 find the value of each of the following 10 and 2 division you get 5 plus and plus both 
,,positive means the final answer is positive 12 divided by 4 that's 3 both negative means final answer is positive 15 divided by 3 is 5. 1 is positive and 1 is negative answer is negative here 21 divided by 7 is 3 1 is negative and 1 is positive answer is negative negative 5 divided by 5 5 divided by 5 is 1 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative 1. 20 divided by 4 is 5 both negative means answer is positive now here 8 times 2 16 both positive that's positive now you have to divide by this 16 divided by 4 that's 4. 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative this one we can simplify the denominator first 6 and 2 multiplication that's 12 both negative means you get positive ones now 36 divided by 12 is 3 1 is negative 1 is positive answer is negative do the numerator 5 times 4 20 one negative one positive 
,,answer is negative denominator now 2 and 2 4 both minus means positive 1's now do this one 20 divided by 4 is 5. 1 is negative 1 is positive answer is negative do the numerator 9 times 8 72 both negative means plus answer 4 times 3 12 1 is negative 1 is positive answer is negative 72 divided by 12 you get 6 1 is positive and 1 is negative answer is negative fill in each cage with the suitable directed number answer is negative that means you are getting a plus value so 20 divided by 2 you get 10. so plus 2 because minus n plus the answer is negative 18 and 6. how you get 6 18 divided by 3. now decide the sign this is plus answer is negative that means 
,,you are getting negative 3 division you get 5 that means 10 divided by 2 is 5. now decide the sign this is plus here minus so both should be minus to get plus answer answer is 4 4 divided by 1 is 4 positive and the answer is negative so this should be negative value how we decide this one when you divide this one by 2 you are getting 6. so think about reverse way so if this is 12 here 12 divided by 2 you get 6. how you get 12 from 3 this should be 4 now decide the sign this is minus and minus if it's plus and minus the answer is minus but the answer is given is plus so that means this should be a minus value so minus 4 now this one you are getting minus 28 here plus 7 is there 7 into 4 28 but this is minus means this should be minus 4 now numerator is ok now to get 7 what should be this answer you are getting minus 4 because minus minus plus 28 divided by 4 is 7. now how you get minus 4 there 2 times 2 but this is minus so you have to multiply it by minus 2. so we covered all theory related to directed numbers subtracting a number from another number is the same as adding the additive inverse of the second number to the first number a positive number is obtained when two directed numbers of the same sign are multiplied or divided a negative number is obtained when two directed numbers of opposite signs are multiplied or divided so remember all these properties in directed numbers and practice all the exercises and examples

Directed Numbers,_BgblvF90UE,"Hi, welcome to Math Antics. In our last video, we learned what negative numbers are, and we learned that they're part of a special set of numbers called ‘integers’. "
,,"Next, we need to learn how to do arithmetic with those integers. In this video, we’re gonna learn how to add and subtract integers. In the next video we’ll learn how to multiply and divide integers. Adding and subtracting whole numbers is pretty easy because there’s really only two possibilities: you’re either adding two positive numbers, or subtracting two positive numbers. But adding and subtracting integers is more complicated, because with negative numbers in the mix, there’s a lot more possibilities. Fortunately, you don’t need to memorize all these possibilities. Instead, we’re gonna learn some simple rules and strategies that will make the process a lot easier . Let’s start by learning two key rules that are really helpful to know when working with negative numbers. The first rule is this:  Adding a negative is the same as subtracting a positive. To visualize what that means, suppose I give you positive two cupcakes, You’d be pretty happy, right? But what if I ‘give’ you negative two cupcakes instead? That’s the same as taking two cupcakes away from you. Would you still be happy? When it comes to math, this rule means that if you "
,,"have a problem like this: 5 + -1 (where you’re adding a negative number), you can just change it to subtraction. Instead of 5 + -1, you can just write 5 ? 1. They’re different ways of writing the same thing. Okay, so rule #1 is:  Adding a negative is the same as subtracting a positive. Now what about rule number #2? Well the second rule is this:  Subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive. Let’s say you have negative two cupcakes.  Like if you have a debt… you OWE me two cupcakes. You wouldn’t be too happy having that negative, would you? But, what if I subtract that negative from you? Taking away the negative two made you more positive, right? Subtracting the negative gives you less debt! When it comes to math, this rule means that if you have a problem like 5 ? (-1), where you’re subtracting a negative number, you can just change it to addition. Instead of 5 ? (-1), you can just write 5 + 1, and that’s a problem you already know how to solve. Alright, now that "
,,"you know our two rules, I want to show you that there’s really only four different types of problems (or 4 cases) when adding or subtracting integers. In case 1, you start with a positive number and you make it more positive. In case 2, you start with a positive number and you make it more negative. In case 3, you start with a negative number and you make it more negative. And in case 4, you start with a negative number and you make it more positive. The key to getting the right answer to the problem is to figure out which of these cases you’re dealing with, so let’s look at each case in more detail. In case 1, you start with a positive number and you "
,,"make it more positive. The good news is that you already know how to do that!  That’s just what regular addition is. For example, when you have the problem 7 + 3, you’re starting with a positive 7 and you’re making it more positive by adding positive 3 to it, to get the answer of positive 10. But, what if instead of 7 + 3, you're given the problem 7 ? (-3)?  That seems a lot harder, right? Well, if you remember rule #2, it’s not harder at all. In fact, it’s exactly the same problem because "
,,"rule #2 says subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive. We can change the “minus minus 3” into “plus 3” and we get the same answer: positive 10. So case 1 is just addition like you’re used to doing, but now that we have negative numbers, there’s a new way that it could be written that you need to be on the lookout "
,,"for. Oh, and in this case (starting with a positive and making it more positive), you know your answer will always be positive because you stay on that side of the number line. In case 2, you start with a positive number, but you make it more negative. That is, you do something to it that makes its value smaller (or moves it to "
,,"the left on the number line). But that’s just like regular subtraction like you already know how to do. For example, here we have the problem 8 ? 5. We start with a "
,,positive 8 but we make it more negative by subtracting 5 from it. Subtracting 5 moves it to the left on the number line down to 3 as our answer. Our answer is still 
,,"a positive number, but it’s less positive than it was before. And that raises an interesting question: What if we subtract even more, to move it further in the negative direction? Like, what if we subtract 8 instead of 5?  That would take us all the way back down to zero on the number line. And before you knew about negative numbers, back when you thought the number line just stopped at zero, you probably thought that’s all we could take away.  But watch this… Let’s start with positive 8 but then subtract 10 from it!  Can we do that? Can we subtract a bigger number from a smaller one? Now we can!  It just means that the answer we get will be a negative number. Starting with positive 8 and subtracting 10 takes us past zero, and down to negative 2 on the number line. So our answer is negative 2. As you can see, case 2 is a little more complicated, because the answer can be positive, negative or even zero, depending on the numbers you’re subtracting. And it’s even more complicated than that because there’s also another way this type of problem can be written, thanks to rule #1. Rule #1 says that adding a negative is really the same as subtracting a positive. And that means our original subtraction problem (8 ? 5) could have been written like this instead (8 + -5). But either way it’s written, you’re starting with a positive and making it more negative. Now on to case 3…  In case 3 you start with a negative number and you make it more negative. That’s really just the opposite of case 1 where we started on the positive side of the number line and made it more positive. For example, let’s say that you’re given the problem: -7 + "
,,"-3. That means that you start with negative 7 and then you make it even more negative by adding negative 3 which gives you negative 10 as the answer. And as you might have guessed by now, thanks to our rules, there’s another way we could write this type of problem. Because of rule #1, we know that adding a negative 3 is the same as subtracting 3. So this problem could also be written like this: -7 ? 3. But either way it’s written, in this case you’re starting with a negative number and making it even more negative. And because of that, you know that your answer will always be negative for case 3 since you stay on the negative side of the number line. And finally, in case 4, you also start with a negative number, but this time you’re gonna make it more positive. Here’s an example of a problem like that: -8 + 5. This problem starts with negative 8 but then we add positive 5 which makes it more positive, or moves us to the right on the number line, up to -3 which is our answer. "
,,"Our answer is still negative, but it’s less negative than what we started with. Ah, but this looks similar to case 2, right? Imagine what would happen if you made it even more positive. You could add 8 (instead of 5) and that would move you all the way up to zero. And if you added even more, like -8 + 10, that would take you to "
,,"the positive side of the number line and give you the answer of positive 2. So just like in case 2, the answer here can be positive, negative or even zero depending "
,,"on the numbers you‘re adding. And, just like before, there’s another way this type of problem can be written. Remember rule #2? …that subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive. Because of that rule, -8 + 5 could also be written as -8 ? (-5). That’s a LOT of negatives, but thanks to rule #2, we can write our “minus "
,,"minus” as a “plus”. But either way it’s written, in this case, we start negative and move in the positive direction. Okay, now that we’ve learned our two rules and we’ve seen that there’s really just four types of problems (or 4 different cases) that you’ll need to solve, I want to give you a basic strategy that will help when you’re adding or subtracting integers. This strategy involves asking 3 simple questions: The first question is, “Am I starting with a positive or a negative number?” "
,,"This question is easy to answer because all you have to do is look at the sign in front of the first number of the problem. If there’s no sign, then you’re starting "
,,"with a positive number. But if there’s a minus sign, then you’re starting with a negative number. Once you know what you’re starting with, the next question to ask is, “Am I making it bigger or smaller?” In other words, is what you’re adding or subtracting going to make the value move in the positive direction of the number line or the negative direction? If you’re subtracting a positive or adding a negative (Rule #1) then you're making the value smaller, which is moving to the left on the "
,,"number line. If you’re adding a positive or subtracting a negative (Rule #2) then you're making the value bigger, which is moving to the right on the number line. And the last question that you need to ask is, “Will my answer be positive, negative, or zero?” The answer to this will depend on which case you have and what values you’re working with. If it’s a case 1 problem, you know the answer will always be positive, and if it’s a case 3 problem, then you know the answer will always be negative. But you’ll remember that in cases 2 and 4, the answer could change between positive, negative or zero depending on the difference between the two numbers that "
,,"you’re working with. So asking these three questions will help you visualize what’s happening in the problem that you’re trying to solve, and it’ll help you get the "
,,right answer. But the most important thing that you can do to get good at integer arithmetic is to practice. It’s important that you try a lot of problems that you have an answer key for so that you know if you’re doing it right. And don’t get discouraged if it’s confusing at first.  You’ll get it if you practice! And you might

Directed Numbers,OAoLCXpao6s,"Hi, welcome to Math Antics.  In this lesson, we’re gonna learn about negative numbers. Negative numbers can be a little confusing at first, so don’t get discouraged "
,,"if it takes you a while to get it. To learn what negative numbers are, we first need to start with ‘whole numbers’. You remember what whole numbers are, right? They’re the set of numbers on the number line, starting with zero, and then counting up one at a time: 1, 2, 3, 4… all the way to infinity. That’s a LOT of numbers, but it’s only half the story! And that’s because the number line really goes in BOTH directions. You’re used to seeing the number line starting at zero and just going to "
,,"the right, but the number line also goes to the left. And what numbers are on that part of the number line? Yep… you guessed it… negative numbers. The negative numbers are just like a mirror image of the numbers on the right side of the number line that we call the positive numbers. And zero is the special number that separates "
,,"the positive numbers from the negative numbers. By the way, when you combine all these numbers (1 ,2, 3, and so on up to infinity, and -1, -2, -3, and so on down to "
,,"negative infinity, and the number zero) that entire set of numbers gets a special name in math.  They’re called ‘the Integers’. As you can see, the negative numbers "
,,"look just like the positive numbers. The only difference is that they have a ‘negative sign’ in front of them. The negative sign looks just like the minus sign. In fact, if we wanted to, we could write a positive sign (a plus) in front of all the positive numbers. But to save time, we just assume that if a number doesn’t have any sign in front of it, then it’s positive. Positive is the ‘default’ sign. Okay, now that you know what negative numbers are, we need to learn how to compare them to other integers. Remember that in math, comparing just means saying which of two numbers is bigger or smaller than the other, or saying that they’re equal. And to do that, we use the greater than, less than, or equal signs. You’re probably already pretty good at comparing positive integers. Like if I ask, “Which is bigger: 2 or "
,,"3 ?”  You know that 3 is bigger than 2. But what if I asked you to compare two negative integers?  “Which is bigger: -2 or -3 ?” Ah, this is where negative numbers can be a little tricky, especially if this is your first time learning about them. That’s because you’re SO used to 3 being bigger than 2 that when you see -2 and -3, it’s really tempting to think that -3 must be bigger than -2, but it’s NOT! Negative 3 is actually smaller (or less) than negative 2. And to help you understand why, let’s look at our number line again. Have you noticed that if you start at zero on the number line and then you move to the right, the numbers keep getting bigger "
,,"and bigger as you go along. 1 is greater than 0, 2 is greater than 1, and 3 is greater than 2, and so on… But what if we go in the opposite direction instead; to the left? As we go to the left, the numbers get smaller and smaller. 2 is less than 3, 1 is less than 2, and 0 is less than 1. Well, those same exact rules apply to negative side of the number line also. The numbers get bigger as you go to the right and they get smaller as you go to the left. So, since -3 is on the left side of -2, it’s actually smaller than -2. I like to think of it like this… On the positive side of the number line, 3 is more positive than 2 (so it’s bigger). But on the negative side of the number line, -3 is more negative than -2 (so it’s smaller). And you can use that idea no matter what the numbers are. On the positive side, 500 is more positive than 200 (so it’s bigger) but on the negative side, -500 is more negative than -200 (so it’s smaller) Keep that in mind if anyone every offers to give you negative 500 dollars. The ‘500’ part sounds pretty good, but the negative part… not so much! Alright, so the positive integers are on the right side of zero on the number line, which means they’re all greater than zero. And the negative integers are all on the left side of zero on the number line, which means they’re all less than zero. Wait… Hold on a second… “Less than zero!?” How… How can ANY number be less than zero? I mean… Doesn’t zero mean ‘nothing’? Ah, that’s a good question. At first, it can be hard to see how there could be numbers that are less than zero, but here’s an example that will help you understand. Let’s say we want to use integers to measure how many meter above sea level small islands are. This island is 10 meters above sea level. This island is only 5 meters above sea level. And this island here happens to be exactly the same height as sea level. So we can use the integer zero to show how it’s height compares to sea level. But what about this island? It’s not even above sea level at all. It’s 5 meters below the surface. But our measurement is supposed to tell us how many meters ABOVE sea level it is. Fortunately, with negative numbers, that’s no problem. We can just say that its height (compared to sea level) is negative 5 meters. Or, what about an example with money?… Suppose there’s three brothers who each have a different amount of money. The first brother has $20, the next brother has $0, and the last brother actually OWES his dad $20. What number do we use to represent how much money he has? Yep… negative 20 dollars! And temperature is another great example. We use zero degrees Celsius to describe the temperature for water to freeze, but it can be warmer or colder than that. The temperature could be negative; like negative 20 degrees! So negative numbers are very useful in the real world to help describe things that can be above OR below zero. Okay, now that you know how negative numbers work, let’s see how we can "
,,"compare any two integers. If we don’t include zero for a moment, basically there’s just three situations. You’ll either need to compare two positive integers, or two negative integers, or one positive and one negative integer. And you already know how to compare two positive integers. The further right on the number line you go, the bigger the numbers get. 7 is greater than 4, 50 is greater than 20, and 1,000 is greater than 100. It’s also really easy to compare a positive integer and a negative integer, because a positive number is ALWAYS bigger than a negative number. ALL of the positive numbers are on the right side of the number line and ALL the negative numbers on the left. So -5 is less than 5 and -40 is less than 3 and -100 is less than 1 The only tricky situation is when you have to compare two negative integers. Then you have to think about which one is further to the left on the number line. Again, a great way to do that is to identify the number that would normal be more positive on the positive side of the number line and realize that it’s more negative on the negative side. -8 is more negative than -4, so it’s smaller. -15 is more negative than -10, so it’s smaller. and -100 is more negative than -25, so it’s smaller. Alright, so in this video we learned what negative numbers are and how they can be used to describe things in the real world. They’re just like positive numbers, but on the other side of zero on the number line. And we leaned that the whole numbers, along with their negative counterparts, form the set of numbers we call integers. We also learned how to compare integers. As you go to the right on "
,,"the number line, the integers get bigger, and as you go left, they get smaller. Comparing integers can be confusing at first, so be sure to practice until you’ve really got it. As always, thanks for watching Math Antics and I’ll see ya next time. Learn more at www.mathantics.com"

Directed Numbers,jVvvUiExjes,in this video we're going to focus on adding and subtracting integers but in the first half we're just going to focus on adding integers let's start with something simple what is 3 plus 5 intuitively you know what the answer is but let's say if you didn't know what to do here's what you can do you can use a number line to help you add and subtract numbers so let's say this is 0 and we're going to start with 3 so start with the first number anytime you need to add travel on the right using the number line if you need to subtract then move towards the left so we wish to add 5 to 3 so we have to travel 5 spaces to the right 1 2 3 4 5 this is 4 5 6 7 8 that's where we ended up so three plus five is eight let's work on another example 4 plus 3 so if we start with 4 and if we travel three spaces to the right this is going to be 5 6 7 so therefore 4 plus 3 is equal to 7 and so using a number line is very helpful you will never need to add or subtract two integers is another example 
,,what is 8 plus negative 5 by the way 8 plus negative 5 is equivalent to 8 minus 5 if you wish to add a negative number start with the first number 8 add in a negative number you need to travel towards the left so 1 2 3 4 5 this is 7 6 5 4 3 so 8 plus negative 5 is positive 3 that's the same as 8 minus 5 which will give you the same answer now what about this one what is 7 plus negative 2 so for you to pause the video and try that so if we start with 7 all we need to do is travel two spaces 
,,to the left so this is 6 and this is 5 7 plus negative 2 is the same as 7 minus 2 which is 5 a positive times a negative will give you a negative sign if you multiply two positive signs this will give you a positive number if you multiply two negative numbers you will get a positive number but if you multiply a positive and the 
,,negatives together it will give you a negative number let's work on some more examples what is negative 6 plus 4 and what is negative 7 plus 8 so take a minute and pause the video and work on those examples so I'm going to use the number line technique once more so let's say negative 6 is on the last one looks at add 4 to it so 
,,we got to travel 4 spaces to the right 1 2 3 4 so this is negative 5 negative 4 negative 3 and negative 2 so therefore negative 6 plus 4 is negative 2 by the way you can reverse the numbers if you want negative 6 plus 4 is the same as positive 4 minus 6 but you have to put the positive in front now 4 minus 6 intuitively you can 
,,see that this is going to be negative 2 now what about negative 7 plus 8 that's equal to 8 minus 7 which is going to be positive 1 but let's use the number lines to 
,,confirm it so let's start with negative 7 and let's travel 8 units to the right since we're adding 8 to negative 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 this is negative 6 negative 5 negative 4 negative 3 two negative one zero positive one so negative seven plus eight is positive one go ahead and try these negative 7 plus negative five and negative three plus negative four so what is a negative seven plus negative five when you add in two negative numbers you're going to get a negative number as well 7 plus 5 is 12 negative 7 plus negative 5 that's going to be negative 12 but let's confirm it using a number line so we're going to start with negative 7 and we're going to add negative 5 to it so if you're adding a negative number you need to move towards the left if you're adding a positive number you need to travel towards the right so 
,,let's travel 5 units to the left this is negative 6 negative 5 negative 4 actually and take that back to the left the negative numbers should be getting bigger this 
,,is negative 8 negative 9 negative 10 negative 11 negative 12 so that's our answer now if 3 plus 4 is positive 7 negative 3 plus negative 4 is equal to negative 7 so 
,,now let's start with negative 3 and let's add negative 4 to it so let's travel 4 units to the left so this is negative 4 and negative 5 negative 6 negative 7 sometimes you may need to add three numbers as opposed to two numbers so what is five plus a negative three plus six five plus negative three that's equal to positive two if you have a number line and if you start with five you need to travel three units to left so going this way that's going to take you to positive two next we need to add two and six so we have to travel six units to the right started from two so this will take us to eight 2 plus 6 is 8 if you can it this is starting from 2 this 
,,is 1 2 3 4 5 6 so 2 plus 6 is 8 and that's the final answer here's another similar example what's negative 7 plus 4 plus negative 5 negative 7 plus 4 that's going to be negative 3 and negative 3 plus negative 5 whenever you're adding two negative numbers you're going to get a negative result so think of 3 plus 5 which is 8 but just add a negative sign to it so it's negative 8 now let's use the number line to confirm everything so we're going to start with negative 7 and we're going to add 4 to it 1 2 3 4 so this is negative 6 negative 5 negative 4 negative 3 so we're currently at negative 3 at this point and then we're going to add negative 5 to it so 
,,we got to go back 5 units that way so 1 2 3 4 5 so the final answer is negative 8 now let's focus on subtracting integers what is 8 minus 3 so if you're subtracting 
,,you need to travel towards the left let's start with the first number eight now we're going to travel three spaces to the left this is seven six five so eight minus 
,,three is positive five and it's just that simple so let's try 4 minus 9 so we're going to start with positive 4 we're going to travel in 9 spaces towards the left 1 
,,2 3 the 0 makes 4 5 6 7 8 9 so notice that we ended at negative 5 so 4 minus 9 is negative 5 now what is negative 3 minus 6 what is that equal to if you see a situation like this you can basically add 3 & 6 and then make it negative 3 plus 6 is 9 but this is going to be negative 9 but if this confuses you you can always just use the number line so we're going to start with negative 3 and we're going to subtract it by 6 so let's travel 6 units to left 1 2 3 4 5 6 so this is negative 4 negative 5 maybe 6 2 negative 7 negative 8 negative 9 so therefore negative 3 minus 6 is negative 9 try this one what is negative 7 minus 6 7 plus 6 is 13 so this is going to be negative 13 so let's start with negative 7 we're going to travel 6 units to the left and as you can see it's going to give us the same result now what is six 
,,minus negative four and also what's seven minus negative two whenever you have two negative signs next to each other you can make it equal to a positive sign six minus negative four is the same as 6 plus four which is 10 and 7 minus negative 2 is 7 plus 2 which is 9 now what would you do if you see a problem with three negative 
,,signs go ahead and try that now the first thing I will do is convert these two negative signs which are right next to each other into a positive sign so negative 4 minus negative 8 is equal to negative 4 plus 8 which is the same as 8 minus 4 which turns out to be 4 so using a number line I would focus on this portion now let's start with negative 4 let's add 8 to it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and as you can see we get the same final answer of positive 4 so negative 4 minus negative 8 is 4 so try a similar example what's negative 5 minus negative 6 so let's convert the two negative signs into a positive sign so this is negative 5 plus 6 which is the same as 6 minus 5 and that's positive 1 so using the number line let's add 6 to negative 5 so this is negative 4 negative 3 and this is going to go all the way to positive 1 so we're going to get the same answer so now you know how to add and subtract positive and negative integers by the way for those of you who want to find more similar videos in pre-algebra check out the description section of this video below and you can find my pre-algebra playlist

Directed Numbers,K_tPbVPfHgk,"Hi!  Welcome to Math Antics. In our last video we learned how to add and subtract integers. In this video, we’re gonna learn how to multiply and divide integers. The good news is that multiplying and dividing integers is easier than adding and subtracting them because even though it involves both positive and negative numbers, the multiplication and division still works basically the same way. As we learned in our video about negative numbers, the negative numbers are like a mirror image of the positive numbers on the number line. Each number on the positive side has a negative counterpart on the negative side. There’s a 2 on the positive side, and there’s a -2 on the negative side. There’s a 5 on the positive side and there’s a -5 on the negative side, and so on… Realizing that can help us understand that negative numbers are just like positive numbers, but they have a negative factor built into them. For example, think about the number 3 for a minute. Do you remember when we learned about factors, we learned that 1 is always a factor of any number. And that’s because multiplying by 1 doesn’t change a number. 3 and 1 × 3 are the same value. So if you have the number 3, you can factor out a 1 and you have 1 × 3. On the other hand, what if you have negative 3 instead? We could still factor out a 1 from it and nothing would change; you’d have 1 times -3. But because the number is negative, we could also factor out a -1. Doing that would give us -1 × 3. So one way to think about negative numbers is to imagine that they are just like positive numbers, but they always have a factor of -1 built into them. That means, if you want to change a positive number into a negative number, all you have to do is multiply it by a factor of -1. 5 times -1 is -5, 7 times -1 is -7, 10 times -1 is -10, and so on… And one way to visualize this is to see that multiplying by a factor of -1 just switches a number from the positive side of the number line to the negative side. Ah… but that raises an interesting question. What happens if you multiply a number that’s already on the negative side by a factor of -1 ? …like -1 times -3  Is that going to make it EXTRA negative? Nope!  In fact it’s going to do just the opposite! Multiplying a negative number by another negative factor is actually going "
,,to switch the answer back to the positive side of the number line. Multiplying by -1 acts like a switch no matter which side of the number line you start on. If you 
,,"start with a positive, then multiplying by -1 switches it to negative. But if you start with a negative, multiplying by -1 switches it back to positive. And you can "
,,"keep switching back and forth between the positive and negative side of the number line by multiplying by another -1 as many times as you want… Positive! Negative! Positive! Negative! Positive! Negative! So, multiplying by 1 negative gives us a negative multiplying by 2 negatives gives us a positive multiplying by 3 negative gives us a negative multiplying by 4 negatives gives us a positive multiplying by 5 negative gives us a negative multiplying by 6 negatives gives us a positive, and so "
,,"on… Do you see the pattern? In a multiplication problem, if you have an EVEN number of negative factors, they’ll form pairs that will balance each other out and will give you a positive answer. That’s because the pair (-1 × -1) just equals 1 which has no effect on the answer. But, if you have an ODD number of negative factors that are being multiplied together, after you balance out all the pairs, there will always be one negative factor left over that will give you a negative answer. In a "
,,"minute, we’ll see some examples of how knowing this will help us when multiplying and dividing lots of integers, but first, let’s look at the simple problem 3 × 5. We know that the answer is 15.  But now, thanks to negative numbers, we know that there’s three more variation of this problem that we need to learn how to do. This might seem a little complicated, but it’s really not. That’s because we’re gonna get the same number for the answer in all four problems, it’s just that the sign of that answer (whether it’s positive or negative) will be different depending on how many negative factors we’re multiplying. Basically, when doing integer multiplication and division, you can just pretend that the negatives aren’t there while you multiply or divide. And then, you count up how many negative factors you have to figure out the sign of the answer. If there’s an even number of negative factors, the answer will be positive, but if there’s an odd number of negative factors, then the answer will be negative. So, in the first problem, we don’t have any negative factors, so our answer is just gonna be positive 15, (which we already knew). In the second problem, we have only one negative factor being multiplied, which means our answer will be negative 15. In the third problem, we also have just one negative factor which means that our answer will also be negative 15. And in the fourth problem, we have two negative factors being multiplied. That’s an even number of negative factors, so they’ll balance each other out (they’ll switch and switch back) and they’ll give us an answer of positive 15. That’s pretty easy, right? And the really great news is that because multiplication and division are so closely related (they’re inverse operations) the rules about negative factors are exactly the same for division problems. For example, if you have the problem 8 divided by 2 (shown here in fraction form) the answer is positive 4. But if you have 8 divided by negative 2, then there’s one negative, so the answer is negative 4. Likewise, if you have -8 divided by 2, then there’s still just one negative, so the answer will also be negative 4. But, if BOTH of the numbers you’re dividing are negative (-8 divided by -2) then there’s two negatives in the division problem, so the answer will be positive 4. And one way to see that a negative divided by a negative gives you a positive is to realize that if you factor out the -1 on the top, and you factor out the "
,,"-1 on the bottom, then you have a pair of common factors that you can cancel, just like you would if you were simplifying a fraction. Okay, are you ready for some more complicated examples? In these problems, we’re gonna be combining both multiplication and division. And the good news is that it doesn’t matter whether a negative factor is being multiplied or divided. You still get to count it when figuring out if you have an even or an odd number of factors. How about this one: (-3 times 8) over -2. Well, on the top, -3 times 8 is gonna give us -24 (since 3 times 8 is 24 and there’s only one negative factor). And then, -24 divided by -2 is gonna be positive 12 (since 24 divided by 2 is 12 and we have two negatives, which means our answer will be positive.) Here’s another good example: -1 times -8 times -6 over the quantity -3 times -4. All five of the numbers are negative and since that’s an odd number of negative factors, we know that the answer is going to be negative. Watch and see… On the top, -1 times -8 is positive 8. Positive 8 times -6 is -48. And on the bottom, we have -3 times -4 which is positive 12. And then as the final step, -48 divided by 12 is -4. So it worked!  Our final answer is negative because we had an odd number of negative factors. But what we if made one slight change to that same problem? What if we made one of the numbers on top positive instead of negative? Then we’d only have four negative numbers (which is even) so the answer should be positive 4. Let’s see if it is… On the top, -1 times positive 8 is -8. -8 times -6 is  positive 48. And on the bottom, we have -3 times -4 which is positive 12. And then as the final step, 48 divided by 12 is positive 4. Just as I suspected! So do you see what I mean?  All the multiplication and division works the same. It’s just that you have to figure our whether the answer is gonna be positive or negative. And to do that, all you have to do is figure out if you have an even or an odd number of negative factors in the multiplication or division. If there’s an odd number of negative factors, then the answer will be negative. And if there's an even number of negative factors, the answer will be positive. And remember, this process ONLY works for integer multiplication and division. If you have a problem that "
,,"also contains integer addition and subtraction, you need to do those operations using the rules we learned in the last video. As always, the way to get good at math "
,,"is to practice, so be sure to work some integer multiplication and division problems to make sure you’ve got it. Thanks for watching Math Antics and I’ll see ya next time. Learn more at www.mathantics.com"

Directed Numbers,LDIiYKYvvdA,"Hi, I’m Rob. Welcome to Math Antics. In the last two Algebra videos, we learned how to solve simple equations that had only one arithmetic operation in them. But often, equations have many different operations which makes solving them a little more complicated. In this video, we’re going to learn how to solve equations that have just two math operations in them. …one addition or subtraction operation, and one multiplication or division operation. And the concepts you learn in this video will help you solve even more complicated equations in the future. Now as you might expect, equations that have two arithmetic operations in them are going to require two different steps to solve them. In other words, to get the unknown all by itself, you’ll need to ‘undo’ two operations. But that doesn’t sound too hard, right? I mean… we learned how to do undo any arithmetic operation in the last two videos. And that’s true.  But there are a couple of reason that make two-step equations a little trickier to solve. The first is that there are a lot more possible combinations of those two operations. And the second is that, when there’s more than one operation, you have to decide what order to undo those operations in. Uh…hello! If you need to know what order to do operations in, just follow the Order of Operations rules! You DID watch that video, didn’t you? I sure did! But the Order of Operations rules tell us what order to DO operations… not what order to UNDO them! Uh…Well…then… could we REVERSE the order since we’re UN-doing operations? Now that’s a good idea. Well of course it is! When solving multi-step equations, that’s basically what we’re going to do. Using the Order of Operations rules in reverse can help us know what order to undo operations in, but it can be a little tricky actually putting it into practice. So… to see how it works, let’s start by solving a very simple two-step equation:  2x + 2 = 8. In this equation, the unknown value ‘x’ is involved "
,,"in two different operations… addition and multiplication (which is implied between the first 2 and the ‘x’) And to undo those two operations, we need to use their inverse operations …subtraction and division. But the question is, which one should we do first? Like many things in life, the order we decide to do things in can make a big difference. Ah, come on! There’s gotta be an easier way! [voice from off screen] “First socks, then shoes.” Fortunately, in math, we have a special set of rules that tell us what order to do operations in. Those rules tell us to do operations inside parentheses (or other groups) first. And then we do exponent, and then multiplication and division, and last of all, we do addition and subtraction. Those are the rules you need to follow when simplifying mathematical expressions or equations. But solving an equation is different because we are trying to UNDO any operations that the unknown value is involved with so that the unknown value will be all by itself. So when solving equations, the best strategy is to apply those Order of Operations rules in reverse. Using the reverse Order of Operations is not the only way to solve a multi-step equation, but it’s usually the easiest way. Just like it’s much easier to take your shoes and socks off in the reverse order that you put them on! Ahhhhh!  Are you sure it’s socks before shoes? Since the Order of Operations rules tell us to DO multiplication before we DO addition. We should UNDO addition before we UNDO multiplication. So first, we undo the addition by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation. On the first side, the ‘plus 2’ and the ‘minus 2’ cancel each other out, leaving just ‘2x’ on that side. And on the other side we have 8 minus 2 which is 6. Next, we can undo the multiplication by dividing both sides of the equation by 2. On the first side, the ‘2’s cancel, leaving ‘x’ all by itself. And on the other side, we have 6 divided by 2 which is just 3. There… we’ve solved the equation using the Order of Operations rules in reverse, and now we know that x = 3. That wasn’t so bad, was it? Let’s try solving another simple two-step "
,,"equation that has division and subtraction in it: x/2 - 1 = 4. Again, we’re going to apply the Order of Operations rules in reverse to undo the subtraction and the division operations. Since we would normally DO the subtraction last, we’re going to UNDO it first. To undo the subtraction, we add '1' to both sides of the equation. On the first side, the ‘minus 1’ and the ‘plus 1’ cancel out, leaving just ‘x’ over 2 on that side. And on the other side, we have 4 plus 1 which is 5. And then, to undo the “divided by 2”, we need to multiply both sides by 2. On the first side, the ‘2’s cancel, leaving ‘x’ all by itself. And on the other side, we have 2 times "
,,"5 which is 10. So our answer is x = 10. Those examples are pretty easy, right? But solving two-step equations gets a bit trickier thanks to a little something in math called “groups”. Do you remember how parentheses are used to group things in math? And our Order of Operations rules say we are supposed to do any operations that "
,,"are inside parentheses first. In other words, we need to do operations that are inside of groups first. Well guess what? That means that when we’re solving equations and UN-doing operations, we need to wait to do groups LAST of all. To see what I mean, let’s solve this equation, which looks very similar to the first one we solved. The only difference is that a set of parentheses has been used to group this x + 2 together. And even though that might not seem like much of a change, it makes a big difference for our answer. That’s because, in the original equation, this first 2 is only being multiplied by the ‘x’, but in the new equation, it’s being multiplied by the entire quantity (or group) x + 2. And that’s going to change how we solve it. We’re still going to follow our Order of Operations rules in reverse, but "
,,"now that the x + 2 is inside parentheses (which means that it’s part of a group), we’re going to undo THAT operation last. Since we are supposed to DO operations in "
,,"groups first, that means we’re going to UNDO operations in groups last. So in this problem, we should start by undoing the multiplication that's implied between the "
,,"2 and the group (x + 2) To do that, we divide both sides of the equation by 2. On the first side, the 2 on the top and the 2 on the bottom cancel, leaving the group "
,,"(x + 2) on that side. And on the other side, we have 8 divided by 2 which is 4. That looks simpler already!  And we can make it even simpler than that, because now that there’s nothing else on that side of the equal sign with the group (x + 2) we really don’t even need the parentheses any more. Next, we just need to subtract 2 from both sides. On the first side, the ‘plus 2’ and the ‘minus 2’ cancel out, leaving ‘x’ all by itself, and on the other side we have 4 minus 2, which is 2. So for "
,,"this equation, x = 2. And now you can see how grouping operations differently in our equation results in different answers. Let’s try one more important example. Do "
,,"you remember the second equation we solved?  x/2 - 1 = 4 In this equation, the 1 is being subtracted from the entire ‘x over 2’ term. But take a look at this slightly different equation. This looks a lot like the original equation, but now that the '1' is up on top of the fraction line, it’s only being subtracted from the ‘x’ and NOT the 2. The ‘x - 1’ on top forms a group. Hold on!  How can the ‘x - 1’ be a group? I don’t see any parentheses or brackets around it. Ah, that’s a good question! In Algebra, the fraction line is used as a way to automatically group things that are above it or things that are below it. For example, in this fancy algebraic expression, everything that’s on top of the fraction line forms a group and everything on the bottom of the line forms another group. Of course, we could put parentheses there if we wanted to make it really clear, but it’s not required. Grouping above and below a fraction line is just ‘implied’ in Algebra. Getting back to our new problem, now that we know that the ‘x - 1’ on the top of the fraction line is an implied group, as we learned in the last example, we’re going to wait and undo the "
,,"operation inside that group last. So the first step is to undo the ‘divided by 2’ by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2. On the first side, the 2 on top and the 2 on the bottom will cancel out, leaving just our implied group ‘x - 1’ on that side. And on the other side, we have 4 times 2 which is 8. Next, we can undo the operation inside the group by adding '1' to both sides. On the first side, the ‘minus 1’ and the ‘plus 1’ cancel, leaving ‘x’ all by itself. And on the other side, "
,,"we have 8 plus 1 which is 9.  So in this equation, x = 9. Alright…  As you can see, solving two-step equations is definitely more complicated than single step equations because there are so many different combinations and different ways to group things. But if you just take things one step at a time and remember to UNDO operations using the REVERSE Order of Operations rules, it will be much easier. Just pay close attention to how things are grouped in an equation and be on the lookout for  "
,,"those ‘implied’ groups on the top and bottom of a fraction line. And, because there are so many variations of these two-step equations, it’s really important to practice by trying to solve lots of different problems.

Directed Numbers,L7DFh3_uTkI,so guys this is a website about ixl.com 
,,i found this website it is very useful so you can see a pre-k kindergarten first grade 
,,second grade third grade fourth grade fifth grade   but you can practice it daily here are some questions like 10 to 12 question 
,,you can practice it daily and if you want to   play more games and if you want to explore 
,,more concepts then you have to upgrade it   like you have to buy a packages here are 
,,so many packages for teachers for students   for educators so you can if you don't want to 
,,buy a package so you can play it practice it   daily 10 to 12 questions let's try to 
,,explore third grade mass number and comparing let's open it here are so many 
,,topics that covers to third grade   division and fluency understand fractions place 
,,value addition division and add three numbers   mixed operations equivalent fractions so 
,,here are so many topics let's choose one   topic a winner or automatic rules let's play this just wait a second it's going to be open even or odd arithmetic rule   as you know about it what are even number an odd 
,,number even number are those like the pair number   2 4 6 8 10 are even numbers and if you 
,,talk about the odd number like 1 3 5   7 and 11 and then 13 and 15 these are the odd 
,,numbers so let's wait for this law now it's open the question is is 33   minus 15 even or odd is 33 minus 15 is even or odd 
,,so what you have to do 3 minus 5 it's not possible   so you have to borrow it this is a mass 
,,rule so here it will be 13 13 minus 5 8 so 13 minus 5 is 8 and here is 2 2 minus 1 is   1 13 minus 5 is 8 and 2 minus 1 is 1 so that 
,,means our answer is 18. so what you have to do   you have to check the last number 8 18 1 8 18 
,,and 8. so 8 is even number submit your answer now the next question is 48 plus 40 is 
,,even or odd so 8 plus 0 is 8 as we know   about it and 4 plus 4 is 8 so our answer is 40 
,,88 our answer is 88 4 plus 4 is 8 and 8 plus 0   is 8 88 and we have to check the last number 
,,so last number is 88 is 8 so 8 is even number submit your answer now the next question is 61 plus 34 is even or 
,,odd so 1 plus 4 once we have to add once to once   like here is one once and in the once here is 
,,4 4 plus 1 is 5 and 6 plus 3 is 8 that means   our answer is 85 85 is our answer so we have to 
,,check the last number 5 so 5 is odd number 1357   odd number now submit your answer the best part of this website is if you do it 
,,wrong let's do it let's select the answer is   wrong okay the best part of this is this website 
,,is they will explain you like zero plus eight is   eight and nine minus five is three zero 
,,minus eight nine who said that to ten minus ten minus eight is so we have to borrow it 10 
,,minus 8 is 2 and here is 8 8 minus 5 is 6 that   means our answer is 62 this is even number 
,,but we will select wrong odd let's check it check the answer sorry it's incorrect as we know about 
,,it we have chosen the wrong answer the   correct answer is even explanation 
,,is here i want to show this part   90 minus 58 even or odd even 
,,or odd your answer is even   the correct answer is even and you have chosen it 
,,odd this is a rule you can follow this rule too   even minus even even even an odd odd even even 
,,odd odd odd even odd so 90 is even and 58 is   even so even even is even use the rule even even 
,,is even now check your answer by doing the math   you can check it in another way like 90 minus 58 
,,like we have done it 10 minus 8 is 2 and n minus 5   is 3 yes the answer is even 
,,ends in a 2 which make it even   so here is an explanation too you can 
,,check it so is 43 plus 15 is even or odd   like three plus five five plus three you can 
,,say eight and four my four plus one is five   like our answer is fifty eight so check the 
,,last number once like 58 8 is even submitted is 35 minus 10 even or odd like 5 minus 
,,0 is 5 3 minus 1 is 2 like our answer is   25 so check the last number 25 5 is 
,,our last number and 5 is odd number submit your answer 72 minus 41 so 2 minus 1 is 1 and 7 
,,minus 4 is 3 that means our answer is 31   1 is odd number our last number is 131 
,,so one is odd number submit your answer so 17 minus 5 even or odd 17 minus 5 12 
,,our answer will be 12 7 minus 5 is 2 so   our answer is 12 our last number is 2 
,,so is it even or odd it's even number submit your answer so the next question is is 5 plus 48 
,,even or odd 5 plus 48 is even or odd so if we add 48 plus 5 our answer will be 53 so 53 5 is 10 and 3 is once so 3 
,,is odd number submit your answer is 22 plus 28 even or odd let's try to 
,,solve this question so 8 plus 2 is 10   so 0 will be here and 1 will be carry 2 plus 2 is 
,,4 and 5 so that means our answer is 50 5 0 50 5   0 50. as we know that 0 2 4 6 8 10 is even number   when number starts from 0 so 0 our answer 
,,is 50 so 0 is even number submit your answer so

Directed Numbers,sEU5uaf-Tu4,hello John Zimmerman from Taba class comm and what I want to do here in this video is just quickly go over the rules for positive and negative numbers many of you out there may know and maybe you've experienced yourself your solutions your math solutions you know becoming incorrect because you messed up on one of these integer rules one of these rules that involve positive and negative numbers it's just so easy too easy to confuse some of these rules but you absolutely have to learn these to really master you know middle school and high school mathematics let's just go through very quickly and we'll start with the easy stuff first I want to take a look at the multiplication rules okay so here anytime you're multiplying two numbers where the signs the signs are the same in other words a positive times a positive or negative times a negative okay the answer is always positive okay so two times positive two times positive eight positive 16 okay so once again negative two times negative eight the signs are the same I both negative positive answer positive 16 now in multiplication when you're multiplying two numbers and where one of the signs are opposite ie ones pause and ones negative here I have a positive times a negative doesn't make a difference it could be a negative times a positive the product the answer is going to be negative okay so that's multiplication right there and these are the multiplication rules now division is the same thing okay so multiplication and division pretty straightforward so 16 divided by 4 of course will be a positive 4 negative 16 divided by a negative 4 would be okay once again signs are the 
,,same so the answers gonna be positive that's a positive 4 and now here I have a negative 16 divided by a positive 4 right opposite signs so the answer ok is going to be negative negative 4 alright so this is the easy stuff now let's get to the more challenging or what seems to give students I think a little bit more problems understanding Nishal e is addition now I'm going to kind of change colors here I'm going to tell you if you know how to add positive negative numbers then you'll be able to subtract and you'll see what I'm talking about here in a second all right so eight plus two K two positives the signs are the same okay so you keep the sign obviously it's gonna be a positive ten right all of us probably knew that now let's take a look at this okay we have a negative eight plus a negative two the signs are 
,,the same so you're going to add these values right here and you're going to keep the same sign so this is going to be negative ten all right so right here when you're adding numbers with the same sign you could tell we're just adding adding the numbers and keeping the sign so no problem there here's where it gets a little interesting to think for students right here we have we're adding two numbers with different signs so we have a negative eight plus a two all right so let me ask you which number here don't look at the sign just look at the positive version of the number which one is larger okay the eight or the - all right well clearly this one would be large we call that the absolute value but I don't want I don't want to throw out too many technical terms here okay so between the eight and a two we said that eight is a larger number okay we think of it as a larger number that's positive version and you can tell they here that a has the negative sign so here's what you do 
,,anytime you have two different signs okay you're going to end up subtracting alright so let's actually do that now okay eight and two if I took the difference I'm going to get six right I just kind of forget about that negative sign for a second but now the sign that is associated with the answer is going to have or you're going to be associated with that largest number ie the eight okay so this is you be a negative six all right so it makes sense let's let's try another one here so we have eight plus and negative two okay the signs are different so when the signs are different you're going to end up subtracting okay so subtract just the whole version 
,,or the positive versions of these numbers okay eight and two so if I just told you to subtract them or find the difference you would say okay that's six now out of the eight and two which one has a larger sign or which one is the larger number the eight is a larger number and this eight right here is a positive eight so my answer is going to be a positive six okay all right so once again I'm just kind of quickly trying to refresh some of these rules and of course you know in a few minutes I would expect you to master all this stuff but hopefully this is making sense to most you out there all right so let's talk about subtraction okay here's a deal with subtraction I said if you know how to add you could subtract positive negative numbers so what we're going to do with subtraction problems is turn them into addition problems by doing something called plus negative so here I have 7 minus 10 what I want you to do is to take that subtraction sign and you're going to turn it into 
,,an addition sign and they're going to put that little negative sign and attack it on to the number to the right of that of that addition symbol okay so you see what 
,,I did there I said seven instead of 7 minus 10 I'm going 7 plus negative 10 and then now of course I'm going to go ahead and do this addition problem the signs are different so I'm going to subtract the numbers okay and then here 10 is the larger number and it has a negative sign so I'm going to go ahead and make that a negative 3 for my answer okay and by the way too what I'm trying to do is just give you kind of a procedural some rules here I'm trying to teach you all the concepts involved in integers which are very important by the way just trying to get you some simple rules so you don't mess this up when you're actually doing calculations okay let's take a look at this last one in here we have 3 minus a minus 6 so I'm going to go ahead and turn this into a positive or excuse me an addition problem and then I'm going to tack on out negative sign to the number to the right but now I have a negative of a negative 6 or the opposite of a negative 6 okay so if I told you what's the opposite of negative 6 you would say oh that's positive six this really turns into this problem three plus a positive six or three plus six and that is nine okay so pretty much a real fast review listen if you need a lot more information on this and other topics come on over to tablet class comm we have a 30 day free trial tons of stuff we have full courses the whole idea with our products it's clear and understandable we we really design our lessons to be explained and that's the key word explained not taught down too but explain in a way that you understand so hopefully and come over and check us out at Taba class comm take one hour 30 day free trials and learn and master this stuff so your headaches and mathematics go away good luck to yourself

Directed Numbers,6U1kCOuNpR4,"Negative numbers are any number less than zero. Imagining something less than zero can be difficult. Suppose you have a bowl of oranges and someone takes them away until you have zero left. When there's nothing it's hard to imagine being able to take away more; however, there are instances in real life where we use numbers less "
,,"than zero. For example, did you know the average temperatures at the top of Mount Everest range from negative 19 degrees Celsius to negative 36 degrees Celsius? Wow, that's cold. Negative numbers also appear in finances to show debt. Suppose you have $50 in your bank account, but then you accidentally spend $60. Your account balance is now negative $10. This means you owe the bank $10. To understand this more, let's look at a number line. For every positive number, there is a negative number. Negative numbers can also be thought of as the opposite of a positive number, so the opposite of 5 is negative 5. You might also notice that as we go further down the number line the negative numbers appear to get larger. However, the numbers are really getting smaller. For example, negative 10 is smaller than negative 5. This can be confusing, but think about it in terms of temperature. Suppose on a winter's day it's negative 25 degrees Celsius in Barrow, Alaska, and negative 35 degrees Celsius in Stanley, Idaho. Stanley would be colder than Barrow because negative 35 is lower than negative 25. Now you know the basics of negative numbers."

Directed Numbers,1DKWG5CBeek,welcome to math with mr j in this video i'm going to cover how to subtract integers now when it comes to subtracting integers we're actually going to add the opposite and we have four examples here that we're going to go through together in order to get this down so let's jump into number one where we have six minus negative four so let's add the opposite so we start with a positive six and we add the opposite of negative 4 which is a positive 4 and 6 plus 4 gives us 10 and that's our final answer of positive 10. now that answer may look incorrect because if you think about it we started with a positive 6 and this is a subtraction problem and we somehow ended up with a positive 10. so we increased in value although this was a subtraction problem so that kind of goes against what we typically think when it comes to subtraction and that's because when you subtract a negative you are increasing in value and you can think of it like this and i still remember this from when i learned about subtracting integers so when you subtract a negative think of it like this taking away or subtracting debt which is a positive or a good thing so you are increasing in value so something to think about and i do have a video where i go through subtracting integers using number lines and that video can help with visualizing what's going on within these problems and just give a better overall understanding of subtracting integers so let's move on to number two where we have a negative five minus three so let's add the opposite so negative five plus the opposite of a positive three is a negative three so we're starting at negative five and we're 
,,adding negative three so we are decreasing in values so we are going to end up with an answer of negative eight let's move on to number three where we have negative 
,,one minus negative nine negative one and then add the opposite so the opposite of negative nine is a positive nine negative 1 plus 9 well that's going to give us a positive 8 for our answer so remember when we subtract a negative we actually increase in value from what we started with for example number three negative one we started with and we increased by a positive nine there we increased by nine to give us an answer of a positive eight and lastly number four negative eight minus negative seven add the opposite the opposite of negative seven is a positive seven so negative eight plus seven gives us a negative one so there you have it there's how you subtract integers use the strategy of adding the opposite i hope that helped thanks so much for watching until next time peace

Directed Numbers,jDSDvrO52Fc,addition and subtraction of directed numbers that is the addition and subtraction of positive numbers and negative numbers when adding directed numbers we usually simplify by removing the brackets by omitting the plus sign when it means odd we also omit the plus sign on the first number when it is positive thus positive tree added the positive 7 is written as 3 plus 7 here we omit the plus sign that means add and you met the plus sign because the first number is positive similarly negative 
,,tree added the negative 7 is return negative tree added the negative 7 so we omit plus sign similarly negative tree added the positive 7 is written this way negative tree added the positive 7 with the plus sign being omitted when it means addition and positive tree added the negative 7 is written this way the rule for subtraction subtraction of a directed number is e Seema's addition of that number with its sign change so positive tree subtract positive 7 is equal to positive tree added two changes sign + 7 negative 7 similarly negative tree subtract negative 7 the same as negative tree added to each in descending 7 positive 7 negative 3 subtract positive 7 the same as negative tree added the negative 7 and positive tree subtract negative 7 is e Seema's positive tree added to change the sign positive 7 so no to the actual addition if we have two positive numbers or two negative numbers we are the numbers and keep the sign so here we have positive tree added to positive 7 the 
,,two signs are the same so we add three to seven they got ten and we keep the sign wood signs are positive so we get positive ten similarly we have negative three being added to negative seven both signs are the same so we add the numbers three plus seven is equal to ten and we'll keep his sign negative ten conversely if one number is negative and one positive we subtract the smaller from the bigger number and we take the sign of the larger number so we have here positive tree added to negative seven we have a positive sentiment have a negative sign so the pod signs are different you're gonna subtract the smaller from the bigger seven subtract three is 
,,equal to four and the bigger number seven has a negative sign so the answer of a negative sign so it's negative for second example we have negative tree been added to positive seven of negative and positive de pute signs are different so we subtract seven subtract three is equal to four we keep the sign of the larger number in this case a larger number is positive so the answer is positive four and that's it for this video I am mr.

,,is see if we have different signs or the same signs in the case of number one we have a negative five and a positive seven so we have different signs so we're going 
,,to look right here so what we need to do we need to find the absolute value of our integers and then we'll take the greater absolute value and subtract the smaller absolute value that's going to give us our answer we'll use the sign of the greater absolute value for that final answer so let's find our absolute values and remember absolute value is the distance from 0 the absolute value of negative 5 is 5 and the absolute value of 7 a positive 7 is 7. so we take the greater absolute value which would be 7 and subtract the smaller absolute value which is five seven minus five is two now we need to use the sign of the greater absolute value so the greater absolute value would be this seven here and in the original problem this 7 it's a positive 7 so that means our answer is going to be a positive 2. now the other strategy we can use would be using our overall number sense and knowledge of integers in order to solve this using mental math so let me rewrite the problem we have negative five plus seven so one way to think through this problem using mental math would be thinking okay we're starting at negative five and we're adding a positive seven so we are increasing in value well negative five plus a positive five gets us to zero but we have seven which is two more than that positive five so let's go two more than zero and we land on positive two now i do wanna mention i have a video that goes through how to add integers using a number line and this really helps visualize what's going on within these problems and it's going to help with mental math when it comes to adding integers i'll drop that link down in the description so let's move on to number two where we have a positive 20 plus a negative 12. so again we have different signs so let's find the absolute value of our integers here so the absolute value of 20 is 20 and the absolute value of negative 12 is 12. so we need to do the greater absolute value 20 minus the smaller absolute value of 12 and we get 8. so we need to use the sign of the greater absolute value so the greater absolute value is 20 and in the original problem it was a positive 20. so our answer is a positive 8. let's think through this using mental math as well so i'll rewrite the problem 20 plus negative 12. so we are starting at a positive 20 and we're adding a negative 12. so we are decreasing in value by 12 from 20. so we can almost think of this as 20 and we are taking away or subtracting 12 because we are decreasing in value so we would end up at a positive eight again we are going from a positive 20 and we are decreasing in value by 12 so we would land on a positive eight for our answer on to number three where we have negative 13 plus a negative four so we have the same signs here so we will look right here so we need to add the 
,,absolute values and use the same sign from the problem so let's find our absolute values here so the absolute value of negative 13 would be 13 and the absolute value of negative 4 would be 4. so we need to add the absolute values there so 13 plus 4 is 17. and we use the sign from the problem so the sign from the problem well negative 13 and negative 4 both negatives so our answer is negative 17. now using mental math well let's think negative 13 plus a negative 4. we are starting at a negative number negative 13 right and we are adding a negative 4. so we are decreasing in value or going down in value by 4. so if we start at negative 13 and decrease in value by 4 go down the number line to the left by 4 we end up at negative 17. and lastly number four we have negative 25 plus a negative eight so same signs again so we need to add the absolute values negative 25 has an absolute value of 25 and negative 8 has an absolute value of 8. so add those and we get 33 and use the same sign from the problem which they are both negative so our answer is negative so negative 33 mental math same thing as number three we are starting at a negative 25 and we're adding a negative eight so we are decreasing in value going further left on the number line and we end up at negative 33. so there you have it there are a couple of different strategies that you can use in order to add integers i hope that helped thanks so much for watching until next time peace

Directed Numbers,cLP7INqs3JM,So let's talk a little bit
,,about rational numbers. And the simple way to think
,,about it is any number that can be represented as
,,"the ratio of two integers is a rational number. So for example, any integer"
,,is a rational number. 1 can be represented as 1/1 or
,,"as negative 2 over negative 2 or as 10,000/10,000. In all of these cases, these are"
,,"all different representations of the number 1,"
,,ratio of two integers. And I obviously can
,,have an infinite number of representations
,,"of 1 in this way, the same number over"
,,the same number. The number negative 7 could be
,,"represented as negative 7/1, or 7 over negative 1, or"
,,"negative 14 over positive 2. And I could go on, and"
,,"on, and on, and on. So negative 7 is definitely"
,,a rational number. It can be represented as
,,the ratio of two integers. But what about things
,,"that are not integers? For example, let us imagine--"
,,"oh, I don't know-- 3.75. How can we represent that as"
,,"the ratio of two integers? Well, 3.75, you"
,,"could rewrite that as 375/100, which is the"
,,"same thing as 750/200. Or you could say, hey,"
,,3.75 is the same thing as 3 and 3/4-- so let
,,me write it here-- which is the same
,,"thing as-- that's 15/4. 4 times 3 is 12, plus 3 is"
,,"15, so you could write this. This is the same thing as 15/4. Or we could write this as"
,,negative 30 over negative 8. I just multiplied the
,,"numerator and the denominator here by negative 2. But just to be clear,"
,,this is clearly rational. I'm giving you multiple
,,examples of how this can be represented as
,,"the ratio of two integers. Now, what about"
,,"repeating decimals? Well, let's take"
,,"maybe the most famous of the repeating decimals. Let's say you have 0.333, just"
,,"keeps going on and on forever, which we can denote by"
,,putting that little bar on top of the 3. This is 0.3 repeating. And we've seen--
,,and later we'll show how you can convert
,,any repeating decimal as the ratio of two integers--
,,this is clearly 1/3. Or maybe you've seen things like
,,"0.6 repeating, which is 2/3. And there's many, many,"
,,many other examples of this. And we'll see any
,,"repeating decimal, not just one digit repeating. Even if it has a million"
,,"digits repeating, as long as the pattern"
,,starts to repeat itself over and over and
,,"over again, you can always represent that as"
,,the ratio of two integers. So I know what you're
,,"probably thinking. Hey, Sal, you've"
,,just included a lot. You've included all
,,of the integers. You've included all of finite
,,"non-repeating decimals, and you've also included"
,,repeating decimals. What is left? Are there any numbers
,,that are not rational? And you're probably
,,"guessing that there are, otherwise people"
,,wouldn't have taken the trouble of trying to
,,label these as rational. And it turns out-- as you
,,can imagine-- that actually some of the most famous
,,numbers in all of mathematics are not rational. And we call these numbers
,,irrational numbers. And I've listed there
,,just a few of the most noteworthy examples. Pi-- the ratio of
,,the circumference to the diameter of a circle--
,,is an irrational number. It never terminates. It goes on and on and on
,,"forever, and it never repeats. e, same thing-- never"
,,"terminates, never repeats. It comes out of continuously"
,,compounding interest. It comes out of
,,"complex analysis. e shows up all over the place. Square root of 2,"
,,"irrational number. Phi, the golden ratio,"
,,irrational number. So these things that
,,"really just pop out of nature, many of these"
,,"numbers are irrational. Now, you might say, OK,"
,,are these irrational? These are just these
,,special kind of numbers. But maybe most
,,"numbers are rational, and Sal's just picked out"
,,some special cases here. But the important thing to
,,"realize is they do seem exotic, and they are exotic"
,,in certain ways. But they aren't uncommon. It actually turns out
,,that there is always an irrational number between
,,"any two rational numbers. Well, we could go on and on. There's actually"
,,"an infinite number. But there's at least one,"
,,so that gives you an idea that you can't
,,really say that there are fewer irrational numbers
,,than rational numbers. And in a future
,,"video, we'll prove that you give me two rational"
,,"numbers-- rational 1, rational 2-- there's going to be"
,,"at least one irrational number between those, which"
,,"is a neat result, because irrational"
,,numbers seem to be exotic. Another way to think about it--
,,"I took the square root of 2, but you take the square root"
,,"of any non-perfect square, you're going to end up"
,,with an irrational number. You take the sum
,,of an irrational and a rational number-- and
,,we'll see this later on. We'll prove it to ourselves. The sum of an irrational
,,and a rational is going to be irrational. The product of an
,,"irrational and a rational is going to be irrational. So there's a lot, a lot, a"
,,lot of irrational numbers out there.

Directed Numbers,Y6M89-6106I,"Hi and welcome to Math Antics. In this video we’re gonna learn how to do multi-digit subtraction. It’s similar to doing multi-digit addition like we learned in our last video, but there’s a few important differences. The main difference is, with subtraction the order of the problem matters. With addition, you can switch the order of the numbers you’re adding and you’ll still get the same answer. 5 + 2 = 7 and 2 + 5 = 7. But with subtraction, if you have the problem 5 minus 2, you’ll get 3. "
,,"But you CAN’T switch the problem around. You won’t get the same answer if you try to do 2 minus 5 instead. In fact, you’ll probably get confused because you’ll be trying to subtract a bigger number from a smaller one. With multi-digit subtraction, it’s important to remember that order matters, especially when you’re re-writing your problem. Often you will be given a problem like this (38 - 25) and you’ll have to re-write it with the numbers stacked up like we did with addition. But you have to make sure that the first number, the one you’re taking FROM, goes on top and the number you are taking AWAY is on the bottom. Another hint is that the bigger number should always be on top. Okay, let’s go ahead and try this problem. We’ve got 38 on top and 25 below it, and the ones places are lined up, just like they should "
,,"be. Now we draw our line so our answer can go below it, and we write a minus sign over here on the left to show that we’re subtracting. Now we can start getting our "
,,"answer.  And just like with addition, we ALWAYS start with the ones place column. Here we subtract the bottom number from the top: 8 - 5 = 3  So the ‘3’ goes in the "
,,"ones place of our answer. Now we move to the next place column to the left, the tens place. There we have 3 - 2 which is 1. There, we just subtracted 25 from 38 and "
,,"found out that the difference is 13. Alright, let’s see another example:  135 - 27 Ah-ha, this is where multi-digit subtraction can get a little tricky. Let’s re-write our problem: 135 on top, 27 below it, with the ones places lined up neatly, and our answer line and subtraction symbol in place. There… now we can start subtracting. Uh-oh!  Look at this… In our ones place column, the digit on top is smaller than the digit on the bottom. How can we subtract a bigger digit from a smaller one? "
,," Did we make some kind of mistake? No, we wrote our problem correctly… the bigger number is on top. Sometimes this just happens… the top digit might be smaller than "
,,"the bottom digit, so you can’t subtract it… unless… you borrow! Here’s how borrowing works… The top digit is 5, but the digit below it wants to take 7 away. “Sorry, "
,,"I don’t have 7, I only have 5.” “Well, what about your neighbor?  He’s in a bigger number place… he’s loaded! So you can just borrow from him.” “Excuse me, I’ve got "
,,"a little problem… do you happen to have something I could borrow?” “Why of course.  Here you go!” Great, that ‘1’ will help.  But if you just add 1 to 5, you'd get 6. But fortunately, this ‘1’ came from the next number place and it really represents a 10. And when we add 10 to 5 we get 15 which is big enough. Now, instead of this column being 5 - 7, it’s 15 - 7 and 15 - 7 = 8. Okay, we’ve got the first digit of our answer. Now we can move on to the next column. But remember, we borrowed from that number place. It used to be a ‘3’, but now it’s a ‘2’.  It went down by 1 because we borrowed from it. Well, remember… we really borrowed 10, because it was in the next number place, but it’s sometimes easier to just think of it as borrowing a ‘1’ and getting to stick that ‘1’ in front of the digit that needed to borrow. "
,,"So in the tens place, we have 2 minus 2 which gives us zero in our answer. And then, our last column just has 1 minus nothing (or 1 minus zero) so that’s still just "
,,"1. There, we’ve calculated that the difference between 135 and 27 is 108. Alright, let’s try another example with borrowing (or re-grouping as some teachers call it).  Let’s subtract 58 from 426. Again we start by subtracting the digits in the ones place column. Here we have 6 - 8, and since 6 it too small to subtract 8 from, we’ll need to borrow. We always borrow from the number place on the left. We’ll borrow a ‘1’ (which is really a ’10’) and we’ll write it in front of our borrowing digit (in this case 6) which gives us 16. And don’t forget to make the digit we borrowed from smaller by 1. You can just cross it out and write the new smaller number above it, like this. Okay, now we can subtract the first column: 16 - 8 = 8 Now for the tens place.  Since we borrowed from this column, it’s become 1 - 5, but again, "
,,"the top number is too small, so we’ll have to borrow again. We borrow a ‘1’ from the next number place over which mean that digit will change from a ‘4’ to a ‘3’. Then we put the ‘1’ in front of the borrowing digit which will make it 11. Now we can do the subtraction for that column: 11 - 5 = 6. And the last column is easy, we bring that leftover ‘3’ down to the answer line because there’s nothing there to subtract from it, and that means 368 is our answer. So now you know the basics of multi-digit subtraction. But before you move on to practicing with exercises, I want to show you one more important trick. Once in a while, you’ll come across a situation where you need to borrow from the next number place over, but that digit happens to be a zero!  How can you borrow from a zero? Well, you can’t.  So you’ll have have to borrow from the next TWO digits instead of just one. In this case, instead of borrowing from 0, borrow from 40. You’ll get the ‘1’ you need to borrow, and the 40 will become a 39. Or in this case… If the ‘3’ needs to borrow, don’t borrow from the ‘0’, borrow from the ’20’ and there will be 19 left over. Or, what if there’s two zeros in a row like this problem?  Well, if the ‘2’ needs to borrow, then borrow from the whole 500 next door. The 2 will become 12, and the 500 will drop by one to become 499. Get the idea?  You can do that no matter how many zeros are in a row. Just keep including the next digit to the left until you get a number you can really borrow from. Okay - that wraps up this lesson.  Hopefully you have a better idea of how multi-digit subtraction works, but to really get it down, you’ve got "
,,to practice. So be sure to do those exercises. Thanks for watching and I’ll see you next time. Learn more at www.mathantics.com

Directed Numbers,P9FfD7FEL-Y,in this video we're going to explore directed number this is another way of saying adding and subtracting involving negative numbers now I'm gonna start at the beginning so that you get the idea of how numbers and on the number line we can use directions to answers questions and I've started with a nice easy some that hopefully 
,,we all know the answer to three add four equals seven so the number at the front three is gonna tell me my starting position and I'm gonna need a glamorous assistant now to help me out with this on the number line so in pops my robot friend that he's gonna start out three because it's an ad he's then going to turn and face the adding direction which you can see on your screens points that way and he's gonna move forwards for spaces and then where he ends up on seven corresponds to my answer there so hopefully you've seen how we can use these simple sums as directions to actually end up at an answer let's have a look at one involving negatives a couple 
,,of things to notice about this first of all when I write a negative number I make sure it's enclosed in brackets so that I don't get confused with the negative sign 
,,and a takeaway sign and I'm also not calling these - numbers these are negative numbers because again - is another word for takeaway and it can lead to some confusion so this is three add negative four equals negative one so let's look at this the same way I'm gonna need my little robot friend to start on three like in the previous example because again this one is an addition he's going to turn and face the adding direction there he goes and I've got to be careful now because this is a negative four he's not gonna move forwards four spaces he's actually gonna move backwards he's gonna moonwalk back four spaces and when he moves back you should see that the answer to this sum where he ends up on is negative one again even though it's my answer still in brackets and still calling it a negative rather than a minus in this second question I've got three takeaway negative four and I'm suggesting that the answer to this is seven so look at this one if I stick my little robot friend on three and this time he's going to turn her face the other direction because it's a takeaway so he's gonna need to turn and face the subtract direction which he 
,,has done and it's a negative four so instead of moving forwards four spaces he's going to do the same thing again he's gonna moonwalk backwards four spaces and hopefully you can see that he's ended up on the correct answer there of seven so three take away negative 4 gives me an answer of 7 in this example I've actually given you two negative numbers and we're going to subtract as well some people see this as the most difficult combination with negative numbers but I think if we stick to our principles of thinking of it as a direction on the number line we can still do this one just as easy as the first couple so to start off with this one I've got a negative 3 at the front and this is going to be my starting position so my robot volunteer is going to appear on negative 3 it's a take away so he's now going to turn and face the subtract direction and got to be careful here it's a negative 4 so instead of moving forwards 4 spaces he's gonna slide back 4 spaces and hopefully you can see that he ends up on one meaning the answer to negative 3 takeaway negative 4 is a positive 1 here are some examples for you to have a go at I'm going to talk through these but if you want to pause the video here and have a go yourself then that's absolutely fine ok so the very first one 2 plus 5 should be no trouble here that's 7 the second one negative 2 plus 5 is actually fairly straightforward I'm going to start on negative 2 and just move 5 spaces forwards in the add direction give me an answer of 3 the next one 2 plus negative 5 have to be a little careful here if I start on to turn to the add direction but then move backwards 5 spaces I end up at negative 3 again my negative numbers are kept enclosed in brackets negative 2 plus negative 5 I'm going to start on negative 2 I'm going to turn and face the add direction but then move backwards 5 spaces giving me negative 7 moving over to the other column now looking at takeaways to take away 5 again hopefully there's no trouble here is negative 3 negative to take away five again isn't that difficult I'm going to start at negative two and just move five spaces the backwards is negative seven and then to take away negative five I'm going to start on positive to turn and face the subtract direction and then slide backwards five spaces putting 
,,me on positive seven negative to take away negative five I'm going to start at negative two and return and face the subtract direction and move backwards five spaces leaving me on positive three here are some questions for you to have a go at these questions all involve one negative only take care with these pause the video here hit play when you're ready for me to go through the answers okay some solutions to this then the first one is negative 2 and then negative 3 12 1 negative 9 negative 7 17 and 0 be careful on the last one people sometimes get confused when you end up actually on a 0 if I've got three I turn to the add direction and then move backwards three spaces end up back at 0 here are 8 questions for you to have a go at be careful with these these ones involve two negatives there's a mixture of adding 
,,and subtracting as well pause the video here hit play when you're ready for the answers okay some solutions to these then so the first one is negative 8 negative 6 positive 6 negative 2 1 negative 9 0 again be careful with this one like in the previous example if I start on negative 3 turn to face the subtract direction and then move backwards 3 spaces I'm going to end up back on 0 and the final one is negative 6 in this final question I'm going to take the idea of directed number and expand it slowly to include some algebra so here you can see some sums and they all have X's in them or unknowns variables so negative 3x plus negative 5x and we need consider what the answer of that is going to be before we start doing any of these I'm going to add in this I know that negative 3 plus negative 5 is negative 8 I know 
,,that 4 take away negative 2 equals 6 I know that 2 plus negative 8 equals negative 6 pan I know that negative 3 take away negative 5 equals 2 that's just looking at 
,,the numbers and the directed number aspects of this adding in the axis doesn't change it that much pause the video here have a go at this one yourself and I'll talk 
,,you through the answers in a minute ok so the very first one then is going to be no different to what we've just looked at in the number example negative 3 plus negative 5 equals negative 8 so negative 3 X's plus negative 5 XS is going to give me negative 8 X's in total 4 takeaway negative 2 equals 6 so 4 X is take away negative 2 XS is going to give me a positive 6 XS and I'm using these number facts all the way through to support me with the unknowns so 2x plus negative 8 X is negative 6x and negative 3x takeaway negative 5 X gives me a final answer of 2x positive 2x well done if you've got all of the questions in this video correct directed number is a really really key skill that you will need to master not only for grade C but for the higher level grades as well thanks for watching

Directed Numbers,DBSviXhkubg,"With all of the rules and scenarios, remembering how to add and subtract negative numbers can be difficult. Here's a little trick to help you remember. Let's say we "
,,"want to solve 3 plus -7. First, imagine a number line with a bird sitting on our first number, 3. The operation plus or minus tells you which end of the number line "
,,"to look at. Since we're adding, our little bird will look right toward the positive end. Our second number tells us how far to move and which direction to move. We'll move forward if it's positive and backwards if it's negative. Since our second number is a -7, our little bird is going to move backwards seven spaces. Since he landed at -4, that's our answer: 3 plus -7 equals -4. Let's try another one. What about -2 minus -4? Our first number is -2, so that's where we'll start. Our operation is a minus, so our bird will look left towards the negative end. Our second number is a -4; therefore, our bird will move backwards 4 spaces. Our bird landed at +2, and that's our answer: -2 minus -4 equals 2. Let's recap. The first number is where you start. The operation tells you where to look: Plus, right, or minus, left. The second number tells you how far to move and in which direction: positive, forward, or negative, backwards. Where you land is your answer. That's it! You now know "
,,a trick for adding and subtracting negative numbers.

Directed Numbers,NybHckSEQBI,"Hi! This is Rob. Welcome to Math Antics. In this lesson, we're going to learn some really important things about a whole branch of math called Algebra. The first thing you need to know is that Algebra is a lot like arithmetic. It follows all the rules of arithmetic and it uses the same four main operations that arithmetic is built on: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. But Algebra introduces a new element... the element of the unknown. When you were learning arithmetic, the only thing that was ever unknown was the answer to the problem. For example, you might have the problem 1 + 2 = what? The answer isn't known until you go ahead and "
,,"do the arithmetic. Now the important thing about Algebra is that when we don't know what a number is yet, we use a symbol in its place. that symbol is usually just any letter of the alphabet. A really popular letter to choose is the letter 'x'. So in arithmetic, we would just leave the problem like this: 1 + 2 = ""blank"" and we'd write in the answer when we did the addition. But in Algebra, we'd write it like this:  1 + 2 = x The 'x' is a place holder that stands for the number that we don't know yet. What we have here is a very basic algebraic equation. An equation is just a mathematical statement that two things are equal. An equation says, ""the things on this side of the equal sign have the same value as the things on the other side of the equal sign."" In this case, our equation is telling us that the known values on this side (1+2) are equal to what's on the other side, which happens to be the unknown value that we are calling 'x'. One of the main goals in Algebra is to figure out what the unknown values in equations are. And when you do that, it's called ""solving the equations"". In this equation, it's pretty easy to see that the unknown value is just 3. All you have to do is actually add the 1 and 2 together on this side of the equation and it turns into 3 = x, which is the same as x = 3. So now we know what 'x' is!  It's just 3. That almost seems too easy, doesn’t it? And that's why in Algebra, you are usually given an equation in a more complicated form like this: x - 2 = 1. This is exactly the same equation as 1 + 2 = x, but it has been rearranged so that it's not quite as easy to tell what 'x' is. So in Algebra, solving equations is a lot like a game where you are given mixed-up, complicated equations, and it's your job to simplify them and rearrange them until it is a nice simple equation (like x = 3) where it's easy to tell what the unknown values are. We're going to learn a lot more about how you actually do that (how you solve equations) in the next several videos, but for now, let's learn some important rules about how symbols can and can't be used in algebraic equations. The first rule you need to know is that the same symbol (or letter) can be used in different algebra problems to stand for different unknown values. For example, in the problem we just solved, the letter 'x' was used to stand for the number 3, right? But 'x' could stand for a different number in a different problem. Like, if someone asks us to solve the equation, 5 + x = 10. In order for the two sides of this equation to be equal, 'x' must have the value '5' in this problem, because 5 + 5 = 10. So 'x' (or any other symbol) can stand for different values in different problems. That's okay, but what's NOT okay is for a symbol to stand for different values in the same problem at the same time! For example, what if you had the equation: x + x = 10? This equation says that if we add 'x' to 'x' we will get 10. And there are a lot of different numbers we could add together to get 10, like 6 and 4. But, if we had the first 'x' stand for 6 and the second 'x' stand for 4, then 'x' would stand for two different value at the same time and things could get really confusing! If you wanted symbols to stand for two different numbers at the same time, you would need to use two different symbols, like 'x' and 'y'. So in Algebra, whenever you see the same symbol repeated more than once in an equation, it's representing the same unknown value. Like if you see a really complicated Algebraic equation (like this), where 'x' is repeated a lot of different times, all of those 'x's stand for the same value, and it will be your job to figure out what that value is. Okay, so for any particular equation, we can't use the same letter to represent two different numbers at the same time, but what about the other way around? Could we use two different letters to represent the same number? Yes! - Here's an example of that. Let's say you have the equation: a + b = 2 What could 'a' and 'b' stand for so that the equation is true? Well, If 'a' was 0 and 'b' was 2, then the equation would be true. Or, we could switch them around. If 'a' was 2 and 'b' was 0, the equation would also be true. But there's another possibility: If 'a' was 1 and 'b' was also 1, that would make the equation true, right? So, even though 'a' and 'b' are different symbols, and would usually be used to represent different numbers, there are times when they might happen to represent the same number. Oh, and this problem can help us understand something very important about how symbols are used in Algebra. Did you notice that there were different possible solution for this equation? In other words, 'b' could have the value 0, 1, or 2 depending on what the value of 'a' was. If 'a' is 0 then 'b' must be 2 If 'a' is 1 then 'b' must be 1 If 'a' is 2 then 'b' must be 0 'b' can't have two different values at the same time, but it's value can change over time if the value of 'a' changes. In Algebra, 'b' is what's called a ""variable"" because it's value can 'vary' or change. In fact, in this equation, both 'a' and 'b' are variables because their values will change depending on the value of each other. Actually, it's really common in Algebra to refer to any letter as a variable, "
,,"since letters can stand for different values in different problems. But at Math Antics, we'll usually just use the word ""variable"" when we're talking about values that can change or vary in the same problem. Alright, so far we've learned that Algebra is a lot like arithmetic, but that in includes unknown values and variables that we can solve for in equations. There's one other really important thing that I want to teach you that will help you understand what's going on in a lot of Algebra "
,,"problems, and it has to do with multiplication. Here are the four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Although in Algebra, you'll usually see division written in fraction form, like this. In Arithmetic, all four operations have the same status, but in Algebra, multiplication get's some special treatment. In Algebra, multiplication is the 'default' operation. That means, if no other arithmetic operation is shown between two symbols, then you can just assume they're being multiplied. The multiplication is 'implied'. For example, instead of writing 'a' times 'b', you can leave out the times symbol and just write 'ab'. Since no operation is shown between these two symbols, you know that you're supposed to multiply 'a' and 'b'. Of course, you can't actually multiply 'a' and "
,,"'b' until you figure out what numbers they stand for. The advantage of this rule about multiplication is that it makes many algebraic equations less cluttered and easier to write down. For example, instead of this: a * b + c * d = 10 You could just write: ab + cd = 10. You can also use this shorthand when you are multiplying a variable and a known number... like 2x, which means the same thing as 2 times 'x' or 3y which means the same thing as 3 times 'y' Since the symbol and the number are "
,,"right next to each other, the multiplication is implied. You don't have to write it down. Finally some good news! Now I never have to write down that pesky multiplication symbol again! Oh yeah!! Ah, not so fast... there are some cases in Algebra where still need to use a multiplication symbol. For example, what if you want to show 2 x 5? If you just get rid of the times symbol and put the '2' right next to the '5', it's going to look like the two-digit number twenty-five, which is NOT the same as 2 x 5. So, whenever you need to show multiplication between two known numbers, you still have to use the times symbol, unless... you use parentheses instead. "
,,"But aren't parentheses used to show grouping in math? How can you use that to show multiplication? Ah, that's a good question. Parentheses are used to group things, "
,,"but whenever you put two groups right next to each other, with no operation between them, guess what operation is implied. Yep!  Multiplication! For example, if you "
,,"see the this, it means that the group (a+b) is being multiplied by the group (x+y). We could put a times symbol between the groups, but we don't have to because it's the default operation in Algebra. The multiplication is just implied. So, going back to our problem: 2 x 5 If you wanted to, you could put each of the numbers inside parentheses like this, and then you could get rid of the multiplication sign. Now this can't be confused with the number twenty-five, and since the groups are right next to each other, you know that you need to multiply them. Of course, it might seem strange to have just one thing inside 'group' symbols like this, but it's okay to do that in math. An alternate way that you could do the same thing would be to put just one of the numbers in parentheses, like this. Again, you won't confuse this with a two-digit number and you know that multiplication is implied. Okay, so we've learned that Algebra is a lot like arithmetic, but it involves unknown values or variables that we need to solve for. And we learned that in Algebra, the multiplication sign is usually not shown, because it's the default operation. You can just assume that two things right next to each other are being multiplied. But why do we even care about Algebra? Is it good for anything in the 'real world'? or is it just a bunch of tricky problems that keep students busy in school? Actually, Algebra is very useful for describing or ""modeling""  things in the real world. It's a little hard to see that when you are just looking at all these numbers and symbols on the page of a math book. But, it's a lot easier to see when you start taking algebraic equations and graphing their solutions. Graphing an equation is like using its different solutions to draw simple lines and curves that can be used to describe and predict things in real life. For example, there's a whole class of equations in Algebra called ""linear"" equations because they form straight lines when you graph them. Those sorts of equations could help you describe the slope of a roof or tell you how long it will take to get somewhere. Another class of algebraic equations, called ""quadratic"" equations can be used to design telescope lenses, or describe how a ball flies through the air, or predict the growth of a population. So Algebra is used all the time in fields like science, engineering, economics and computer programming. And even though you might not need Algebra to get by in your day to "
,,"day life,... ...so divide both sides by 3. That means x = 42. So... in three... two... one... YES!! Alright... now to see how much butter I need. It's still a very useful part of math. Thanks for watching Math Antics,"

Directed Numbers,bXkewQ7WEdI,"Hi …Rob here with Math Antics. …just wanted to say “hi” to all the people who watch our videos, and say thank you so much for watching and liking and subscribing. I "
,,"know we usually don’t do milestone videos, but this seemed like a pretty cool milestone that we just had to mention it. We have one times ten to the six YouTube subscribers! That’s crazy!  That’s awesome! Thank you SO much! Oh wait… You don’t know what numbers like one times ten to the six even mean? Well you’re in luck! We have a video that explains it. In fact, it’s this video that you’re watching right now! Hi I’m Rob.  Welcome to Math Antics. Have you ever heard people use numbers like "
,,"that?… 1 times 10 to the 6th or maybe 3.4 times 10 to the negative 8th? Well… those are examples of a way of writing numbers called Scientific Notation. Huh… that didn’t sound quite right, let me try that again. …Scientific Notation… Ah yes… that’s better. Numbers can be really big or really small, right? Like, if you wanted to "
,,"count up all the cells that make up your body, it would be a really big number. …something like 35 trillion cells! But if you wanted to measure the diameter of one of those cells using meters, you’d get a really small number. …something like 0.0000005 meters. Not only are really big or small numbers a lot of work to write down because of all the zeros, they’re hard to quickly evaluate and compare. At a glance, it’s not easy to tell just how many number places there are in these really big or small numbers. And that’s where Scientific Notation can really help us out! Instead of using a long sequence of decimal digits to represent numbers, Scientific Notation uses a shorter number multiplied by a power of 10. And it’s always in that form:  some number “…times 10 to the…” some exponent. Here’s an example of a really "
,,"long number: One-hundred, twenty-five million. And here’s the equivalent number written in Scientific Notation: 1.25 times 10 to the 8th Wanna see how these two numbers are just different ways of writing the same thing? Let’s start by making a copy of our big number and messing with its decimal point a bit. Where’s the decimal point you ask? Remember that it’s always here, immediately to the right of the ones-place. We just don’t need to show it if there aren’t any decimal digits. Okay, so "
,,"what would happen if we shift the decimal point one place to the left? Well, doing that would change the number, right? By definition, the decimal point is always immediately to the right of the ones-place, so shifting the decimal point shifts the ones-place and all the other number places too. And if we line up the ones-place of our new number with the ones-place of the original number, you see that the new number is 10 times smaller. That means shifting the decimal point one place to the "
,,"left is equivalent to dividing a number by 10. But, do we want a number that’s 10 times smaller than before? Well…no.  We don’t want to change the value of the number at all. We just want to write it in a different way. Since shifting the decimal resulted in a number that’s 10 times smaller than before, to compensate and keep the value the same, we need to multiply the new number by 10. Making the number smaller and then compensating for that might seem like a weird thing to do, but it will make more sense in a minute. Let’s do that process again. Let’s make a copy of the new number and shift the decimal point to the left again. Since that shifts all the number places, we can align the ones-places and see that the same thing happened. The new number is 10 times smaller than before. So to keep it the same value as "
,,"the original number, we need to compensate by making it 10 times bigger. We need to multiply by another 10. And if we repeat that process again… if we make another copy and shift the decimal point again, we’ll see that the number gets 10 times smaller, so we need to compensate by multiplying by another 10. Alright, time out!  We seem to have a little problem here. Each time we shift the decimal point to the left, our number gets smaller. But since we have to compensate with a factor of 10 each time, it’s making kind of a mess! This part is getting shorter, but this part is getting longer! No problem… Exponents can fix that! Do you remember that exponents are a way of writing repeated multiplication? If you don’t, then be sure to watch our videos about them before moving on. Instead of writing 10 times 10, we can write 10 to the 2nd power, and instead of writing 10 x 10 x 10, we can write 10 to the 3rd power. That’s much better!  Now we can continue on. We’ll shift the decimal point again and multiplying by 10 again. But this time, instead of writing another “times 10”, we can just increase the exponent by 1 since there would be a total of four 10s being multiplied together. Let’s keep going with this process of shifting the decimal point to the left and multiplying by 10 for each number place we shift. And we’ll stop when there’s only one digit remaining to the left of the decimal point. Wow!  That’s quite a pattern. Each time we shifted the decimal, the number got 10 times smaller. So, each time we had to multiply by another 10 to keep the value the same. And because we did that, each one of these lines represents the same value. So even though it looks a lot different, this last line has the exact same value as the first one. In fact, it’s just the original number written in Scientific Notation. But, why is it only this last line, and not any of the others? I mean… they all look pretty scientific to me! Ah… that’s a good question. For a number "
,,"to be in ‘proper’ Scientific Notation, it’s supposed to have only 1 digit to the left of the decimal. There can be more than one digit to the right of the decimal, depending on the accuracy of the number, but just 1 digit to the left. But why? I mean… that rule sounds kinda arbitrary. It’s not arbitrary at all! If there's more than one digit to the left of the decimal point, that would mean that we didn’t get out all of the factors of 10 that we could have. And factoring out ALL of the 10s "
,,helps us quickly determine a number’s “order of magnitude”. Order of magnitude!? What in the world is that? That sounds kinda scary! Order of magnitude is basically 
,,"just how many 10s you need to multiply to get a certain number. And when a number is in Scientific Notation, the order of magnitude is just the exponent, because that’s telling us how many 10s to multiply together. In this example, the Scientific Notation says that if we take this small decimal and multiply it by eight 10s, we’ll get our original number. So Scientific Notation is a way of taking a really big number and reducing it down to a value that’s less than 10, but keeping track of how many 10s we would need to multiply together to get the full number. You can think of it as basically just extracting its “order of magnitude” and storing it in exponent form. But why would we want to do that?  I mean… it seems kinda complicated. Well… yeah, but… did you see how much writing it saved us? When we wrote out 125,000,000 we had to write ELEVEN characters, including commas. But when we wrote the same number in Scientific Notation, we only had to write EIGHT characters. What? …not convinced that it’s worth the savings? Well how about this number?… That’s a LOT of zeros to write, isn’t it?! But in Scientific Notation, this number is just 8.4 times 10 to the 31st power. That’s much better! So Scientific Notation is very useful when it comes to writing down really large numbers… or really small ones. For "
,,"example, this number is really small:  0.00000095 It’s much less than 1, but it’s not zero. And here’s the same number written in Scientific Notation. Again, it consists of a number that has only one digit to the left of the decimal point which is being multiplied by 10 to a certain power. But do you notice anything different about the exponent? Yep… it’s negative!  So what does that mean? Well, the short answer is that positive exponents show repeated multiplication while negative exponents show repeated division. And since this is a negative exponent with 10 as the base, it means to repeatedly divide by 10. To see how that works, let’s copy our original number and do that decimal-point-shift-thing again. Only this time, we’re gonna shift the decimal point to the right. What happens if we shift it one place to the right? It makes the number 10 times bigger than it was before. There used to be 6 zeros between the decimal point and the '9', but now there’s only 5. Again, we don’t want to change the value, so what can we do to compensate for shifting the decimal point? In this case, since shifting one place to the right made the number 10 "
,,"times bigger, we need to compensate by dividing the number by 10. And because of the way multiplication and division are related, dividing by 10 is the same as multiplying by 1 over 10 (or one-tenth) so we can just multiply by one-tenth. OR… we can multiply by 10 to the negative 1, because 10 to the negative1 is just another way of writing one-tenth. That may seem odd if you haven’t learned about negative exponents before, and we explain it in more detail in our video about the Laws of Exponents. For now, all you really need to know is that multiplying by 10 to the negative 1 is the same as dividing by 10, so it compensated for shifting the decimal point one place to the right. Continuing on, if we shift the decimal point another place to the right, the same thing happens… we make the number 10 times bigger. So to keep the value the same, we have to multiply by another factor of 10 to the negative 1. And it you’re wondering whether we can combine these exponents, you’re on the right track! 10 to the negative 1 times 10 to the negative 1 combine to become 10 to the negative 2, which makes sense because we shifted the decimal point a total of two places to the right. And if we shift the decimal point 3 places to the right, we need to multiply by 10 to the negative 3 to compensate. And if we shift 4 places, then we need 10 to the negative 4 to compensate.  …get the idea? And if we continue doing that until the decimal point is positioned so that there’s only 1 digit to the left of it, that gives us the number in Scientific Notation:  9.5 times 10 to the -7 And can you figure out what the order of magnitude of this number is? "
,,"Yep… just like before, the exponent tells us. It’s negative 7. Being able to quickly identify a number’s order of magnitude is pretty handy. For example, if the order of magnitude is a big positive exponent, then you know right away that you’re dealing with a really big number. But if it’s a big NEGATIVE exponent, then you know "
,,"you’re dealing with a really small number. And if you’re comparing two really big number like these two, or two really small numbers like these two, it’s hard to tell at a glance which is actually bigger or smaller. But if you see them in Scientific Notation, it’s easy to see that this number’s order of magnitude is bigger than "
,,"the other’s, which means that it’s bigger, and this number’s order of magnitude is less that the other’s which means that it’s smaller. So now that you’ve seen how Scientific Notation works, and you realize that it’s just a short-hand way of writing really big or really small numbers, let’s break down the procedure for converting back and forth between numbers written in regular form and Scientific Notation. Starting with these two examples in regular form… First, count how many number places you would need to shift the decimal point for there to be only 1 digit to the left of it. For this number we’d need to shift 8 places, and for this number; 6 places. The number of places you need to shift will be the exponent in the Scientific Notation form, but the sign of that exponent is determined by the direction you shifted. If you shifted to the left (because you started with a big number) then the exponent will be positive. But if you shifted to the right (because you started with a small number) then the exponent will be negative. So that gives you the “times 10 to the something” part of the Scientific Notation and to get the number that’s "
,,"multiplied by that power of 10, you just take the shifted decimal number and remove any zeros that don’t really need to be shown. There… that wasn’t too hard, was it? But what if we start out with numbers in Scientific Notation and want to convert them into regular form? Let’s do that with these two examples. The first step is to look at the exponent which is the order of magnitude of the number. It tells you how many 10s you'll need to multiply or divide by to get the number in regular form. If the exponent is positive, it means that you’ll need to multiply by that many 10s. In this example, that means that we would need to multiply by a total of seven 10s to get the number in regular form. That would be a lot of work, but we can also just shift the decimal point that number of places. Which direction do we need "
,,"to shift it? Well… since we’re multiplying by factors of 10, we need to shift it in the direction that will make the number bigger. That is, we need to shift it to the right. So, we’ll just shift the decimal point 7 places to the right. But as you can see, there’s aren’t 7 digits after the decimal, so any places that don’t have "
,,"a digit will just be filled with a zero. There… Our number is regular form is 41,650,000 In this second example, the exponent is negative, which means that we’ll need to divide by that number of 10s to get the number in regular form. Again, we could just do that division, or we can shift the decimal point to save time. Since dividing by factors of 10 make a number smaller, we’ll need to shift the decimal point in the direction that results in a smaller number… that is, to the left. Since our exponent is negative 5, we’ll shift the decimal point 5 places to the left. And any places that we shift past that don’t already have a digit in them will get filled with a zero. We’ll also put a zero in the ones-place since that’s always good form for decimal numbers. There… Our number in regular form is 0.0000109 Alright… that’s the basics of Scientific Notation. It’s may seem a little confusing at first, but as you get more experience with it, it makes a lot of sense. And when it comes to writing really big or really small numbers, it’s totally worth it. And even if you understand how Scientific Notation works, it may take some practice to get good at converting back and forth between it and regular form, so be sure to practice on your own.

Directed Numbers,uSXcjhhBSAM,hey guys in a previous lesson we learned about the number line extended after the zero and we've introduced what we have or what we call as negative numbers now we're going to use the number line to learn how to add and subtract directed or negative numbers now at the start you're going to use the number line but after you get the hang of it you're going to become so quick and so good that you're not going to use the number line at all but it's always good always tell my students for the first couple of times that you are using and you are working with these questions even if it takes you one whole exercise or 15 or 20 or even 30 to 40 questions that you need to do using the number line there's nothing wrong with it use it and after you get the hang of it you won't need the number line again but for the start let's use the number line to get an understanding of how it actually works here we have questions and these questions involve negative or directed numbers we're going to go through one by one and you're going to see it's a very easy process using the number line and hopefully by the end of the lesson you can probably even do them without a number line as well okay let's start we have this question saying negative 4 plus 3 negative 4 plus 3 what we do we use the number line we start at negative 
,,4 so we can put our pen or au finger on negative 4 there it is and it says we have to add 3 now a quick rule to remember when we're adding we're moving towards the right we're moving towards the addition we're moving Awards towards the plus direction and if we - thing or we're taking away we're going towards the left remember that rule very important so negative 4 plus 3 we start at negative 4 and we add 3 we're going to the right because we're adding 1 2 3 our answer is negative 1 we started negative for add 3 1 2 3 as you can see I'm caning the moves one move two moves three moves so negative one is our answer then we have another example minus 2 or 
,,negative 2 plus 6 what we do first we start at negative 2 negative 2 we're adding 6 addition meaning we're going towards the right so we're adding 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 so our answer is positive 4 we don't need to write positive we just write 4 because we know 4 means positive 4 and notice when I was counting I started from negative 2 I said 1 2 I had to ensure that I add 0 I've seen students make a mistake where they just move and they go straight to the other side forgetting the 0 very important 
,,the 0 is the number we need to add it part of the process so negative 2 plus 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 our answer is 4 let's see if you can do this one where are we going to start at negative 9 so negative 9 with it says negative 9 plus 7 so we start at negative 9 add we're going towards the right and we're going to add 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 so our answer is negative 2 negative 9 moving 7 times we end at negative 2 minus 5 Plus 8 again we start at negative 5 or minus 5 negative 5 there we're adding 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 we are on the positive was a 3/3 that's our answer now we have something a little bit different we have negative 3 plus negative 2 negative 3 plus negative 
,,2 okay what do we do here we have a plus and a negative whenever we have a plus a negative next to each other side by side they don't like each other they don't like each other at all so what I do they're a big fight they'll fight and they're always the negative will always win the negative will always win so whenever you see a 
,,puss and Nega negative next to each other like that side by side they don't like each other they have a big fight and negative will always win so how do we do it now it becomes negative 3 minus 2 negative 3 minus 2 so we start at negative 3 and we - now we said positive or we addition we go to the right - of course we're going to go to the left - 3 minus 2 or negative 3 - 2 - 3 - 2 1 - our answer is negative 5 the number is getting smaller once again negative 4 plus in brackets negative 3 now the brackets don't get confused it is exactly the same as the top so then get confused because the brackets are there it's just telling us that there is a plus and a minus just to distinguish them sometimes you'll see the brackets sometimes you don't however disregard them - 4 + - 3 + - we said they don't like one another they have a fight so and always - we'll win so - 4 - 3 we start at minus 4 and we go back 3 1 2 3 1 - 4 1 2 3 so our answer negative 4 minus 3 is negative seven another one five plus negative six in brackets we said we disregard the bracket here we notice for a plus and a minus we know what do they do they have a fight and the minus wins so five take away six we start at five notice it's a positive five so we start at five in the positive side minus six one two three four five six at negative 
,,one so we go to the left because we're taking away and our answer is negative one five take away six is negative 1 then we have 7 plus negative seven again a plus and a minus next to each other they don't like one another they have a fight - will always win 7 take away 7 I mean it's too easy but we'll still use the number line we start at 7 minus 7 so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 obviously our answer is going to go and become nothing zero 7 take away 7 is zero so this is the basics of how to use a number 
,,line to add or subtract directed numbers we're going to do a couple more examples that way you get the hang of it and by now you should already have a very good understanding of how to solve these number sentences using the number line and hopefully you probably even now see the pattern where you don't even need the number line 
,,at all now that we know how to use a number line we can actually solve a little bit more harder questions let's see how they're done in this example we have negative 3 minus and in brackets negative 3 plus 5 we know that we have to use brackets of division multiplication addition and subtraction we still have to follow that order in all our number sentences now here we noticed we have brackets so we have to complete what's in the brackets first before we go outside in the brackets we have negative 3 plus five so using the rules negative three plus five where do we start we start at negative three we add five we're going to the right one two three four 
,,five our answer is two now negative three minus two we start at negative three and we - two one two so answer in full negative five minus three minus two is negative five we start from the brackets and we move on here we have nine plus in brackets negative two minus six closed bracket so we follow the order of operations which shows that we have to do the brackets first to do that negative six my or minus two minus six we start at negative 2 and we minus 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 so negative 8 then 9 plus negative 8 9 plus negative 8 we notice a plus and a minus next to each other and we know they don't like one another they have a fight - will always win so it's 
,,9 take away 8 9 take away 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and of course the insert is 198 now answer here is one one last example negative six plus in brackets 2 times 5 again order of operations States we have to complete the brackets first so 2 times 5 is 10 negative six plus 10 so we start at negative six we add 10 so we get to the right one two three four five six seven eight nine ten our answer is positive four or just four so here we've done three examples where we do need to use the order of operations but exactly if we follow the steps we follow the process we won't go wrong the more practice you do with the number line you get the hang of it and hopefully later on you won't even need the number line at all

Directed Numbers,6U1kCOuNpR4,"Negative numbers are any number less than zero. Imagining something less than zero can be difficult. Suppose you have a bowl of oranges and someone takes them away until you have zero left. When there's nothing it's hard to imagine being able to take away more; however, there are instances in real life where we use numbers less "
,,"than zero. For example, did you know the average temperatures at the top of Mount Everest range from negative 19 degrees Celsius to negative 36 degrees Celsius? Wow, that's cold. Negative numbers also appear in finances to show debt. Suppose you have $50 in your bank account, but then you accidentally spend $60. Your account balance is now negative $10. This means you owe the bank $10. To understand this more, let's look at a number line. For every positive number, there is a negative number. Negative numbers can also be thought of as the opposite of a positive number, so the opposite of 5 is negative 5. You might also notice that as we go further down the number line the negative numbers appear to get larger. However, the numbers are really getting smaller. For example, negative 10 is smaller than negative 5. This can be confusing, but think about it in terms of temperature. Suppose on a winter's day it's negative 25 degrees Celsius in Barrow, Alaska, and negative 35 degrees Celsius in Stanley, Idaho. Stanley would be colder than Barrow because negative 35 is lower than negative 25. Now you know the basics of negative numbers."

Directed Numbers,jVvvUiExjes,in this video we're going to focus on adding and subtracting integers but in the first half we're just going to focus on adding integers let's start with something simple what is 3 plus 5 intuitively you know what the answer is but let's say if you didn't know what to do here's what you can do you can use a number line to help you add and subtract numbers so let's say this is 0 and we're going to start with 3 so start with the first number anytime you need to add travel on the right using the number line if you need to subtract then move towards the left so we wish to add 5 to 3 so we have to travel 5 spaces to the right 1 2 3 4 5 this is 4 5 6 7 8 that's where we ended up so three plus five is eight let's work on another example 4 plus 3 so if we start with 4 and if we travel three spaces to the right this is going to be 5 6 7 so therefore 4 plus 3 is equal to 7 and so using a number line is very helpful you will never need to add or subtract two integers is another example 
,,what is 8 plus negative 5 by the way 8 plus negative 5 is equivalent to 8 minus 5 if you wish to add a negative number start with the first number 8 add in a negative number you need to travel towards the left so 1 2 3 4 5 this is 7 6 5 4 3 so 8 plus negative 5 is positive 3 that's the same as 8 minus 5 which will give you the same answer now what about this one what is 7 plus negative 2 so for you to pause the video and try that so if we start with 7 all we need to do is travel two spaces 
,,to the left so this is 6 and this is 5 7 plus negative 2 is the same as 7 minus 2 which is 5 a positive times a negative will give you a negative sign if you multiply two positive signs this will give you a positive number if you multiply two negative numbers you will get a positive number but if you multiply a positive and the 
,,negatives together it will give you a negative number let's work on some more examples what is negative 6 plus 4 and what is negative 7 plus 8 so take a minute and pause the video and work on those examples so I'm going to use the number line technique once more so let's say negative 6 is on the last one looks at add 4 to it so 
,,we got to travel 4 spaces to the right 1 2 3 4 so this is negative 5 negative 4 negative 3 and negative 2 so therefore negative 6 plus 4 is negative 2 by the way you can reverse the numbers if you want negative 6 plus 4 is the same as positive 4 minus 6 but you have to put the positive in front now 4 minus 6 intuitively you can 
,,see that this is going to be negative 2 now what about negative 7 plus 8 that's equal to 8 minus 7 which is going to be positive 1 but let's use the number lines to 
,,confirm it so let's start with negative 7 and let's travel 8 units to the right since we're adding 8 to negative 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 this is negative 6 negative 5 negative 4 negative 3 two negative one zero positive one so negative seven plus eight is positive one go ahead and try these negative 7 plus negative five and negative three plus negative four so what is a negative seven plus negative five when you add in two negative numbers you're going to get a negative number as well 7 plus 5 is 12 negative 7 plus negative 5 that's going to be negative 12 but let's confirm it using a number line so we're going to start with negative 7 and we're going to add negative 5 to it so if you're adding a negative number you need to move towards the left if you're adding a positive number you need to travel towards the right so 
,,let's travel 5 units to the left this is negative 6 negative 5 negative 4 actually and take that back to the left the negative numbers should be getting bigger this 
,,is negative 8 negative 9 negative 10 negative 11 negative 12 so that's our answer now if 3 plus 4 is positive 7 negative 3 plus negative 4 is equal to negative 7 so 
,,now let's start with negative 3 and let's add negative 4 to it so let's travel 4 units to the left so this is negative 4 and negative 5 negative 6 negative 7 sometimes you may need to add three numbers as opposed to two numbers so what is five plus a negative three plus six five plus negative three that's equal to positive two if you have a number line and if you start with five you need to travel three units to left so going this way that's going to take you to positive two next we need to add two and six so we have to travel six units to the right started from two so this will take us to eight 2 plus 6 is 8 if you can it this is starting from 2 this 
,,is 1 2 3 4 5 6 so 2 plus 6 is 8 and that's the final answer here's another similar example what's negative 7 plus 4 plus negative 5 negative 7 plus 4 that's going to be negative 3 and negative 3 plus negative 5 whenever you're adding two negative numbers you're going to get a negative result so think of 3 plus 5 which is 8 but just add a negative sign to it so it's negative 8 now let's use the number line to confirm everything so we're going to start with negative 7 and we're going to add 4 to it 1 2 3 4 so this is negative 6 negative 5 negative 4 negative 3 so we're currently at negative 3 at this point and then we're going to add negative 5 to it so 
,,we got to go back 5 units that way so 1 2 3 4 5 so the final answer is negative 8 now let's focus on subtracting integers what is 8 minus 3 so if you're subtracting 
,,you need to travel towards the left let's start with the first number eight now we're going to travel three spaces to the left this is seven six five so eight minus 
,,three is positive five and it's just that simple so let's try 4 minus 9 so we're going to start with positive 4 we're going to travel in 9 spaces towards the left 1 
,,2 3 the 0 makes 4 5 6 7 8 9 so notice that we ended at negative 5 so 4 minus 9 is negative 5 now what is negative 3 minus 6 what is that equal to if you see a situation like this you can basically add 3 & 6 and then make it negative 3 plus 6 is 9 but this is going to be negative 9 but if this confuses you you can always just use the number line so we're going to start with negative 3 and we're going to subtract it by 6 so let's travel 6 units to left 1 2 3 4 5 6 so this is negative 4 negative 5 maybe 6 2 negative 7 negative 8 negative 9 so therefore negative 3 minus 6 is negative 9 try this one what is negative 7 minus 6 7 plus 6 is 13 so this is going to be negative 13 so let's start with negative 7 we're going to travel 6 units to the left and as you can see it's going to give us the same result now what is six 
,,minus negative four and also what's seven minus negative two whenever you have two negative signs next to each other you can make it equal to a positive sign six minus negative four is the same as 6 plus four which is 10 and 7 minus negative 2 is 7 plus 2 which is 9 now what would you do if you see a problem with three negative 
,,signs go ahead and try that now the first thing I will do is convert these two negative signs which are right next to each other into a positive sign so negative 4 minus negative 8 is equal to negative 4 plus 8 which is the same as 8 minus 4 which turns out to be 4 so using a number line I would focus on this portion now let's start with negative 4 let's add 8 to it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and as you can see we get the same final answer of positive 4 so negative 4 minus negative 8 is 4 so try a similar example what's negative 5 minus negative 6 so let's convert the two negative signs into a positive sign so this is negative 5 plus 6 which is the same as 6 minus 5 and that's positive 1 so using the number line let's add 6 to negative 5 so this is negative 4 negative 3 and this is going to go all the way to positive 1 so we're going to get the same answer so now you know how to add and subtract positive and negative integers by the way for those of you who want to find more similar videos in pre-algebra check out the description section of this video below and you can find my pre-algebra playlist

Directed Numbers,DBSviXhkubg,"With all of the rules and scenarios, remembering how to add and subtract negative numbers can be difficult. Here's a little trick to help you remember. Let's say we "
,,"want to solve 3 plus -7. First, imagine a number line with a bird sitting on our first number, 3. The operation plus or minus tells you which end of the number line "
,,"to look at. Since we're adding, our little bird will look right toward the positive end. Our second number tells us how far to move and which direction to move. We'll move forward if it's positive and backwards if it's negative. Since our second number is a -7, our little bird is going to move backwards seven spaces. Since he landed at -4, that's our answer: 3 plus -7 equals -4. Let's try another one. What about -2 minus -4? Our first number is -2, so that's where we'll start. Our operation is a minus, so our bird will look left towards the negative end. Our second number is a -4; therefore, our bird will move backwards 4 spaces. Our bird landed at +2, and that's our answer: -2 minus -4 equals 2. Let's recap. The first number is where you start. The operation tells you where to look: Plus, right, or minus, left. The second number tells you how far to move and in which direction: positive, forward, or negative, backwards. Where you land is your answer. That's it! You now know "
,,a trick for adding and subtracting negative numbers.

Directed Numbers,5Re3nbmqVaU,Hello and welcome to Number Sequencing. In this video you'll learn how to predict
,,"which number comes next in a series of numbers. Patterns are all around us. Patterns can be repeated items, shapes,"
,,"colors, images, or numbers. Sometimes a set of things are"
,,repeated to create a pattern. Number patterns are fun because you need to
,,"look carefully for clues to complete them. Here is a number pattern, or a"
,,sequence of numbers. What comes next? This is a fairly easy pattern because
,,"we count this one all the time. 1, 2, 3, 4, and... What comes next? Yes. 5. The number five completes this pattern. Here is another one. What comes next? Let's see. "
,,"We have 2, 4, 6. If you look for clues, we see that each number"
,,in this sequence is greater by 2. 2 + 2 is 4. 4 + 2 is 6. That is a clue. We should add 2 to 6 to give us the
,,"next number, which is... 8. Good work. Number patterns can also work in reverse. For example, in this pattern, what comes next? Your detective skills tell you that the"
,,"numbers are decreasing. That means that this pattern isn't adding on. It's subtracting. In fact, the pattern is decreasing by 1. 10 - 1 is 9. 9 - 1 is 8. 8 - 1 is 7. That means the next number should also be subtracted by 1 to give us the next"
,,number in this sequence. 7 - 1 is... 6. Yes. The next number in this sequence is 6. And there you have it. You now know how to complete a number

,,our friends but unfortunately we lost our internet connection and I'm sure you already know how it feels when that happens as it's difficult to imagine our lives without the internet nowadays wait a minute that's an excellent topic to explore hello friends have you ever wondered what the internet exactly is and how it works I'm 
,,sure you did so by the time the internet reconnects let's search the world of the Internet and learn how it works zoom in well when I was young I believed that the internet was some magic trick created by a secret group of magicians which makes it float through the clouds but when I came across its actual definition I understood that it is a network that connects millions of computers worldwide hmm but the important question still remains the same how does this magic happen imagine you and 
,,your friend want to share a feature or some other essential document with each other and to do so the first thing you both will need are computers that are connected in a network with the help of the Internet then once you establish this connection you visit the website using a browser login to your account type your message or

Directed Numbers,mlNHIzV4x8Y,hello kids we already know what integers are today let us learn addition and subtraction of integers using a number line let's begin addition of the integers using a number line let us look at a few examples example 1 add positive 5 plus positive 3 firstly start from 0 and move 5 places to the right we reach positive 5 now move 
,,three places to the right from positive 5 and reach positive 8 look we found the answer yes it is positive 8 hence positive 5 plus positive 3 is equal to positive 8 
,,example to find negative 5 plus negative 4 start from 0 and move 5 places to the left that is in the negative direction we reach negative 5 now on moving another 4 places to the left from negative 5 we reach negative 9 hence negative 5 plus negative 4 is equal to negative 9 example 3 find 3 plus negative 5 firstly start from 0 and move 3 places to the right we reached positive 3 now we move 5 places to the left that is in the negative direction from positive 3 and reach negative 2 therefore three plus negative five is equal to negative two lastly example four find negative five plus positive two start from zero and move five places to the left that is 
,,in the negative direction look we have reached negative five from negative five we move two places to the right and reach negative three thus we get the answer as negative five plus positive two is equal to negative three coming to subtraction of integers using a number line let us solve a few examples to understand in a better 
,,way example 1 find negative 3 minus 4 step 1 change the subtraction problem into an addition problem that is change the sign of subtrahend from positive to negative 
,,or negative to positive so here on changing we get the addition problem as negative 3 plus negative 4 step two follow the rules used for addition using the number line start from zero and move three places to the left that is in the negative direction look we have reached negative three from negative three we move four places again to the left and reach negative seven which is the answer example to find negative 5 minus negative 3 so here on changing the subtraction problem into addition problem we get the new question as negative five plus positive three now let us use the number line to solve this problem start from zero and move five places to the left that is in the negative direction from this point we move three places to the right and reach negative two thus we get the answer as negative two

Directed Numbers,_BgblvF90UE,"Hi, welcome to Math Antics. In our last video, we learned what negative numbers are, and we learned that they're part of a special set of numbers called ‘integers’. "
,,"Next, we need to learn how to do arithmetic with those integers. In this video, we’re gonna learn how to add and subtract integers. In the next video we’ll learn how to multiply and divide integers. Adding and subtracting whole numbers is pretty easy because there’s really only two possibilities: you’re either adding two positive numbers, or subtracting two positive numbers. But adding and subtracting integers is more complicated, because with negative numbers in the mix, there’s a lot more possibilities. Fortunately, you don’t need to memorize all these possibilities. Instead, we’re gonna learn some simple rules and strategies that will make the process a lot easier . Let’s start by learning two key rules that are really helpful to know when working with negative numbers. The first rule is this:  Adding a negative is the same as subtracting a positive. To visualize what that means, suppose I give you positive two cupcakes, You’d be pretty happy, right? But what if I ‘give’ you negative two cupcakes instead? That’s the same as taking two cupcakes away from you. Would you still be happy? When it comes to math, this rule means that if you "
,,"have a problem like this: 5 + -1 (where you’re adding a negative number), you can just change it to subtraction. Instead of 5 + -1, you can just write 5 ? 1. They’re different ways of writing the same thing. Okay, so rule #1 is:  Adding a negative is the same as subtracting a positive. Now what about rule number #2? Well the second rule is this:  Subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive. Let’s say you have negative two cupcakes.  Like if you have a debt… you OWE me two cupcakes. You wouldn’t be too happy having that negative, would you? But, what if I subtract that negative from you? Taking away the negative two made you more positive, right? Subtracting the negative gives you less debt! When it comes to math, this rule means that if you have a problem like 5 ? (-1), where you’re subtracting a negative number, you can just change it to addition. Instead of 5 ? (-1), you can just write 5 + 1, and that’s a problem you already know how to solve. Alright, now that "
,,"you know our two rules, I want to show you that there’s really only four different types of problems (or 4 cases) when adding or subtracting integers. In case 1, you start with a positive number and you make it more positive. In case 2, you start with a positive number and you make it more negative. In case 3, you start with a negative number and you make it more negative. And in case 4, you start with a negative number and you make it more positive. The key to getting the right answer to the problem is to figure out which of these cases you’re dealing with, so let’s look at each case in more detail. In case 1, you start with a positive number and you "
,,"make it more positive. The good news is that you already know how to do that!  That’s just what regular addition is. For example, when you have the problem 7 + 3, you’re starting with a positive 7 and you’re making it more positive by adding positive 3 to it, to get the answer of positive 10. But, what if instead of 7 + 3, you're given the problem 7 ? (-3)?  That seems a lot harder, right? Well, if you remember rule #2, it’s not harder at all. In fact, it’s exactly the same problem because "
,,"rule #2 says subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive. We can change the “minus minus 3” into “plus 3” and we get the same answer: positive 10. So case 1 is just addition like you’re used to doing, but now that we have negative numbers, there’s a new way that it could be written that you need to be on the lookout "
,,"for. Oh, and in this case (starting with a positive and making it more positive), you know your answer will always be positive because you stay on that side of the number line. In case 2, you start with a positive number, but you make it more negative. That is, you do something to it that makes its value smaller (or moves it to "
,,"the left on the number line). But that’s just like regular subtraction like you already know how to do. For example, here we have the problem 8 ? 5. We start with a "
,,positive 8 but we make it more negative by subtracting 5 from it. Subtracting 5 moves it to the left on the number line down to 3 as our answer. Our answer is still 
,,"a positive number, but it’s less positive than it was before. And that raises an interesting question: What if we subtract even more, to move it further in the negative direction? Like, what if we subtract 8 instead of 5?  That would take us all the way back down to zero on the number line. And before you knew about negative numbers, back when you thought the number line just stopped at zero, you probably thought that’s all we could take away.  But watch this… Let’s start with positive 8 but then subtract 10 from it!  Can we do that? Can we subtract a bigger number from a smaller one? Now we can!  It just means that the answer we get will be a negative number. Starting with positive 8 and subtracting 10 takes us past zero, and down to negative 2 on the number line. So our answer is negative 2. As you can see, case 2 is a little more complicated, because the answer can be positive, negative or even zero, depending on the numbers you’re subtracting. And it’s even more complicated than that because there’s also another way this type of problem can be written, thanks to rule #1. Rule #1 says that adding a negative is really the same as subtracting a positive. And that means our original subtraction problem (8 ? 5) could have been written like this instead (8 + -5). But either way it’s written, you’re starting with a positive and making it more negative. Now on to case 3…  In case 3 you start with a negative number and you make it more negative. That’s really just the opposite of case 1 where we started on the positive side of the number line and made it more positive. For example, let’s say that you’re given the problem: -7 + "
,,"-3. That means that you start with negative 7 and then you make it even more negative by adding negative 3 which gives you negative 10 as the answer. And as you might have guessed by now, thanks to our rules, there’s another way we could write this type of problem. Because of rule #1, we know that adding a negative 3 is the same as subtracting 3. So this problem could also be written like this: -7 ? 3. But either way it’s written, in this case you’re starting with a negative number and making it even more negative. And because of that, you know that your answer will always be negative for case 3 since you stay on the negative side of the number line. And finally, in case 4, you also start with a negative number, but this time you’re gonna make it more positive. Here’s an example of a problem like that: -8 + 5. This problem starts with negative 8 but then we add positive 5 which makes it more positive, or moves us to the right on the number line, up to -3 which is our answer. "
,,"Our answer is still negative, but it’s less negative than what we started with. Ah, but this looks similar to case 2, right? Imagine what would happen if you made it even more positive. You could add 8 (instead of 5) and that would move you all the way up to zero. And if you added even more, like -8 + 10, that would take you to "
,,"the positive side of the number line and give you the answer of positive 2. So just like in case 2, the answer here can be positive, negative or even zero depending "
,,"on the numbers you‘re adding. And, just like before, there’s another way this type of problem can be written. Remember rule #2? …that subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive. Because of that rule, -8 + 5 could also be written as -8 ? (-5). That’s a LOT of negatives, but thanks to rule #2, we can write our “minus "
,,"minus” as a “plus”. But either way it’s written, in this case, we start negative and move in the positive direction. Okay, now that we’ve learned our two rules and we’ve seen that there’s really just four types of problems (or 4 different cases) that you’ll need to solve, I want to give you a basic strategy that will help when you’re adding or subtracting integers. This strategy involves asking 3 simple questions: The first question is, “Am I starting with a positive or a negative number?” "
,,"This question is easy to answer because all you have to do is look at the sign in front of the first number of the problem. If there’s no sign, then you’re starting "
,,"with a positive number. But if there’s a minus sign, then you’re starting with a negative number. Once you know what you’re starting with, the next question to ask is, “Am I making it bigger or smaller?” In other words, is what you’re adding or subtracting going to make the value move in the positive direction of the number line or the negative direction? If you’re subtracting a positive or adding a negative (Rule #1) then you're making the value smaller, which is moving to the left on the "
,,"number line. If you’re adding a positive or subtracting a negative (Rule #2) then you're making the value bigger, which is moving to the right on the number line. And the last question that you need to ask is, “Will my answer be positive, negative, or zero?” The answer to this will depend on which case you have and what values you’re working with. If it’s a case 1 problem, you know the answer will always be positive, and if it’s a case 3 problem, then you know the answer will always be negative. But you’ll remember that in cases 2 and 4, the answer could change between positive, negative or zero depending on the difference between the two numbers that "
,,"you’re working with. So asking these three questions will help you visualize what’s happening in the problem that you’re trying to solve, and it’ll help you get the "
,,right answer. But the most important thing that you can do to get good at integer arithmetic is to practice. It’s important that you try a lot of problems that you have an answer key for so that you know if you’re doing it right. And don’t get discouraged if it’s confusing at first.  You’ll get it if you practice! And you might

Directed Numbers,sEU5uaf-Tu4,hello John Zimmerman from Taba class comm and what I want to do here in this video is just quickly go over the rules for positive and negative numbers many of you out there may know and maybe you've experienced yourself your solutions your math solutions you know becoming incorrect because you messed up on one of these integer rules one of these rules that involve positive and negative numbers it's just so easy too easy to confuse some of these rules but you absolutely have to learn these to really master you know middle school and high school mathematics let's just go through very quickly and we'll start with the easy stuff first I want to take a look at the multiplication rules okay so here anytime you're multiplying two numbers where the signs the signs are the same in other words a positive times a positive or negative times a negative okay the answer is always positive okay so two times positive two times positive eight positive 16 okay so once again negative two times negative eight the signs are the same I both negative positive answer positive 16 now in multiplication when you're multiplying two numbers and where one of the signs are opposite ie ones pause and ones negative here I have a positive times a negative doesn't make a difference it could be a negative times a positive the product the answer is going to be negative okay so that's multiplication right there and these are the multiplication rules now division is the same thing okay so multiplication and division pretty straightforward so 16 divided by 4 of course will be a positive 4 negative 16 divided by a negative 4 would be okay once again signs are the 
,,same so the answers gonna be positive that's a positive 4 and now here I have a negative 16 divided by a positive 4 right opposite signs so the answer ok is going to be negative negative 4 alright so this is the easy stuff now let's get to the more challenging or what seems to give students I think a little bit more problems understanding Nishal e is addition now I'm going to kind of change colors here I'm going to tell you if you know how to add positive negative numbers then you'll be able to subtract and you'll see what I'm talking about here in a second all right so eight plus two K two positives the signs are the same okay so you keep the sign obviously it's gonna be a positive ten right all of us probably knew that now let's take a look at this okay we have a negative eight plus a negative two the signs are 
,,the same so you're going to add these values right here and you're going to keep the same sign so this is going to be negative ten all right so right here when you're adding numbers with the same sign you could tell we're just adding adding the numbers and keeping the sign so no problem there here's where it gets a little interesting to think for students right here we have we're adding two numbers with different signs so we have a negative eight plus a two all right so let me ask you which number here don't look at the sign just look at the positive version of the number which one is larger okay the eight or the - all right well clearly this one would be large we call that the absolute value but I don't want I don't want to throw out too many technical terms here okay so between the eight and a two we said that eight is a larger number okay we think of it as a larger number that's positive version and you can tell they here that a has the negative sign so here's what you do 
,,anytime you have two different signs okay you're going to end up subtracting alright so let's actually do that now okay eight and two if I took the difference I'm going to get six right I just kind of forget about that negative sign for a second but now the sign that is associated with the answer is going to have or you're going to be associated with that largest number ie the eight okay so this is you be a negative six all right so it makes sense let's let's try another one here so we have eight plus and negative two okay the signs are different so when the signs are different you're going to end up subtracting okay so subtract just the whole version 
,,or the positive versions of these numbers okay eight and two so if I just told you to subtract them or find the difference you would say okay that's six now out of the eight and two which one has a larger sign or which one is the larger number the eight is a larger number and this eight right here is a positive eight so my answer is going to be a positive six okay all right so once again I'm just kind of quickly trying to refresh some of these rules and of course you know in a few minutes I would expect you to master all this stuff but hopefully this is making sense to most you out there all right so let's talk about subtraction okay here's a deal with subtraction I said if you know how to add you could subtract positive negative numbers so what we're going to do with subtraction problems is turn them into addition problems by doing something called plus negative so here I have 7 minus 10 what I want you to do is to take that subtraction sign and you're going to turn it into 
,,an addition sign and they're going to put that little negative sign and attack it on to the number to the right of that of that addition symbol okay so you see what 
,,I did there I said seven instead of 7 minus 10 I'm going 7 plus negative 10 and then now of course I'm going to go ahead and do this addition problem the signs are different so I'm going to subtract the numbers okay and then here 10 is the larger number and it has a negative sign so I'm going to go ahead and make that a negative 3 for my answer okay and by the way too what I'm trying to do is just give you kind of a procedural some rules here I'm trying to teach you all the concepts involved in integers which are very important by the way just trying to get you some simple rules so you don't mess this up when you're actually doing calculations okay let's take a look at this last one in here we have 3 minus a minus 6 so I'm going to go ahead and turn this into a positive or excuse me an addition problem and then I'm going to tack on out negative sign to the number to the right but now I have a negative of a negative 6 or the opposite of a negative 6 okay so if I told you what's the opposite of negative 6 you would say oh that's positive six this really turns into this problem three plus a positive six or three plus six and that is nine okay so pretty much a real fast review listen if you need a lot more information on this and other topics come on over to tablet class comm we have a 30 day free trial tons of stuff we have full courses the whole idea with our products it's clear and understandable we we really design our lessons to be explained and that's the key word explained not taught down too but explain in a way that you understand so hopefully and come over and check us out at Taba class comm take one hour 30 day free trials and learn and master this stuff so your headaches and mathematics go away good luck to yourself

Directed Numbers,5NI0VX_KqFo,or so here what you're doing you can start off at the first number two okay so let's start right over here at two and when you subtract okay that means you're taking away right so when you subtract that means you're actually gonna be going backwards okay but when you work with negative numbers see the negative three here negative numbers actually tell you to do the opposite okay so if you're subtracting normally we would go backwards one two three because it's getting smaller but the negative number tells us to do the opposite so we're actually going to go instead of going backwards three we're going to go forwards three one two three and you can see we end up at five okay so we understand about negative numbers doing the opposite we understand how subtraction normally takes us backwards on the number line but I'm going to show you a shortcut and this will help you as you do more complicated problems what you can do is when you see a subtraction problem think of it as an addition problem so what we're going to do is subtraction is really like adding the opposite so if you change this from subtraction to addition you want to change this sign to the opposite if it's positive you make it negative if it's negative you make it positive now you can see we have a simple problem here it's just two plus three which we learned a long time ago that's just five right okay let's go to the next one negative three minus one okay one way to think about this is the number line 
,,you could start at negative three subtraction says we're gonna go to the left one place and we're at negative four right easy the other way to do it is we could say 
,,hmm subtraction is like adding the opposites if I change this I don't want to change the overall value of the problem I have to change this to the opposite so negative three plus negative one we can talk about the scale like we talked about in the previous video about comparing you know positive and negative numbers if we have a negative three plus negative one it's like stacking up three bricks on the left side plus another brick on the left side the scale is going to tilt to the left because it's heavier by 4 bricks okay there's nothing on the right to counterbalance it so we have negative four over here in this example negative four minus negative - so what I would do okay if you wanted to think of the number line we'd start off over here at negative four okay if we subtract we would go to the left right because subtracting is making the numbers smaller but we're working with a negative two negative numbers tell us to do the opposite so instead of going left - we're gonna 
,,go right - and that's gonna put us at negative two now it gets a little bit more complicated when you start having all these negatives in your problem so what I suggest and recommend after you have a feel for how positive and negative numbers work is just take this little shortcut and make subtraction like adding the opposite if you change this sign change this to the opposite and you've got it so we've got negative 4 plus 2 think about putting 4 bricks on this side 2 bricks on this side which way is it going to tilt well it's going to tilt to the heavier side right why because it's heavier by 2 okay 2 of these are gonna cancel out with two of these that would be balanced but it's actually heavier on that side by 2 and so you can see you're gonna have negative 2 it's tilting towards a negative side ok the last example here we're subtracting so that's like adding the opposite we have a negative 700 plus a negative 100 okay so you spend $700 + you spend another hundred dollars 
,,so far you've spent $800 so you've decreased whatever was in your account let's say by $800 so these are just some simple and easy and direct ways to work with positive and negative numbers when you're subtracting just think about changing it to adding the opposite and then you can use that scale analogy that I was showing you and you'll you'll have it so I'll see you in the next video

Directed Numbers,fw1kyM0F00Y,integers good day students welcome back to my classroom for today's lesson you will learn how to describe the set of integers and identify real life situations to make use of it and compare integers let us begin integers are whole numbers which consists of zero positive and negative numbers let's take a look at this number line 
,,this number line is divided into right and left part by the number zero zero is an integer that is neither negative nor positive the numbers on the right side of 0 are the positive integers these positive integers are can be written with or without the positive sign while the numbers to the left of zero are the negative integers which must be written with the negative sign remember that integers are whole numbers fractions and decimals are not considered as integers some real-world situations can be modeled by integers let's take a look at this example the sea level represents zero while below the sea level represents negative numbers and above sea level represents by the positive numbers if we say 40 feet above sea level that means it is equivalent to positive 40 feet well if we say 40 feet below sea level it means it is equivalent to negative 40. now let's try another situational phrases which can also be represented by integers we have here 15 feet above the ground our clue word here is the word above which represents positive number this means that it can be represented by positive 15. another one we have ten floors up our key word here is the word up it means that it is positive then next one we have five steps backwards our clue word here is the word buff it means that we are going to move five steps backward so that is negative five and lastly we have decrease of nine points it can be represented by negative nine wonderful now if we are asked this question what is two units to the right of three it means that we need to move two units or two times to the right of the number three let's try it there it means two units to the right of three is positive five this also represents addition where when we add two and three that gives us positive five another example what is five units to the left of zero this means that we need to move five times to the left from zero so let's try great job so that is negative five this also represents subtraction where zero minus five is negative five now let's learn how to compare integers in comparing integers we need to understand that the numbers to the right of zero gets bigger and bigger while the numbers to the left of zero get smaller and smaller therefore zero is greater than negative numbers but less than positive numbers let's try an example let's compare zero and negative five since negative five is a negative integer and it can be found to the left of number zero this means that zero 
,,is greater than negative five let's have another example let's compare zero and positive five since five here is positive and it can be found to the right of zero this means that zero is less than positive five awesome we also need to understand that all positive numbers are greater than negative numbers it means that negative numbers are less than positive numbers let's have an example let us compare positive three and negative five when we take a look at here it seems that negative five is greater than positive three but since all positive numbers are greater than negative numbers it means that positive three is greater than negative five let's have 
,,another one this time let us compare negative four and positive one again all negative numbers are less than positive numbers these means that negative four is less 
,,than positive one now let's have another one what about we compare positive 18 and negative 25 since all positive numbers are greater than negative numbers it means 
,,that positive 18 is greater than negative 25 awesome now let's go to another one now what if we are comparing negative numbers since negative numbers get smaller and smaller it means that the bigger the number the smaller it is sounds confusing right let's have an example let us compare negative three and negative five it seems 
,,that negative five is greater than negative three but here negative three is closer to number zero this means that negative three is greater than negative five let's have another example let us compare negative four and negative two since negative four is bigger than negative two it means that negative four is less than negative two great job how about this one great job negative 40 is less than negative 21. wonderful great job students you made it now here are things that you learned today you

Directed Numbers,3i2i9nmkG24,in our daily life we count various things for various purposes we count things using counting numbers the numbers 1 2 3 4 5 and so on are called counting numbers or 
,,natural numbers the numbers zero one two three four five and so on are called whole numbers zero has no value if placed before a natural number but it has a significant value and placed after a natural number although zero is the first whole number the first counting number is one but numbers like 1 upon to 1.8 and 2.2 are not whole numbers whole numbers on a number line on a number line numbers are represented as points and distances to represent whole numbers on a number line draw a straight horizontal ray label one end of the line as zero mark another point to the right of zero and label it as 1 the distance between 0 & 1 is the unit distance now mark points two three four and so on to the right side of 0.1 at unit distance this is how the number line will look like when we represent the whole numbers starting 
,,from the point zero negative numbers let us first understand what negative numbers are we know that zero means nothing but there are instances in real life when we use numbers that are less than zero for example in a few cold regions in the world the temperature goes below zero degrees Celsius that is negative 4 degrees Celsius 
,,or even below negative 40 degrees Celsius the numbers negative 4 and negative 40 are less than zero and are called negative numbers a negative number is any number that is less than zero for example negative eight is a number that is eight less than zero a negative number is represented with a negative sign any number without a 
,,negative sign is called a positive number which means a number that is greater than zero so while negative eight is negative eight seven is positive 7 or simply 7 integers the numbers one two three and so on the opposites negative one negative two negative three and so on and the number zero together form a different set of numbers let us understand the set of integers with the help of the following diagram in this combination each shape represents a particular number or set of numbers the 
,,circle represents zero this shape represents natural numbers the rectangle represents whole numbers the triangle represents negative numbers and this ship represents integers representation of integers on a number line integers can be represented on a number line that extends to the left to the right it is indicated by arrows and the positive integers are represented to the right of 0 and the negative integers are represented to the left of 0 positive 1 positive 2 positive 3 and so on are called positive integers the number value increases as they move away from zero negative one negative two negative three and so on are called negative integers the number value decreases as they move away from zero the integer zero is neutral it is neither positive nor negative positive integers do not need the positive sign before the number for example positive 2 can be written as just two negative integers need the negative sign before the number in the sign is not included that number is considered as positive two integers are opposites if they are each the same distance away from zero but on opposite sides of the number line one will have a positive sign the other a negative sign in the number line shown here positive three and negative three are opposite numbers now let us look at different situations where we mark our number either as positive or negative money earned or deposited is marked as positive whereas money owed or spent or withdrawn is marked as negative height above sea level is marked as positive whereas depth below sea level is marked as negative climbing up is marked as positive whereas coming down is marked as negative

Directed Numbers,OAoLCXpao6s,"Hi, welcome to Math Antics.  In this lesson, we’re gonna learn about negative numbers. Negative numbers can be a little confusing at first, so don’t get discouraged "
,,"if it takes you a while to get it. To learn what negative numbers are, we first need to start with ‘whole numbers’. You remember what whole numbers are, right? They’re the set of numbers on the number line, starting with zero, and then counting up one at a time: 1, 2, 3, 4… all the way to infinity. That’s a LOT of numbers, but it’s only half the story! And that’s because the number line really goes in BOTH directions. You’re used to seeing the number line starting at zero and just going to "
,,"the right, but the number line also goes to the left. And what numbers are on that part of the number line? Yep… you guessed it… negative numbers. The negative numbers are just like a mirror image of the numbers on the right side of the number line that we call the positive numbers. And zero is the special number that separates "
,,"the positive numbers from the negative numbers. By the way, when you combine all these numbers (1 ,2, 3, and so on up to infinity, and -1, -2, -3, and so on down to "
,,"negative infinity, and the number zero) that entire set of numbers gets a special name in math.  They’re called ‘the Integers’. As you can see, the negative numbers "
,,"look just like the positive numbers. The only difference is that they have a ‘negative sign’ in front of them. The negative sign looks just like the minus sign. In fact, if we wanted to, we could write a positive sign (a plus) in front of all the positive numbers. But to save time, we just assume that if a number doesn’t have any sign in front of it, then it’s positive. Positive is the ‘default’ sign. Okay, now that you know what negative numbers are, we need to learn how to compare them to other integers. Remember that in math, comparing just means saying which of two numbers is bigger or smaller than the other, or saying that they’re equal. And to do that, we use the greater than, less than, or equal signs. You’re probably already pretty good at comparing positive integers. Like if I ask, “Which is bigger: 2 or "
,,"3 ?”  You know that 3 is bigger than 2. But what if I asked you to compare two negative integers?  “Which is bigger: -2 or -3 ?” Ah, this is where negative numbers can be a little tricky, especially if this is your first time learning about them. That’s because you’re SO used to 3 being bigger than 2 that when you see -2 and -3, it’s really tempting to think that -3 must be bigger than -2, but it’s NOT! Negative 3 is actually smaller (or less) than negative 2. And to help you understand why, let’s look at our number line again. Have you noticed that if you start at zero on the number line and then you move to the right, the numbers keep getting bigger "
,,"and bigger as you go along. 1 is greater than 0, 2 is greater than 1, and 3 is greater than 2, and so on… But what if we go in the opposite direction instead; to the left? As we go to the left, the numbers get smaller and smaller. 2 is less than 3, 1 is less than 2, and 0 is less than 1. Well, those same exact rules apply to negative side of the number line also. The numbers get bigger as you go to the right and they get smaller as you go to the left. So, since -3 is on the left side of -2, it’s actually smaller than -2. I like to think of it like this… On the positive side of the number line, 3 is more positive than 2 (so it’s bigger). But on the negative side of the number line, -3 is more negative than -2 (so it’s smaller). And you can use that idea no matter what the numbers are. On the positive side, 500 is more positive than 200 (so it’s bigger) but on the negative side, -500 is more negative than -200 (so it’s smaller) Keep that in mind if anyone every offers to give you negative 500 dollars. The ‘500’ part sounds pretty good, but the negative part… not so much! Alright, so the positive integers are on the right side of zero on the number line, which means they’re all greater than zero. And the negative integers are all on the left side of zero on the number line, which means they’re all less than zero. Wait… Hold on a second… “Less than zero!?” How… How can ANY number be less than zero? I mean… Doesn’t zero mean ‘nothing’? Ah, that’s a good question. At first, it can be hard to see how there could be numbers that are less than zero, but here’s an example that will help you understand. Let’s say we want to use integers to measure how many meter above sea level small islands are. This island is 10 meters above sea level. This island is only 5 meters above sea level. And this island here happens to be exactly the same height as sea level. So we can use the integer zero to show how it’s height compares to sea level. But what about this island? It’s not even above sea level at all. It’s 5 meters below the surface. But our measurement is supposed to tell us how many meters ABOVE sea level it is. Fortunately, with negative numbers, that’s no problem. We can just say that its height (compared to sea level) is negative 5 meters. Or, what about an example with money?… Suppose there’s three brothers who each have a different amount of money. The first brother has $20, the next brother has $0, and the last brother actually OWES his dad $20. What number do we use to represent how much money he has? Yep… negative 20 dollars! And temperature is another great example. We use zero degrees Celsius to describe the temperature for water to freeze, but it can be warmer or colder than that. The temperature could be negative; like negative 20 degrees! So negative numbers are very useful in the real world to help describe things that can be above OR below zero. Okay, now that you know how negative numbers work, let’s see how we can "
,,"compare any two integers. If we don’t include zero for a moment, basically there’s just three situations. You’ll either need to compare two positive integers, or two negative integers, or one positive and one negative integer. And you already know how to compare two positive integers. The further right on the number line you go, the bigger the numbers get. 7 is greater than 4, 50 is greater than 20, and 1,000 is greater than 100. It’s also really easy to compare a positive integer and a negative integer, because a positive number is ALWAYS bigger than a negative number. ALL of the positive numbers are on the right side of the number line and ALL the negative numbers on the left. So -5 is less than 5 and -40 is less than 3 and -100 is less than 1 The only tricky situation is when you have to compare two negative integers. Then you have to think about which one is further to the left on the number line. Again, a great way to do that is to identify the number that would normal be more positive on the positive side of the number line and realize that it’s more negative on the negative side. -8 is more negative than -4, so it’s smaller. -15 is more negative than -10, so it’s smaller. and -100 is more negative than -25, so it’s smaller. Alright, so in this video we learned what negative numbers are and how they can be used to describe things in the real world. They’re just like positive numbers, but on the other side of zero on the number line. And we leaned that the whole numbers, along with their negative counterparts, form the set of numbers we call integers. We also learned how to compare integers. As you go to the right on "
,,"the number line, the integers get bigger, and as you go left, they get smaller. Comparing integers can be confusing at first, so be sure to practice until you’ve really got it. As always, thanks for watching Math Antics and I’ll see ya next time. Learn more at www.mathantics.com"

Directed Numbers,41eVMYPCWTQ,today let us learn prime and composite numbers before we begin let us understand what do we mean by natural numbers the set of numbers 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and so on are 
,,called natural numbers natural numbers can be divided into prime numbers and composite numbers before we proceed ahead remember that any given number will always have one and itself as its factors now let us start with prime numbers look at the examples the factors of 3 are 1 and 3 the factors of 11 are 1 and 11 the factors of 17 are 1 and 17 all these numbers have only two factors one and the number itself such numbers are called prime numbers thus prime numbers are natural numbers that have only two factors one and the number itself composite numbers look at the examples the factors of 6 are 1 2 3 & 6 the factors of 14 are 1 2 7 and 14 the factors of 20 are 1 2 5 10 and 20 all the above numbers have more than two factors these numbers are called composite numbers thus composite numbers are natural numbers that have more than two factors remember these points one is neither prime nor composite as it has only one factor two is the smallest and the only even prime number three is the smallest odd prime number now why don't you list all the prime and composite numbers from 1 to 100

,,ten to one so should I start okay let me begin with 10 first one and zero number ten right the word comes before number ten number nine so right number nine and the 
,,phone number nine it's number eight and Boyd comes before eight who's going to tell me come on number seven that's right and before number seven number six okay and 
,,now who's going to tell me what comes before sakes number five you're absolutely right number five and what comes before number five number four okay and before for 
,,number three and what comes before three number two and what comes before two number one so these are called numbers in reverse order so friends we have learned numbers one to ten and now it's time to learn some more numbers so let's get started come on number 11 one and one 11 number 12 one and two number 12 now number 13 one and three becomes 13 right the rich number we come you guess yes number 14 one and four 14 now number 15 one and five 15 number 16 one and six is 16 number 17 one and seven 17 number 18 1 and 8 becomes 18 number 19 1 and 9 is 19 and now a new number number 20 that is 2 and 0 becomes 20 when I write well titled 14 pistol-whips and Ferelden open angle turtle now let's see number 11 to 20 yes you're right number 11 is 1 and 1 1 standing line one slipping line and slanting line makes number again one standing line one slipping line one slanting line makes number one so 1 and 1 is 11 now I'll show you how to write number 12 now you tell me which two numbers 
,,number 1 and number 2 so 1 & 2 makes number 12 now number 13 1 & 3 is 13 now number 41 and four makes number 14 and now you tell me which number comes after 14 15 right so which two numbers 1 & 5 okay so 1 & 5 is 15 and what comes after 15 1 & 6 correct 1 and 6 makes number 16 and now number 17 1 & 7 makes number 17 okay now your turn I will not say yes 1 an 818 so 1 & 8 is 18 now which number 19 1 and 9 makes 19 and the new number now is 20 so how do I 20 which two numbers 2 and 0 8 so 2 and 0 becomes 20 hey friends it's time to learn more numbers now that's 21 to 25 so let's begin with number 21 so that's 2 + 1 21 right 2 + 2 xx - 2 + 3 xx 3 2 & 4 24 2 & 5 25 21 22 23 24 25 okay friends now get set go now get ready now we are going to write numbers 21 to 25 let's start number 21 that's 2 & 1 so 2 + 1 21 now who's going to tell me 22 how to write yes 2 & 2 22 the word comes up at 22 tell me 23 direct that's 2 & 3 23 and what comes up at 23 24 okay - and for 24 another last one is 25 now it's your turn to tell me how do i 25 2 + 5 25 that's correct so 2 + 5 25 here friends up till now we have learned the numbers and I've even taught you 
,,how to write the numbers so now it's time to have some fun so let's begin with a numbers game I'm going to write a number on a board and you should tell me which number is that let's begin okay now number now tell me which number is this you have learned this number and you even know how to write it yes louder number five that's correct now another number which no much what I write e now which number is this number seven that's correct I'll write one more number which number is this okay tell me quick number nine that's correct now number okay fast number three very good now okay tell me number eight excellent here friends now let's begin with another 
,,game now I'm going to write a number on board and you should tell me which number comes before that number okay so let's begin for example number seven so which number comes before seven that number six okay so now it's your turn number eight now you tell me which number comes before it come on don't be late quick yes number seven another number now number five and which number comes before five okay yes very good number four I hope you are enjoying this game now last number okay number nine and which number comes before nine number eight correct okay friends now we play another game okay now I'm going to write a number on a board and you should tell me which number comes after that number I am writing number three and now tell me which number comes after three louder yes number four correct one more number number one and which number comes after one it's very simple don't take so much time number two right okay the last number number five and which number comes after five number say excellent here friends I know you're enjoying the games so let's play another one this is called fill in the blanks I'll show you this is number four this is the plank and number six so now you tell me which number comes in between yes number five let's try another one number one and number three so which number comes between number one and three number two right now another one number two this is the plank and number Oh so which number comes between number two and four okay think 
,,yes you're right number three another number number five plank number seven okay quick fine take your time count in your mind right number six now 100 number number 
,,eight supplying and number ten so which number comes between eight and ten yes number nine now let us see one more number number two blank and this time there is one more blank and number five now guess the numbers okay take you all time come on think fast faster okay number three and number four very good

Directed Numbers,NKsoImYwyGo,today i'm here to teach you chapter 8 in your textbook that's directed numbers so this word is new to you directed so that means there's a direction so numbers with 
,,direction we call directed numbers look at this diagram what is the first light post from the place where child is what can you say about this diagram the distance from here to a or here to p is the same so we can't say which point exactly we can say either a or p a or b what is the first light pose to the right direction from the place where child is if you take this is the right hand side what's the first light post that's a what is the second light pose to the right we know right hand side is this way so that's p what is the third light pose to the right one two three that's c what is the first light pose to the left so you have to take this direction so that's p and what is the second light pose to the left you can say that's q and what's the third light pose to the left that's r now you know to the right side that means this way and left means this way look at this line so 0 is there and plus 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus values are to the right and minus 1 starting from here 1 minus 1 minus 2 minus 3 there there seems to be two directions to the above numbers positive side negative side numbers to the right from 0 plus values the numbers to the left from 0 are minus numbers or negative numbers you can write negative also negative numbers 0 does not have a mark plus or minus it is the initial point so we can call this is the initial volume from this initial point we take plus values to the right and minus values or negative values to the left and also we put an arrow this way only one side showing that the numbers are increasing this way what you call this line number line this is called a number line so initial point and towards right side you get positive values towards left side you get negative values write the numbers relevant to these letters a a is here that means minus 2 that means 2 places to the left from 0 b b is here that's 0 initial point see that's plus 2. d as d that's plus 4 and e e is minus 4 and f as f f is here plus 1. here we put 
,,brackets when you get a negative number look at this number line the position p is stationed on the very middle of minus 1 and minus 2. look at this one so that's half way between minus 1 and minus 2. so what can you say about p then you can say this is minus 1 and a half one and a half or you can write p as one minus 1.5 in decimals in between 1 and 2 that's 1.5 so minus values they are minus 1.5 the position q is stationed on the very middle of plus 2 and plus 3. this is also the same so 
,,what's the value of q q you can write plus 2.5 or two and a half you can either write in fractions or decimals all the plus whole numbers minus or negative whole numbers 0 plus fractions plus decimals minus numbers and the minus decimals station on the number line are all directed numbers so you can get positive numbers negative whole numbers 0 fractions decimals so all these values on this number lie so we call these are directed numbers so remember directed means with the direction now try to write down the other points what's s s is in between 0 and 1 so what's s s is half 4.5 so i can write half plus half of 0.5 what about r our point you can write our point is in between minus 3 and minus 4. so minus 3 and a half or you can write r equals minus 3.5 station the following numbers on the number line two and a half so plus you don't need to give the plus sign nothing means you have to take that is plus two and a half two and a half means midway of two and three that's e b minus three and a half minus 3 and a half is in between minus 3 and minus 4 that's b c equals 0. so that's the initial point see d is plus 4 so d is and we can put an 
,,arrow towards right side so that's the number line look at this diagram write the numbers shown on the points marked on the number line p p is minus four q in between minus two and minus three so what's the value of minus 2.5 or minus two and a half r are exactly minus one s is in between zero and one that's plus half t plus 2 u is in between 3 and 4. you can write plus 3.5 or 3 and a half now we'll compare directed numbers look at the number line right three numbers greater than a greater 
,,means you can't include a greater means towards right side so write down three numbers greater than a so i can write plus three plus four plus five right three numbers smaller than a so you can't write plus two so towards left side plus one zero minus one write 3 numbers greater than b b is here greater means towards right side 
,,so you can write minus 1 0 plus 1 write 3 numbers smaller than b that means towards left side minus 3 minus 4 minus 5. numbers to the right of a certain number are greater than that number numbers to the left of certain number are smaller than that number so when you compare two numbers see which one is to the right side so the 
,,right side number is greater than the other number always look at this statement elephant is greater than or larger than ant this means ant is less or smaller than we can say smaller than elephant now right how the following these ones in words 7 is greater than 3 7 is greater greater larger you can use those words 7 is greater 
,,than 3. this one 2 is greater than minus 3 2 is greater than negative three this is otherwise remember crocodile mouth crocodile crocodile mouth opens to the bigger 
,,side other side is less so minus 5 or negative 5 is less than negative 2. this one negative 3 is less than is less than zero this statement zero is greater than minus seven minus or negative 7 here minus 4 is less than or negative 4 is less than 4 write these using either greater or less sign minus 2 minus 2 a smaller than less 
,,than 4 minus 7 smaller than minus 6. 0 is larger than minus 5. 8 is smaller than 12 plus 12 so you can write plus if you want minus 3 smaller than 3 smaller than plus 3 plus 9 larger means greater than minus 1. so when you look at these numbers always the bigger value is to the right nine and minus one nine is to the right here 
,,plus three is to the right plus twelve here's zero is to the right compared with minus 5. fill in the blanks using either greater of less than mark minus 3 and minus 4. so minus 3 is towards the right side then minus 4 so this is greater minus 8 10 plus 2 2 is to the right and minus 8 to the left so 2 should be greater so minus 
,,it 8 is less than plus 2 plus 5 n plus 3.5 this is towards right side so that's greater minus 1.5 and point five two plus two point five is to the right so this way 
,,so that means this number is less than two point five zero and minus four which one to the right 0. so you put greater minus 9 and minus 7 minus 7 is towards right side so you put greater to that side plus say 10 plus 5 this is more towards to the right so that's greater plus 8 is greater minus 10 and plus 10 10 is to the right 
,,so you put the crocodile mouth open with the cluster minus seven and a half and minus five and a half this one minus five and a half towards right so you put this number 2.10 3.7 3.7 is to the right you put this one if the relationship given for the following pair of numbers is correct indicate the correct sign if it's not correct put wrong side plus 3 and minus 2 yes 5 plus 3 is towards right side this is correct minus 5 and minus 4 minus 5 is towards left side so that's correct 0 n minus 
,,7 that's wrong because 0 is to the right side it should be greater so that's wrong minus nine and minus eight minus eight towards right side so that's also wrong plus seven and plus nine nine is bigger that's wrong minus 11 minus 11 both are equal that's correct 9 and 12 12 is bigger that's correct minus 6 and minus 2. minus 2 is bigger that's wrong 5 and 9 9 is bigger that's correct 0 and 2 2 is bigger so that's wrong additive inverse numbers so what are what are additive inverse means the distance from minus 2 to 0 equals to the distance from 0 to 2 so again distance from -3 to 0 and distance from 0 to -3 these two distances are equal so we call minus 3 is the additive inverse of plus 3 plus 2 is the additive inverse of minus 2 so the same distance from the original point or the initial point right numbers having equal distance to zero if it's minus five what should be the additive inverse that's plus five equal distance minus four what's the value minus 4 is same as plus 4 so don't get confused with this side so this is just brackets not any equal inequality sign just a bracket showing that what are the additive inverse of these numbers minus 3 what's the additive inverse of that plus 3 minus 2 is plus 2 minus 1 is plus 1 and plus 9 that's minus nine plus eight additive inverse is minus eight plus seven additive inverse is minus seven plus six that's minus six plus five that's minus 5. so these are the additive inverse of the other numbers that means the distance from the initial point to these points are what is the answer getting when the following additive inverse numbers are added think about plus 10 and minus 10. so both get cancel out and you get 0 minus 9 plus 9. you get 0 because 1 towards right and one's towards left so both signs plus minus get cancel out minus eight and 
,,plus eight zero plus plus seven and minus seven zero so all these when you add additive inverse to that number what you get you get all zeros this is also number and the additive inverse all are zeros five and minus five four so all you get zero so always when two additive inverse integers are added the answer is 0 because it get cancel out positive means towards right side negative means towards left side so same distance it get cancel out addition of directed numbers the number line can be used for adding directed numbers so we'll try to do this plus 2. what's plus 2 means from 0 you move 2 places to the right that's plus 2. now this is the new position then adding plus 3 another 3 places 1 from here one two three so you are moving another three so what's the final answer you get five this is the initial position 0 to 5 so answer is plus 5 move 2 units to the right first after starting from zero move three more units to the right and join zero and the final destination there will be the answer from that so plus five is the answer plus 3 and plus 4. we'll try to use the number line for that plus 3 means starting from the initial three places to the right that's this position then another 4 towards right side 1 2 3 4 so that's the final position so here to here what's that 0 to 7 that's plus 7 plus 
,,5 and plus 4 starting from initial point 5 places to the right and then another four places one two three four so what's the final answer that's plus nine one try plus 6 and plus 2 starting from initial point plus 6 means 6 squares to the right and then plus 2 another 2 to the right final position is this here to here means plus 8 so remember on a number line when you mark the numbers the distances are equal do the following additions at once so what can you see from the previous one when you get same sign plus you just add these two numbers 5 plus 4 9 3 plus 4 7 6 plus 2 8. so without the number line when you get two positive numbers adding you can just write down the addition three and three plus six plus eight and three plus eleven four and eight plus twelve six plus three plus nine nine plus two plus eleven eight and eight plus sixteen eight plus seven plus 15 9 and 10 plus 19 7 and 11 plus 18 and 10 and 7 plus 17. so if both numbers carry the same sign the answer get the same sign answer is given by adding both numbers fill in the blanks minus 8 is there so how you get minus 8 from -3 so towards minus side so you can add another minus 5. 5 and 3 8 so both to the left how you get minus 9 from minus 6 you're adding another minus 3 10 from this one 7 both are minus so when you add 3 to that towards left side you'll get minus 10. how you get minus 5 minus 4 minus 1 minus eight you can get it from minus zero your minus r plus doesn't matter zero is the same minus four you need to get minus six from minus you are adding minus 2 minus 16 from minus 10 you are adding minus 6 minus 18 from minus 9 minus 9. minus five is already there so you are adding zero minus eight from minus four you are adding minus four now we'll try to use the number line minus 2 now minus 2 means starting from the initial 2 places to the left now and then adding negative 3 means the direction is different now negative means to the left so three more to the left so final position is this so what's the number you get minus five move two units to the left starting from zero move another three units to the left from there on and join o and the final destination if moved to minus direction the answer is minus so minus 2 and minus 3 becomes minus 5. add using number line minus 3. so how do you do that starting from 0 minus 3 means towards left side 3 squares minus 4 1 2 3 4. another 4. so this is the final position so here to here is the answer so you get minus 7 minus 7 and minus 2. so first position is 0 minus 7 means this one another 2 to the left here so here to here this is the final position so you get minus 9 minus 5 minus 3 so starting from the initial point minus 5 means towards left side another 3 to the left so you get final position is minus 8 so minus 5 and minus 3 adding it becomes minus 8. studying the answers of the above number line write the answer to the following at once so what's the theory when you get both negative what you do just add the two numbers minus 7 minus 2 minus 9 minus 3 minus 4 minus 7 minus 5 minus 3 that's minus 8. now we'll use that property votes same sign minus 3 minus 7 minus 10 minus 5 and minus 2 here minus 7 minus 9 minus 2 minus 11 minus 6 n minus 4 minus 10 minus 3 n minus 2 you get minus 5 minus 8 n minus 3 minus 1 minus 7 n minus 2 minus 9 minus 10 n minus 4 minus 14 minus 11 n minus 9. minus 20 just add minus 8 and minus 8 minus 60. so if both numbers get the same sign the answer will get the same sign is given by adding both numbers so add then put the sign 11 plus 9 20 both are negative so put negative sign fill in the blanks minus 8 from minus 3 minus 5. how you get minus 9 from minus 6 you have to add minus 3 minus 10 and minus 7 you have to add minus 3 there how you get minus 5 from minus 4 that's minus 1 minus 8 from minus 8 that means zero this one how do you get minus six from minus four adding minus two sixteen from minus ten you have to add minus 6 18 from 9 at minus 9. 5 is already there at 0. how you get minus 8 from minus 4 at minus 4. now 1 is positive and the other one is negative so we'll see how we use the number line 
,,plus 5 from 0 plus means towards right side so that's plus 5 is here now minus adding negative the the direction is not the same you are moving two squares to the left now so what's the last position you get 0 2 3 so i'll use a different color there here to here now what's the answer plus 3 so what happens starting from 0 move 5 units to the right then move two more units along from there on but this is towards left side answer is given according to the direction so 0 to 3 that's positive b so you get positive 3. final answer using number line plus 7 so here 2 here 7 squares to the right now from there minus 5 change the direction 1 2 3 4 5. so 5 squares to the left now so what's the end point this is the last position this is the starting point so what's the answer plus 2. minus 6 and plus 3 starting from 0 minus 6 means 6 squares to the left and adding 3 now adding 3 means move 3 squares to the right so what's the position here so minus 3 from here so the answer is minus three minus five plus two so from zero minus five means towards left then plus two means two squares to the right so now the point is here so what's the answer 0 2 this one means minus 3 plus 8 and minus 6 plus 8 means starting from here 8 squares here to the right but minus means you move 6 squares this way so this is the last position so the answer answer is plus 2. write the answer at once now here look at carefully five and two you got three sine is negative so what we do when you get two different signs you take the difference 5 and 2 difference is 3 then 8 and 6 difference is 2. take the difference and put the sign of the bigger number which one is bigger 5 is bigger than 2 so the sign for 5 is minus which one is bigger here here there's a small mistake this is minus 6 so which sign is bigger plus 8 is bigger 
,,so this is plus so use that theory and find out this one eight and three difference is five which one is bigger plus eight difference of seven and five is two which 
,,one is bigger plus set plus seven 9 and 2 difference is 7 minus sign is bigger answer is minus 7 plus 7 and minus 10 what's the difference 3 minus sign is here because 10 is bigger 10 and 8 minus 10 that means difference is 2 that's minus then 6th one 11 and 7 difference is 4 plus is there because 11 is bigger minus 5 and 5 inverse additive numbers the answer is 0 15 and i'll do this one 9 n minus 2 difference is 7 and plus is there because 9 is bigger 11 and 5 difference is 6 negative 6 because minus 11 is bigger than 5 when you compare without the sign then 15 and 10 difference is 5 negative sign is bigger so negative 15 is bigger so you put negative 10 and 3 that's 7 plus 7 because 10 is bigger minus 8 and 5 difference is 3 which one is bigger minus 8 8 is bigger so that's minus sign so when you get two different signs take the difference and put the sign of the bigger number now fill in the blanks minus 2 is there that's minus so you are adding plus 5 to that 7 and 5 difference is 2 you get minus 3 minus 8 is there what's the difference you need another plus five six and four difference is two so add two to that minus nine and three 
,,difference is 3 that means you are adding 6 to that is that 6 that's wrong because that becomes -3 so you have to add more positive numbers plus 12 9 and 12 differences 3 but positive is the highest number here positive is the highest number means this should be more 8 plus 5 13 that's plus 30 plus is more so you have to add 13 
,,more plus 18 you get plus 13 as the difference plus 7 is there how you get 7 from this so you need to add that 10 plus 10 and minus 3 you get plus 7 minus 5 and minus 2 is there so that means you are adding plus 3 take the difference that's 2 bigger number is negative bigger number is negative there so you need to add plus 8 there to get minus 2 plus 8 and minus 10 minus 2 minus 1 is there so that means you are adding plus 5 difference is 1 plus 5 is there so you are adding 0 so you don't need brackets 0 plus 5 that's plus 5 minus 7 is there so add 0 to that so that's how you get the difference write the answer at once now all these expressions one is 
,,negative one is positive so take the difference and put the sign of the bigger number seven five that's two negative is the sign because seven is bigger eight and three difference is five plus five is there because 8 is bigger 10 and 11 difference is 1 put the sign of the bigger number that's plus 1 9 and 12 3 and minus 3 is there because 12 is bigger 6 and 10 4 is the difference plus 4 you are getting because 10 is the bigger number minus 5 and 13 what's the difference 8 and plus 8 because 13 is bigger this one 8 and minus 7 you get 1 and that's positive 19 and 10 9 minus 9 because 19 is bigger 11 and 20 the difference is 9 and plus 9 because 20 is bigger 18 and 21 3 is the difference and minus 3 you are getting because minus 21 so 21 is bigger than 80 19 and 16 difference is 3 plus 3 because 19 is bigger 17 and 
,,9 what's the difference so you get 8 17 and 9 plus is there because 17 is bigger write the answer at once now you can do so this is combination when you get same sign you add even it's negative or positive when you get different signs you take the difference that's the basic idea plus 5 plus 3 3 both positive add it minus 3 minus 8 both negative add these two numbers and put the sign of the number 7 and 2 add the numbers and put the sign 9 and 3 same sign that's positive now this is difference because 1 is positive 1 is negative so the difference is 4 the larger number is positive difference is 6 larger number is negative 8 and 11 difference is 3 not difference both negative both negative means add these two you get 19 and put the sign both negative add it and put the sign both negative add and put the sign one is positive 1 is negative difference is 3 bigger number is positive 16 and 8 here take the difference because 1 is positive and 1 is negative bigger number is negative 10 and 15 difference is 5 bigger number is minus take the difference 17 and 15 that's two bigger number is positive there 11 and 3 both negative add it together so 
,,you get 14 both negative so that's negative 40 plus say 10 plus 0 both positive just add it you get plus 8 30 and 35 difference is 5 and the larger number is positive so only thing you have to remember when you get adding same sign numbers you are getting same sign with addition of the two numbers when you get two different signs you take the difference and put the sign of the larger number fill in the blanks of the following tables what's that adding zero zero adding zero zero and one one 
,,zero and two two zero and three three 0 and 4 so this is just the number as it is minus 1 and 0 minus 1. you get the same number when you add 0. so i can write this 
,,column as it is and then these numbers minus 1 and plus 1 additive inverse you get 0 minus 1 and plus 2 take the difference one that becomes plus one minus one and plus three difference is two and that's plus minus one and plus four that's plus three difference is three minus one and 5 difference is 4 5 is the bigger number that's positive now minus 2 and plus 1 1 is positive 1 is negative take the difference and put the sign of the bigger number minus 2 plus 2 you get additive inverse that's 0 minus 2 and plus 3 the difference is 1 you get plus 1 minus 2 plus 4 you get plus 2 minus 2 plus 5 plus 3. now minus 3 minus 3 plus 1 take the difference and put the bigger sign of the bigger number minus 3 plus 2 that's minus 1 minus 3 plus 3 that's additive inverse you get 0 minus 3 plus 4 that's positive 1 minus 3 plus 5 you get positive 2 minus 4 plus 1 you get negative 3 minus 4 plus 2 negative 2 minus 4 plus 3 negative 1 and this is additive inverse you get 0 minus 4 plus 5 you get plus 1 minus 5 now minus 5 plus 1 you get minus 4 minus 5 plus 2 minus 3 minus 5 plus 3 minus 2 minus 5 plus 4 minus 1 and minus 5 and plus 5 additive inverse you get 0. now you know how to add directed numbers another method for addition of directed numbers so this is where we look at the distance from the initial point o is the o means 0 is the number line zero of the number line is called as the initial point we already know that now we are checking most distant initial point from the following two points so always look at the initial point and see which one is the most disturbed is it minus 3 or plus 5 let's plus 5 minus 5 or plus 7 plus 7 plus 
,,8 or minus 11 this is most distant value from the initial point plus 9 or minus 6 plus 9 10 or 11. so this is towards left this is towards right 11 is bigger minus 5 or 7 7 is more distant than 5 11 or 13 13 15 or minus 20. minus 20 18 or 25 25 is most distant 20 or minus 80 plus 20 is more disturbed 20 or this one this one minus 6 or plus 7 7. so when you take the number you can find out the most distant value from the initial point so what we use you look at the most distant number plus 5 is the most listed num so apply plus mark to the answer so check most distance value that's plus and the answer you get the difference five and three three difference is two so what you get plus five and minus 3 that's plus 2 minus 7 and 3 which one is most distant 7. so minus 7 is there so that means minus answer you are getting and difference is 4. so minus 4 is the answer minus 5 and 5. now what happens both are the same distance minus 5 plus 5 due to being stationed in the equal distances so you get answer 0 minus 8 plus 8 also answer 7 plus 7 minus 7 same distance you get answer 0 minus 6 and plus 6 you get 0. write the answers at once minus 7 minus 7 both minus and and put the sign minus 40 minus 3 and 5 both negative and then the negative sign minus 2n minus 8 you get 11 9 and 4 30 that's minus minus 6 and minus 6 minus 12 8 and 2 adding that's 10 plus 11 plus 7 you get plus 18 6 and 4 that's 10 5 and 3 that's 8 8 and 7. that's 15. when you get same sign you add and put the sign of the number write the answer that once now two different signs take the difference eight and five most distant number is eight so plus is there difference is three difference of these two is 3 most distant value is plus 10 and 5 difference is 5 most distant value is 10 8 and 12 difference is 4 most distant value is minus so minus 4 is the answer 9 and 11 what's the difference 2 the most distant value is minus minus eight and plus eight additive numbers you get zero because same distance from initial point eighteen and ten difference is eight and plus because most distant value is plus 18. 19 and 10 difference is 9 and this is plus 8 and 6 difference is 2. 8 is most distant value that's plus 17 and 15 difference is 2 most distant value is minus so minus 2 write the answers at once so both positive add the two numbers one third one third you get two thirds both positive both positive two nines two ninths 4 9. it's positive both negative so add it 5 and 2 7 7 over 
,,7 minus so finally you get minus 1 because it get cancelled out this one one is positive one is negative take the difference seven and four difference is three three over ten this is plus because plus 7 is the most distant number both minus edit 3.5 2.1 when you add it you get 5.6 both negative so you can put negative sign this 
,,one both positive add the two numbers six and nine nine point six this is positive now we look at the exercises and examples in your textbook example number one find the value of plus 3 plus 2 using the number line so what you do you can mark it first so alma starting from here 0 plus 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4 plus 5 6 plus 7 plus 
,,8. so here plus 3 so starting from 0 plus 3 means 3 squares to the right and plus 2 another 2 to the right so what's the final answer so you are getting here to here that means plus 5 so the answer is plus 5 0 2 plus 5. exercise 8.1 find each of the following sums using the number line so i'll start from 0 here 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 plus 2 that means starting from the initial point plus 2 is here plus 3 means another 3 squares to the right so what's the answer using number line we are getting here to here that's plus 5 plus 3 plus 3 so you can start from 0 one two three four five six seven eight nine starting from zero plus three means three squares to the right another three three squares to the right so what's the answer final position is here you can write plus six plus four n plus one so you can mark the number 
,,line first starting from plus 4 0 to 4 and another 1 to the right so this is this position so what's that 0 2 plus 5 so plus 5 is there plus 5 n plus 3 and start from 0 plus one two three four five six seven eight nine plus five means five squares to the right that's here another three squares to the right so what's the answer plus five and plus three becomes plus eight here to here eight example number one now this is minus three minus two towards left hand side so we need more negative numbers so i'll start from negative nine negative three so that means to the left now zero to three so negative three to the left another 2 to the left so the position is here from here to here that's negative 5. exercise eight point two find the value using the number line negative four negative one so i'll start here minus nine 
,,starting from -4 so here 0 minus 4 means to the left 4 squares and another one more so what's the final position here 2 here so that's minus 5 minus 2 and minus 2. first mark the number line and starting from the initial point minus two two squares to the left another two squares to the left so what's the final position that's 0 to minus 4 so minus 4 is the answer minus two minus three you know the number line and starting from the initial point minus two means two squares to the left another three squares to the left one two three so what's the last position here to here now that's minus 5 minus 1 minus 3. starting with minus one so initial point minus one means one square to the left three more squares to the left one two three three squares to the left so you get finally four squares from here from the initial 
,,point that's minus four minus three minus three the number lines starting from initial point minus three means three squares to the left another three squares to the left so you get here two here so that's left minus six minus 4 and minus 2 starting from we'll take minus 9 first label it and then starting from initial point minus 4 means 4 squares to the left another two squares to the left so what's the final position you get six squares to the left so the answer is minus six example number one find the value of minus five plus two using the number line now two different signs so we'll take minus nine minus eight starting from zero minus five five squares to the left plus 2 means two squares to the right again so what's the final position final position is here so that means here to here from initial point so that's minus 3 exercise 8.3 find the value using the number line plus three and negative one plus three starting from this one plus 3 means towards right side 3 squares then negative 1 means 1 square to the left so what's the answer there you get here to here that's positive 2. minus 4 n plus 6 so here plus 6 starting from minus 4. so here's 0 minus 4 means towards left side 4 squares plus 6 means from there 6 squares to the right one two three four five six now the last position is here so what's the answer here to here you get plus two minus 7 and plus 2. starting from zero minus seven means seven squares to the left plus two means two squares to the right now one two so what's the answer this is the final position here to here you get minus 5 plus 2 and minus five so we'll start from the same thing plus two starting from zero two squares to the right minus five means from here five squares to the left now the position is here here to here that means to the left that's three squares you get minus three as a answer look at this one plus 1 and minus 1. so we'll take the number line plus one starting from zero plus one means one square to the right and minus one one square to the left so what's the answer you get 0 additive inverse minus 3 and plus 3. so you have to show this on a number line so that's 
,,why we need to mark numbers and show that you get 0. minus 3 means 3 squares to the left and from there plus 3 means 3 squares to the right so the final position is 
,,0. example number one simplify so now this is without a number line so same sign addition all these same signs so what you do add it and put the sign 6 and 4 10 plus is given so plus 10 11 and 3 14 both pluses so you get plus 5 and 2 7 both minus so you get minus 7 4 and 1 addition is 5 both negative you get negative 5 exercise 
,,8.4 simplify now both same sign addition 8 plus 3 11 this is plus both same sign 7 and 3 that's 10 both negative so negative 10 12 and 4 both positive 12 plus 4 16 that's plus 9 and 16 addition 25 both negative so negative 25 negative 20 and negative 13 both negative so add the two numbers and put the sign 17 and 13 addition that's 30. put the sign 29 and 11 addition that's 40 with the sign of the two numbers that's negative 2 and 8 that's 10 put the sign of the two numbers that's plus minus 3 and minus 10 that's 13. both negative put the sign as negative example number one simplify now two different signs so when you get two different signs you take the difference eight and three difference is five the most distant point value from initial that's plus eight so this is plus five plus four n minus ten difference is 6 most distant value is 10 so that's minus 6. evaluate the following seven and two take the difference and put the sign of the bigger number ten and four take the difference six put the sign off the bigger number that's minus 6 and 3 take the difference and put the sign of the larger number 9 and 5 difference is 4 larger number is positive 11 and 4 what's the difference you get 7 large number is negative so negative 7 4 and 0 difference is 4 large number is 4 so that's minus 4 9 and 8 difference is 1 larger number is positive so you get positive 1 7 and 15 the difference is 8 larger number is negatives 5 and 6 larger number is negative so the answer is negative difference is 1 7 and 5 take the difference it's 2 large number is negative so you get negative 2 8 and 10. difference is two larger number is negative that's minus two nine and four difference is five larger number is negative so you get negative five example number 1 at the following directed numbers you get fractions decimals same sign so you add it half and half you get 2 over 2 or just 1 both positive so plus 1 both negative addition so that means at these 2 4 and 2 6 6 over 7 both negative so you put negative 6 over 7 both numbers positive so you take the addition 7.2 and 1.3 you get 8.5 both positive so positive 8.5 here 1 is negative 1 is positive means take the difference difference is 4.4 which one is bigger 6.9 is bigger so you put the negative sign exercise 8.6 evaluate the following same sign you add 3 plus 1 4 4 over 5 both positive so you put positive both negative addition 4 and 1 5 so add the two fractions and put the sign both positive at the both positive at the two values two plus one three three over three you get one so both positive the sign also positive addition two and half two and a half both negative so negative two and a half both negative here at the two numbers eight point one and one point three nine point four this is negative both negative at the 2 3.6 and 1.8 5.4 is the answer both negative so you put the sign negative 1 is positive 1 is negative take the difference when you take the difference you get 1.5 1.5 is the answer which one is bigger four so that's positive both negative so add it 8.7 so negative both so you put negative sign this one both negative 4 and 3 7 so 7 over 8. this one you can do these two first 1 is negative 1 is positive means take the difference 3.9 what's the answer this is minus plus so bigger number is plus so you get plus 3.9 now 4.3 and 3.9 two different sides so take the difference now 4.3 and 3.9 0.4 is the answer so 0.4 answer is negative because the bigger number is negative so negative 0.4 these two one is positive one is negative take the difference 1.8 which number is larger than this so 5.7 is larger so this is positive now positive again so that means at 1.4 so you get 3.2 that's positive now look at miscellaneous exercise fill in the blanks plus eight minus one take the difference that's seven bigger number is positive 11 and 12 take the difference that's one bigger number is negative both negative added 15 both negative means the answer is also negative both negative added 7 plus 5 12 12 over 9 that's negative you can simplify further 3 times 3 3 times 4 so minus 4 over 3 you can write as improper this improper fraction as mixed number i can write minus one and one third as four over three both negative here so add it eight plus three eleven eleven over eleven that's negative so you get negative 1 this one both positive add it together 8.95 2.97 when you add it you get 12 here 19 11. 11.92 both positive so you get positive 11.92 both negative so you can add it 6 10 8. so 8.06 and both negative means put a negative sign 1 is negative 1 is positive take the difference so you get 4.64 so that's 4.64 which one is bigger plus sign is bigger so this is plus this one both negative added 7 plus 4 11 11 over 13 and this is minus 1 is positive 1 is negative take the difference 1.01 what's the sign plus because of larger number is positive question number two the ground flow of a building has been named flow zero and the flows above it have been named one two three respectively while the flows below it have been named minus one minus two minus three respectively if a person in flow 7 climbs up a further 5 flows which flow will he be in if the person in flow minus 1 descends a further two flows which flow will he be in so you can think as the number line so when you take the number line so 0 if you take this one is the ground flow and 1 2 3 up like that plus 1 and down this is minus 1 minus 2 minus 3 so this goes down and that one goes up if a person in flow 7 climbs up a further 5 flows so that means flow 7 means plus 7. climbs up for the five floors so that means fives moves here seven plus five that's 12 which flow will he be 12th floor second one if a person in flow minus one so second one is similar to something like minus one is the position minus four distance means go to the left going down further two flows two flows from here what's the value minus 1 minus 2 minus 3. so that's minus 3 which flow will he be minus 3 if a person in flow 8 flow 8 distance three flows so four eight flow eight means plus eight distance means go to the left going down by three three units so what's the value it becomes plus five which flow will he be in plus five if a person in flow two so flow two means plus two distance four flows descends means going down so four flows one two three four so what's the value 1 0 minus 1 minus 2 4 flows from here means minus 2. then which flow will he be in this one if a person flow 2 descends 4 flows which flow minus 2 question number three the temperature at 6 00 am in moscow on a certain day was recorded as minus 4.7 celsius while the temperature at 4 pm on the same day was increased by 12. find the temperature in moscow at 4 pm so 6 am minus 4.7 celsius while the temperature at 4 pm increased increase means plus 12 find the temperature so that means minus 4.7 plus 12. so what's the value this is different signs you take the difference first 4.7 so you get 3 5 so 7.3 what's the sign bigger number is positive so plus 7.3 celsius is the temperature at 4 pm so we covered all theory related to directed numbers all numbers that are written with positive or negative sign to indicate not only their magnitude but also one of two directions which are opposite to each other are called directed numbers when adding two directed numbers of the same sign just add the two numbers and consider the sign when adding two direct numbers of opposite signs positive or negative take the difference without considering the sign and the answer with the sign of the directed number which is further away from zero on the number line or the bigger number so practice all theory and exercises related to directed numbers because you need this in future

Directed Numbers,f4c8izcEX4s,hello graduate children today i'm here to teach you chapter four in your textbook that's directed numbers we can call it directed numbers as well so we'll see what are the basics here what is this one what what you call this one this is a number line so starting point is 0 and then towards the right hand side you get positive numbers towards left hand side you get negative numbers so 0 plus 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4 like that towards this side to the right side minus 1 minus 2 minus 3 to the left side of 0. what about in between in between means any decimals or fractions in between the whole numbers but only we mark the integers half 0.5 is in between 0 and 1. so any fraction or decimal in between the integers now what are these plus 1 plus 1.2 plus 3.5 these are directed numbers there's a direction that's why we use plus or minus so here it's better to write directed numbers in brackets because we can see that whether it's towards positive side or towards negative side now here use plus for addition and subtraction we use minus sign so therefore it is better to write directed numbers in brackets so here minus 3 means to the left side of 0 
,,3 units to the left plus 8 means towards right hand side plus 5 towards right hand side minus 4 towards left hand side so when you want to show directed numbers sign is important and make sure that you put brackets now what are the properties in directed numbers magnitude and the direction so what is magnitude means the size of 
,,the directed number just a number direction means whether it's positive or negative so consider plus 3 what's the magnitude there you take only the number plus 3 that is the distance on the number line from 0 to plus 3 this is towards right hand side plus sign represent the number is in the right hand side to zero consider minus five directed number what's the magnitude there magnitude is five so what's the meaning of that magnitude 5 means starting from 0 to -5 distance from 0 to -5 and minus means the number is in the left hand side to zero write down the magnitude and the direction for given directed numbers plus seven so what's the magnitude 7 what's the direction plus plus means to the right minus 8 magnitude is 8 minus means to the left of 0 plus 4 4 is the magnitude this is to the right and minus 10 10 is the magnitude this is to the left 0 that's not moving so magnitude 0 and what's the direction none not moving left or right minus six means six is the magnitude minus means to the left plus 12 plus 12 means magnitude is 12 and plus means to the right now look at this one numbers with the same magnitude and opposite signs are located in equal distance from zero when you add these the answer is zero now what it means now take this one so here i can start minus 3 minus 2 minus 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 like that minus 3 what it means 0 to minus 3 distance plus 3 means 0 to right hand side distance so these two distances are the same when you add what happens opposite 
,,sides get cancel out and you get 0 if this is plus 7 to get 0 you need to add minus 7. if this is 0 plus 8 is there that means you have to add minus a and if this is minus 10 is there you have to add plus 10 to get 0. so we call it's the additive inverse additive inverse means if you take plus 3 minus 3 is the additive inverse of plus 3. now if you take plus 7 what's the additive inverse that's minus 7 minus 12 what's the additive inverse of minus 12 that's plus 12 when you add these you get zero addition of directed numbers so what we do so plus 2 plus 5 so we can start from plus 2 in grade 7 you did starting with 0. now we can start with plus 2. so plus 2 is there here and adding plus 4 so straight away 4 units from here 1 2 3 4 so the answer you are getting here is the final answer so what is plus 2 plus 4 that's plus 6 so the answer is plus 6. start from plus 2 and move 4 places to the right answer is obtained from the last position on the number line let's take this one 
,,minus 3 so start with -3 plus plus means to the right and plus 4 means you are moving 4 places to the right 1 2 3 4 so you're moving to this side so what's minus 3 plus 4 answer is plus 1 this one negative 2 plus negative 3 so starting from negative 2 and adding negative 3 adding means to the right but you are subtracting here another minus three now again you have to go back to left so another three one two three to the left side so what's the final answer minus 2 adding 3 places to the left so final answer is minus 5. so start from minus 2 and move 3 places to the left answer is obtained from the position on the number line find minus 4 plus 7 so starting from minus 4 plus seven that means moves to the right seven places one two three four five six seven so here to here so what's the final position plus 3 here 2 this is 3 so plus 3 is the answer this one plus seven and minus eight so here plus seven starting point is plus seven adding and here minus eight so minus means you have to move eight places to the left one two three four five six seven eight so this is the final position so what's the answer minus one plus 4 plus minus 7 so starting point is plus 4 plus and minus 7 means moves 7 places to the left so what's the answer 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 so here 2 here so the final position is minus 3 write down the answer at once now all are positive and addition so what you do just add the numbers and put the sign positive both numbers are positive answer is also positive and value is the sum of the two numbers so you can do at once 5 plus 3 8 sine is positive 7 plus 2 9 sine is positive 6 plus 4 10 sine is positive 8 plus 6 fourteen sign is positive nine plus one ten sign is positive and four plus four eight sine is positive write down the answer at once now what happens you get both negatives and addition sign is there so what we do both numbers are negative answer is also negative and the value is the sum of the two numbers if both are negative just add it 3 plus 2 5 but the sign is negative 5 and 3 8 here negative 7 plus 6 13 negative 30 5 and 5 10 that's negative 10 9 plus 2 11 that's negative 11 and four plus four eight that's negative eight write down the answer at once now what happens one is positive and the other one is negative so what we do here addition of directed numbers with opposite signs ignore the sign and take the difference between the two values sine of the answer is always the sign of the larger number so what we do take the difference 7 and 2 difference is 5. and which one is a bigger plus 7 so the answer is plus 5. 6 and 3 difference is 3 positive 6 is the bigger one it's plus 3 10 and 4 what's the difference 6 but large number is negative so negative 6 here 11 and 8 what's the difference 3 large number is positive so you put positive 3 subtraction of directed numbers now you are asked to find out plus 4 minus minus 2 using number line so what's the starting value plus 4 here subtraction is left and minus 2 you need to get the opposite direction so that means plus 2 so 2 places to the right so you get 6 is the answer so we can write plus 4 minus minus 2 is plus 6. this one find minus 3 minus minus 5 using number line so minus 3 is the starting point minus means left subtraction and minus 5 you have to consider the opposite that means five places to the right one two three four five so you get plus two so minus three minus minus five is plus 2. find the answer using number line so starting value is plus 3 minus minus means left here plus 4 so left 4 places 1 2 3 4 so you get this number so what's the answer minus 1. 5 minus minus 7 start with minus 5 okay so these are all positive numbers and here minus is left and another minus means opposite direction seven places to the right one two three four five six seven so you get plus 2 as the answer so make sure that you put brackets so the answer is plus 2. this one plus 4 is the starting point minus plus 6 means 6 places to the left 1 2 3 4 5 6. 6 places to the left the final as is minus 2 so you can write -2 there zero minus minus four what's the starting value zero and here minus and another minus get cancel out so you are moving four places to the right one two three four what's the final answer you get plus four so here also plus four is the answer this one 0 that means starting point is 0 minus plus 5 means moves 5 places to the left 1 2 3 4 5. you get minus 5 so what's the answer minus 5 is the directed number plus 2 minus plus 4 starting value is plus 2. this is all positive and minus to the left 4 units 1 2 three four so here this way so the answer is minus two write down the answer at once now you know what you have to do so here 7 and these all this is positive both positive and the subtraction just subtract 7 minus 5 plus 2 8 minus 4 what's 8 minus 4 plus 4 10 minus 6 you get 4 and this is plus 4 9 and plus 5 difference is 4 and this is plus 4 6 and 4 subtraction you get plus 2 11 and 9 
,,you need to subtract 11 minus 9 2 11 minus 9 is 2 that's plus 2 this side minus 3 and plus 4 now so here difference is 1 and look at this one so you have to add starting from minus 3 move 4 places to the left again so what's the answer 4 and 3 you get 7 that's minus 7 this one starting from minus 5 moves 9 places towards left side 9 plus 5 14 that's minus starting from minus 10 you are moving 12 places again to the left side so you are adding these two numbers so 22 and this is minus 8 and 
,,4 addition is 12 and this is minus because starting value is minus 4 you move 8 places to the left starting point is minus 9 move 11 places to the left that means just add these two numbers starting from minus seven subtract plus eight means moves eight places to the left eight plus seven fifteen that's minus additive inverse we know if it's plus 2 when you add minus 2 to both sides what happens you get plus 2 n minus 2 becomes 0 so you get x equals minus 2 so what's the additive inverse of plus 2 that's minus 2 so minus 2 is the additive inverse of plus 2 addition of additive inverse numbers the answer is 0 so when you add additive inverse you get the answer 0. now we'll see these numbers you are getting 0. how you get 0 when you add additive inverse plus 3 when you add additive inverse of plus 3 that's minus 3 you get 0 minus 2 there when you add plus 2 you get 0 minus 8 when you add plus 8 you get 0 plus 9 when you add minus 9 you get 0 minus 3 additive inverse is plus 3 minus 7 additive inverse of that is plus 7 to get 0 plus 11 additive inverse is minus 11 when you add additive inverse values you get 0 write down the additive inverse of given numbers plus 3 or 3 inverse minus 3 minus 8 plus 8 is the additive inverse 9 is minus 9 minus 6 that means plus 6 plus 11 means minus 11 is the additive inverse minus 1.5 plus 1.5 plus three and a half minus three and a half minus six point three plus six point three and plus seven and a half means minus seven and a half minus 2 1 4 means plus 2 and 1 4 so these are the additive inverse of these numbers now when you have two numbers directed numbers to subtract what you can do you can add the additive inverse and change the question for example if the question is plus 5 minus plus 2 that means you can add the additive inverse of plus 2. so this is same as plus five plus of minus two so both cases you get the same answer so here also plus five and minus two phi minus two is plus three then subtraction means moves two places to the left that is also plus three so subtraction of directed numbers means addition of additive inverse of that number write down the following subtractions as addition of additive inverse and find the answer now how can i write this question plus 7 i can write plus of minus 2 adding these two numbers so what we can do 7 and subtract 2 you get plus 5 plus 6 minus becomes plus additive inverse of minus 5 is plus 5. so you get 6 and 5 addition that's plus 11 plus 6 is there minus becomes plus of the additive inverse that's minus 2 that means 6 minus 2 you get plus minus nine and here additive inverse of minus five is plus five so nine and five addition we take the difference and put the sign of the larger number it's minus 4. this one minus 11 is there addition of additive inverse is minus 3 then minus 11 minus 3 both are the same sign add it and put the minus sign so minus 40. here also you can do the same thing minus 8 adding the additive inverse of minus 4 that's plus 4. so take the difference that's 4 put the sign of the bigger number that's minus 4 minus 6 addition of the additive inverse that's minus 3 both signs are the same so add it and put the sign minus 9 plus 11 addition of the additive inverse that's plus 3 11 plus 3 14 that's plus minus 12 additive inverse of plus 
,,3 is minus 3 both negative so add it that's 15 both negative so you get the answer also negative minus 9 adding of the additive inverse of minus 5 that's plus 5. so 
,,this is the difference because 1 is positive and 1 is negative and they put the sign of the larger numbers you get minus 4 for subtraction write down the addition of additive inverse numbers and find the answer same thing i can write minus as the plus of the additive inverse so you get 11 plus 3 40. now we'll do this one minus 6. plus 3 here you can convert to addition of additive inverse of minus 8 that's plus now these two you can add 8 plus 3 11 11 minus 6 you get 5 that's positive this 
,,one minus 9 plus minus 2 and here convert to addition of the additive inverse that's plus 6. so minus 2n minus 9 minus 11 minus 11 and plus 6 means the difference is 5 the bigger number is minus 11 so you get minus 5 minus 1 plus 8 minus becomes additive inverse of that that's plus 3 and plus plus 2. 8 plus 3 11 11 plus 2 plus 30. this one plus 11 and here convert to positive addition of additive inverse of minus 4 is plus 4 and here also adding the additive inverse of minus 2 is plus 2. now all are positive just add the numbers 11 plus 4 15 15 plus 2 17 multiplication of directed numbers so what we do ignore the sign just multiply the two numbers and 
,,then what you do if both signs are the same answer is positive always if the signs are different you get a negative answer 3 times 2 6 plus plus both signs are the same you get plus 6 2 and 2 4 both pluses plus 4 2 and 1 2 both pluses you get plus so remember same sign you get always positive when you multiply by zero what happens multiplication of directed number by zero is always zero now look at this one multiply the directed numbers 3 times 2 6 and this is plus 2 times 2 4 and this is plus 1 times 2 2 same sign you get plus 0 times plus 2 you get 0. so when you look at this side you see a pattern 6 4 2 0 what are these numbers minus 2 minus 4 and minus 6 will check whether it's true both numbers are not the same now same sign 1 is negative and 1 is positive so the answer is negative so 2 times 1 2 you get negative 2 2 times 2 4 you get negative 4 3 times 2 6 negative 6 because 1 is positive the other one is negative so here you need to remember multiplication of positive 
,,numbers answer is always positive multiplication of positive number with a negative number answer is negative write down the answer once answer is positive when multiply two positive numbers so all these are positive numbers so you get positive answer 5 times 3 50 plus 15. 4 times 3 12. so plus 12 two times six twelve plus twelve seven times two fourteen plus fourteen and four times four sixteen that's plus sixteen one times three three that's plus three eight times two sixteen plus sixteen eleven times two twenty two that's plus six times three eighty that's plus 10 times 440 that's plus find the answer 3 times -2 ignore the sign and here 1 is positive and 1 is negative you get the answer negative this is 4 minus 4 1 times 2 2 this is minus 2. 0 times -2 is 0 now look at this one same sign minus and minus so you 
,,get positive 2 2 times 2 plus 4 because both are negative both are negative you get plus 6 so what's the thing you need to remember multiplication of positive number and a negative number is always a negative answer answer is negative multiplication of two negative numbers the answer is positive write down the answer at once answer is negative and multiply a positive and a negative number now plus as minus here all these 1 is positive the other number is negative so always the answer is negative 3 times 2 6 that's negative 6 3 times 2 6 negative 6 4 times 4 16 negative 16 6 times two twelve that's negative twelve eight times five forty that's negative 
,,forty six times three eighteen that's negative eighteen eight times two sixteen negative sixteen here nine times one nine negative nine four times four sixty that's 
,,negative two times 11 22 that's negative one negative and one positive answer is always negative write down the answer at once answer is positive and multiply two negative numbers in all these both numbers are negative so the final answer is positive three times two six five times one five six times two twelve eight times three 
,,twenty-four nine times two eighteen then 4 times 3 12 5 times 3 15 11 times 1 that's plus 11 10 times 2 20 9 times 3 27 so here both negative means the final answer 
,,is positive write down the answer at once yeah you get combination sometimes positive sometimes negative both negative answer is positive one is negative one is positive answer is negative one is positive one is negative answer is negative so you need to multiply separate 9 times to 80. both negative answer is positive 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative so 10 times 3 30. 11 times 3 33 both negative that means plus one negative one positive answer is negative both negative positive answer one negative one positive answer is negative both negative answer is positive 9 times 4 36 both negative means answer is positive 12 times 224 one negative one positive answer is negative write down the answer at once look at all these questions multiplied by zero when you multiply any number by zero what's the answer 
,,you always get zero so what are these answers all these are zeros because you are multiplying by zero any number with zero is always zero find the value now you can 
,,take 2 at a time and find the answer 4 times 3 12 but it's negative now both negative the answer is positive twelve times five sixty plus one minus four and minus two four times two eight both negative means plus plus say ten minus 3 multiplication 8 times 3 24 1 is plus 1 is negative means you get a negative answer this one minus 9 minus 1 both negative means plus 9 now multiply with 4 9 times 4 36 both positive means the answer also positive minus 5 times 2 you get a negative answer because 1 is positive and the other one is negative multiplied by negative both negative now so you get a positive answer again take 2 at a time 8 times 3 24 both positive one is positive one is negative so first multiply four times four sixteen one remaining four times two eight plus one nine one plus and one negative answer is negative both negative you get a plus answer plus 33 and when you multiply by a negative the answer is a negative one both negative you get plus answer 3 times 2 6. here you can do separately these two 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative 4 times 3 12. now 12 times 6 ignore sign and multiply 6 times 2 12 1 remaining and here 72 is it positive or negative 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative here 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is 12 there minus 12 negative 12. both negative answer is positive 4. now 12 times 4 48 what's the sign one negative one positive answer is negative this one again take two at a time negative both you get positive 10 positive both you get positive 6 now multiply both positive you get positive 60. here both negative negative negative you get positive answer here negative negative positive answer now positive positive multiplication you get positive answer 9 times 4 is 30 6. find the value just multiply by two first two times one two two times three six what's the sign one negative one positive answer is negative multiply by two two times one two two times five ten ten point two is the answer both 
,,negative you get plus sign four times this 4 times 3 12 1 remaining 4 times 1 4 plus 1 5 so 5.2 both positive means answer is positive this one multiplied by 2 6 and 2 1 is negative and 1 is positive answer is negative now we look at division of directed numbers now we know multiplication 5 into plus 2 you get plus 10. now what 
,,happens when you take 10 divided by plus 2 you take this one to this side that becomes division so what's the answer you are getting plus 5 divide the numbers ignoring the sign answer is positive when dividing positive number by a positive number so just ignore the sign 10 divided by 2 you get 5. both positive means answer is also positive write down the answer once 8 divided by 2 is 4 how you decide the sign both positive means positive sign 15 divided by 5 is 3 both positive you get the positive answer 10 divided by 10 1 both positive you get 1. 16 divided by 4 4 you get plus 4 8 divided by 2 that's 4 that is also plus 4. 20 divided by 5 20 divided by 5 is 4 both positive you get positive 4. 16 divided by 8 you get 2 that's plus 2. 30 divided by 10 that's 3 you get plus 3. 40 divided by 10 you get 4 both positive means plus 4. 36 divided by 6 you get 6 both positive so when you divide both positive numbers the answer is positive now this one we know plus into minus 4 is negative 4. and when you take this one to this side negative 25 divided by negative 4 you are getting plus 6. so now look at this question both negative answer is positive answer is positive when dividing negative number by a negative number write down the answer at once both negative numbers all in all these questions both negative numbers when you divide both negative numbers the answer is positive just normal division 8 divided by 2 4 answer is plus because both are negatives 16 divided by 
,,4 4 that's plus 4. 20 divided by 5 you get 4 that's plus 4. 18 divided by 6 you get 3 that's plus 3 12 divided by 2 6 that's plus 6 18 divided by 9 you get 2 that's 
,,plus 2. 20 divided by 10 you get 2. ours is plus 2. 30 divided by 10 that's three answers plus 40 divided by 20 you get plus 2 24 divided by 12 you get plus 2 because both the numbers are negative negative number divided by a negative you get a positive answer now what happens here 1 is negative and 1 is positive so minus 8 and 
,,plus 3 we know that's minus 24 when you take plus 3 to this side that means minus 24 divide by plus 3 you need to get minus now what happens 1 is negative 1 is positive answer is negative answer is negative when dividing negative number by a positive number here also both numbers are negative you get positive 24. when you take this one here minus 6 to this side what happens plus 24 divide by this is plus 24 divide by minus 6 the answer is minus 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is always negative answer is negative when dividing positive number by a negative number so it can be positive first number and the divisor is negative or divisor is positive and the number given is negative final answer is negative write down the answer at once plus and minus so you get negative 12 divided by 4 3 plus and minus 18 divided by 6 is 3 you are getting a negative answer again minus n plus 30 divided by 5 is 6 answer is minus 6 negative positive 28 divided by 7 that's 4 you get negative 4. 27 divided by 9 you get 9 times 3 so this is negative now look at this one 12 divided by 4 you get 3 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative 18 divided by minus 6 1 is positive and 1 is negative answer is negative 30 divided by 5 6 1 is positive and 1 is negative so answer is negative 28 divided by 7 you get 4 1 is positive and 1 is negative answer is negative 27 and 9 you get 3 answer is negative 3 so you need to remember when you get same sign pluses you get positive or either same sign negatives the final answer is positive when you divide here this one one positive and one negative always you get negative answer order is not important you can get negative number divide by a positive still the answer is negative so multiplication of different signs answer is negative so in this case you get negative here you get positive for same sign write down the answer at once now combination so first multiply numbers separately and then decide the sign 7 times 2 40 both pluses answer is plus 6 times 2 12 both minus answer is plus now the division 12 divided by 6 answer is 2 this is minus and plus the sign is negative division again 30 divided by 15 you know that's 2 sign is negative because 1 is negative and 1 is positive 32 divided by 8 you get 4 1 is negative 1 is plus means answer is negative 9 times 3 27 1 is positive and 1 is negative that's minus 16 divided by 4 you get 4 both negative answer is positive 18 divided by 18 you get 1 both negative answer is positive 40 divided by 20 ans is 2. both negative means you get plus 27 divided by 3 you get 9. one negative and one positive you get minus again eight times eight multiplication 64. both negative you get plus now division 64 divided by 8 that's 8 1 positive 1 negative answer is negative 12 times 3 multiplication you get 36 1 positive 1 negative answer is negative 36 divided by 12 you get 3 both negative here you get plus 48 divided by 2 that's 24 1 negative 1 positive answer is negative 8 times 4 32 both negative answer is positive here division negative negative division you get 4 divided by 4 1 both negative means the sign is plus 18 divided by 1 you get 18. both negative that's plus 40 divided by 8 that's 5. one negative 1 positive means you get minus 9 times 3 27 and both positive means answer is positive so that's not hard you can just multiply the numbers and then decide the sign simplify following directed numbers so we can do the numerator first and then the denominator 4 times 3 12 but this is negative because 1 is positive and 1 is negative now 12 divided by 6 is 2 one negative and one positive answer is negative 8 times 4 32 is this plus or minus minus minus both means this is plus 2 times 2 4 1 minus and 1 positive means you get minus 4. now division 32 divided by 4 is 8 plus and minus the answer is minus this one we'll do these two first 5 and 2 10 minus minus becomes plus and then here three times one three one positive one negative is minus three now you can do ten times three 30 but this is negative and divide by negative 30 divided by 3 is 10 both negative means the final answer is positive this one we'll 
,,do these two 8 times 2 16 that's positive and multiplied by a negative value here 6 times 2 12 and you get a negative answer no numerator multiply you get 3 times 6 
,,18 1 remaining 3 times 1 3 plus 1 48 that's negative because 1 is positive and 1 is negative now divide by -12 both negative answer is positive 48 divided by 12 is 4. so you get plus 4 as the answer do this we'll do these two separately 9 times 3 27 that's minus and then 12 times 3 36 that's minus because 1 is negative and 1 is 
,,positive now 27 times 4. 108 that's negative negative that's positive divide by minus 36 the answer is negative 1 is positive 1 is negative how many times are there 
,,36 times what's the answer 3 3 times so you get 3 times 36 is 108 so you get negative 3 as the final this one you can do these two minus 8 and 4 minus 32. multiplied by plus 2 here 4 times 4 16 and this is minus minus plus now numerator separately 32 times 2. that's plus into minus minus 64. divide by plus 16 minus n plus minus 
,,how many 16s are there for sixty-four four so answer is minus four this one 12 times 4 you get 48 that's minus 3 times 2 6 minus minus plus now divide 48 divided by 
,,6 8 but this is minus because 1 is negative well 1 is positive 12 times 8 96 plus into minus that's minus 3 times 2 6 both minus that means plus 6. how many sixes are there divide by six you get one for 36 that's 16. is it positive or negative one is negative one is positive answer is negative these two what is eighteen times three 24 3 times 1 3 plus 2 54 but the answer is negative 6 times 3 18 answer is positive now divide how many 18s are there for 54 3 so the answer is 3 minus and plus 
,,different signs you get negative so the answer is negative 3. here we'll take these two first 4 times 3 plus 12 and then with minus 6. here 18 times 2 you get 36 that's minus 1 is positive 1 is negative now multiply these two 72 12 times 6 but the answer is negative now both negative 72 divided by 36 is 2. both negative means answer is positive now we'll look at example number one find the value of minus 3 plus minus 2 by using the number line so number line is given what's the starting point minus 3 so this is the starting point and then what we do plus minus 2 means 2 places to the left so 2 places to the left means answer is minus 5 review exercise 
,,now we'll take the review exercise find the value of each of the following by using the number line plus 2 and plus 6. so we'll take the number line okay so what's the starting value plus 2 so here i'll take minus 2 minus 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and we'll put 8 here these are pluses that's the number line starting point is plus 2 and 
,,plus 6 means 6 places to the right one two three four five six so what's the answer plus eight plus eight and minus 5 so we'll take the number line again so plus 8 is there so we need 8 i'll mark this one as 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 minus 1. now start from plus 8 and plus minus 5 means moves 5 places to the left so 1 two three four five what's the answer plus three minus two n plus three we'll take it minus two so that means i'll take this one as minus 3 minus 2 minus 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 these are pluses so starting value is minus 2 plus plus 3 means move 3 places to the right 1 2 3 answer is plus 1. this one take the number line and starting value is minus 3 so 
,,you need to check minus three but here minus means moves left so we'll start from here plus one you need to decide what are the numbers you need so here minus 3 is the starting point and here this is left means you need more minus values so four places to the left one two three four answer is minus seven this one plus 4 and minus 6 is there that means towards left side so we'll take plus 4 here starting point is plus 4 6 to the left 1 2 3 4 5 6. so you get minus 2. find the value of each of the following you can do it at once what's the condition both pluses means just add the two numbers 3 plus 2 5 so you get plus 5 now both negative that's also adding two numbers four plus two six you put a negative sign here one is positive one is negative you take the difference five and three difference is two but bigger number is positive you put plus 2 plus and minus take the difference that's 6 bigger number is negative so you put negative 6 here this is additive inverse addition so what's the answer negative 7 and 7 difference is 0. so when you add additive inverse you get 0. these two all positive so that means adding the numbers 5 plus 2 7 7 plus 3 now here all these negative numbers so that means adding negative numbers 3 plus 1 4 4 plus 4 8 what this is negative 8. all these two these two positive and the other one is negative so what is this one plus two plus four you get plus six now you have to take the difference because 1 is positive and 1 is negative so 9 and 6 difference is 3 bigger number is negative so minus 3. here you have to take the difference because 1 is positive and the other one is negative so 5 over 7 minus 2 over 7 that's 3 over 7. so answer is 3 over 7. how you decide the sign the bigger one is this that's positive 1 is positive 1 is negative 2 so take the difference when you subtract you get 8 and here 1. so 1.8 is the answer which one is bigger 5.2 that's negative so the answer also negative here what are these two additive inverse so additive inverse addition is zero example number one find the value of plus 2 minus minus 3 by using the number line so here first look at it plus 2 and minus minus that means you have to move towards right side so starting with plus 2. so we can take plus 2 somewhere here so this is plus 1 0 minus 1 minus 2 plus 3 plus 4 plus 5 plus 6 plus 7 so start with plus 2 here move three places to the right one two three so what's the final answer that's plus five find the value of minus 2 minus plus 3 by using the lambda line so before we mark the numbers just see minus 2 that means starting value is minus 2 moves to the left 3 units so when you are marking the number line we can take i'll take minus 6 minus 5 minus 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 starting with minus 2 moves left by 3 units 1 2 3. so the answer is minus five example number three find the value of minus two minus minus three by using the number line so we'll take the number line now here before we mark the points you have to look at carefully starting point is minus 2 minus minus means you have to move to the right side by 3 units so we can take minus 3 minus 2 minus 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6. these are positive values so starting value is minus two moves three places to the right one two three that's the answer plus one exercise 4.1 find the value by using the number line so we'll take the number line and now how we label you have to look at starting value is plus 4 and minus means you are moving to the left so plus 4 will mark it somewhere here and starting value is plus 4 moving towards left side by 2 units so final answer is plus two take a number line for this now how we label this so here starting point is plus 1 and here minus minus means moves towards right side so we can start from here i'll take plus 1 here plus 2 plus 3 plus 4 plus 5 
,,plus 6 like that and here this is 0 minus 1. so start from plus one and moves two places to the right one two so what's the final answer final answer is plus three this one using number line so we'll take the number line and starting with minus 2 and here minus means moves to the left so we'll start -2 somewhere here it's easy first you decide otherwise you can't put all the numbers so this is plus 1 minus 3 minus 4 minus 5 minus 6 like that starting value is minus 2 3 places to the left one two three so you get minus five this one minus one and minus minus 3 so what you have to do starting with minus and minus minus means moves towards right side so i'll start minus 1 somewhere here these are pluses so starting value is minus 1 moves three places to the right one two three one two three so answer is plus two this one starting value is minus 6 and you have to move towards right side because minus minus towards right side so we'll start from -6 here so starting value is minus 
,,6 5 places to the right 1 2 3 4 5 answer is minus 1 this one starting point is plus 2 minus minus means towards right hand side so i can start with plus 2 here here 
,,plus 1 and 0 starting with 2 and 2 places to the right this is plus 4. example number four find the value of plus two minus minus four so we can use addition of additive inverse i can change the question to adding the additive inverse of minus 4 that's plus 4. now both positive 4 plus 2 addition is plus 6. find the value of minus 5 minus plus 2. so convert this to additive inverse adding the additive inverse of plus 2 that's minus 2 now this is both minus addition so just add it and put the sign so you get minus 7. find the value of minus 7 minus minus 3 so how you do minus 7 is there adding additive inverse of minus 3 is plus 3 now difference 7 and 3 
,,difference is 4 and put the sign of the bigger number that's minus 4. example 7 find the value of minus 12 minus minus 15 minus plus 5. so these two i can convert minus 12 addition of additive inverse of that plus 50 and here also adding additive inverse that's minus 5. now these two take the difference minus 12 and 15 take the 
,,difference you get 3 that's positive now again consider this one now 1 is positive and 1 is minus you take the difference difference is 2 and the bigger number is minus you get minus 2. example eight find the value of plus three fifths minus so you can do the additive inverse of plus one over 5 means minus 1 over 5. now this is 
,,difference so you take 3 over 5 minus 1 over 5 that's 2 over 5 is the difference which one is bigger positive answer is bigger so the answer is plus 2 over 5. example 9 minus five and a half minus plus two so what you do i can rewrite this as adding the additive inverse of plus 2 that's minus 2. so this means both minus now edit 5 and 2 7 and you get 7 and a half both minus means the answer is minus example 10 minus 3.2 minus i can write plus of the additive inverse of plus 1.4 that's minus 1.4 now both negative negative means adding so 3.2 and 1.4 just add it you get 4.6 but both negative means the answer also negative example number 11 find the value of minus 8.4 minus minus i can change it to plus with the additive inverse of minus 2.5 that's plus 2.1 now 1 is negative 1 is positive take the difference 6.3 so which one is the bigger number minus so you put a minus psi exercise 4.2 fill in each cage with the suitable directed number here minus 5. we can convert to additive 
,,inverse of plus 3 that's minus 3. now both negative add the two numbers 5 plus 3 8 so you put minus eight this one convert to additive inverse so this is plus with plus four one is positive one is negative take the difference four and three difference is 1 bigger number is positive plus 1. convert to additive inverse plus 7 plus minus 1 additive inverses plus 1 7 and 1 both positive you get plus 8. this one plus 7 additive inverse of minus 2 that's plus 2 and both pluses 7 plus 2 you get plus 9. find the value of each of the following so 4 you can write this one as adding the additive inverse of this 4 minus 1 you get 3 positive number because the higher number is positive minus 8 plus additive inverse of minus 2 that's plus 2. take the difference 8 and 2 difference is 6 bigger number is minus answer is minus 6 convert to addition plus of additive inverse that's plus 7 take the difference because 1 is negative and 1 is positive so you get 4 bigger number is positive that's plus 4 here also you can start from plus 9 addition of the additive inverse that's plus 6 9 and 6 addition 15 that's plus minus 5 addition of additive inverse plus 5 yeah minus 5 and plus 5 difference is 0 this one adding the additive inverse that's minus 3 so 0 and minus 3 answer is minus 3 here minus 11 addition of additive inverse of plus 4 that's minus 4 both negative so add it so 15 answer is negative this one convert the question plus 2 plus minus 1 adding of the additive inverse that's plus 4 2 minus 1 take the difference you get plus 1. plus 1 and plus 4 you get plus 5 this one i can take minus 5 convert to addition additive inverse of this is minus 2 again convert this one plus with additive inverse that's plus 6. now these two both negative so just add it and put the sign this is plus 6 now 1 is positive and 1 is negative take the difference 7 and 6 difference is 1 bigger number is negative so you get negative 1 this one plus 4 and here adding the additive inverse that's minus 2 again adding the additive inverse that's minus 8. now 4 and 2 take the difference that's 2 that's plus 2. and now again take the difference 8 and 2 difference is 6. bigger number is negative so you put negative six this one four and a half adding the additive inverse of minus 2 that's plus 2 now this means adding these two numbers 4 and 2 6 6 and a half that's positive this one minus 6 and 1 4 is there adding of the additive inverse that's 1 4 plus 1 over now you have to take the difference so we'll take the difference six one fourth minus one fourth so one fourth one fourth get cancel out you get six what's the sign the bigger number is negative so the answer is negative 6 this one plus 15.7 adding the additive inverse that's plus 2.3 now this is addition 15.7 and 2.3 adding 7 plus 3 10 and 6 plus 2 8. so 18.0 so plus 18.0 this one will take first minus 2. adding the additive inverse of plus 3.5 that's minus 3.5 adding 4.5 4.1 now these two both negative that means adding you get 5.5 that's negative and adding plus 4.1 again the difference one is positive one is negative so take the difference you get 1.4 which number is bigger negative number so answer is negative 1.4 this one plus three and a half adding the additive inverse of minus 2 that's plus 2 here also adding additive inverse of this is plus one third now look at all of this all are adding so three plus two five that's the whole part half plus one third what's half plus one third convert to the same denominator lowest common multiple is six three times two so three times one three two times three six so two times one two so you get five over six so what's the final answer 5 and 5 over 6 so that's positive example number one simplify so here multiplication what you do just multiply the two numbers and same sign you get plus multiplication here 6 and 2 12. 1 is positive and 1 is negative answer is negative simplify the following here first one two times five ten one is positive the other one also positive both positive means ansi is positive second one three times two six 1 is negative 1 is positive answer is negative third one 5 times 3 
,,15 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative 15. here 4 times 3 12 12 times 2 24. now we'll decide the sign both negative you get plus again plus with plus answer is plus example number four plus 2.5 into minus 5. just multiply by 5 first 5 times 5 25 5 times 2 10 plus 2 12. so 12.5 how do you decide the sign one is positive one is negative answer is negative here multiplied by 12 first 3.4 multiplied by 12. 10 and 2 4 and 3 2 times 4 8 2 times 3 6. when you add it you get 4 0 8 and here 1 decimal place so 40.8 is the answer but how you decide the sign minus minus both the final answer is positive find the value exercise 4.3 so straight away you can do 5 times 420 both positive means answer is positive 5 times 420 1 is negative 1 is positive answer is negative 10 times 550 both negative answer is positive 7 times 3 21 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative both negative just multiply 1 times 4 4 both negative means you get a positive answer here 11 times 0 when you multiply any number by 0 always you get answer 0 6 times 4 24 1 is negative and 1 is plus answer is negative 12 times 3 you get 36 1 is positive one is negative answer is negative here we'll multiply first two times two four four times five twenty now we'll decide the sign one is negative one is positive answer is negative that's negative and this negative both negative means the answer is plus here 3 times 1 3 3 times 2 6 6 times 5 30 decide the sign negative negative positive here positive negative you get negative now again positive negative means the final answer is negative multiplied by 2 you get 5 both positive answer is positive now here you need to multiply by 20 3 now 20 and 3 times one two two times four eight three times one three three times four twelve when you add it you get ninety four point three now one is positive one is negative means answer is negative example number one now it's division same thing you divide and finally you can put the sign 6 divided by 2 you get 3 both negative you get positive 3 6 and 2 division you get 3 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative this one 15 divided by 5 answer is 3 both 
,,positive you get positive 3 9 divided by 3 is 3 1 is negative 1 is positive you get a negative answer 15 divided by 3 you get 5 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative 9 divided by 3 3 both negative you get positive answer exercise 4.4 find the value of each of the following 10 and 2 division you get 5 plus and plus both 
,,positive means the final answer is positive 12 divided by 4 that's 3 both negative means final answer is positive 15 divided by 3 is 5. 1 is positive and 1 is negative answer is negative here 21 divided by 7 is 3 1 is negative and 1 is positive answer is negative negative 5 divided by 5 5 divided by 5 is 1 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative 1. 20 divided by 4 is 5 both negative means answer is positive now here 8 times 2 16 both positive that's positive now you have to divide by this 16 divided by 4 that's 4. 1 is positive 1 is negative answer is negative this one we can simplify the denominator first 6 and 2 multiplication that's 12 both negative means you get positive ones now 36 divided by 12 is 3 1 is negative 1 is positive answer is negative do the numerator 5 times 4 20 one negative one positive 
,,answer is negative denominator now 2 and 2 4 both minus means positive 1's now do this one 20 divided by 4 is 5. 1 is negative 1 is positive answer is negative do the numerator 9 times 8 72 both negative means plus answer 4 times 3 12 1 is negative 1 is positive answer is negative 72 divided by 12 you get 6 1 is positive and 1 is negative answer is negative fill in each cage with the suitable directed number answer is negative that means you are getting a plus value so 20 divided by 2 you get 10. so plus 2 because minus n plus the answer is negative 18 and 6. how you get 6 18 divided by 3. now decide the sign this is plus answer is negative that means 
,,you are getting negative 3 division you get 5 that means 10 divided by 2 is 5. now decide the sign this is plus here minus so both should be minus to get plus answer answer is 4 4 divided by 1 is 4 positive and the answer is negative so this should be negative value how we decide this one when you divide this one by 2 you are getting 6. so think about reverse way so if this is 12 here 12 divided by 2 you get 6. how you get 12 from 3 this should be 4 now decide the sign this is minus and minus if it's plus and minus the answer is minus but the answer is given is plus so that means this should be a minus value so minus 4 now this one you are getting minus 28 here plus 7 is there 7 into 4 28 but this is minus means this should be minus 4 now numerator is ok now to get 7 what should be this answer you are getting minus 4 because minus minus plus 28 divided by 4 is 7. now how you get minus 4 there 2 times 2 but this is minus so you have to multiply it by minus 2. so we covered all theory related to directed numbers subtracting a number from another number is the same as adding the additive inverse of the second number to the first number a positive number is obtained when two directed numbers of the same sign are multiplied or divided a negative number is obtained when two directed numbers of opposite signs are multiplied or divided so remember all these properties in directed numbers and practice all the exercises and examples

Directed Numbers,uSXcjhhBSAM,hey guys in a previous lesson we learned about the number line extended after the zero and we've introduced what we have or what we call as negative numbers now we're going to use the number line to learn how to add and subtract directed or negative numbers now at the start you're going to use the number line but after you get the hang of it you're going to become so quick and so good that you're not going to use the number line at all but it's always good always tell my students for the first couple of times that you are using and you are working with these questions even if it takes you one whole exercise or 15 or 20 or even 30 to 40 questions that you need to do using the number line there's nothing wrong with it use it and after you get the hang of it you won't need the number line again but for the start let's use the number line to get an understanding of how it actually works here we have questions and these questions involve negative or directed numbers we're going to go through one by one and you're going to see it's a very easy process using the number line and hopefully by the end of the lesson you can probably even do them without a number line as well okay let's start we have this question saying negative 4 plus 3 negative 4 plus 3 what we do we use the number line we start at negative 
,,4 so we can put our pen or au finger on negative 4 there it is and it says we have to add 3 now a quick rule to remember when we're adding we're moving towards the right we're moving towards the addition we're moving Awards towards the plus direction and if we - thing or we're taking away we're going towards the left remember that rule very important so negative 4 plus 3 we start at negative 4 and we add 3 we're going to the right because we're adding 1 2 3 our answer is negative 1 we started negative for add 3 1 2 3 as you can see I'm caning the moves one move two moves three moves so negative one is our answer then we have another example minus 2 or 
,,negative 2 plus 6 what we do first we start at negative 2 negative 2 we're adding 6 addition meaning we're going towards the right so we're adding 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 so our answer is positive 4 we don't need to write positive we just write 4 because we know 4 means positive 4 and notice when I was counting I started from negative 2 I said 1 2 I had to ensure that I add 0 I've seen students make a mistake where they just move and they go straight to the other side forgetting the 0 very important 
,,the 0 is the number we need to add it part of the process so negative 2 plus 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 our answer is 4 let's see if you can do this one where are we going to start at negative 9 so negative 9 with it says negative 9 plus 7 so we start at negative 9 add we're going towards the right and we're going to add 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 so our answer is negative 2 negative 9 moving 7 times we end at negative 2 minus 5 Plus 8 again we start at negative 5 or minus 5 negative 5 there we're adding 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 we are on the positive was a 3/3 that's our answer now we have something a little bit different we have negative 3 plus negative 2 negative 3 plus negative 
,,2 okay what do we do here we have a plus and a negative whenever we have a plus a negative next to each other side by side they don't like each other they don't like each other at all so what I do they're a big fight they'll fight and they're always the negative will always win the negative will always win so whenever you see a 
,,puss and Nega negative next to each other like that side by side they don't like each other they have a big fight and negative will always win so how do we do it now it becomes negative 3 minus 2 negative 3 minus 2 so we start at negative 3 and we - now we said positive or we addition we go to the right - of course we're going to go to the left - 3 minus 2 or negative 3 - 2 - 3 - 2 1 - our answer is negative 5 the number is getting smaller once again negative 4 plus in brackets negative 3 now the brackets don't get confused it is exactly the same as the top so then get confused because the brackets are there it's just telling us that there is a plus and a minus just to distinguish them sometimes you'll see the brackets sometimes you don't however disregard them - 4 + - 3 + - we said they don't like one another they have a fight so and always - we'll win so - 4 - 3 we start at minus 4 and we go back 3 1 2 3 1 - 4 1 2 3 so our answer negative 4 minus 3 is negative seven another one five plus negative six in brackets we said we disregard the bracket here we notice for a plus and a minus we know what do they do they have a fight and the minus wins so five take away six we start at five notice it's a positive five so we start at five in the positive side minus six one two three four five six at negative 
,,one so we go to the left because we're taking away and our answer is negative one five take away six is negative 1 then we have 7 plus negative seven again a plus and a minus next to each other they don't like one another they have a fight - will always win 7 take away 7 I mean it's too easy but we'll still use the number line we start at 7 minus 7 so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 obviously our answer is going to go and become nothing zero 7 take away 7 is zero so this is the basics of how to use a number 
,,line to add or subtract directed numbers we're going to do a couple more examples that way you get the hang of it and by now you should already have a very good understanding of how to solve these number sentences using the number line and hopefully you probably even now see the pattern where you don't even need the number line 
,,at all now that we know how to use a number line we can actually solve a little bit more harder questions let's see how they're done in this example we have negative 3 minus and in brackets negative 3 plus 5 we know that we have to use brackets of division multiplication addition and subtraction we still have to follow that order in all our number sentences now here we noticed we have brackets so we have to complete what's in the brackets first before we go outside in the brackets we have negative 3 plus five so using the rules negative three plus five where do we start we start at negative three we add five we're going to the right one two three four 
,,five our answer is two now negative three minus two we start at negative three and we - two one two so answer in full negative five minus three minus two is negative five we start from the brackets and we move on here we have nine plus in brackets negative two minus six closed bracket so we follow the order of operations which shows that we have to do the brackets first to do that negative six my or minus two minus six we start at negative 2 and we minus 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 so negative 8 then 9 plus negative 8 9 plus negative 8 we notice a plus and a minus next to each other and we know they don't like one another they have a fight - will always win so it's 
,,9 take away 8 9 take away 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and of course the insert is 198 now answer here is one one last example negative six plus in brackets 2 times 5 again order of operations States we have to complete the brackets first so 2 times 5 is 10 negative six plus 10 so we start at negative six we add 10 so we get to the right one two three four five six seven eight nine ten our answer is positive four or just four so here we've done three examples where we do need to use the order of operations but exactly if we follow the steps we follow the process we won't go wrong the more practice you do with the number line you get the hang of it and hopefully later on you won't even need the number line at all

Directed Numbers,sEU5uaf-Tu4,hello John Zimmerman from Taba class comm and what I want to do here in this video is just quickly go over the rules for positive and negative numbers many of you out there may know and maybe you've experienced yourself your solutions your math solutions you know becoming incorrect because you messed up on one of these integer rules one of these rules that involve positive and negative numbers it's just so easy too easy to confuse some of these rules but you absolutely have to learn these to really master you know middle school and high school mathematics let's just go through very quickly and we'll start with the easy stuff first I want to take a look at the multiplication rules okay so here anytime you're multiplying two numbers where the signs the signs are the same in other words a positive times a positive or negative times a negative okay the answer is always positive okay so two times positive two times positive eight positive 16 okay so once again negative two times negative eight the signs are the same I both negative positive answer positive 16 now in multiplication when you're multiplying two numbers and where one of the signs are opposite ie ones pause and ones negative here I have a positive times a negative doesn't make a difference it could be a negative times a positive the product the answer is going to be negative okay so that's multiplication right there and these are the multiplication rules now division is the same thing okay so multiplication and division pretty straightforward so 16 divided by 4 of course will be a positive 4 negative 16 divided by a negative 4 would be okay once again signs are the 
,,same so the answers gonna be positive that's a positive 4 and now here I have a negative 16 divided by a positive 4 right opposite signs so the answer ok is going to be negative negative 4 alright so this is the easy stuff now let's get to the more challenging or what seems to give students I think a little bit more problems understanding Nishal e is addition now I'm going to kind of change colors here I'm going to tell you if you know how to add positive negative numbers then you'll be able to subtract and you'll see what I'm talking about here in a second all right so eight plus two K two positives the signs are the same okay so you keep the sign obviously it's gonna be a positive ten right all of us probably knew that now let's take a look at this okay we have a negative eight plus a negative two the signs are 
,,the same so you're going to add these values right here and you're going to keep the same sign so this is going to be negative ten all right so right here when you're adding numbers with the same sign you could tell we're just adding adding the numbers and keeping the sign so no problem there here's where it gets a little interesting to think for students right here we have we're adding two numbers with different signs so we have a negative eight plus a two all right so let me ask you which number here don't look at the sign just look at the positive version of the number which one is larger okay the eight or the - all right well clearly this one would be large we call that the absolute value but I don't want I don't want to throw out too many technical terms here okay so between the eight and a two we said that eight is a larger number okay we think of it as a larger number that's positive version and you can tell they here that a has the negative sign so here's what you do 
,,anytime you have two different signs okay you're going to end up subtracting alright so let's actually do that now okay eight and two if I took the difference I'm going to get six right I just kind of forget about that negative sign for a second but now the sign that is associated with the answer is going to have or you're going to be associated with that largest number ie the eight okay so this is you be a negative six all right so it makes sense let's let's try another one here so we have eight plus and negative two okay the signs are different so when the signs are different you're going to end up subtracting okay so subtract just the whole version 
,,or the positive versions of these numbers okay eight and two so if I just told you to subtract them or find the difference you would say okay that's six now out of the eight and two which one has a larger sign or which one is the larger number the eight is a larger number and this eight right here is a positive eight so my answer is going to be a positive six okay all right so once again I'm just kind of quickly trying to refresh some of these rules and of course you know in a few minutes I would expect you to master all this stuff but hopefully this is making sense to most you out there all right so let's talk about subtraction okay here's a deal with subtraction I said if you know how to add you could subtract positive negative numbers so what we're going to do with subtraction problems is turn them into addition problems by doing something called plus negative so here I have 7 minus 10 what I want you to do is to take that subtraction sign and you're going to turn it into 
,,an addition sign and they're going to put that little negative sign and attack it on to the number to the right of that of that addition symbol okay so you see what 
,,I did there I said seven instead of 7 minus 10 I'm going 7 plus negative 10 and then now of course I'm going to go ahead and do this addition problem the signs are different so I'm going to subtract the numbers okay and then here 10 is the larger number and it has a negative sign so I'm going to go ahead and make that a negative 3 for my answer okay and by the way too what I'm trying to do is just give you kind of a procedural some rules here I'm trying to teach you all the concepts involved in integers which are very important by the way just trying to get you some simple rules so you don't mess this up when you're actually doing calculations okay let's take a look at this last one in here we have 3 minus a minus 6 so I'm going to go ahead and turn this into a positive or excuse me an addition problem and then I'm going to tack on out negative sign to the number to the right but now I have a negative of a negative 6 or the opposite of a negative 6 okay so if I told you what's the opposite of negative 6 you would say oh that's positive six this really turns into this problem three plus a positive six or three plus six and that is nine okay so pretty much a real fast review listen if you need a lot more information on this and other topics come on over to tablet class comm we have a 30 day free trial tons of stuff we have full courses the whole idea with our products it's clear and understandable we we really design our lessons to be explained and that's the key word explained not taught down too but explain in a way that you understand so hopefully and come over and check us out at Taba class comm take one hour 30 day free trials and learn and master this stuff so your headaches and mathematics go away good luck to yourself

Directed Numbers,NybHckSEQBI,"Hi! This is Rob. Welcome to Math Antics. In this lesson, we're going to learn some really important things about a whole branch of math called Algebra. The first thing you need to know is that Algebra is a lot like arithmetic. It follows all the rules of arithmetic and it uses the same four main operations that arithmetic is built on: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. But Algebra introduces a new element... the element of the unknown. When you were learning arithmetic, the only thing that was ever unknown was the answer to the problem. For example, you might have the problem 1 + 2 = what? The answer isn't known until you go ahead and "
,,"do the arithmetic. Now the important thing about Algebra is that when we don't know what a number is yet, we use a symbol in its place. that symbol is usually just any letter of the alphabet. A really popular letter to choose is the letter 'x'. So in arithmetic, we would just leave the problem like this: 1 + 2 = ""blank"" and we'd write in the answer when we did the addition. But in Algebra, we'd write it like this:  1 + 2 = x The 'x' is a place holder that stands for the number that we don't know yet. What we have here is a very basic algebraic equation. An equation is just a mathematical statement that two things are equal. An equation says, ""the things on this side of the equal sign have the same value as the things on the other side of the equal sign."" In this case, our equation is telling us that the known values on this side (1+2) are equal to what's on the other side, which happens to be the unknown value that we are calling 'x'. One of the main goals in Algebra is to figure out what the unknown values in equations are. And when you do that, it's called ""solving the equations"". In this equation, it's pretty easy to see that the unknown value is just 3. All you have to do is actually add the 1 and 2 together on this side of the equation and it turns into 3 = x, which is the same as x = 3. So now we know what 'x' is!  It's just 3. That almost seems too easy, doesn’t it? And that's why in Algebra, you are usually given an equation in a more complicated form like this: x - 2 = 1. This is exactly the same equation as 1 + 2 = x, but it has been rearranged so that it's not quite as easy to tell what 'x' is. So in Algebra, solving equations is a lot like a game where you are given mixed-up, complicated equations, and it's your job to simplify them and rearrange them until it is a nice simple equation (like x = 3) where it's easy to tell what the unknown values are. We're going to learn a lot more about how you actually do that (how you solve equations) in the next several videos, but for now, let's learn some important rules about how symbols can and can't be used in algebraic equations. The first rule you need to know is that the same symbol (or letter) can be used in different algebra problems to stand for different unknown values. For example, in the problem we just solved, the letter 'x' was used to stand for the number 3, right? But 'x' could stand for a different number in a different problem. Like, if someone asks us to solve the equation, 5 + x = 10. In order for the two sides of this equation to be equal, 'x' must have the value '5' in this problem, because 5 + 5 = 10. So 'x' (or any other symbol) can stand for different values in different problems. That's okay, but what's NOT okay is for a symbol to stand for different values in the same problem at the same time! For example, what if you had the equation: x + x = 10? This equation says that if we add 'x' to 'x' we will get 10. And there are a lot of different numbers we could add together to get 10, like 6 and 4. But, if we had the first 'x' stand for 6 and the second 'x' stand for 4, then 'x' would stand for two different value at the same time and things could get really confusing! If you wanted symbols to stand for two different numbers at the same time, you would need to use two different symbols, like 'x' and 'y'. So in Algebra, whenever you see the same symbol repeated more than once in an equation, it's representing the same unknown value. Like if you see a really complicated Algebraic equation (like this), where 'x' is repeated a lot of different times, all of those 'x's stand for the same value, and it will be your job to figure out what that value is. Okay, so for any particular equation, we can't use the same letter to represent two different numbers at the same time, but what about the other way around? Could we use two different letters to represent the same number? Yes! - Here's an example of that. Let's say you have the equation: a + b = 2 What could 'a' and 'b' stand for so that the equation is true? Well, If 'a' was 0 and 'b' was 2, then the equation would be true. Or, we could switch them around. If 'a' was 2 and 'b' was 0, the equation would also be true. But there's another possibility: If 'a' was 1 and 'b' was also 1, that would make the equation true, right? So, even though 'a' and 'b' are different symbols, and would usually be used to represent different numbers, there are times when they might happen to represent the same number. Oh, and this problem can help us understand something very important about how symbols are used in Algebra. Did you notice that there were different possible solution for this equation? In other words, 'b' could have the value 0, 1, or 2 depending on what the value of 'a' was. If 'a' is 0 then 'b' must be 2 If 'a' is 1 then 'b' must be 1 If 'a' is 2 then 'b' must be 0 'b' can't have two different values at the same time, but it's value can change over time if the value of 'a' changes. In Algebra, 'b' is what's called a ""variable"" because it's value can 'vary' or change. In fact, in this equation, both 'a' and 'b' are variables because their values will change depending on the value of each other. Actually, it's really common in Algebra to refer to any letter as a variable, "
,,"since letters can stand for different values in different problems. But at Math Antics, we'll usually just use the word ""variable"" when we're talking about values that can change or vary in the same problem. Alright, so far we've learned that Algebra is a lot like arithmetic, but that in includes unknown values and variables that we can solve for in equations. There's one other really important thing that I want to teach you that will help you understand what's going on in a lot of Algebra "
,,"problems, and it has to do with multiplication. Here are the four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Although in Algebra, you'll usually see division written in fraction form, like this. In Arithmetic, all four operations have the same status, but in Algebra, multiplication get's some special treatment. In Algebra, multiplication is the 'default' operation. That means, if no other arithmetic operation is shown between two symbols, then you can just assume they're being multiplied. The multiplication is 'implied'. For example, instead of writing 'a' times 'b', you can leave out the times symbol and just write 'ab'. Since no operation is shown between these two symbols, you know that you're supposed to multiply 'a' and 'b'. Of course, you can't actually multiply 'a' and "
,,"'b' until you figure out what numbers they stand for. The advantage of this rule about multiplication is that it makes many algebraic equations less cluttered and easier to write down. For example, instead of this: a * b + c * d = 10 You could just write: ab + cd = 10. You can also use this shorthand when you are multiplying a variable and a known number... like 2x, which means the same thing as 2 times 'x' or 3y which means the same thing as 3 times 'y' Since the symbol and the number are "
,,"right next to each other, the multiplication is implied. You don't have to write it down. Finally some good news! Now I never have to write down that pesky multiplication symbol again! Oh yeah!! Ah, not so fast... there are some cases in Algebra where still need to use a multiplication symbol. For example, what if you want to show 2 x 5? If you just get rid of the times symbol and put the '2' right next to the '5', it's going to look like the two-digit number twenty-five, which is NOT the same as 2 x 5. So, whenever you need to show multiplication between two known numbers, you still have to use the times symbol, unless... you use parentheses instead. "
,,"But aren't parentheses used to show grouping in math? How can you use that to show multiplication? Ah, that's a good question. Parentheses are used to group things, "
,,"but whenever you put two groups right next to each other, with no operation between them, guess what operation is implied. Yep!  Multiplication! For example, if you "
,,"see the this, it means that the group (a+b) is being multiplied by the group (x+y). We could put a times symbol between the groups, but we don't have to because it's the default operation in Algebra. The multiplication is just implied. So, going back to our problem: 2 x 5 If you wanted to, you could put each of the numbers inside parentheses like this, and then you could get rid of the multiplication sign. Now this can't be confused with the number twenty-five, and since the groups are right next to each other, you know that you need to multiply them. Of course, it might seem strange to have just one thing inside 'group' symbols like this, but it's okay to do that in math. An alternate way that you could do the same thing would be to put just one of the numbers in parentheses, like this. Again, you won't confuse this with a two-digit number and you know that multiplication is implied. Okay, so we've learned that Algebra is a lot like arithmetic, but it involves unknown values or variables that we need to solve for. And we learned that in Algebra, the multiplication sign is usually not shown, because it's the default operation. You can just assume that two things right next to each other are being multiplied. But why do we even care about Algebra? Is it good for anything in the 'real world'? or is it just a bunch of tricky problems that keep students busy in school? Actually, Algebra is very useful for describing or ""modeling""  things in the real world. It's a little hard to see that when you are just looking at all these numbers and symbols on the page of a math book. But, it's a lot easier to see when you start taking algebraic equations and graphing their solutions. Graphing an equation is like using its different solutions to draw simple lines and curves that can be used to describe and predict things in real life. For example, there's a whole class of equations in Algebra called ""linear"" equations because they form straight lines when you graph them. Those sorts of equations could help you describe the slope of a roof or tell you how long it will take to get somewhere. Another class of algebraic equations, called ""quadratic"" equations can be used to design telescope lenses, or describe how a ball flies through the air, or predict the growth of a population. So Algebra is used all the time in fields like science, engineering, economics and computer programming. And even though you might not need Algebra to get by in your day to "
,,"day life,... ...so divide both sides by 3. That means x = 42. So... in three... two... one... YES!! Alright... now to see how much butter I need. It's still a very useful part of math. Thanks for watching Math Antics,"

Directed Numbers,OAoLCXpao6s,"Hi, welcome to Math Antics.  In this lesson, we’re gonna learn about negative numbers. Negative numbers can be a little confusing at first, so don’t get discouraged "
,,"if it takes you a while to get it. To learn what negative numbers are, we first need to start with ‘whole numbers’. You remember what whole numbers are, right? They’re the set of numbers on the number line, starting with zero, and then counting up one at a time: 1, 2, 3, 4… all the way to infinity. That’s a LOT of numbers, but it’s only half the story! And that’s because the number line really goes in BOTH directions. You’re used to seeing the number line starting at zero and just going to "
,,"the right, but the number line also goes to the left. And what numbers are on that part of the number line? Yep… you guessed it… negative numbers. The negative numbers are just like a mirror image of the numbers on the right side of the number line that we call the positive numbers. And zero is the special number that separates "
,,"the positive numbers from the negative numbers. By the way, when you combine all these numbers (1 ,2, 3, and so on up to infinity, and -1, -2, -3, and so on down to "
,,"negative infinity, and the number zero) that entire set of numbers gets a special name in math.  They’re called ‘the Integers’. As you can see, the negative numbers "
,,"look just like the positive numbers. The only difference is that they have a ‘negative sign’ in front of them. The negative sign looks just like the minus sign. In fact, if we wanted to, we could write a positive sign (a plus) in front of all the positive numbers. But to save time, we just assume that if a number doesn’t have any sign in front of it, then it’s positive. Positive is the ‘default’ sign. Okay, now that you know what negative numbers are, we need to learn how to compare them to other integers. Remember that in math, comparing just means saying which of two numbers is bigger or smaller than the other, or saying that they’re equal. And to do that, we use the greater than, less than, or equal signs. You’re probably already pretty good at comparing positive integers. Like if I ask, “Which is bigger: 2 or "
,,"3 ?”  You know that 3 is bigger than 2. But what if I asked you to compare two negative integers?  “Which is bigger: -2 or -3 ?” Ah, this is where negative numbers can be a little tricky, especially if this is your first time learning about them. That’s because you’re SO used to 3 being bigger than 2 that when you see -2 and -3, it’s really tempting to think that -3 must be bigger than -2, but it’s NOT! Negative 3 is actually smaller (or less) than negative 2. And to help you understand why, let’s look at our number line again. Have you noticed that if you start at zero on the number line and then you move to the right, the numbers keep getting bigger "
,,"and bigger as you go along. 1 is greater than 0, 2 is greater than 1, and 3 is greater than 2, and so on… But what if we go in the opposite direction instead; to the left? As we go to the left, the numbers get smaller and smaller. 2 is less than 3, 1 is less than 2, and 0 is less than 1. Well, those same exact rules apply to negative side of the number line also. The numbers get bigger as you go to the right and they get smaller as you go to the left. So, since -3 is on the left side of -2, it’s actually smaller than -2. I like to think of it like this… On the positive side of the number line, 3 is more positive than 2 (so it’s bigger). But on the negative side of the number line, -3 is more negative than -2 (so it’s smaller). And you can use that idea no matter what the numbers are. On the positive side, 500 is more positive than 200 (so it’s bigger) but on the negative side, -500 is more negative than -200 (so it’s smaller) Keep that in mind if anyone every offers to give you negative 500 dollars. The ‘500’ part sounds pretty good, but the negative part… not so much! Alright, so the positive integers are on the right side of zero on the number line, which means they’re all greater than zero. And the negative integers are all on the left side of zero on the number line, which means they’re all less than zero. Wait… Hold on a second… “Less than zero!?” How… How can ANY number be less than zero? I mean… Doesn’t zero mean ‘nothing’? Ah, that’s a good question. At first, it can be hard to see how there could be numbers that are less than zero, but here’s an example that will help you understand. Let’s say we want to use integers to measure how many meter above sea level small islands are. This island is 10 meters above sea level. This island is only 5 meters above sea level. And this island here happens to be exactly the same height as sea level. So we can use the integer zero to show how it’s height compares to sea level. But what about this island? It’s not even above sea level at all. It’s 5 meters below the surface. But our measurement is supposed to tell us how many meters ABOVE sea level it is. Fortunately, with negative numbers, that’s no problem. We can just say that its height (compared to sea level) is negative 5 meters. Or, what about an example with money?… Suppose there’s three brothers who each have a different amount of money. The first brother has $20, the next brother has $0, and the last brother actually OWES his dad $20. What number do we use to represent how much money he has? Yep… negative 20 dollars! And temperature is another great example. We use zero degrees Celsius to describe the temperature for water to freeze, but it can be warmer or colder than that. The temperature could be negative; like negative 20 degrees! So negative numbers are very useful in the real world to help describe things that can be above OR below zero. Okay, now that you know how negative numbers work, let’s see how we can "
,,"compare any two integers. If we don’t include zero for a moment, basically there’s just three situations. You’ll either need to compare two positive integers, or two negative integers, or one positive and one negative integer. And you already know how to compare two positive integers. The further right on the number line you go, the bigger the numbers get. 7 is greater than 4, 50 is greater than 20, and 1,000 is greater than 100. It’s also really easy to compare a positive integer and a negative integer, because a positive number is ALWAYS bigger than a negative number. ALL of the positive numbers are on the right side of the number line and ALL the negative numbers on the left. So -5 is less than 5 and -40 is less than 3 and -100 is less than 1 The only tricky situation is when you have to compare two negative integers. Then you have to think about which one is further to the left on the number line. Again, a great way to do that is to identify the number that would normal be more positive on the positive side of the number line and realize that it’s more negative on the negative side. -8 is more negative than -4, so it’s smaller. -15 is more negative than -10, so it’s smaller. and -100 is more negative than -25, so it’s smaller. Alright, so in this video we learned what negative numbers are and how they can be used to describe things in the real world. They’re just like positive numbers, but on the other side of zero on the number line. And we leaned that the whole numbers, along with their negative counterparts, form the set of numbers we call integers. We also learned how to compare integers. As you go to the right on "
,,"the number line, the integers get bigger, and as you go left, they get smaller. Comparing integers can be confusing at first, so be sure to practice until you’ve really got it. As always, thanks for watching Math Antics and I’ll see ya next time. Learn more at www.mathantics.com"

Directed Numbers,_BgblvF90UE,"Hi, welcome to Math Antics. In our last video, we learned what negative numbers are, and we learned that they're part of a special set of numbers called ‘integers’. "
,,"Next, we need to learn how to do arithmetic with those integers. In this video, we’re gonna learn how to add and subtract integers. In the next video we’ll learn how to multiply and divide integers. Adding and subtracting whole numbers is pretty easy because there’s really only two possibilities: you’re either adding two positive numbers, or subtracting two positive numbers. But adding and subtracting integers is more complicated, because with negative numbers in the mix, there’s a lot more possibilities. Fortunately, you don’t need to memorize all these possibilities. Instead, we’re gonna learn some simple rules and strategies that will make the process a lot easier . Let’s start by learning two key rules that are really helpful to know when working with negative numbers. The first rule is this:  Adding a negative is the same as subtracting a positive. To visualize what that means, suppose I give you positive two cupcakes, You’d be pretty happy, right? But what if I ‘give’ you negative two cupcakes instead? That’s the same as taking two cupcakes away from you. Would you still be happy? When it comes to math, this rule means that if you "
,,"have a problem like this: 5 + -1 (where you’re adding a negative number), you can just change it to subtraction. Instead of 5 + -1, you can just write 5 ? 1. They’re different ways of writing the same thing. Okay, so rule #1 is:  Adding a negative is the same as subtracting a positive. Now what about rule number #2? Well the second rule is this:  Subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive. Let’s say you have negative two cupcakes.  Like if you have a debt… you OWE me two cupcakes. You wouldn’t be too happy having that negative, would you? But, what if I subtract that negative from you? Taking away the negative two made you more positive, right? Subtracting the negative gives you less debt! When it comes to math, this rule means that if you have a problem like 5 ? (-1), where you’re subtracting a negative number, you can just change it to addition. Instead of 5 ? (-1), you can just write 5 + 1, and that’s a problem you already know how to solve. Alright, now that "
,,"you know our two rules, I want to show you that there’s really only four different types of problems (or 4 cases) when adding or subtracting integers. In case 1, you start with a positive number and you make it more positive. In case 2, you start with a positive number and you make it more negative. In case 3, you start with a negative number and you make it more negative. And in case 4, you start with a negative number and you make it more positive. The key to getting the right answer to the problem is to figure out which of these cases you’re dealing with, so let’s look at each case in more detail. In case 1, you start with a positive number and you "
,,"make it more positive. The good news is that you already know how to do that!  That’s just what regular addition is. For example, when you have the problem 7 + 3, you’re starting with a positive 7 and you’re making it more positive by adding positive 3 to it, to get the answer of positive 10. But, what if instead of 7 + 3, you're given the problem 7 ? (-3)?  That seems a lot harder, right? Well, if you remember rule #2, it’s not harder at all. In fact, it’s exactly the same problem because "
,,"rule #2 says subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive. We can change the “minus minus 3” into “plus 3” and we get the same answer: positive 10. So case 1 is just addition like you’re used to doing, but now that we have negative numbers, there’s a new way that it could be written that you need to be on the lookout "
,,"for. Oh, and in this case (starting with a positive and making it more positive), you know your answer will always be positive because you stay on that side of the number line. In case 2, you start with a positive number, but you make it more negative. That is, you do something to it that makes its value smaller (or moves it to "
,,"the left on the number line). But that’s just like regular subtraction like you already know how to do. For example, here we have the problem 8 ? 5. We start with a "
,,positive 8 but we make it more negative by subtracting 5 from it. Subtracting 5 moves it to the left on the number line down to 3 as our answer. Our answer is still 
,,"a positive number, but it’s less positive than it was before. And that raises an interesting question: What if we subtract even more, to move it further in the negative direction? Like, what if we subtract 8 instead of 5?  That would take us all the way back down to zero on the number line. And before you knew about negative numbers, back when you thought the number line just stopped at zero, you probably thought that’s all we could take away.  But watch this… Let’s start with positive 8 but then subtract 10 from it!  Can we do that? Can we subtract a bigger number from a smaller one? Now we can!  It just means that the answer we get will be a negative number. Starting with positive 8 and subtracting 10 takes us past zero, and down to negative 2 on the number line. So our answer is negative 2. As you can see, case 2 is a little more complicated, because the answer can be positive, negative or even zero, depending on the numbers you’re subtracting. And it’s even more complicated than that because there’s also another way this type of problem can be written, thanks to rule #1. Rule #1 says that adding a negative is really the same as subtracting a positive. And that means our original subtraction problem (8 ? 5) could have been written like this instead (8 + -5). But either way it’s written, you’re starting with a positive and making it more negative. Now on to case 3…  In case 3 you start with a negative number and you make it more negative. That’s really just the opposite of case 1 where we started on the positive side of the number line and made it more positive. For example, let’s say that you’re given the problem: -7 + "
,,"-3. That means that you start with negative 7 and then you make it even more negative by adding negative 3 which gives you negative 10 as the answer. And as you might have guessed by now, thanks to our rules, there’s another way we could write this type of problem. Because of rule #1, we know that adding a negative 3 is the same as subtracting 3. So this problem could also be written like this: -7 ? 3. But either way it’s written, in this case you’re starting with a negative number and making it even more negative. And because of that, you know that your answer will always be negative for case 3 since you stay on the negative side of the number line. And finally, in case 4, you also start with a negative number, but this time you’re gonna make it more positive. Here’s an example of a problem like that: -8 + 5. This problem starts with negative 8 but then we add positive 5 which makes it more positive, or moves us to the right on the number line, up to -3 which is our answer. "
,,"Our answer is still negative, but it’s less negative than what we started with. Ah, but this looks similar to case 2, right? Imagine what would happen if you made it even more positive. You could add 8 (instead of 5) and that would move you all the way up to zero. And if you added even more, like -8 + 10, that would take you to "
,,"the positive side of the number line and give you the answer of positive 2. So just like in case 2, the answer here can be positive, negative or even zero depending "
,,"on the numbers you‘re adding. And, just like before, there’s another way this type of problem can be written. Remember rule #2? …that subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive. Because of that rule, -8 + 5 could also be written as -8 ? (-5). That’s a LOT of negatives, but thanks to rule #2, we can write our “minus "
,,"minus” as a “plus”. But either way it’s written, in this case, we start negative and move in the positive direction. Okay, now that we’ve learned our two rules and we’ve seen that there’s really just four types of problems (or 4 different cases) that you’ll need to solve, I want to give you a basic strategy that will help when you’re adding or subtracting integers. This strategy involves asking 3 simple questions: The first question is, “Am I starting with a positive or a negative number?” "
,,"This question is easy to answer because all you have to do is look at the sign in front of the first number of the problem. If there’s no sign, then you’re starting "
,,"with a positive number. But if there’s a minus sign, then you’re starting with a negative number. Once you know what you’re starting with, the next question to ask is, “Am I making it bigger or smaller?” In other words, is what you’re adding or subtracting going to make the value move in the positive direction of the number line or the negative direction? If you’re subtracting a positive or adding a negative (Rule #1) then you're making the value smaller, which is moving to the left on the "
,,"number line. If you’re adding a positive or subtracting a negative (Rule #2) then you're making the value bigger, which is moving to the right on the number line. And the last question that you need to ask is, “Will my answer be positive, negative, or zero?” The answer to this will depend on which case you have and what values you’re working with. If it’s a case 1 problem, you know the answer will always be positive, and if it’s a case 3 problem, then you know the answer will always be negative. But you’ll remember that in cases 2 and 4, the answer could change between positive, negative or zero depending on the difference between the two numbers that "
,,"you’re working with. So asking these three questions will help you visualize what’s happening in the problem that you’re trying to solve, and it’ll help you get the "
,,right answer. But the most important thing that you can do to get good at integer arithmetic is to practice. It’s important that you try a lot of problems that you have an answer key for so that you know if you’re doing it right. And don’t get discouraged if it’s confusing at first.  You’ll get it if you practice! And you might

Directed Numbers,RQ2nYUBVvqI,"Hi!  Welcome to Math Antics. In this lesson, we’re gonna learn about ratios.  Well…what in the world is a ratio? Well, let’s look it up in a math book to find out. It says here that a ratio is a “comparison of two numbers by division”. Well that’s true, but it’s also a little confusing. It’s confusing because most of us think of comparing numbers as trying to decide if a number is greater that, less than, or equal to another number. But with ratios, we’re not trying to compare numbers like "
,,"that. Instead, we’re really trying to see how two numbers relate to each other, and so at Math Antics, we like to think of ratios as a “relationship between two numbers by division”. Okay, but how do you compare (or show how two numbers are related) by division? Well, To see what the “by division” part really means, let’s look at an example of a ratio. Uh, excuse me… That’s not a ratio.  That’s a fraction. Oh, it’s a ratio alright. Mathematically, ratios and fractions are basically the same thing. It’s just that when we use a fraction in a particular way, we call it a ratio. Well sure, everybody knows that! Well like I was saying… Ratios are basically "
,,"just like fractions. The difference is how we use them to describe things in the real world. To see what I mean, let’s look at examples of how we could use the fraction 1 over 2 and the ratio 1 over 2. Mathematically, these are both the same thing. They’re just the division problem: 1 divided by 2. But in the case of the fraction, we usually treat it as if it’s just a single number. For example, at lunch time, you might eat 1 sandwich. Or if you’re really hungry, you might eat 2 sandwiches. But, if your not very hungry, you might just have 1/2 sandwich. We can use the fraction 1/2 just like we use 1 or 2 to show how many sandwiches you eat. It’s just that in the case of 1/2 we know that it’s only part of a sandwich; just a fraction of one. Now let’s see how we can use the ratio 1 over 2. With a ratio, we don’t treat it as if it’s just a single number. Instead, we pay close attention to the top and bottom numbers because we use them to refer to different things. For example, let’s say we’re planning to go on a picnic. And for every two people that are going on the picnic, we’re only bringing 1 sandwich. In that case, we'd say that the ratio of sandwiches to people is 1 to 2, or 1 sandwich per 2 people. Do you see the difference between our fraction and our ratio? The math part of each of them is the "
,,"same. But, with the fraction, both the top and bottom numbers are referring to the same thing; the sandwich. However, with the ratio, the top and bottom numbers are "
,,"referring to different things: sandwiches and people. The fraction shows a part of something, but the ratio shows a relationship (or a comparison) between two different things. And you can see that they’re the same mathematically because if you did have the ratio of 1 sandwich per every 2 people on a picnic, guess how much of a "
,,"sandwich each person would get? Yep… half a sandwich. Alright, so now you know that fractions and ratios are basically the same thing. But, since they’re used differently in math, sometimes they're also shown differently. Once in a while, instead of seeing the standard division form, a ratio might be represented with this symbol. ( : ) When you see a ratio written this way, it just means “1 to 2” or “1 per 2”. For example, in this picture, you could say the ratio of dogs to cats is 3 to 2, "
,,"(3 dogs to 2 cats). And you could also write it in the standard division form: 3 dogs over 2 cats. They’re just different ways to write the same ratio. Ratios are used all the time to represent all sorts of things in real-world situations, so let’s see a few more examples to help you really understand what ratios are. Have you ever wanted to compare apples to oranges, but someone told you you couldn’t? Well you can with a ratio!  Let’s say a fruit stand sells 5 apples for ever 3 oranges they sell. The ratio of apples to oranges would be 5 to 3. Or, have you ever helped someone bake cookies? The recipe might tell you that for every 2 cups of flour, you "
,,"need 1 cup of sugar. That means that the ratio of flour to sugar is 2 to 1. Or, what about your TV screen or your computer monitor. Have you ever hear someone say that the size (or aspect ratio) is 16 to 9? 16 to 9 is the ratio of the screen’s width to its height. So if the screen is 16 inches wide, then its height would be 9 inches tall. Ah, here’s another good ratio that you might use in your car:  40 miles per hour. Ah ha!  Didn’t you said that a ratio was a relationship between TWO numbers? But 40 miles per hour is just one number! …looks like someone’s got some explainin’ to do. Actually, there ARE two numbers. Do you remember how any number can be written like a fraction just by writing ‘1’ as the bottom number? Well, 40 miles per hour is the ratio, 40 miles per ONE hour. Well I guess you have an answer for "
,,"everything, don’t you? 40 miles per 1 hour is a type of ratio that we call a rate. A rate is just a ratio that usually involves a period of time. Here are some common examples of rates: 10 meters per second $12 per hour 3 meals per day 50 games per year Notice that the bottom numbers in each of these ratios relate to a period of time. …seconds, hours, days, years.  And that’s why we call them a rate. Alright, so that’s simple enough. But you might be wondering, why are the bottom numbers of all these rates 1? Couldn’t you have a rate like, 90 meters per 9 seconds, or $60 per 5 hours? We sure could, but most of the time when we have rates like that, we "
,,"want to convert them into an equivalent rate that has 1 as the bottom number. That’s because whenever the bottom number represents only one unit of time (like one hour or one day) it makes comparing different rates much easier. For example, imagine two cars driving at two different rates. The first car’s rate is 120 miles per 3 "
,,"hours and the second car’s rate is 150 miles per 5 hours. Which car is going faster? Well, it’s not all that easy to tell when the rates have different bottom numbers. Fortunately, it’s really easy to change a rate so that it has 1 as the bottom number. All you have to do is divide the top number by the bottom number. The answer you get is the top number of the new (equivalent) rate, and the bottom number is just 1. Rates like this are called “unit rate” because “unit” means “one”. Alright, let’s convert the rates of speed for our two cars into unit rates so that we can compare them easily. The first car’s rate was 120 miles per 3 hours. So if we take "
,,"120 and divide it by 3, we get 40. That means that the unit rate for the first car is 40 miles per hour. The second car’s rate was 150 miles per 5 hours. So if we divide 150 by 5, we get 30. So the unit rate for the second car is 30 miles per hour. And now, you can easily tell that the first car is going faster. And you can tell why unit rates are so helpful. Okay, so that’s it for this lesson. We’ve learned that a ratio is basically just like a fraction. But instead of showing what part of something you have, it shows the relationship between two different things. We also learned that when one of those two things is time, we call the ratio a rate. And last of all, we learned how to convert a rate into a unit rate for easy comparison. As always, thanks for watching Math Antics and I’ll see ya next time. Learn more at www.mathantics.com"

Directed Numbers,LDIiYKYvvdA,"Hi, I’m Rob. Welcome to Math Antics. In the last two Algebra videos, we learned how to solve simple equations that had only one arithmetic operation in them. But often, equations have many different operations which makes solving them a little more complicated. In this video, we’re going to learn how to solve equations that have just two math operations in them. …one addition or subtraction operation, and one multiplication or division operation. And the concepts you learn in this video will help you solve even more complicated equations in the future. Now as you might expect, equations that have two arithmetic operations in them are going to require two different steps to solve them. In other words, to get the unknown all by itself, you’ll need to ‘undo’ two operations. But that doesn’t sound too hard, right? I mean… we learned how to do undo any arithmetic operation in the last two videos. And that’s true.  But there are a couple of reason that make two-step equations a little trickier to solve. The first is that there are a lot more possible combinations of those two operations. And the second is that, when there’s more than one operation, you have to decide what order to undo those operations in. Uh…hello! If you need to know what order to do operations in, just follow the Order of Operations rules! You DID watch that video, didn’t you? I sure did! But the Order of Operations rules tell us what order to DO operations… not what order to UNDO them! Uh…Well…then… could we REVERSE the order since we’re UN-doing operations? Now that’s a good idea. Well of course it is! When solving multi-step equations, that’s basically what we’re going to do. Using the Order of Operations rules in reverse can help us know what order to undo operations in, but it can be a little tricky actually putting it into practice. So… to see how it works, let’s start by solving a very simple two-step equation:  2x + 2 = 8. In this equation, the unknown value ‘x’ is involved "
,,"in two different operations… addition and multiplication (which is implied between the first 2 and the ‘x’) And to undo those two operations, we need to use their inverse operations …subtraction and division. But the question is, which one should we do first? Like many things in life, the order we decide to do things in can make a big difference. Ah, come on! There’s gotta be an easier way! [voice from off screen] “First socks, then shoes.” Fortunately, in math, we have a special set of rules that tell us what order to do operations in. Those rules tell us to do operations inside parentheses (or other groups) first. And then we do exponent, and then multiplication and division, and last of all, we do addition and subtraction. Those are the rules you need to follow when simplifying mathematical expressions or equations. But solving an equation is different because we are trying to UNDO any operations that the unknown value is involved with so that the unknown value will be all by itself. So when solving equations, the best strategy is to apply those Order of Operations rules in reverse. Using the reverse Order of Operations is not the only way to solve a multi-step equation, but it’s usually the easiest way. Just like it’s much easier to take your shoes and socks off in the reverse order that you put them on! Ahhhhh!  Are you sure it’s socks before shoes? Since the Order of Operations rules tell us to DO multiplication before we DO addition. We should UNDO addition before we UNDO multiplication. So first, we undo the addition by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation. On the first side, the ‘plus 2’ and the ‘minus 2’ cancel each other out, leaving just ‘2x’ on that side. And on the other side we have 8 minus 2 which is 6. Next, we can undo the multiplication by dividing both sides of the equation by 2. On the first side, the ‘2’s cancel, leaving ‘x’ all by itself. And on the other side, we have 6 divided by 2 which is just 3. There… we’ve solved the equation using the Order of Operations rules in reverse, and now we know that x = 3. That wasn’t so bad, was it? Let’s try solving another simple two-step "
,,"equation that has division and subtraction in it: x/2 - 1 = 4. Again, we’re going to apply the Order of Operations rules in reverse to undo the subtraction and the division operations. Since we would normally DO the subtraction last, we’re going to UNDO it first. To undo the subtraction, we add '1' to both sides of the equation. On the first side, the ‘minus 1’ and the ‘plus 1’ cancel out, leaving just ‘x’ over 2 on that side. And on the other side, we have 4 plus 1 which is 5. And then, to undo the “divided by 2”, we need to multiply both sides by 2. On the first side, the ‘2’s cancel, leaving ‘x’ all by itself. And on the other side, we have 2 times "
,,"5 which is 10. So our answer is x = 10. Those examples are pretty easy, right? But solving two-step equations gets a bit trickier thanks to a little something in math called “groups”. Do you remember how parentheses are used to group things in math? And our Order of Operations rules say we are supposed to do any operations that "
,,"are inside parentheses first. In other words, we need to do operations that are inside of groups first. Well guess what? That means that when we’re solving equations and UN-doing operations, we need to wait to do groups LAST of all. To see what I mean, let’s solve this equation, which looks very similar to the first one we solved. The only difference is that a set of parentheses has been used to group this x + 2 together. And even though that might not seem like much of a change, it makes a big difference for our answer. That’s because, in the original equation, this first 2 is only being multiplied by the ‘x’, but in the new equation, it’s being multiplied by the entire quantity (or group) x + 2. And that’s going to change how we solve it. We’re still going to follow our Order of Operations rules in reverse, but "
,,"now that the x + 2 is inside parentheses (which means that it’s part of a group), we’re going to undo THAT operation last. Since we are supposed to DO operations in "
,,"groups first, that means we’re going to UNDO operations in groups last. So in this problem, we should start by undoing the multiplication that's implied between the "
,,"2 and the group (x + 2) To do that, we divide both sides of the equation by 2. On the first side, the 2 on the top and the 2 on the bottom cancel, leaving the group "
,,"(x + 2) on that side. And on the other side, we have 8 divided by 2 which is 4. That looks simpler already!  And we can make it even simpler than that, because now that there’s nothing else on that side of the equal sign with the group (x + 2) we really don’t even need the parentheses any more. Next, we just need to subtract 2 from both sides. On the first side, the ‘plus 2’ and the ‘minus 2’ cancel out, leaving ‘x’ all by itself, and on the other side we have 4 minus 2, which is 2. So for "
,,"this equation, x = 2. And now you can see how grouping operations differently in our equation results in different answers. Let’s try one more important example. Do "
,,"you remember the second equation we solved?  x/2 - 1 = 4 In this equation, the 1 is being subtracted from the entire ‘x over 2’ term. But take a look at this slightly different equation. This looks a lot like the original equation, but now that the '1' is up on top of the fraction line, it’s only being subtracted from the ‘x’ and NOT the 2. The ‘x - 1’ on top forms a group. Hold on!  How can the ‘x - 1’ be a group? I don’t see any parentheses or brackets around it. Ah, that’s a good question! In Algebra, the fraction line is used as a way to automatically group things that are above it or things that are below it. For example, in this fancy algebraic expression, everything that’s on top of the fraction line forms a group and everything on the bottom of the line forms another group. Of course, we could put parentheses there if we wanted to make it really clear, but it’s not required. Grouping above and below a fraction line is just ‘implied’ in Algebra. Getting back to our new problem, now that we know that the ‘x - 1’ on the top of the fraction line is an implied group, as we learned in the last example, we’re going to wait and undo the "
,,"operation inside that group last. So the first step is to undo the ‘divided by 2’ by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2. On the first side, the 2 on top and the 2 on the bottom will cancel out, leaving just our implied group ‘x - 1’ on that side. And on the other side, we have 4 times 2 which is 8. Next, we can undo the operation inside the group by adding '1' to both sides. On the first side, the ‘minus 1’ and the ‘plus 1’ cancel, leaving ‘x’ all by itself. And on the other side, "
,,"we have 8 plus 1 which is 9.  So in this equation, x = 9. Alright…  As you can see, solving two-step equations is definitely more complicated than single step equations because there are so many different combinations and different ways to group things. But if you just take things one step at a time and remember to UNDO operations using the REVERSE Order of Operations rules, it will be much easier. Just pay close attention to how things are grouped in an equation and be on the lookout for  "
,,"those ‘implied’ groups on the top and bottom of a fraction line. And, because there are so many variations of these two-step equations, it’s really important to practice by trying to solve lots of different problems.

Directed Numbers,jDSDvrO52Fc,addition and subtraction of directed numbers that is the addition and subtraction of positive numbers and negative numbers when adding directed numbers we usually simplify by removing the brackets by omitting the plus sign when it means odd we also omit the plus sign on the first number when it is positive thus positive tree added the positive 7 is written as 3 plus 7 here we omit the plus sign that means add and you met the plus sign because the first number is positive similarly negative 
,,tree added the negative 7 is return negative tree added the negative 7 so we omit plus sign similarly negative tree added the positive 7 is written this way negative tree added the positive 7 with the plus sign being omitted when it means addition and positive tree added the negative 7 is written this way the rule for subtraction subtraction of a directed number is e Seema's addition of that number with its sign change so positive tree subtract positive 7 is equal to positive tree added two changes sign + 7 negative 7 similarly negative tree subtract negative 7 the same as negative tree added to each in descending 7 positive 7 negative 3 subtract positive 7 the same as negative tree added the negative 7 and positive tree subtract negative 7 is e Seema's positive tree added to change the sign positive 7 so no to the actual addition if we have two positive numbers or two negative numbers we are the numbers and keep the sign so here we have positive tree added to positive 7 the 
,,two signs are the same so we add three to seven they got ten and we keep the sign wood signs are positive so we get positive ten similarly we have negative three being added to negative seven both signs are the same so we add the numbers three plus seven is equal to ten and we'll keep his sign negative ten conversely if one number is negative and one positive we subtract the smaller from the bigger number and we take the sign of the larger number so we have here positive tree added to negative seven we have a positive sentiment have a negative sign so the pod signs are different you're gonna subtract the smaller from the bigger seven subtract three is 
,,equal to four and the bigger number seven has a negative sign so the answer of a negative sign so it's negative for second example we have negative tree been added to positive seven of negative and positive de pute signs are different so we subtract seven subtract three is equal to four we keep the sign of the larger number in this case a larger number is positive so the answer is positive four and that's it for this video I am mr.

Directed Numbers,jVvvUiExjes,in this video we're going to focus on adding and subtracting integers but in the first half we're just going to focus on adding integers let's start with something simple what is 3 plus 5 intuitively you know what the answer is but let's say if you didn't know what to do here's what you can do you can use a number line to help you add and subtract numbers so let's say this is 0 and we're going to start with 3 so start with the first number anytime you need to add travel on the right using the number line if you need to subtract then move towards the left so we wish to add 5 to 3 so we have to travel 5 spaces to the right 1 2 3 4 5 this is 4 5 6 7 8 that's where we ended up so three plus five is eight let's work on another example 4 plus 3 so if we start with 4 and if we travel three spaces to the right this is going to be 5 6 7 so therefore 4 plus 3 is equal to 7 and so using a number line is very helpful you will never need to add or subtract two integers is another example 
,,what is 8 plus negative 5 by the way 8 plus negative 5 is equivalent to 8 minus 5 if you wish to add a negative number start with the first number 8 add in a negative number you need to travel towards the left so 1 2 3 4 5 this is 7 6 5 4 3 so 8 plus negative 5 is positive 3 that's the same as 8 minus 5 which will give you the same answer now what about this one what is 7 plus negative 2 so for you to pause the video and try that so if we start with 7 all we need to do is travel two spaces 
,,to the left so this is 6 and this is 5 7 plus negative 2 is the same as 7 minus 2 which is 5 a positive times a negative will give you a negative sign if you multiply two positive signs this will give you a positive number if you multiply two negative numbers you will get a positive number but if you multiply a positive and the 
,,negatives together it will give you a negative number let's work on some more examples what is negative 6 plus 4 and what is negative 7 plus 8 so take a minute and pause the video and work on those examples so I'm going to use the number line technique once more so let's say negative 6 is on the last one looks at add 4 to it so 
,,we got to travel 4 spaces to the right 1 2 3 4 so this is negative 5 negative 4 negative 3 and negative 2 so therefore negative 6 plus 4 is negative 2 by the way you can reverse the numbers if you want negative 6 plus 4 is the same as positive 4 minus 6 but you have to put the positive in front now 4 minus 6 intuitively you can 
,,see that this is going to be negative 2 now what about negative 7 plus 8 that's equal to 8 minus 7 which is going to be positive 1 but let's use the number lines to 
,,confirm it so let's start with negative 7 and let's travel 8 units to the right since we're adding 8 to negative 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 this is negative 6 negative 5 negative 4 negative 3 two negative one zero positive one so negative seven plus eight is positive one go ahead and try these negative 7 plus negative five and negative three plus negative four so what is a negative seven plus negative five when you add in two negative numbers you're going to get a negative number as well 7 plus 5 is 12 negative 7 plus negative 5 that's going to be negative 12 but let's confirm it using a number line so we're going to start with negative 7 and we're going to add negative 5 to it so if you're adding a negative number you need to move towards the left if you're adding a positive number you need to travel towards the right so 
,,let's travel 5 units to the left this is negative 6 negative 5 negative 4 actually and take that back to the left the negative numbers should be getting bigger this 
,,is negative 8 negative 9 negative 10 negative 11 negative 12 so that's our answer now if 3 plus 4 is positive 7 negative 3 plus negative 4 is equal to negative 7 so 
,,now let's start with negative 3 and let's add negative 4 to it so let's travel 4 units to the left so this is negative 4 and negative 5 negative 6 negative 7 sometimes you may need to add three numbers as opposed to two numbers so what is five plus a negative three plus six five plus negative three that's equal to positive two if you have a number line and if you start with five you need to travel three units to left so going this way that's going to take you to positive two next we need to add two and six so we have to travel six units to the right started from two so this will take us to eight 2 plus 6 is 8 if you can it this is starting from 2 this 
,,is 1 2 3 4 5 6 so 2 plus 6 is 8 and that's the final answer here's another similar example what's negative 7 plus 4 plus negative 5 negative 7 plus 4 that's going to be negative 3 and negative 3 plus negative 5 whenever you're adding two negative numbers you're going to get a negative result so think of 3 plus 5 which is 8 but just add a negative sign to it so it's negative 8 now let's use the number line to confirm everything so we're going to start with negative 7 and we're going to add 4 to it 1 2 3 4 so this is negative 6 negative 5 negative 4 negative 3 so we're currently at negative 3 at this point and then we're going to add negative 5 to it so 
,,we got to go back 5 units that way so 1 2 3 4 5 so the final answer is negative 8 now let's focus on subtracting integers what is 8 minus 3 so if you're subtracting 
,,you need to travel towards the left let's start with the first number eight now we're going to travel three spaces to the left this is seven six five so eight minus 
,,three is positive five and it's just that simple so let's try 4 minus 9 so we're going to start with positive 4 we're going to travel in 9 spaces towards the left 1 
,,2 3 the 0 makes 4 5 6 7 8 9 so notice that we ended at negative 5 so 4 minus 9 is negative 5 now what is negative 3 minus 6 what is that equal to if you see a situation like this you can basically add 3 & 6 and then make it negative 3 plus 6 is 9 but this is going to be negative 9 but if this confuses you you can always just use the number line so we're going to start with negative 3 and we're going to subtract it by 6 so let's travel 6 units to left 1 2 3 4 5 6 so this is negative 4 negative 5 maybe 6 2 negative 7 negative 8 negative 9 so therefore negative 3 minus 6 is negative 9 try this one what is negative 7 minus 6 7 plus 6 is 13 so this is going to be negative 13 so let's start with negative 7 we're going to travel 6 units to the left and as you can see it's going to give us the same result now what is six 
,,minus negative four and also what's seven minus negative two whenever you have two negative signs next to each other you can make it equal to a positive sign six minus negative four is the same as 6 plus four which is 10 and 7 minus negative 2 is 7 plus 2 which is 9 now what would you do if you see a problem with three negative 
,,signs go ahead and try that now the first thing I will do is convert these two negative signs which are right next to each other into a positive sign so negative 4 minus negative 8 is equal to negative 4 plus 8 which is the same as 8 minus 4 which turns out to be 4 so using a number line I would focus on this portion now let's start with negative 4 let's add 8 to it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and as you can see we get the same final answer of positive 4 so negative 4 minus negative 8 is 4 so try a similar example what's negative 5 minus negative 6 so let's convert the two negative signs into a positive sign so this is negative 5 plus 6 which is the same as 6 minus 5 and that's positive 1 so using the number line let's add 6 to negative 5 so this is negative 4 negative 3 and this is going to go all the way to positive 1 so we're going to get the same answer so now you know how to add and subtract positive and negative integers by the way for those of you who want to find more similar videos in pre-algebra check out the description section of this video below and you can find my pre-algebra playlist

Directed Numbers,Jh5NxxhCvww,hello welcome back to algebra 1 here we're going to talk about some very very important topics that we're going to use to build on everything that we talked about from here on out and the first of these topics is called negative numbers the concept of a negative number which we've kind of talked about a little bit we're also going to talk about absolute value and along the way we're going to talk about something very important we'll use a lot called the number line so let's start with that 
,,the number line now I know that you all have probably been exposed to what the number line is we're going to talk about it my way here and then we'll go from there so we have this thing called the number line so we'll draw an arrow pointed this way and we'll draw a line all the way across pointed the other way now in the middle 
,,of this number line is familiar 0 that's the concept of zero now over to the right everything over here are all of the numbers that you've been growing up dealing with like 3 peanuts two apples five pencils things like that and so you have the number one the number two the number three the number four the number five and I could keep going but basically you have six seven eight nine ten in the arrow right here means that these numbers go on and on to infinity okay so these are the positive 
,,numbers right and we've talked about this you've learned about this since you were a kid you know you know you know what all of the stuff basically means these are the things that you can have if you have three jellybeans or if you have two and a half cups of water because don't forget the numbers in between here are on the number line two so three point five four point six things like that these are all the numbers that you've been dealing with so so far in life so let me give you a couple couple of examples all of these numbers here these are things like when you have money in other words I may have $3 so on the number line that's gonna be right here $3 I may have four dollars and 25 cents which is 4.25 that's gonna be over here because in the middle would be four and a half so four point two five would be somewhere over here these are numbers in my bank account these are this is money I have tangible objects I have or you might say if you're talking just to pick a different example than money this can be altitude above sea level so altitude above sea level these positive numbers here notice these are all positive because we don't put 
,,"plus signs in front of them but because there's no negative signs we all we assumed and then we know that they're positive so I could be three feet above sea level or five feet above sea level those are positive numbers of course this goes to infinity so it could be 30,000 feet above sea level once so on so now we'll cut the suspense and talk about the numbers on the other side of zero these numbers exist just like all of these numbers it's just not something you really learn too much when "
,,you're playing in second grade right so to the left of zero you have negative one and then you have negative two and then you have negative three and then they negative four and so on negative five now when you continue going on this direction you go on and on to negative infinity okay so here you have you see the nice symmetry 
,,here it's like there's a mirror here these numbers get bigger bigger bigger so we can say that when you go this direction these are larger positive numbers the farther you go off to the right on the number line the bigger the larger the numbers get in the positive direction and then when you go this direction from zero points it to the left these are what you called larger negative I'll put it in quotations larger negative numbers but the question remains what is a negative number why would we spend time in math trying to define what a negative number actually is well that's why I spent some time over here writing these things down because these are things you'll understand if you have two dollars in the bank that's positive two if you have five dollars in the bank that's positive five if you're 16 feet above sea 
,,level or above the ground it's positive 16 so these numbers are going to be similar here so what we're going to do is we're going to say these represent for instance if you're talking about money when I owe you money okay and I'll talk about that in a second or it could be altitude below sea level it's just a way to keep track of what side of 0 you're on everybody understands if they have five dollars in the bank that they're over here in the number line but what if I have no money in the bank what if I have zero right and then I decide that I really need some money to you know you know get the candy bar right so I'm in the lunch line with somebody and he puts $2 on the counter and pays for me to get that candy bar I eat that candy bar I'm so thankful because I'm not hungry anymore right but I don't that was not money I had I didn't have the two dollars but after this person pays for me then I don't have those two dollars I never had the two dollars so that was not positive numbers there but I owe this guy two dollars so suddenly I don't have zero money anymore I actually borrowed money so now I'm over here I owe two dollars if I actually get two dollars from my job the first thing I'm gonna do is pay this guy back and that'll bring me back to zero because I'm gonna take the two dollars I'm gonna give it away so so then I won't Oh anybody anything and I won't have anything if I get two dollars for my job and I give it away after I've been after I owed it to somebody so the easiest way to think of negative numbers is when you Oh people money it's not money I have it's money I don't have that I owe to someone else I keep track of it how many dollars I owe with the number and the negative sign is keeping track that it's not real money I have it's money that I owe to someone else now the 
,,same analogy here below sea level you know you have I can draw a little picture over here if this is the ground then this is the altitude above sea level right and then this would be the altitude below sea level so when you're flying in an airplane you're way up here in the sky you're so many feet above sea level but there are some places believe it or not that actually are near the coast and maybe they're just a little bit maybe they're in a valley but they're near the water so that may be the the city is actually or the road or the piece of land you're on is actually a little bit below sea level maybe it's a 2 or 3 feet below sea level so you would keep track of that with a negative sign because it's negative relative to the to the zero point relative to where the sea is that's why we call a sea level so however you want to think about it money or sea level that's what negative numbers represent they they're just showing you the numbers that are on the other side of zero they get larger the farther away you get from zero in a negative sense just like the mirror image of what these guys are right here so if we wanted to to draw a few things on here on the number line right for instance we would say if I owed somebody $3 because they bought me a bag of chips then on the number line that would be right here right so I could say Oh $3 so I would represent that maybe as negative 3 okay on the number line see here is the number 1 and here is the number 2 how would 
,,I represent negative 1.5 well this is between negative 1 this is negative 2 so negative 1.5 would be right in the middle here and these are just examples this was negative 1.5 okay and then of course the number 2 that's really easy that's just the number 2 2 bucks in the bank or in my pocket all right so I'm just plotting a few 
,,things to show you that the positive numbers are plotted this way the negative numbers are plotted this way and when you're plotting decimals like that you got to be between 1 & 2 here's negative 1 here's negative 2 so negative 1 and 1/2 is actually over here now we're gonna take a few seconds we're gonna leave this here to kind of sink in and we're going to talk about the concept of absolute value because it goes hand-in-hand with what we've just talked about here absolute value all right 
,,the easiest way I could write a definition down but the easiest way to talk about absolute value is just to write down it's the distance to zero and you'll understand that want to give you a couple of examples if I take the absolute value which is written with these vertical bars of the number three what is the absolute value what it's asking you is look at the number positive three and tell me how far away that number is from zero so here's positive three how many units is it away from zero well it's three units away one two three that's very simple so I gave you a simple example first the absolute value of 3 is 3 because it's in the positive direction over here but it's 3 units away from 0 the distance to zero that's what the absolute value is in a similar way the absolute value of 9 is just simply 9 because it's off the chart here but eventually I'll get to the number 9 that's where the number 9 is the distance to zero is 9 units away so we say that it's equal to this all 
,,right now let's take the absolute value of negative 3 what is that it's the distance between negative 3 and 0 so here's negative 3 what's the distance distance between this and 0 how many units 1 2 3 units away so the absolute value the distance between this number and negative 3 and 0 is simply 3 units away how far away is negative 7 from 0 it's just going to be 7 units away how far is the number 8 from 0 it's just going to be 8 ok and we can do the same thing with fractions how far away is the fraction 2/3 from 0 it's just 2/3 that's 2/3 of the unit away what about the fraction negative 9/10 it's a negative fraction how far away is that from 0 it's just 9/10 so the short answer is when you see something inside of the absolute value bars like this all you do is you take the sine away you throw the sine away throw the sine away throw the sine away throw the sine way these are already positive but you throw it away whatever and you're just left with these positive numbers here all you do is you take the number out strip away the sign and that is the absolute value because that is always going to be the distance to zero no matter where it 
,,is a negative land over here if you throw away the sign that's going to be its absolute value and we would use that as we work problems moving forward so keep that in mind with what absolute value is understand what negative numbers are and then follow me on to the next lesson what we're finally going to start learning how to add and subtract these negative numbers together

Directed Numbers,B4zejSI8zho,"Hi!  Welcome to Math Antics. In our last video called “Intro to Exponents”, we learned that exponents (also called Indices) are a special type of math operation. In "
,,"this video, we’re going to expand on what we know about exponents by learning about their inverse operations, which are called “roots”. That’s kind of a strange name for a math operation, but it will make more sense in just a minute. First, let’s review what we mean by inverse operations. In the video called “What Is Arithmetic”, we learned that inverse operations are pairs of math operations that UNDO each other. For example, you can undo addition by doing subtraction, so addition and subtraction are inverse operations. Likewise, you can undo multiplication by doing division, so multiplication and division are inverse operations. As I mentioned, exponents have inverse operations also. There are operations that can undo them, and those operations are called roots. To see how roots and exponents work together to undo each other, let’s look at the simple exponent 4 to the 2nd power (or four squared). Previously, we learned that this is the same as 4 × 4 which equals 16. Doing this exponent meant going from 4 squared to 16. So now if we want to undo that with a root operation, that involves starting out with 16 and then somehow getting back to the 4 which is being raised to the 2nd power. And do you remember what that part of the original exponent is called? Yep, it’s called the “base”. So doing a root operation is going to give us the base as our answer, and that helps us understand its name a little better. The words “base” and “root” have a similar meaning, especially if you think of a tree. The root is at the base of a tree, and that can help you remember how root operations work. With a root operations, you start with the answer of an exponents and try to figure out what the base of that original exponent is. Okay, but how do we actually do that? How do we use a root operation to go backwards and figure out the base of the original exponent? Well for starters, we need to know about a special math symbol that looks like this. And you guessed it… it’s called the root sign. Whoa Dude! That math symbol looks totally radical dude! It’s… it’s like that division thingy, only way cooler!! Ah yes, that reminds me… "
,,"the root sign is often referred to as the “radical” sign (and mathematicians used that term even before surfers did) And yes, it does look similar to the division sign so it’s really important not to get them confused. The root (or radical) sign is different from the division sign because, instead of having a curved front, its front shape is like a check mark. The number that you want to take the root of goes under the sign like this. So when you see a number under a root (or radical) sign "
,,"like this, you know you need to figure out the base of the original exponent. In this case, you need to figure out what number you could multiply together a certain "
,,number of times to get 16. Ah - but there’s the catch!  How many times? The answer we get from taking the root will depend on how many times that number would be multiplied together. But that would depend on the original exponent.  So how do we know what that number is? Simple… the root symbol tells us. The root symbol actually 
,,"includes the original exponent in it. What?  You don’t see it? Oh… That’s because I didn’t draw it yet.  And later in this video, you’ll understand why. So let’s put a little 2 right here above the check mark part of the root symbol. And that 2 tells us that we need to figure out what number (or base) could be multiplied together 2 times in order to get 16. And, if you remember your multiplication table (or if you just look at our original example here) you’ll know that the answer to that is 4. Now do you see how the root operation is the inverse of the exponent operation? When doing the exponent, we asked, “What do we get if we multiply 4 together 2 times?”, and the answer was 16. But when we did the root operation, we asked, “What number could we multiply together 2 times to get 16?” and the answer was 4. Great!  Now that you understand how exponents and roots are related, we’re going to look closer at how root operations work. To do that, we’re gonna change our root problem slightly.  Let’s change the little 2 into a little 4. The first root was asking us to figure out what number we could multiply together 2 times to get 16. But this new root is asking us to figure out what number we could multiply together 4 times to get 16. That’s a bit trickier, huh?  Can you think of a number like that? Yep, the answer is 2, because if you multiplied four ‘2’s together (2 × 2 × 2 × 2) you get 16. So the 2nd root of 16 is 4, but the 4th root of 16 is 2. Both those roots "
,,"were pretty easy to figure out, right? But unfortunately, figuring out roots in math can be much harder. For example, what if we had this problem instead, “root 3 of 16” That means we need to figure out what number we could multiply together 3 times to get 16. Can you think of a number like that? [No]  I can’t either! And unfortunately, it’s not easy to calculate what that number would be. Remember, even hough this look a little but like the division symbol, this is NOT just division! You can’t just divide 16 by 3 to get the answer.  Roots are NOT the same as long division. So how DO we calculate a root like this? Well, there are special algorithms that you can use to calculate just about any root, but they’re kinda complicated, so we’ll save those for a future video. Instead, I’m gonna use a special root function on my calculator to get the answer. And on my calculator the button for that root function looks like this. To use it, I first enter the number that I want to take "
,,"the root of, which is 16. Next, I hit the root function button, and then I enter 3 so it knows that I want the 3rd root of 16. Last, I hit the equals sign and voila… the answer is 2.519842… and the decimal digits just keep on going forever. Wow!  See what I mean about roots being hard to figure out? That is a really complicated "
,,"decimal number and you may even wonder if it’s the right answer.  Well, let’s check… Based on what we know about exponents and roots, if we multiply this decimal number together 3 times, we should get 16, right? But to make it easier to check, let’s just round the number off to 2 decimal places. Let’s make it 2.52. If we multiply 2.52 together 3 times, (in other words if we take 2.52 to the 3rd power) we’ll get: 16.003. Well… that’s almost right.  It’s really close to 16, isn’t it? The reason it’s not exactly 16 is that we rounded the number off which made it less accurate. But the more decimal digits we use, the closer we’ll get to 16. In math, the vast majority of roots are complicated number like this. And they’re hard to figure out unless you use a calculator or a special algorithm. That’s the bad news. But the good news is that most of the time, the roots you’ll be asked to do in your homework or on tests are the easy ones; ...the ones that have nice whole number answers. And usually, you’ll only be asked to find 2nd or 3rd roots of numbers. Do you remember in the last video, we learned that 2 and 3 are the most common exponents. …so common in fact, that they even had special names. Raising a number to the 2nd power was called “squaring” it, and raising a number to the 3rd power was called “cubing” it. Well, it’s the same with roots.  Since the roots 2 and 3 are the most common, they get special names also. The 2nd root is called the “square root” and the "
,,"3rd root is called the “cube root”. In fact, the “square root” is SO common that it’s basically the default root and its symbol even gets special treatment. Do you remember that when I first showed you the root symbol, I left out the index number that tells you what root to find? Well, whenever that number is left out, you can just assume that it’s 2. In other words, the root symbol, with no index number, is always the square root. So if you want someone to find a different root (like cubed or 4th or 5th) then you need to include that number so they know which root to find. And even though square roots are the most common, they’re not always easy to find. Most are still going to be big long decimal numbers, except for the “perfect squares”. It’s easier to find the square roots of the perfect squares because their "
,,"answers can be found using the multiplication table. On the multiplication table, have you ever noticed that all the answers to problems where the same number is being multiplied together are on the diagonal of the table. In other words, 2x2=4, 3 × 3 = 9, 4 × 4 = 16, 5 × 5 = 25, 6 × 6 = 36, and so on. Well, those numbers are called the perfect squares because they’re the answers you get when you square a whole number. And that means if you take the square root of a number along that diagonal, you get a nice whole number as your answer. The square root of 4 is 2. The square root of 9 is 3. The square root of 16 is 4. The square root of 25 is 5, and so on. See what I mean? Those roots are really common and they’re also easy to figure out if you know your multiplication facts. So if you’re new to exponents and roots, learning the perfect squares is the place to start. Once you understand how those exponents and roots work, you’ll be ready to figure our tougher problems. Alright… so now you know how exponents are related to roots.  They’re inverse operations and they undo one another. And you also know that, just like 2 and 3 are the most common exponents, the square root and the cube root are the most common roots. You also know that finding roots is usually not very easy. That’s important to know so you don’t get discouraged if you feel like it’s hard to figure out what a certain root is. You’re not alone!  We think it’s hard too and would normally just use a calculator to find them. The good news is that some roots are easy to find, like the perfect squares, so be sure to focus on learning them first. And remember, to get good at math you need to actually practice what you learn from watching videos, so be sure to do some exercise problem.

Directed Numbers,Z-ZkmpQBIFo,in this video we're going to focus on solving two-step equations so let's start with the basics we're going to cover equations with fractions parentheses variables on both sides and even decimals but let's start with the basic two-step equations so how would you solve this equation let's say that 3x plus 5 is equal to 17 what's 
,,the first thing that we need to do in this problem in order to solve this equation we need to isolate the X variable so the first thing we need to move is the 5 we want to get X by itself on the left side so we need to get rid of the 5 since the 5 is added to 3x let's perform the opposite operation let's subtract both sides by 5 5 and negative 5 those two will cancel so what we have left over on the left side of the equal sign is 3x 17 minus 5 is 12 now all we need to do is separate the 3 from the X the opposite of multiplication is division so we need to divide both sides by 3 so X is 12 divided by 3 which is 4 and this is the answer here's another example that you could try 4x plus 3 is equal to 19 so based on the last example take a moment and work on this problem feel free to pause the video now just like before we're going to start with subtraction let's subtract both sides by 3 just to get rid of the 3 on the left side 3 and negative 3 they add up to 0 so we just have 4x on the left side and on the right side it's going to be 19 minus 3 which is 16 next to separate the 4 from the X we need to divide both sides by 4 4 divided by 4 is 1 1 X and X you can just write as X on the right side is 16 divided by 4 which is 4 and so that's the answer for this problem X is equal to 4 let's try a similar example but slightly different so let's say that 17 minus 5x is equal to 2 if that's the case what is the value of X so what do you think we need to do in this problem well we need to get rid of the 17 first on the Left we have positive 17 so we need to begin by subtracting both sides by 17 so these two will add to 0 and then we 
,,could bring down the negative 5x positive 2 minus 17 that's equal to negative 15 next let's divide both sides by negative 5 negative 5 divided by itself is 1 leaving behind 1x negative 15 divided by negative 5 is positive doing whenever you divide by two negative numbers you're going to get a positive result and so that is the answer X is equal to 3 now let's move on to our next example consider this equation 9 is equal to 3 plus X divided by 4 so we have a fraction what do you think we need to do and it's problem 1 this problem we could start by subtracting both sides by 3 just as we've been doing 9 minus 3 is 6 now let's bring down the fraction so 6 
,,is equal to X divided by 4 the opposite of division is multiplication so since X is divided by 4 to get rid of that let's multiply both sides by 4 on the right side 
,,the 4s will cancel leaving behind an X variable on the Left we have 4 times 6 which is 24 and so that is the answer now if you want to check your work you can take this answer and plug it into the original equation so 9 is equal to 3 plus let's replace X with 24 24 divided by 4 is 6 and 3 plus 6 is 9 so 9 equals 9 the equation is balanced which means that this here is indeed of our answer X is indeed 24 now let's move on to the next problem go ahead and take a minute and try this example so 8 plus X divided by 3 is equal to 12 so pause the video and write this equation down go ahead and solve it so I'm going to start off by subtracting both sides by 8 
,,12 minus 8 is 4 now then the next step we're going to multiply both sides by 3 so on the left the 3s will cancel on the right we have 4 times 3 which is 12 and so that's going to be the answer for this problem X is equal to 12 is another one that you could try so in this example the X variable is on the right side so go ahead and try so this problem is very similar to the first two problems that we covered even though the X variables on the other side the same rules apply let's begin by subtracting both sides by 2 so 14 minus 2 that's 12 and on the right side these will cancel just as before and as you can see solving these equations they're not that difficult now we'll need to divide both sides by 3 so X is going to be 12 divided by 3 so X is 4 in this example now sometimes you may have multiple X variables like 
,,in its problem 3x + 8 + 5 X let's say this is all equal to 32 now what should we do in this example now this problem might require more than two steps so it might be a multi-step problem which I'll have more later in this video but what do you think we need to do in this problem if you see two X variables on the same side the first thing you should do is combine like terms so we should add 3x + 5 X which is 8 X now we have a problem that's similar to the ones that we dealt with in the beginning so let's go ahead and subtract both sides by 8 8 minus 8 is 0 we could bring down the 8x and on the left side we have 32 minus 8 which is 24 and now let's divide both sides by 8 so 8x divided by 8 is simply X 24 divided by 8 is 3 and therefore this is the answer X is equal to 3 and now it's your turn go ahead and work on this problem let's say about 7x plus 2 minus 3x is equal to 26 so pause the video and try that so let's begin by combining like terms let's combine 7x and negative 3x 
,,7 minus 3 is positive 4 so we have positive 4x plus 2 which is equal to 26 next let's subtract both sides by 2 26 minus 2 that's going to be 24 and let's bring down 
,,the 4 X now we need to separate 4 from X so let's divide both sides by 4 4x divided by 4 is X and 24 divided by 4 is 6 and so that's the answer X is equal to 6 now sometimes you may have a variable found on both sides of the equation so what do you think we need to do it in is from in this problem what you want to do is you remove all the extra variables to one side of the equation and all the numbers to the other side so let's move the 5x from the left to the right side so we can accomplish that by subtracting both sides by 5 now simultaneously we can add 8 to both sides we can move all the constant terms all the numbers to file X to the left side the 8 will cancel and the 5x will cancel so on the Left we just have a number 4 plus 8 is 12 on the right side we have a variable 8x minus 5 x is 3 X so now all we need to do is divide by 3 at this point and so X is equal to 4 and that's it so that's how you can solve that equation here's a similar example 13 minus 2x is equal to 4x so now's your turn go ahead and work on that problem so now what I'm going to do is add 2x both sides and at the same time I'm going to add five to both sides doing it this way will allow me to get rid of all the extra variables on the left and all the constant terms on the right so on the left I just have 13 plus 5 which is 18 and on a right 4x plus 2x which is 6x so now all I need to do is divide both sides by 6 and so X is going to be 18 divided by 6 which is stream sometimes you may have parentheses in the equation like this one let's say that 3 times 2x minus 4 plus 1 is equal to 7 so what do you think needs to do in order to solve this particular equation what ideas do you have well we need to use the distributive property we move to distribute 3 to 2x minus 4 so first let's multiply 3 times 2x that's going to be 6x next let's multiply 3 by negative 4 and that's negative 12 let's rewrite everything else now our next step is to combine like terms negative 12 and 1 are 
,,like terms on the same side so negative 12 plus 1 we can exchange that for negative 11 since they're equivalent to each other now all we need to do at this point is 
,,first add 11 to both sides and then we could divide right now we have 6x which is equal to 7 plus 11 which is 18 and then we could divide by 6 18 divided by 6 is 3 and so that's our answer X is equal to 3 is another problem that's let's try a similar problem first go ahead and try this one so let's begin with the distributive property let's multiply five by three X just like we did before and so that's going to be 15 X next we have five times four which we know to be 20 and then let's rewrite the other stuff now let's combine like terms we can add 20 + 2 which we know it's going to be 22 so we have 15 X + 22 which is equal to 37 now our next step is to subtract both sides by 22 37 - 22 that's 15 so now all we need to do is divide both sides by 15 15 divided by 15 is 1 and so that's going to be our answer X is equal to 1 now sometimes you may have parentheses on both sides of the equation so let's try an example that illustrates that so let's say we have 2 plus 4 times 3x plus 2 and let's say that's equal to 3 minus 4 times well let's change that let's say it's 2 times 5x plus 1 plus 14 so using what you know go ahead and solve this particular equation find a value of x so we need to use distributive property first let's multiply 4 by 3x and then by 2 4 times 3x is 12x and 4 times positive 2 that's equal to 8 on the right side we need to multiply 2 by 5x which is 10 X and then 2 times 1 which is 2 now let's combine like terms on the left side we can combine 2 & 
,,8 on the right side 2 and 14 now 2 plus 8 adds up to 10 and 2 plus 14 is 16 so now let's isolate the X variables let subtract both sides by 10 X so doing this will give us an X variable only on the left side and let's subtract both sides by 10 so that we're going to have a constant number on the right side 12 12 X minus 10 X is 
,,2 X 16 minus 10 is 6 now all I need to do is divide by 2 6 divided by 2 is 3 and so X is equal to 3 and that's the answer is this a new problem that you could try let's say that 5 minus 2 times 3 X plus 4 is equal to 3 minus 4 times 2 X plus 1 so based on the last problem go ahead and try these forms so let's start with the distributive property let's multiply negative 2 by 3 X that's going to be negative 6 X and then let's multiply negative 2 by 4 which is negative 8 on the right side let's start with negative 4 times 2 X that's negative 8x and then negative 4 times 1 which is negative 4 now let's combine like terms so we can combine those two on the 
,,left and 3 and negative 4 on the right 5 minus 8 that's going to be negative 3 and 3 minus 4 is negative 1 now let's add 8x to both sides this will give us an X variable on the left side and it's going to be positive and let's add 3 to both sides so we can get a constant term on the right side negative six x plus eight X is 2x negative one plus three is two so if we divide both sides by two we can see that X is going to be one and that's it for that problem now sometimes you may have multiple fractions we covered an example where we only had one fraction in the equation but here's an example with two fractions now there's different ways in which you could solve it you could try to add one to both sides first to simplify the equation or you could just from the beginning eliminate all fractions which sometimes I'd like to do notice that we have a denominator of 3 and 2 what is the common multiple of 2 & 3 a common multiple of 2 & 3 is 6 so if we multiply everything by 6 we can 
,,get rid of all fractions so let's multiply 6 by 2 X divided by 3 6 times 2x is 12 X 12 X divided by 3 well that's going to be 4x so 2/3 of 6 is 4 next let's multiply 6 by 4 6 times 4 is 24 and then let's multiply 6 by 3 X divided by 2 6 times 3x is 18 X divided by 2 that's a 9 X and then 6 times negative 1 is negative 6 and now 
,,this looks similar to equations that we've solved before so let's begin by subtracting both sides by 4 X and simultaneously let's add 6 to both sides twenty four plus six is thirty nine X minus four X is 5x now all we need to do is divide both sides by five thirty divided by 5 is 6 so X is equal to 6 and that's the answer for that problem here is a similar problem but this time it's going to be three fractions in the equation so go ahead and try this from now let's find the least common multiple of 4 & 5 a quick way to find just a common multiple 4 & 5 is to multiply the two numbers 4 times 5 is 20 so if we multiply every fraction by 20 we can completely eliminate the entire equation of all fractions so let's do that let's multiply 20 by 3 X divided by 4 now 20 times 3x is 60 X 60 X divided by 4 is 15 X instead of multiplying first and then dividing you could divide first again multiply if we did 20 divided by 4 that's 5 5 times 3x will give us the same answer of 15 X now what about two-fifths of 20 well if we take 20 divided by 5 that will give us 4 and then 4 times 2 is 8 so two-fifths of 20 is 8 now if we multiply 83 over 20 by 20 the tourneys will cancel giving us 83 and now let's solve let's subtract both sides by 8 83 minus 8 is 75 and that all we need to do is divide both sides by 15 75 divided by 15 is 5 and so that's the answer so sometimes you may have to deal with decimals let's say we have point two x plus 0.3 which is equal to one point five now you can go ahead and solve it or you can eliminate all decimals now every decimal in this equation is rounded to the the tenths place so to get rid of all decimals all we need to do is multiply everything by ten point two x times ten is 2x point three times 10 is 3 1 point 5 times 10 is 15 and now we could solve it like any other 
,,problem so let's subtract both sides by 3 15 minus 3 is 12 and then we divide by 2 we can see that X is equal to 6 here's the last example in this video so as you can see all the numbers are rounded to the hundreds place so what do you think we need to do in this problem let's multiply everything by a hundred so basically you just need to move the decimal 2 units to the right 100 times point 28 X is 28 X point 14 times 100 is 14 point 13 x times 100 is 13 X and point 74 times 100 is 74 and 
,,now we just got to solve let's subtract both sides by 13 X and also by 14 so 28 minus 13 is 1574 minus 14 is 16 60 divided by 15 that's equal to 4 and that's the answer for this problem now I want to show you one of my algebra courses that might be useful to you if you ever need it so go to udemy.com now in a search box just type in algebra and it should come up so it's the one of the image with the black background so if you select that option and if you decide to go to course content you

Directed Numbers,sqzueYDDDJY,in this video we're going to focus on adding negative and positive numbers we're also going to do some subtraction multiplication and division but let's start with addition how can we add five plus four using a number line let's say five is somewhere over here whenever you're adding you need to move to the right on the number line and if you need to subtract move to the left so if you want to find the value of five plus four travel four spaces to the right of five so this is six seven eight nine this is where you end therefore 5 plus 4 is 9 what is 7 minus 2 you might know the answer already but using a number line since we're subtracting we need to travel two units to the left from seven so one two this is 6 and this is five 4 therefore 7 minus 2 is 5 now what about 3 minus 5 what is the answer to this question so you can start with the 3 or the negative 5 but let's start with 3 so with subtracting 3 by 5 so we need to move 5 spaces to the left so this is negative 2 actually not negative 2 but positive 2 positive 1 0 negative 1 and negative 2 so I need to stop here so therefore 3 minus 5 is negative 2 so for the sake of practice we're going to go over a few more examples so what is negative 4 plus 7 so if we start with negative 4 and if we add 7 units or go 7 years to write we should end that negative 3 negative 2 negative 1 0 1 2 three so therefore negative four plus seven history now you can do it the other way you can start with seven and go to the left four if you start with seven you're subtracting by four negative four plus seven is the same as seven minus four so we need to move 4 units to the left if we're going to subtract it by four one two three four so this is six five four three so you get the same answer either way try this one negative six plus four so if we start at negative six and add four units this is going to take us to negative two now what's negative five minus three for this we can start with negative five and since we're subtracting it by three we need to move three units to the left so this is negative six negative seven negative eight therefore negative five minus three is negative eight now what about this example negative six minus negative eight what is the answer to that one whenever you have two negative signs next to each other they're 
,,going to change to a positive sign so it's negative six plus eight so if you start at negative 6 and if you add eight units or travel eight units to the right you should be at positive two so negative six plus eight is to try this one negative nine minus negative three so this is the same as negative nine plus three so if we start at negative nine and move three spaces to the right we're going to end at negative six therefore negative nine plus three is negative six so that's how you can add and subtract positive and negative numbers using a number line now sometimes you may need to add large numbers for example if you wish to add 23 and 45 and what do you need to do you can line it up like this and then add three plus five is eight two plus four six so 23 plus 45 is 68 try this one add 68 and 159 8 plus 9 is 17 so we need to carry over the 1 5 + 6 is 11 11 plus 1 is 12 so we got to carry over the next one 1 + 1 is 2 so if you tied this in a calculator 68 + 159 is 227 now what about subtraction what's 36 minus 23 so let's line it up 6 minus 3 is 3 3 minus 2 is 1 so 36 minus 23 is 13 try this one what is 76 - 49 now we can subtract 6-1 if we do we're going to get a negative number so what we need to do is borrow a 1 if we borrow a run from 7 the 7 will turn into a 6 but this 6 will become 16 16 minus 9 is 7 and 6 minus 4 is 2 therefore 76 - 49 is 27 now what about this one 27 minus 38 notice that the bottom number is larger so this is going to be a negative number you don't want to subtract it this way what I will do is simply reverse it and then add the negative sign at the end 8 minus 7 is 1 3 minus 2 is 1 so if 38 minus 
,,27 is positive 11 27 minus 30 8 is negative 11 so you could just subtract it this way and then make it negative now let's move on into multiplication what is 5 timestream if you know your times tables or your multiplication table up to 12 this is going to be a piece of cake if not don't lose hope you can still figure this out multiplication is basically a shortcut for addition five times 3 means that you're adding 5 3 times it can also mean that you're adding 3 5 times what's five plus five plus five five plus five plus five is 15 now what about 3 plus 3 plus 3 plus 3 plus 3 if you add two threes you get six these two will turn into a six and then we have one three left over 6 plus 6 is 12 12 plus 3 is 15 so both ways you get 15 therefore 5 times 3 or 3 times 5 is 15 try this one seven times four seven times four 
,,is the same as adding seven four times or is the same as adding four seven times let's focus on a seven-part 7 plus 7 is 14 and these two are also 14 14 plus 14 is 28 therefore 7 times 4 is 28 4 + 4 is 8 that's another 8 that's another 8 and we have one 4 left over 8 plus 8 is 16 8 plus 4 is 12 16 and 12 will also give you 28 so if you don't know what 7 times 4 is you can break it down like this and then figure it out by adding multiple times now if 7 times 4 is 28 what is 7 times negative 
,,4 a positive number multiplied by a negative number is a negative number now what's the negative 7 times negative 4 when you multiply two negative numbers you're going to get a positive number this is positive 28 now what's 9 times 8 how can we figure this out if you know your multiplication tables you can see that in 72 you can add 9 8 times or add 8 9 times not to take a while now you can break down the eight into two numbers 8 is basically 4 plus 4 so if you know what 9 times 4 is if you know it's 36 you just got to add 36 2 times 36 plus 36 is 72 and so 9 times 8 is 72 so let's say if you want to multiply a large number by another number 24 times 7 there's two ways you can do this you can break down 24 into 20 plus 4 and then multiply each number by 7 so what's 7 times 27 times 2 is 14 so 7 times 20 must be 140 you just got to add the zero and we know that 7 times 4 is 28 if you add 140 and 28 you're going to get 168 so that's 24 times 7 now you can also multiply this one 7 times 4 is 28 so you write the 8 but you put the 2 over here then 2 times 7 is 14 plus 2 that's 16 so you get the same answer 168 try this one what's 9 times 35 so mentally you can do 9 times 30 plus 5 now 9 times 3 is 27 so 9 times 30 is 270 9 times 5 is 45 if you add to 7 or 45 you're going to get 315 now let's do it the other way so 35 times 9 so 9 times 5 that's going to be 45 we're going to write the 5 but bring the 4 on top 3 times 7 is 21 plus 4 that's 31 so we're going to get 315 so let's say if you want to multiply to 40 1 by 3 how can you do it mentally and by hand mentally I will think of it this way 241 is 200 plus 14 plus 1 now we need 
,,to multiply everything by 3 3 times 200 if 3 times 2 is 6 3 times 200 is 600 3 times 4 is 12 so 3 times 40 is 120 we add a 0 to 1 and 3 times 1 is 3 so if you add these 3 numbers this is going to be 3 to 7 so it's 723 now you can also do it this way 241 times 3 so 3 times 1 is 3 4 times 3 is 12 bring over the 1 and then 3 times 
,,2 is 6 plus 1 that's 7 so you get the same answer 723 now what about this one what's 36 times 45 use the distributive property to get the answer and also multiply by hand so 30 we can break it down to 30 plus 6 I mean 36 is 30 plus 6 145 is 40 plus 5 so we're going to foil 30 times 40 is how much if 3 times 4 is 12 30 times 40 is 1200 because we need to add the two zeros one zero one three one zero and X to the 4 now what's 30 times five if 3 times 5 is 15 30 times 5 is 150 now 6 times 46 times 48 must be 240 because 6 times 4 is 24 and then finally we have 6 times 5 which is 30 so if you add these numbers this is going to be 0 5 + 4 is 9 plus 3 is 12 
,,carry the 1 over 1 plus 2 is 3 plus 1 is 4 plus 2 is 6 and then this one is just going to fall down so it should be 1620 so now let's multiply by hand so 36 times 45 6 times 5 is 30 we need to write the 0 and carry over the 3 3 times 5 is 15 plus 3 that's 18 now if you're going down to the next level make sure you add a 0 4 times 6 is 24 we need to write the 4 but the two let me to put on top 3 times 4 is 12 plus 2 that's 14 and 0 and 0 is 0 8 plus 4 is 12 carry over the 1 1 plus 1 plus 4 is 6 so we get the same answer 16 20 so now let's move on into the division what is 40 divided by 5 by the way this can be written as a fraction this is the same as 40 over 5 division is the opposite of multiplication 5 times 1 is 40 it turns out that 5 times 8 is 40 so therefore 40 divided by 5 is 8 so what is 72 divided by 6 6 
,,times what number is 72 it turns out that 6 times 12 is 72 therefore 72 divided by 6 is 12 now if you don't know your multiplication tables you could still simplify 
,,we can break down 72 into 60 and 12 but with the same denominator which is the bottom of the fraction since 60 plus 12 is 72 now 60 divided by 6 is 10 one way you can see that is 6 divided by 6 is 1 and then just add the 0 12 divided by 6 is 2 so 10 plus 2 is 12 therefore 72 divided by 6 is 12 now what about 210 divided by 7 that's a big number so you can break down 210 into smaller numbers 210 is the same as 21 times 10 and 21 you can break that into 7 times 3 notice that you can cancel a 
,,7 and 3 times 10 is 30 so it turns out that 210 divided by 7 is 13 because 21 over 7 is 3 you just got to add the 0 try this one negative 72 divided by 4 a negative 
,,number divided by a positive number is going to be a negative number so let's ignore the negative sign but we have our answer will just make it negative so 72 is 40 
,,plus 32 and it turns out that 40 divided by 4 is 10 and 32 divided by 4 is 8 because 8 times 4 is 32 so 10 plus 8 is 18 therefore 72 divided by 4 is 18 so negative 72 divided by 4 is negative 18 now let's see if we can get the same answer using long division so the number on the bottom is going to go on the outside how many times does four go into seven four goes into 7 one time one times four is four 7 minus 4 is 3 so we're going to bring down the tune now how many times does 4 go into 32 
,,4 goes into 32 8 times 8 times 4 is 32 so the remainder is zero so therefore 72 divided by four as you can see is 18 and negative 72 over positive 4 is negative 18 here's our last example for the day what's 180 divided by five so we could break it into 15 we know that 50 divided by 5 is 10 50 plus 50 plus 50 is 150 180 minus 150 is 30 so 50 plus 50 plus 50 plus 30 is 150 divided by 5 is 10 so we're going to write that 3 times and 30 divided by 5 is 6 10 plus 10 plus 10 is 30 and 30 plus 6 is 36 therefore 180 over 5 is 36 so now let's use long division to get the same answer so how many times does 5 go into 18 5 goes into 18 3 times 3 times 5 is 15 and 
,,18 minus 15 is 3 now if you add to 0 5 goes into 30 6 times 6 times 5 is 30 the remainder 0 so therefore 180 over 5 is 36 so that is it for this video we've covered 
,,the basics of addition subtraction multiplication and division so thanks for watching and have a great day

Directed Numbers,NQSN00zL5gg,Let's have some practice
,,adding and subtracting negative numbers. So the first example I want
,,to look at is 2 minus 3. So right now I'm just
,,subtracting a positive number from another positive
,,"number, but you might already see that I'm subtracting a"
,,"larger number from a smaller number. So I'm probably, or"
,,"I will, definitely end up with a negative number. But let's just think"
,,about this a little bit. And I'm going to do
,,it with a number line. So there's my number
,,"line right over there. Now this is 0, this is 1,"
,,"this is 2, this is negative 1, this is negative 2. We could view this"
,,as starting at 2. So this is 2 right over
,,"here, and then we're going to subtract 3 from that 2. So we're going to move 3 to"
,,the left on the number line. So we're going to move
,,"3 to the left, 1, 2, 3. And that gets us to negative 1. This is equal to negative 1. Now let's mix it up"
,,a little bit more. Let's imagine what would happen
,,if we had negative 2 minus 3. So this was positive 2 minus 3. Now let's think about
,,"negative 2 minus 3. So once again, let's"
,,"draw our number line. And I'll put 0 over here. So this is 0, this is 1, this"
,,"is negative 1, negative 2, negative 3, negative 4,"
,,"negative 5, negative 6, and I could keep going. But we're starting"
,,"at negative 2, and then we're"
,,"subtracting 3 again. So once again, we're"
,,"going to move three to the left of negative 2. So we go 1, 2, 3. We end up at negative 5. So this is negative 5. So notice in both"
,,"situations we subtracted 3, we moved 3 to the left"
,,on the number line. It's just here we started
,,2 to the right of 0. Here we started 2
,,to the left of 0. This is negative 2. Let's do another example
,,with these same numbers. Let's imagine negative 2 plus 3. I encourage you to
,,"pause this video, and try to think about"
,,this on your own. So we could draw
,,the number line-- I could draw a straighter
,,number line than that-- so draw the number line again. And let's say that
,,"this is negative 2, negative 1, 0, 1, and 2 again. We're starting at"
,,"negative 2, we're starting 2 to the left of zero. So we're starting at negative"
,,"2, and we're going to add 3. So we're going to"
,,"go 3 to the right now, 1, 2, 3, and we"
,,end up at positive 1. Now let's think about
,,"2, so positive 2, and we're going to"
,,subtract a negative 3. And other videos we've
,,"already talked about this. In fact, there's a video"
,,explaining why this actually makes sense. But when you
,,"subtract a negative, this is the same thing"
,,as adding the positive. So 2 minus negative 3 is
,,the exact same thing as 2 plus 2 plus positive 3. These two statements
,,"are equivalent, and this just boils down"
,,"to, this right over here, is just going to be 5. Now, let's mix it up"
,,a little bit more. Let's imagine negative
,,"2 minus negative 3. Now, this might seem"
,,really intimidating to have all of these negatives
,,"in place here, but you just have to"
,,"remember subtracting a negative, like this, is"
,,going to get you a positive. So this is the exact same
,,"thing as negative 2 plus 3, and negative 2 plus"
,,"3, we've already seen it right over here. You start at negative 2, you"
,,"start 2 to the left of 0, and then we're going"
,,"to go 3 to the right, we're adding 3, 1, 2, 3."

Directed Numbers,bXkewQ7WEdI,"Hi …Rob here with Math Antics. …just wanted to say “hi” to all the people who watch our videos, and say thank you so much for watching and liking and subscribing. I "
,,"know we usually don’t do milestone videos, but this seemed like a pretty cool milestone that we just had to mention it. We have one times ten to the six YouTube subscribers! That’s crazy!  That’s awesome! Thank you SO much! Oh wait… You don’t know what numbers like one times ten to the six even mean? Well you’re in luck! We have a video that explains it. In fact, it’s this video that you’re watching right now! Hi I’m Rob.  Welcome to Math Antics. Have you ever heard people use numbers like "
,,"that?… 1 times 10 to the 6th or maybe 3.4 times 10 to the negative 8th? Well… those are examples of a way of writing numbers called Scientific Notation. Huh… that didn’t sound quite right, let me try that again. …Scientific Notation… Ah yes… that’s better. Numbers can be really big or really small, right? Like, if you wanted to "
,,"count up all the cells that make up your body, it would be a really big number. …something like 35 trillion cells! But if you wanted to measure the diameter of one of those cells using meters, you’d get a really small number. …something like 0.0000005 meters. Not only are really big or small numbers a lot of work to write down because of all the zeros, they’re hard to quickly evaluate and compare. At a glance, it’s not easy to tell just how many number places there are in these really big or small numbers. And that’s where Scientific Notation can really help us out! Instead of using a long sequence of decimal digits to represent numbers, Scientific Notation uses a shorter number multiplied by a power of 10. And it’s always in that form:  some number “…times 10 to the…” some exponent. Here’s an example of a really "
,,"long number: One-hundred, twenty-five million. And here’s the equivalent number written in Scientific Notation: 1.25 times 10 to the 8th Wanna see how these two numbers are just different ways of writing the same thing? Let’s start by making a copy of our big number and messing with its decimal point a bit. Where’s the decimal point you ask? Remember that it’s always here, immediately to the right of the ones-place. We just don’t need to show it if there aren’t any decimal digits. Okay, so "
,,"what would happen if we shift the decimal point one place to the left? Well, doing that would change the number, right? By definition, the decimal point is always immediately to the right of the ones-place, so shifting the decimal point shifts the ones-place and all the other number places too. And if we line up the ones-place of our new number with the ones-place of the original number, you see that the new number is 10 times smaller. That means shifting the decimal point one place to the "
,,"left is equivalent to dividing a number by 10. But, do we want a number that’s 10 times smaller than before? Well…no.  We don’t want to change the value of the number at all. We just want to write it in a different way. Since shifting the decimal resulted in a number that’s 10 times smaller than before, to compensate and keep the value the same, we need to multiply the new number by 10. Making the number smaller and then compensating for that might seem like a weird thing to do, but it will make more sense in a minute. Let’s do that process again. Let’s make a copy of the new number and shift the decimal point to the left again. Since that shifts all the number places, we can align the ones-places and see that the same thing happened. The new number is 10 times smaller than before. So to keep it the same value as "
,,"the original number, we need to compensate by making it 10 times bigger. We need to multiply by another 10. And if we repeat that process again… if we make another copy and shift the decimal point again, we’ll see that the number gets 10 times smaller, so we need to compensate by multiplying by another 10. Alright, time out!  We seem to have a little problem here. Each time we shift the decimal point to the left, our number gets smaller. But since we have to compensate with a factor of 10 each time, it’s making kind of a mess! This part is getting shorter, but this part is getting longer! No problem… Exponents can fix that! Do you remember that exponents are a way of writing repeated multiplication? If you don’t, then be sure to watch our videos about them before moving on. Instead of writing 10 times 10, we can write 10 to the 2nd power, and instead of writing 10 x 10 x 10, we can write 10 to the 3rd power. That’s much better!  Now we can continue on. We’ll shift the decimal point again and multiplying by 10 again. But this time, instead of writing another “times 10”, we can just increase the exponent by 1 since there would be a total of four 10s being multiplied together. Let’s keep going with this process of shifting the decimal point to the left and multiplying by 10 for each number place we shift. And we’ll stop when there’s only one digit remaining to the left of the decimal point. Wow!  That’s quite a pattern. Each time we shifted the decimal, the number got 10 times smaller. So, each time we had to multiply by another 10 to keep the value the same. And because we did that, each one of these lines represents the same value. So even though it looks a lot different, this last line has the exact same value as the first one. In fact, it’s just the original number written in Scientific Notation. But, why is it only this last line, and not any of the others? I mean… they all look pretty scientific to me! Ah… that’s a good question. For a number "
,,"to be in ‘proper’ Scientific Notation, it’s supposed to have only 1 digit to the left of the decimal. There can be more than one digit to the right of the decimal, depending on the accuracy of the number, but just 1 digit to the left. But why? I mean… that rule sounds kinda arbitrary. It’s not arbitrary at all! If there's more than one digit to the left of the decimal point, that would mean that we didn’t get out all of the factors of 10 that we could have. And factoring out ALL of the 10s "
,,helps us quickly determine a number’s “order of magnitude”. Order of magnitude!? What in the world is that? That sounds kinda scary! Order of magnitude is basically 
,,"just how many 10s you need to multiply to get a certain number. And when a number is in Scientific Notation, the order of magnitude is just the exponent, because that’s telling us how many 10s to multiply together. In this example, the Scientific Notation says that if we take this small decimal and multiply it by eight 10s, we’ll get our original number. So Scientific Notation is a way of taking a really big number and reducing it down to a value that’s less than 10, but keeping track of how many 10s we would need to multiply together to get the full number. You can think of it as basically just extracting its “order of magnitude” and storing it in exponent form. But why would we want to do that?  I mean… it seems kinda complicated. Well… yeah, but… did you see how much writing it saved us? When we wrote out 125,000,000 we had to write ELEVEN characters, including commas. But when we wrote the same number in Scientific Notation, we only had to write EIGHT characters. What? …not convinced that it’s worth the savings? Well how about this number?… That’s a LOT of zeros to write, isn’t it?! But in Scientific Notation, this number is just 8.4 times 10 to the 31st power. That’s much better! So Scientific Notation is very useful when it comes to writing down really large numbers… or really small ones. For "
,,"example, this number is really small:  0.00000095 It’s much less than 1, but it’s not zero. And here’s the same number written in Scientific Notation. Again, it consists of a number that has only one digit to the left of the decimal point which is being multiplied by 10 to a certain power. But do you notice anything different about the exponent? Yep… it’s negative!  So what does that mean? Well, the short answer is that positive exponents show repeated multiplication while negative exponents show repeated division. And since this is a negative exponent with 10 as the base, it means to repeatedly divide by 10. To see how that works, let’s copy our original number and do that decimal-point-shift-thing again. Only this time, we’re gonna shift the decimal point to the right. What happens if we shift it one place to the right? It makes the number 10 times bigger than it was before. There used to be 6 zeros between the decimal point and the '9', but now there’s only 5. Again, we don’t want to change the value, so what can we do to compensate for shifting the decimal point? In this case, since shifting one place to the right made the number 10 "
,,"times bigger, we need to compensate by dividing the number by 10. And because of the way multiplication and division are related, dividing by 10 is the same as multiplying by 1 over 10 (or one-tenth) so we can just multiply by one-tenth. OR… we can multiply by 10 to the negative 1, because 10 to the negative1 is just another way of writing one-tenth. That may seem odd if you haven’t learned about negative exponents before, and we explain it in more detail in our video about the Laws of Exponents. For now, all you really need to know is that multiplying by 10 to the negative 1 is the same as dividing by 10, so it compensated for shifting the decimal point one place to the right. Continuing on, if we shift the decimal point another place to the right, the same thing happens… we make the number 10 times bigger. So to keep the value the same, we have to multiply by another factor of 10 to the negative 1. And it you’re wondering whether we can combine these exponents, you’re on the right track! 10 to the negative 1 times 10 to the negative 1 combine to become 10 to the negative 2, which makes sense because we shifted the decimal point a total of two places to the right. And if we shift the decimal point 3 places to the right, we need to multiply by 10 to the negative 3 to compensate. And if we shift 4 places, then we need 10 to the negative 4 to compensate.  …get the idea? And if we continue doing that until the decimal point is positioned so that there’s only 1 digit to the left of it, that gives us the number in Scientific Notation:  9.5 times 10 to the -7 And can you figure out what the order of magnitude of this number is? "
,,"Yep… just like before, the exponent tells us. It’s negative 7. Being able to quickly identify a number’s order of magnitude is pretty handy. For example, if the order of magnitude is a big positive exponent, then you know right away that you’re dealing with a really big number. But if it’s a big NEGATIVE exponent, then you know "
,,"you’re dealing with a really small number. And if you’re comparing two really big number like these two, or two really small numbers like these two, it’s hard to tell at a glance which is actually bigger or smaller. But if you see them in Scientific Notation, it’s easy to see that this number’s order of magnitude is bigger than "
,,"the other’s, which means that it’s bigger, and this number’s order of magnitude is less that the other’s which means that it’s smaller. So now that you’ve seen how Scientific Notation works, and you realize that it’s just a short-hand way of writing really big or really small numbers, let’s break down the procedure for converting back and forth between numbers written in regular form and Scientific Notation. Starting with these two examples in regular form… First, count how many number places you would need to shift the decimal point for there to be only 1 digit to the left of it. For this number we’d need to shift 8 places, and for this number; 6 places. The number of places you need to shift will be the exponent in the Scientific Notation form, but the sign of that exponent is determined by the direction you shifted. If you shifted to the left (because you started with a big number) then the exponent will be positive. But if you shifted to the right (because you started with a small number) then the exponent will be negative. So that gives you the “times 10 to the something” part of the Scientific Notation and to get the number that’s "
,,"multiplied by that power of 10, you just take the shifted decimal number and remove any zeros that don’t really need to be shown. There… that wasn’t too hard, was it? But what if we start out with numbers in Scientific Notation and want to convert them into regular form? Let’s do that with these two examples. The first step is to look at the exponent which is the order of magnitude of the number. It tells you how many 10s you'll need to multiply or divide by to get the number in regular form. If the exponent is positive, it means that you’ll need to multiply by that many 10s. In this example, that means that we would need to multiply by a total of seven 10s to get the number in regular form. That would be a lot of work, but we can also just shift the decimal point that number of places. Which direction do we need "
,,"to shift it? Well… since we’re multiplying by factors of 10, we need to shift it in the direction that will make the number bigger. That is, we need to shift it to the right. So, we’ll just shift the decimal point 7 places to the right. But as you can see, there’s aren’t 7 digits after the decimal, so any places that don’t have "
,,"a digit will just be filled with a zero. There… Our number is regular form is 41,650,000 In this second example, the exponent is negative, which means that we’ll need to divide by that number of 10s to get the number in regular form. Again, we could just do that division, or we can shift the decimal point to save time. Since dividing by factors of 10 make a number smaller, we’ll need to shift the decimal point in the direction that results in a smaller number… that is, to the left. Since our exponent is negative 5, we’ll shift the decimal point 5 places to the left. And any places that we shift past that don’t already have a digit in them will get filled with a zero. We’ll also put a zero in the ones-place since that’s always good form for decimal numbers. There… Our number in regular form is 0.0000109 Alright… that’s the basics of Scientific Notation. It’s may seem a little confusing at first, but as you get more experience with it, it makes a lot of sense. And when it comes to writing really big or really small numbers, it’s totally worth it. And even if you understand how Scientific Notation works, it may take some practice to get good at converting back and forth between it and regular form, so be sure to practice on your own.

Directed Numbers,ffLLmV4mZwU,"Hi, I’m Rob. Welcome to Math Antics. In this video, we’re going to learn about Polynomials. That’s a big math word for a really big concept in Algebra, so pay attention. Now before we can understand what polynomials are, we need to learn about what mathematicians call “terms”. In Algebra, terms are mathematical expressions that "
,,"are made up of two different parts: a number part and a variable part. In a term, the number part and the variable part are multiplied together, but since multiplication is implied in Algebra, the two parts of a term are usually written right next to each other with no times symbol between them. The number part is pretty simple… it’s just a number, like 2 or 5 or 1.4 And the number part has an official name… it’s called the “coefficient”. Now there’s another cool math word that you can use "
,,"to impress your friends at parties! …and then I said, “That’s not my wife… that’s my coefficient!” The variable part of a term is a little more complicated. It can be made up of one or more variables that are raised to a power. Like… the variable part could be 'x squared'.  That’s a variable raised to a power. Or, the variable part could be just ‘y’. If you remember what we learned in our last video, you’ll realize that that also qualifies as a variable raised to a power. ‘y’ is the same as ‘y’ to the 1st power. But since the exponent ‘1’ doesn’t change anything, we don’t need to actually show it. Or… the variable part of a term could be some tricky combination of variables that are raised to powers, like ‘x squared’ times ‘y squared’. …or ‘a’ times ‘b squared’ times ‘c cubed’. Terms can have any number of variables like that, but the good news is that most of the time, you’ll only need to deal with terms that have one variable. …or maybe two in complicated problems. Oh, and "
,,"there’s one thing I should point out before we move on… if you have a term like 6y, even though it would be fine to do the multiplication the other way around and write y6, it’s conventional to always write the number part of the term first and the variable part of the term second. Okay, so that’s the basic idea of a term. But there’s a little more to terms that we’ll learn in a minute. First, let’s see how this basic idea of a term helps us understand the basic idea of a polynomial. A polynomial is a combination of many terms. It’s kind of like a chain of terms that are all linked together using addition or subtraction. The terms themselves contain multiplication, but each term in a polynomial must be joined by either addition or subtraction. And polynomials can be made from any number of terms joined together, but there are a few specific names that are used to describe polynomials with a certain number of terms. If there’s only one term (which isn’t really a chain) then we call it a “monomial” because the prefix “mono” means “one”. If there are just two terms, then we call it a “binomial” because the prefix “bi” means “two”, and if there are three terms, then we call it a “trinomial” since the prefix “tri” means “three”. Beyond three terms, we usually just say “polynomial” since “poly” means “many”, and in fact, it’s common to simply use the term “polynomial” even when there are just 2 or 3 terms. Okay, so that’s the basic idea of a polynomial. It’s a series of terms that are joined together by addition or subtraction. Now, let’s see a typical example of a polynomial that will help us learn a little more about terms:  3 ‘x squared’ plus ‘x’ minus 5 How many terms does this polynomial have? Well, based on what we’ve learned so far, you’re probably not quit sure. If the terms are the parts that are joined together by addition or subtraction, then this should have three terms, but it looks like there’s something missing with the last two terms. This middle term is missing its number part, and this last term is missing its variable part. That doesn’t seem to fit with our original definition of a term.  What’s up with that? Well, the middle term is easy to explain. There really is a number part there, but it’s just ‘1’. Do you remember how ‘1’ is always a factor of any number? But, since multiplying by ‘1’ has no effect on a number or variable, we don’t need to show it. So, if you see a term in a polynomial that has only a variable part, you know that the number part (or coefficient) of that term is just ‘1’. Okay, but what about this last term that’s missing its variable part? Well, that’s a little trickier. Do you remember in our last video about exponents in Algebra, we learned that any number or variable that’s raised to the 0th power just equals ‘1’? That means we can think of this last term as having a variable ‘x’ that’s being raised to the 0th power. Since that would always just equal ‘1’, it’s not really a variable in the true sense of the word, and it has no effect on the value of the term. But it makes sense, especially if you remember the other rule from the last video. That rule says that any number raised to the 1st power is just itself, which helps us see that this middle term is basically the same as ‘1x’ raised to the 1st power. Now do you see the pattern? Each term has a number part and each term has a variable part that is raised to a power: 0, 1 and 2. But since ‘x’ to the ‘0’ is just ‘1’, and ‘x’ to the ‘1’ is just ‘x’, and anything multiplied by ‘1’ is just itself, the polynomial gets simplified so that it no longer looks exactly like the pattern it comes from. Oh, and this last term… the one that doesn’t have a truly variable part… it’s called a CONSTANT term because its value always stays the same. Alright… Now that you know what a Polynomial is, let’s talk about an important property of terms and polynomials called their “degree”. Now that might sound like the units we use to measure temperature or angles, but the degree we’re talking about here is different. The degree of a term is determined by the power of the variable part. For example, in this term, since the power of the variable is 4, we say that the degree of the term is 4, or that it’s a 4th degree term. And in this term, the power of the variable is 3, so it’s a 3rd degree term. Likewise, this would be a 2nd degree term and this would be a 1st degree term. Oh, and I suppose you could call a term with no variable part a “zero degree” term, but it’s usually just referred to as a “constant term”. Things are a little more complicated when you have terms with more that one variable. In that case, you add up the powers of each variable to get the degree of the term. Since the powers in this term are 3 and 2, it’s a 5th "
,,"degree term because 3 + 2 = 5. Okay, but why do we care about the degree of terms? Well, it’s because polynomials are often referred to by the degree of their highest term. If a polynomial contains a 4th degree term (but no higher terms), then it’s called a “4th degree” polynomial. But if its highest term is only a 2nd degree term, then it’s called a “2nd degree” polynomial. Another reason that we care about the degree of the terms is that it helps us decide the arrangement of a polynomial. We arrange the terms in a polynomial in order from the highest degree to the lowest. …ya know, cuz, mathematicians like to keep things organized… [mumbeling] …nice… let’s see…double check… Perfect! For example, this polynomial (which has 5 terms) should be rearranged so that the highest degree term is on the left, and the lowest degree term is on the right. But of course, not every polynomial has a term of every degree. This is a 5th degree polynomial, but it only has 3 terms. We should still put them in order from highest to lowest, even though it has terms that are missing. So, the “4x to the fifth” should come first. And then the “minus 10x”. And finally, the “plus 8”. By the way, it’s totally fine for a polynomial to have “missing” terms like that. And it’s sometimes helpful to think of those missing terms as just having coefficients that are all zeros. If the coefficient of a term is zero, then the whole term has a value of zero so it wouldn’t effect the polynomial at all. And speaking of coefficients… What if we need to re-arrange this polynomial so that its terms are in order from highest degree to lowest degree? The highest degree term is ‘5x squared’ but before we just move it to the front of the polynomial, it’s important to notice that it’s got a minus sign in front of it. Normally when "
,,"we see a minus sign, we think of subtraction, but when it comes to polynomials, it’s best to think of a minus sign as a NEGATIVE SIGN that means the term right after it has a negative value (or a negative coefficient). In fact, instead of thinking of a polynomial as having terms that are added OR subtracted, it’s best to think of ALL of the terms as being ADDED, but that each term has either a POSITIVE or a NEGATIVE coefficient which is determined by the operator right in front of that term. For example, if you have this Polynomial, you should treat it as if all of the terms are being added together, and use the sign that’s directly in front of each term to tell you if it’s a positive or a negative term. This first term has a coefficient of ‘negative 4’, so it’s a negative term. The next term has a coefficient of "
,,"‘positive 6’, so it’s positive. The next term has a coefficient of ‘negative 8’, so it’s negative. And the constant term is just ‘positive 2’. And recognizing positive and negative coefficients helps us a lot when rearranging polynomials that have a mixture of positive and negative terms like our example here. If you think of the negative sign in front of the ‘5x squared’ term as part of its coefficient, then you’ll realize that when we move it to the front of the polynomial, the negative sign has to come with it. It has to come with it because it’s really a NEGATIVE term. If we don’t bring the negative sign along with it, we’ll be changing it into a positive term which would actually change the value of the polynomial. And in addition to helping us re-arrange them, treating a polynomial as a combination of positive and negative terms will be very helpful when we need to simplify them, which just so happens to be the subject of our next basic Algebra video. Alright, we’ve learned a LOT about polynomials in this video, and if you’re a little overwhelmed, don’t worry… it might just take some time for it all to make sense. Remember, you can always re-watch this video a few times, and doing some of the practice problems will help it all sink in. As always, thanks for watching Math Antics,"

Directed Numbers,C38B33ZywWs,Welcome to the presentation
,,on adding and subtracting negative numbers. So let's get started. So what is a negative
,,"number, first of all? Well, let me draw"
,,a number line. Well it's not much of a
,,line but I think you'll get the picture. So we're used to the positive
,,"numbers, so if that's 0, you have 1, you have 2, you have 3,"
,,"you have 4, and you keep going. And if I were to say what's 2"
,,"plus 2, you'd start at 2 and then you'd add 2 and"
,,you'd get to 4. I mean most of us
,,it's second nature. But if you actually drew
,,it on a number line you'd say 2 plus 2 is 4. And if I asked you what's
,,2 minus 1 or let's say what's 3 minus 2? If you start at 3 and
,,"you subtracted 2, you would end up at 1. That's 2 plus 2 is equal to 4"
,,and 3 minus 2 is equal to 1. And this is a joke for you. Now what if I were to
,,"say what is 1 minus 3? Huh. Well, it's the same thing. You start at 1 and we're going"
,,"to go 1 -- well, now we're going to go below 0 --"
,,what happens below 0? Well then you start going
,,"to the negative numbers. Negative 1, negative 2,"
,,"negative 3, and so on. So if I start at 1 right here,"
,,"so 1 minus 3, so I go 1, 2, 3, I end up at negative 2. So 1 minus 3 is equal"
,,to negative 2. This is something that you're
,,"probably already doing in your everyday life. If I were to tell you that boy,"
,,"it's very cold today, it's 1 degree, but tomorrow it's going"
,,"to be 3 degrees colder, you might already know intuitively,"
,,well then we're going to be at a temperature of
,,negative 2 degrees. So that's all a
,,negative number means. And just remember when a
,,"negative number is big, so like negative 50, that's actually"
,,"colder than negative 20, right? So a negative 50 is actually"
,,even a smaller number than negative 20 because it's even
,,further to the left of negative 20. That's just something you'll
,,get an intuitive feel for. Sometimes when you start you
,,"feel like oh, 50's a bigger number than 20, but it's a"
,,"negative 50 as opposed to a positive 50. So let's do some problems, and"
,,I'm going to keep using the number line because I
,,think it's useful. So let's do the
,,problem 5 minus 12. I think you already might
,,have an intuition of what this equals. But let me draw a
,,"line, 5 minus 12. So let me start with minus 10,"
,,"minus 9, minus 8 --I think I'm going to run out of space --"
,,"minus 7, minus 6, minus 5 -- I should have this pre-drawn --"
,,"minus 4, minus 3, minus 2, minus 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,"
,,I'll put 5 right here. 5 minus 12. So if we start at 5 -- let me
,,use a different color -- we start at 5 right here and we're
,,"going to go to the left 12 because we're subtracting 12. So then we go 1, 2, 3, 4,"
,,"5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. Negative 7. That's pretty interesting. Because it also happens"
,,"to be that 12 minus 5 is equal to positive 7. So, I want you to think a"
,,little bit about why that is. Why the difference between 12
,,"and 5 is 7, and the difference between -- well, I"
,,guess it's either way. Because in this situation we're
,,"also saying that the difference between 5 and 12 is negative 7,"
,,"but the numbers are that far apart, but now we're starting"
,,with the lower number. I think that last sentence just
,,"completely confused you, but we'll keep moving forward. We just said 5 minus 12"
,,is equal to minus 7. Let's do another one. What's negative 3
,,"plus 5 equals what? Well, let's use the"
,,same number line. Let's go to negative 3 plus 5. So we're going to
,,"go to the right 5. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. It's a 2. It equals 2. So negative 3 plus"
,,5 is equal to 2. That's interesting because 5
,,"minus 3 is also equal to 2. Well, it turns out that 5 minus"
,,"3 is the same thing, it's just another way of writing 5"
,,"plus negative 3 or negative 3 plus 5. A general, easy way to always"
,,do negative numbers is it's just like regular subtraction
,,"and addition and subtraction, but now when we subtract we"
,,can go to the left below 0. Let's do another one. So what happens when you get
,,"let's say 2 minus minus 3? Well, if you think about how"
,,it should work out I think this will make sense. But it turns out that the
,,"negative number, the negative signs actually cancel out. So this is the same thing"
,,"as 2 plus plus 3, and that just equals 5. Another way you could say is --"
,,let's do another one -- what is negative 7 minus minus 2? Well that's the same thing
,,"as negative 7 plus 2. And remember, so we're doing to"
,,start at negative 7 and we're going to move two to the right. So if we move one to the right
,,"we go to negative 6, and then we move two to the right"
,,we get negative 5. That makes sense because
,,"negative 7 plus 2, that's the same thing as 2 minus 7. If it's 2 degrees and it gets 7"
,,"degrees colder, it's minus 5. Let's do a bunch of these. I think the more you do the"
,,"more practice you have, and the modules explain it pretty well,"
,,probably better than I do. So let's just do a
,,ton of problems. So if I said
,,"negative 7 minus 3. Well, now we're going"
,,to go three to the left of negative 7. We're going to get 3 less
,,"than negative 7 so that's negative 10, right? That makes sense, because if we"
,,had positive 7 plus 3 we're at 7 to the right of 0 and we're
,,going to go three more to the right of 0 and we
,,get positive 10. So for 7 to the left of 0 and
,,go three more to the left we're going to get negative 10. Let's do a bunch more. I know I'm probably confusing
,,"you, but practice is what's going to really help us. So say 3 minus minus 3, well,"
,,"these negatives cancel out so that just equals 6. What's 3 minus 3? Well, that's easy"
,,that's just 0. What's minus 3 minus 3? Well now we're going to get
,,"three less than minus 3, well that's minus is 6. What's minus 3 minus minus 3? Interesting. Well, the minuses cancel out"
,,"so you get minus 3 plus 3. Well, if we start three to the"
,,"left of 0 and we move three to the right we end up at 0 again. So that makes sense, right? Let me do that again. Minus 3 minus minus 3. Anything minus itself        "
,,"should equal 0, right? That's why that equals 0. And that's why it makes sense"
,,that those two negatives cancel out and that's
,,"the same thing as this. Let's do a bunch more. Let's do 12 minus 13. That's pretty easy. Well, 12 minus 12 is 0, so"
,,12 minus 13 is negative 1 because we're going to
,,"go one the left of 0. Let's do 8 minus 5. Well, this one is just a"
,,"normal problem, that's 3. What's 5 minus 8? Well, we're going to go all the"
,,"way to 0 and then 3 more to the left of zero, so it's minus 3. I could draw a"
,,"number line here. If this is 0 this is 5, and now"
,,"we're going to go to left 8, then we end up and negative 3. You could do that"
,,for all of these. That actually might
,,be a good exercise. I think this will give you good
,,introduction and I recommend that you just do the modules
,,"because the modules actually, especially if you do the hints,"
,,it has a pretty nice graphic that's a lot nicer than
,,anything I could draw on this chalkboard. So try that out and I'm going
,,to try to record some more modules that hopefully won't
,,confuse you as badly. You could also attend the
,,seminar on adding and subtracting negative numbers. I hope you have fun. Bye.
,,
Directed Numbers,Hlal9ME2Aig,"In this video, I want"
,,"to familiarize ourselves with negative numbers,"
,,and also learn a bit of how do we
,,add and subtract them. And when you first
,,"encounter them, they look like this deep"
,,and mysterious thing. When we first
,,"count things, we're counting positive numbers. What does a negative"
,,number even mean? But when we think
,,"about it, you probably have encountered negative"
,,numbers in your everyday life. And let me just give
,,you a few examples. So before I actually
,,"give the example, the general idea is"
,,a negative number is any number less than the 0. And if that sounds strange
,,"and abstract to you, let's just think about it in a"
,,couple of different contexts. If we're measuring the
,,temperature-- and it could be in Celsius
,,or Fahrenheit. Let's just assume we're
,,"measuring it in Celsius. And so, let me"
,,draw a little scale that we can measure
,,"the temperature on. And so, let's say this"
,,"is 0 degrees Celsius. That is 1 degree Celsius,"
,,"2 degrees Celsius, 3 degrees Celsius. Now let's say that it's"
,,"a pretty chilly day, and it's currently"
,,3 degrees Celsius. And someone who
,,predicts the future tells you that it
,,is going to get 4 degrees colder the next day. So how cold will it be? How can you represent
,,"that coldness? Well, if it only"
,,"got 1 degree colder, we would be at 2 degrees. But we know we have to"
,,"go 4 degrees colder. If we got 2 degrees colder,"
,,we would be at 1 degree. If we got 3 degrees
,,"colder, we would be at 0. But 3 isn't enough. We have to get 4 degrees colder. So we have to actually"
,,"go one more below the 0. And that one below 0,"
,,"we call that negative 1. And so, you can kind of"
,,"see that the number line, as you go to the right"
,,"of 0 on the number line, it increases in positive values. As you go to the left"
,,"of the number line, you're going to have negative 1. Then you're going"
,,to have negative 2. And you're going
,,to have negative 3. And you're going
,,to have-- depending on how you think
,,about it-- you're going to have larger
,,negative numbers. But I want to make it
,,very clear-- negative 3 is less than negative 1. There is less heat in
,,the air then negative 1. It is colder. There's less temperature there. So let me just
,,make it very clear. Negative 100 is much
,,"smaller than negative 1. You might look at 100,"
,,"and you might look at 1, and your gut reaction"
,,"is to say, wow, 100 is a much larger"
,,number than 1. But when you think
,,"about it, negative 100 means there's a"
,,"lack of something. If it's negative 100 degrees,"
,,there's a lack of heat. So there's much less heat here
,,then if we had negative 1. Let me give you another example. Let's say in my bank
,,"account today, I have $10. Let me do this in a new color. So let's say today I have $10. Now let's say I go"
,,out there-- because I feel good about my $10-- and
,,let's say I go and spend $30. And for the sake of
,,"argument, let's say I have a very flexible"
,,"bank, one that lets me spend more"
,,money than I have-- and these actually exist. So I spend $30. So what's my bank account
,,going to look like? So let me draw a
,,number line here. And you might already have
,,"an intuitive response. I will owe the bank some money. So let me write this over here. So tomorrow, what"
,,is my bank account? So you might immediately
,,"say, look, if I have $10, and I spend $30,"
,,there's $20 that had to come from
,,"someplace, and that $20 is coming from the bank. So I'm going to"
,,"owe the bank $20. And so, in my bank account,"
,,"to sure how much I have, I could say $10 minus $30"
,,"is actually negative $20. So in my bank account tomorrow,"
,,"I'm going to have negative $20. So if I say I have negative $20,"
,,that means that I owe the bank. I don't even have it. Not only do I have
,,"nothing, I owe something. It's going in reverse. Here, I have something to spend. If my $10 is in my bank, that"
,,means the bank owes me $10. I have $10 that I
,,"can use to go spend. Now all of a sudden,"
,,I owe the bank. I've gone in the
,,other direction. And if we use a
,,"number line here, it should hopefully make"
,,a little bit of sense. So that is 0. I'm starting off with $10. And spending $30 means I'm
,,moving 30 spaces to the left. So if I move 10 spaces to the
,,"left-- if I only spend $10, I'll be back at 0. If I spend another $10,"
,,I'll be at negative $10. If I spend another
,,"$10 after that, I will be at negative $20. So each of these distances--"
,,"I spent $10, I'd be at 0. Another $10, I'd"
,,"be at negative $10. Another $10, I would"
,,be at negative $20. And this whole distance right
,,"here is how much I spent. I spent $30. So the general idea, when"
,,you spend or if you subtract or if we're getting
,,"colder, you would move to the left"
,,of the number line. The numbers would get smaller. And we now know they
,,can get smaller than 0. They can go to
,,"negative 1, negative 2, they can even go to"
,,"negative 1.5, negative 1.6. You're getting more and more"
,,negative the more you lose. If you're adding-- if I
,,"go and get my paycheck, I will move to the right"
,,of the number line. Now with that out of
,,"the way, let's just do a couple of more"
,,pure math problems. And just think
,,"about what it means if we were to say 3 minus 4. So once again, this is"
,,exactly the situation that we did here
,,"with the temperature. We're starting at 3,"
,,and we're subtracting 4. So we're going to
,,"move 4 to the left. We go 1, 2, 3, 4. So that gets us to negative 1. And when you're"
,,"starting to do this, you really understand what"
,,a negative number means. I really encourage you to
,,"visualize the number line, and really move"
,,along it depending on whether you're
,,adding and subtracting. Now let's do a couple more. Let's say I have 2 minus 8. And we'll think about more ways
,,"to do this in future videos. But once again, you just"
,,want to do the number line. You have a 0 here. Let me draw the
,,"spacing a little bit. So we have 0 here. We're at 1, 2. If we're subtracting"
,,"8, that means we're going to"
,,move 8 to the left. So we're going to go 1
,,"to the left, 2 the left. So we've gone 2 to"
,,the left to get to 0. We have to move how
,,"many more to the left? Well, we've already"
,,"moved 2 the left. To get to 8, we have to"
,,move 6 more to the left. So we're going to have to
,,"move 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 more to the left. Well, where is that"
,,"going to put us? Well, we were at 0. This is a negative 1, negative"
,,"2, negative 3, negative 4, negative 5, negative 6. So 2 minus 8 is negative 6. 2 minus 2 would be 0. When you're subtracting 8,"
,,you're subtracting another 6. So we'd go up to negative 6. We go 6 below 0. Let me do one more example. And this one will be a little
,,"less conventional for you, but hopefully it"
,,will make sense. And I'll do this in a new color. Let me take negative 4 minus 2. So we're starting at
,,"a negative number, and then we're"
,,"subtracting from that. And if this seems confusing,"
,,"just remember the number line. So this is 0 right here. This is negative 1, negative"
,,"2, negative 3, negative 4. So that's where we're starting. Now we're going to"
,,subtract 2 from negative 4. So we're going to
,,"move 2 to the left. So if we subtract 1, we"
,,"will be at negative 5. If we subtract another 1, we"
,,are going to be at negative 6. We are going to
,,be at negative 6. So this is negative 6. Let's do another
,,interesting thing. Let's start at negative 3. Let's say we have negative 3. Instead of subtracting something
,,"from that, let's add 2 to it. So where would this put"
,,us on the number line? So we're starting at negative
,,"3, and we're adding 2, so we're going to"
,,"move to the right. So you add 1, you"
,,become negative 2. But if you add another
,,"1, which we have to do, you become negative 1. You move 2 to the right. So negative 3 plus"
,,negative 2 is negative 1. And you can see for
,,yourself but this all fits our traditional notion
,,of adding and subtracting. If we start at negative
,,"1, and we subtract 2, we should get negative 3--"
,,kind of reverse of this thing up here. Negative 3 plus 2 gets us there. Then if we start
,,"then, we subtract 2, we should get back to negative"
,,"3, and we see that happens. If you start at negative"
,,"1 right over here, and you subtract 2--"
,,"you move 2 to the left-- you get back to negative 3. So hopefully, this"
,,starts to give you a sense of what it means to
,,"deal with, or add and subtract, negative numbers. But we're going to give"
,,a lot more examples in the next video. And we're actually
,,going to see what it means to subtract
,,a negative number.

Directed Numbers,CfkaifC7tGY,welcome to math with mr j in this video i'm going to cover how to add integers now when it comes to adding integers there are different strategies you can use in order to solve these so as we go through the four examples i'll give you a couple of different ways to think through these problems and get to that final answer so let's jump into number one where we have negative five plus seven and the strategy we're going to use first is at the top of the screen so the first thing we need to do 
,,is see if we have different signs or the same signs in the case of number one we have a negative five and a positive seven so we have different signs so we're going 
,,to look right here so what we need to do we need to find the absolute value of our integers and then we'll take the greater absolute value and subtract the smaller absolute value that's going to give us our answer we'll use the sign of the greater absolute value for that final answer so let's find our absolute values and remember absolute value is the distance from 0 the absolute value of negative 5 is 5 and the absolute value of 7 a positive 7 is 7. so we take the greater absolute value which would be 7 and subtract the smaller absolute value which is five seven minus five is two now we need to use the sign of the greater absolute value so the greater absolute value would be this seven here and in the original problem this 7 it's a positive 7 so that means our answer is going to be a positive 2. now the other strategy we can use would be using our overall number sense and knowledge of integers in order to solve this using mental math so let me rewrite the problem we have negative five plus seven so one way to think through this problem using mental math would be thinking okay we're starting at negative five and we're adding a positive seven so we are increasing in value well negative five plus a positive five gets us to zero but we have seven which is two more than that positive five so let's go two more than zero and we land on positive two now i do wanna mention i have a video that goes through how to add integers using a number line and this really helps visualize what's going on within these problems and it's going to help with mental math when it comes to adding integers i'll drop that link down in the description so let's move on to number two where we have a positive 20 plus a negative 12. so again we have different signs so let's find the absolute value of our integers here so the absolute value of 20 is 20 and the absolute value of negative 12 is 12. so we need to do the greater absolute value 20 minus the smaller absolute value of 12 and we get 8. so we need to use the sign of the greater absolute value so the greater absolute value is 20 and in the original problem it was a positive 20. so our answer is a positive 8. let's think through this using mental math as well so i'll rewrite the problem 20 plus negative 12. so we are starting at a positive 20 and we're adding a negative 12. so we are decreasing in value by 12 from 20. so we can almost think of this as 20 and we are taking away or subtracting 12 because we are decreasing in value so we would end up at a positive eight again we are going from a positive 20 and we are decreasing in value by 12 so we would land on a positive eight for our answer on to number three where we have negative 13 plus a negative four so we have the same signs here so we will look right here so we need to add the 
,,absolute values and use the same sign from the problem so let's find our absolute values here so the absolute value of negative 13 would be 13 and the absolute value of negative 4 would be 4. so we need to add the absolute values there so 13 plus 4 is 17. and we use the sign from the problem so the sign from the problem well negative 13 and negative 4 both negatives so our answer is negative 17. now using mental math well let's think negative 13 plus a negative 4. we are starting at a negative number negative 13 right and we are adding a negative 4. so we are decreasing in value or going down in value by 4. so if we start at negative 13 and decrease in value by 4 go down the number line to the left by 4 we end up at negative 17. and lastly number four we have negative 25 plus a negative eight so same signs again so we need to add the absolute values negative 25 has an absolute value of 25 and negative 8 has an absolute value of 8. so add those and we get 33 and use the same sign from the problem which they are both negative so our answer is negative so negative 33 mental math same thing as number three we are starting at a negative 25 and we're adding a negative eight so we are decreasing in value going further left on the number line and we end up at negative 33. so there you have it there are a couple of different strategies that you can use in order to add integers i hope that helped thanks so much for watching until next time peace

Directed Numbers,5NI0VX_KqFo,or so here what you're doing you can start off at the first number two okay so let's start right over here at two and when you subtract okay that means you're taking away right so when you subtract that means you're actually gonna be going backwards okay but when you work with negative numbers see the negative three here negative numbers actually tell you to do the opposite okay so if you're subtracting normally we would go backwards one two three because it's getting smaller but the negative number tells us to do the opposite so we're actually going to go instead of going backwards three we're going to go forwards three one two three and you can see we end up at five okay so we understand about negative numbers doing the opposite we understand how subtraction normally takes us backwards on the number line but I'm going to show you a shortcut and this will help you as you do more complicated problems what you can do is when you see a subtraction problem think of it as an addition problem so what we're going to do is subtraction is really like adding the opposite so if you change this from subtraction to addition you want to change this sign to the opposite if it's positive you make it negative if it's negative you make it positive now you can see we have a simple problem here it's just two plus three which we learned a long time ago that's just five right okay let's go to the next one negative three minus one okay one way to think about this is the number line 
,,you could start at negative three subtraction says we're gonna go to the left one place and we're at negative four right easy the other way to do it is we could say 
,,hmm subtraction is like adding the opposites if I change this I don't want to change the overall value of the problem I have to change this to the opposite so negative three plus negative one we can talk about the scale like we talked about in the previous video about comparing you know positive and negative numbers if we have a negative three plus negative one it's like stacking up three bricks on the left side plus another brick on the left side the scale is going to tilt to the left because it's heavier by 4 bricks okay there's nothing on the right to counterbalance it so we have negative four over here in this example negative four minus negative - so what I would do okay if you wanted to think of the number line we'd start off over here at negative four okay if we subtract we would go to the left right because subtracting is making the numbers smaller but we're working with a negative two negative numbers tell us to do the opposite so instead of going left - we're gonna 
,,go right - and that's gonna put us at negative two now it gets a little bit more complicated when you start having all these negatives in your problem so what I suggest and recommend after you have a feel for how positive and negative numbers work is just take this little shortcut and make subtraction like adding the opposite if you change this sign change this to the opposite and you've got it so we've got negative 4 plus 2 think about putting 4 bricks on this side 2 bricks on this side which way is it going to tilt well it's going to tilt to the heavier side right why because it's heavier by 2 okay 2 of these are gonna cancel out with two of these that would be balanced but it's actually heavier on that side by 2 and so you can see you're gonna have negative 2 it's tilting towards a negative side ok the last example here we're subtracting so that's like adding the opposite we have a negative 700 plus a negative 100 okay so you spend $700 + you spend another hundred dollars 
,,so far you've spent $800 so you've decreased whatever was in your account let's say by $800 so these are just some simple and easy and direct ways to work with positive and negative numbers when you're subtracting just think about changing it to adding the opposite and then you can use that scale analogy that I was showing you and you'll you'll have it so I'll see you in the next video

Directed Numbers,nZMMTK8aJKI,in this video we're going to talk about integers how to add subtract multiply and divide positive and negative integers so what is an integer an integer is a whole number that could be positive it can be zero or it can be negative these are all integers three-point-four is not an integer now how can we add two integers for example if you want to add 5 plus 3 this is pretty straightforward you know it's 8 but what you can use is the number line let's say 5 is at this position if you're adding you need to travel to the right of the number line and if you need to subtract move to the left of the number line so since we're adding 3 to 5 we need to travel three spaces so this is going to be 6 7 8 so 5 plus 3 is 8 now you can also do it in a reverse order 3 plus 5 is also 8 so what you could do is you can start at 3 and travel 5 spaces to the right 1 2 3 4 5 so this is 4 5 6 7 8 so three plus five is eight now what about 7 minus 4 we know 7 minus 4 is 3 so if you start at 7 and if 
,,you move three spaces to the left you're going to get 3 so this is going to be 6 I mean 4 spaces so left 6 5 4 3 so 7 minus 4 is 3 now what if you're dealing with negative numbers for example what is negative 8 plus 5 this is the same as plus 5 minus 8 or 5 on the same the answer is negative 3 so if we start with negative 8 put 
,,it on the left side and if we add 5 to it we need to go 5 units to the right so 1 2 3 4 5 this is negative 7 negative 6 negative 5 and negative 4 negative 3 so negative 8 plus 5 equals negative 3 for those of you who may not be familiar with the number line in the middle you have 0 to the right you have the positive numbers and 
,,to the left the numbers are negative so in the last example as you move to the right the numbers were decreasing meaning they're becoming less negative or on a number line they're increasing negative 1 is greater than negative 2 technically speaking now let's try this one what is negative 7 minus negative 4 and what is that equal to so you can start with negative 7 or negative 4 but I'm going to start with negative 7 so if we're subtracting by 4 we need to move 4 units to the left so this is going to be negative 8 negative 9 negative 10 negative 11 so negative 4 minus 7 is negative 11 now what about this example what's negative 6 minus negative 5 so if you have two negative signs next to each other it's going to turn into a positive sign so this is the same as a negative 6 plus 5 so let's start with negative 6 and let's add a 5 to it so we need to travel 5 units to the right 1 2 3 4 5 so this is negative 5 negative 4 negative 3 negative 2 and negative 1 so negative 6 plus 5 is negative 1 now let's say if you want to add to larger numbers let's say if you wish to add 32 and 45 the best way to do it is to line it up like this 45 plus 32 and then add 5 plus 2 is 7 4 plus 3 and 7 so 32 plus 45 is 77 now let's try another example what is 84 plus 69 so let's align the two numbers 4 plus 9 is 13 but only add the 3 at the bottom the one need to put it to the tens digit so 1 plus 8 is 9 9 plus 6 is 15 so this is 153 try this one 147 plus 60 or rather 78 by the way feel 
,,free to pause the video as you work on these examples so 7 plus 8 is 15 we need to carry over the 1 1 plus 4 is 5 5 plus 7 is 12 we need to carry over another one 1 
,,plus 1 is 2 so 147 plus 78 is 225 what about subtraction what is 76 minus 41 what is that equal to so you always want to put the larger number on top 6 minus 1 is 5 
,,7 minus 4 is 3 so 76 minus 41 is positive 35 now what if it's the reverse let's say if you're subtracting a large number by or a smaller number by a large number let's say 35 minus 89 so if you write it this way 5 minus 9 is a negative number and what are going to write negative 4 it's best to subtract it this way first now this is going to give you a positive answer but then just add the negative sign because you know 35 minus 89 is a negative result 8 minus 5 is 4 I mean 9 minus 5 is 4 excuse me 8 minus 3 is 5 so 89 minus 35 it's positive 54 so 35 minus 89 must be equal to negative 54 so this is the answer let's try another example so 42 minus 73 so 
,,we're going to write it this way 73-42 3 minus 2 is 1 7 minus 4 is 3 so if 73-42 is positive 31 then 42 minus 73 is negative 31 try this 154 - 37 so for this one we 
,,don't need to reverse because 54 is larger than 37 and we're going to get a positive result so notice that we can't do 4 minus 7 because that's going to give us negative 3 so what we need to do is we need to borrow a 1 from the 5 so the 5 will now become a 4 and the 4 is not will 14 so 14 minus 7 is 7 and 4 minus 3 is 1 so the answer is 17 let's try another example with that so 343 minus 156 so we can't do 3-6 that's a negative number so we need to borrow a 1 from the 4 so the 3 is now 13 13 minus 6 is 7 3 minus 5 is negative so we need to borrow a 1 so now the 3 is a 13 13 minus 5 is 8 2 minus 1 is 1 so 343 minus 156 is 187 now let's move on to multiplication what is 4 times 3 4 times 3 is the same as 3 times 4 which is equal to 12 now it will be nice if you have your multiplication tables memorized from 1 to 12 
,,it'll be very helpful but let's say if you don't know that how else can you find the value of 4 times 3 4 times 3 is equivalent to add in 4 3 times 4 plus 4 is 8 and 8 plus 4 is 12 so that's one way you can get the answer now 4 times 3 is also equal to 3 times 4 which is equivalent to add in 3 4 times 3 plus 3 is 6 the other 2/3 is will give you 6 as well and 6 plus 6 is 12 so either way you look at it 3 times 4 is 12 so let's say if we want to multiply 5 times 3 5 times 3 is 15 but you can get the answer by adding 5 3 times 5 Plus 5 is 10 and 10 plus the other 5 is 15 or you can add 3 5 times so now what is 4 times 6 4 times 6 is the same as 6 times 4 it's easier to add 6 4 times then to add 4 6 times so let's add 6 4 times 6 plus 6 is 12 and the other 2 6 is add up to 12 12 plus 12 is 24 so 6 times 4 is 24 so that's a simple technique that can help you to multiply small integer values now let's say if you want to multiply negative 5 times 6 first figure out what 5 times 6 is equal to overall the answer should be negative a negative times a positive number will give you a negative result when you multiply two positive numbers you're going to get a positive result and if you multiply two negative numbers the end result is positive so here we have negative 5 times positive 6 which should equal a negative number but first let's figure out what 5 times 6 is equal to so 5 times 6 let's add five six times still two 5s add to a 10 the next two 5s will add to another 
,,10 and the last two 5s add up to ten as well 10 plus 10 is 20 and 20 plus the other 10 is 30 so 5 times 6 is 30 so negative 5 times 6 is negative 30 now what about negative 4 times negative 5 if it's your in this way this means multiplication so we know the answer is positive so this is equivalent to a positive 4 times positive 
,,5 so let's add 5 4 times we know 5 Plus 5 is 10 and the other two 5s add up to 10 10 plus 10 is 20 so negative 4 times negative 5 is positive 20 now what if we're multiplying large numbers let's say if we want to find out what 8 times 16 is equal to this two ways we can do this one we can use the distributive property 16 is 10 plus 6 so 8 times 10 is 80 and 8 times 6 is 48 and then if you add 80 and 48 this will give you 128 now granted remember you can do it this way too you don't have to 
,,use a calculator 8 plus 0 is 8 4 plus 8 is 12 so you get 128 another way you can do it is you can multiply this way 8 times 6 is 48 so we need to carry over the 4 and then 1 times 8 is 8 plus the 4 is 12 so that's 128 so let's try some more examples what is 9 times 25 now one way in which you can do this is you can think of money what is the value of nine quarters if you think about it nine quarters is equal to 2.25 cents so 929 times 25 is 225 let's prove it so 20 is 20 plus 5 now what is 
,,9 times 20 if 9 times 2 is 18 then 9 times 20 is 180 you just got to add the zero and 9 times 5 is 45 so if we add these two numbers 5 and 0 is 5 8 + 4 is 12 1 + 1 is 2 so you got 225 or we can use the other technique 25 times 9 so first let's multiply 5 + 9 that's 45 so the 4 we need to carry it over and then 2 times 9 is 18 + 
,,4 that's 22 so you get 225 now what is 8 times 99 99 is 100 minus 1 so instead of using addition you can use subtraction so let's distribute 8 times 100 is 808 times negative 1 is negative 8 so what is 800 minus 8 800 minus 8 is 792 so 8 times 99 is 792 now let's use the other technique 99 times 8 so 9 times 8 is 72 let's carryover this 7 and then 8 times 9 is also 72 + 7 so that's 792 so you get the same answer now let's work on division what is 42 divided by 6 so 6 times what number is equal to 42 division is the opposite of multiplication if 6 times 7 is 42 then 42 divided by 6 is 7 let's try another one what is 45 divided by 5 so if it's written as a fraction it also is equivalent to the vision so 5 times what number is equal to 45 5 times 9 is 45 so 45 divided by 5 is 9 so that's the best way to perform division if you're dealing with small numbers but let's say if you're dealing with larger numbers for example what is 256 divided by 4 well let's start with 4 a not so large number let's use 64 divided by 4 let's start with that now one technique that you can use is you can simplify 64 into smaller numbers so you know that forty or four goes into forty and sixty four minus forty is 24 so if you separate sixty and so forty and twenty four it's easier to divide it since forty plus 24 is sixty-four now forty divided by 4 is 10 because 4 times 10 is 40 24 divided by four six since 4 times 6 is 24 and then add the two numbers so this is equal to 16 so now let's 
,,confirm the result with long division so you can also do it this way how many times does 4 go into 6 4 goes into 6 one time four times one is four and then subtract 
,,6 minus 4 is 2 and let's bring down the 4 and how many times does 4 go into 24 4 goes into 24 6 times and the remainder is 0 so therefore 64 divided by 4 is 16 now let's try the other example 256 divided by 4 so what would you do to simplify this result personally I would break it into 100 and 100 because 4 can go into 125 times 4 quarters is a dollar and 56 I would break it into 40 and 16 since 40 plus 16 is 56 so 100 plus 100 plus 40 plus 16 that's 256 100 divided by 4 is 25 you want to break into a number in which you know what that number is when divided by 4 40 divided by 4 we know it's 10 and 16 divided by 4 is 4 25 plus 25 is 50 10 plus 4 is 14 
,,50 plus 14 is 64 so 256 divided by 4 is 64 now let's confirm the answer with long division so how many times does four go into 25 4 goes into 25 6 times 4 times 6 is 24 and 25 minus 24 is 1 so now let's bring down the 6 how many times is 4 go into 16 4 goes into 16 4 times so the remainder is zero so therefore 256 divided by 4 is 64 long division is easier but the other way could be useful if you're doing it mentally

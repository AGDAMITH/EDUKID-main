Sets,aqsIWLqlDhE,"We are asked, what number set"
,,does the number 8 belong to? So this is actually
,,a good review of the different sets of numbers
,,that we often talk about. So the first set
,,under consideration is the natural numbers. And these are essentially
,,"the counting numbers, and you're not counting 0. So just if you were"
,,"actually to count objects, and you have at"
,,"least one of them, we're talking about"
,,"the natural numbers. So that would be 1, 2,"
,,"3, so on and so forth. So clearly, 8 is"
,,a natural number. You can count up to 8 here. You could count 8 objects. So 8 is a member of
,,the natural numbers. The next one we
,,"should consider, let's consider the whole"
,,numbers right over here. And I should say
,,natural numbers. So let's consider
,,the whole numbers. The whole numbers
,,are essentially the same thing as
,,"the natural numbers, but we're now"
,,"going to include 0. So this is 0, 1, 2,"
,,"3, so on and so forth. So clearly, 8 is one"
,,of these as well. You could eventually
,,"increment your way to 8, like you're just counting"
,,all of the whole numbers. Another way to view this is
,,the non-negative numbers. So 8 clearly belongs
,,to this as well. So let's expand our
,,set a little bit. Let's think about integers. Now these are all the
,,"numbers starting with, well you could keep counting"
,,"down, all the way up to negative 3, negative"
,,"2, negative 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, and you could just"
,,"keep going there. Now clearly, 8 is"
,,"one of these as well. You can just keep counting to 8. In fact, let me just"
,,"put our check box there. In general, you"
,,have your integers that contain both the positive
,,"and the negative numbers and 0, depending on"
,,whether you consider that positive or
,,"negative, or neither. So that's the integers,"
,,right over here. And then the whole numbers
,,is a subset of the integers. So I'll draw it like this. The whole numbers
,,"are right over here, that is the whole numbers. We've now excluded all"
,,of the negative numbers. So these are all the
,,non-negative numbers. All the non-negative
,,"integers, I should say. So these are the whole numbers. And then the natural numbers"
,,are a subset of that. It's essentially everything. So the only thing that's
,,in whole numbers that's not in the natural numbers
,,is just the number 0. So this whole area
,,right here just corresponds to the number 0. So it really should
,,be a bit of a point. So let me make it clear. This circle is
,,"the whole numbers, and then I have the"
,,"natural numbers, which is a subset of that. Obviously this isn't"
,,drawn to scale. The natural numbers
,,is a subset of that. 8 is a member of all of them. 8 is sitting right over here. So it's a member of the
,,"natural numbers, whole numbers, and the integers. Now let's keep expanding things. Let's talk about"
,,rational numbers. Now these are numbers that
,,"can be expressed in the form p over q, where both p"
,,"and q are integers. So can 8 be expressed this way? Well, you can express"
,,8 as 8 over 1. Or actually 16 over 2. Or you could just
,,"keep going, 32 over 4, you can express it as a"
,,"bunch of p's over q's, where both the p and q are integers. So it's definitely"
,,"a rational number. And in fact, all of these things"
,,over here are rational numbers. So let me draw. So this is all a subset
,,of rational numbers. So 8 is definitely a
,,"member of that as well. Rational numbers, so let me"
,,put the check box over here. Now what about
,,"irrational numbers? Irrational numbers. Well, by definition, these are"
,,numbers that are not rational. These are numbers that cannot
,,"be expressed in this form, where p and q are integers. So if something is rational,"
,,it just cannot be irrational. So 8 is not a member of
,,the irrational numbers. The irrational numbers are
,,just a completely separate set over here. So I would draw it like this. This area right over
,,"here, this would be the irrational numbers. Irrational. Rational is not a subset of"
,,"irrational, they are exclusive. You can't be in both sets. So that's irrational"
,,"right over there. And then finally let's ask, is"
,,8 a member of the real numbers? Now the real numbers are
,,essentially all of these. It's combining both the
,,rational and the irrational. So the real numbers is all
,,of this right over here. And so 8 is clearly
,,a member of the real. It's a member of the
,,"real, and within the real, you either can be rational or"
,,"irrational, 8 it is rational. It's an integer. It's a whole number. And it is a natural number. So it's definitely a"
,,member of the reals. And just to give
,,"you might be saying, hey well, what is an"
,,irrational number then? Can't almost every number
,,be represented like this? Or every number you can think
,,of be represented like this? And an example of maybe
,,"the most famous example of an irrational number is pi. Pi is equal to 3.14159, and"
,,people devote their lives to memorizing the digits of pi. But what makes this irrational
,,"is you can't represent it as a ratio, or as a"
,,"rational expression, of integers, the way you"
,,can for rational numbers. And this right here
,,is non-repeating. And if it was
,,"repeating, you actually could express it as"
,,"a ratio of integers, and we do that in other videos. It is non-repeating"
,,"and non terminating, so you never run out digits to"
,,the right of the decimal point. So this would be an example
,,of an irrational number. So pi would sit here
,,"in the irrationals. Anyway, hopefully you"
,,found that helpful

Sets,VBzlvKP-2yI,types of sets empty set singleton set finite set infinite set equal sets equivalent sets universal set subset proper subset superset proper superset powerset empty set a set with no element this is the symbol of an empty set let's name it set e another way of writing that is using the symbol the null set the cardinality of set e is equal to zero this notation simply means the number of elements singleton set assert with one element set s is a singleton set the cardinality of set s is one finite set a set with limited elements example set F is a set of counting numbers less than 6 the elements of set F are 1 2 3 4 5 the cardinality of set F is 5 infinite set a set width and limited elements example set n is the set of counting numbers the element subset n are 1 2 3 and so on the cardinality of set n is infinite equal sets two sets are equal if they have the same elements example set E is a set of letters in the word earth the element subset e r e a R th set H is a set of letters in the word heart the elements of set H are H E a R T set E and set H have the same elements they are equal sets set e equals set H equivalent sets equivalent sets have different elements but have the same number of elements example given set F and set H the cardinality of set F is 5 and the cardinality of set H is 5 the to sets have different elements but they have the same number of elements set F is equivalent to set H Universal set Universal set is the set containing all elements at 
,,which all other sets are subsets the universal set is represented by a capital letter you example let u be the universal set set u is the set of all flowers in the English alphabet all other sets are subsets of the universal set set a is a proper subset of set you set B is also a proper subset of set u all the elements of sets a and B are also found in the universal set another example set U is a set of counting numbers sets a B and C are proper subsets of set u because a universal set contains all the elements in a particular problem subset set a is a subset of set D if and only if every element in a is also an element in B here's an example list of the possible subsets upset a number-one asset with three elements two three four sets with one element five six seven sets with two elements in number eight is an empty set how many subsets does set a health to find the number of subsets use this formula two to the power of n where n is a number of elements the cardinality of set a is 3 so 2 to the power of 3 is just 2 times 2 times 2 equals 8 proper subset set a is a proper subset of set B if there is at least one element in B not contained in a in symbol set a is a proper subset of set B example given sets a B C and D set B is a proper subset of set a set C is a proper subset of set a set D is a proper subset of set a list all the proper subsets of set a set one to three have two elements sets four five six have one element and number seven is an empty set the set itself is not a proper subset of set a how many proper subsets does set a half since the set itself is not a proper subset the formula is 2 to the power of n minus 1 where n is the number of elements the cardinality of set a is 3 using the formula to ^ 3 minus 1 equals 8 minus 1 is 7 supper set supper set is a set containing all of the elements of another set symbol set a is a supper set of set B this is just a reverse of subset proper superset set a is a proper supper set of set B if set a is a superset of set B and set a is not equal to set B in symbol set a is a proper superset of set B given set a and set B well set B is a proper subset of set a 
,,set a is a proper superset of set B power set the set of all the subsets of a set what is the power set of set s EO Bess contains all the subsets of set s how many elements does the power set of set s have since the power set contains all the subsets of a given set it follows the formula two to the power of n where n is the number of elements so the number of elements of the OBS is two to the power of three which is equal to eight
,,
Sets,xZELQc11ACY,now let's say if we have set a which contain the elements two four five six and nine and we also have set B which contain the elements two three five six seven nine 
,,and ten so what is the intersection of set a and B how can we get the answer to find the intersection we need to find out which elements are common to both sets so both sets contain a two they contain a five a six and also a nine so therefore the intersection of sets a and B it's two three actually not three but two five six and nine and that's it so that's how you could find the intersection of two sets so now let's work on some more examples you can pause the video and try this one if you want to let me sum different letters so let's say this is set C and I contain the elements 3 4 6 7 and 10 and also set D which contain the elements 3 6 8 & 9 so feel free to pause the video and determine the intersection of sets C and D go ahead and try it so which elements are common to both sets so 3 is common to both sets 6 
,,and that's it so for this particular example it's only 3 & 6 so that's the intersection of the two sets so this is the answer let's try another example let's say set F contains the elements a B C D F G and J and set G contains the elements a C G H and K so what is the intersection between sets f and G so feel free to take a minute and try it so let's see which elements are shared between both sets so both sets contain element a element C G and that is it so the intersection of F and G is going to be a C and G so as you can see finding the intersection is pretty straightforward but now what about this particular example let's say set J contains the elements 5 7 10 and 11 and set K has the elements 2 4 8 and 13 what is the intersection of J and K now notice that there is no common element shared between the two sets the elements and J are completely different from the elements in K so in that case the intersection of J and K is going to be empty there's gonna be nothing inside 
,,so if there's nothing inside if you have an empty set you have a null set so this is the answer you have to use a Greek simple fine now let's say we have set R which contains the numbers 3 4 7 and 10 and set s which is basically an empty set what is the intersection of R and s the intersection of a set with numbers and an empty 
,,set there's going to be another empty set or a null set so that's it for this one now let's focus on a second type of problem that we need to talk about and that is 
,,to find a union of two sets so let's say that set a contains two elements 1 2 3 & 4 and set B contains the elements 3 4 5 & 6 so what is the union of these two sets 
,,I think of Union I think of combining these into a larger set now notice that we do have some common numbers 3 & 4 now the union will contain everything in both sets but 3 & 4 we're not going to write it twice only once so the union of set a and B is going to be 1 2 3 4 5 & 6 so we're gonna write everything in both sets but only write it once so let's try some other examples so let's say set C is 3 comma 5 comma 9 11 and 13 and set D is 2 3 6 8 and 12 go ahead and find a union between sets 
,,C and D go ahead and try that so all we got to do is just write all the numbers in C and E so let's put it in ascending order so we have a 2 of 3 there's a 5 a 6 there's no 7 so we have an 8 a 9 there's no 10 but we have an 11 12 and 13 and so that's it so that's the union of those two sets here's another example let's say that 
,,set J contains the letters a C D and E and that set K contains the letters a B f ing go ahead and determine the union between J and K so just like before all we need to do is write all the letters so we have an a a b c d e f and g and that's it for that question let's say that set x contains the numbers 2 5 8 12 and set Y let's 
,,say is an empty set what is the union of a set with numbers and an empty set well the empty set is not going to add anything it's like saying 15 plus 0 that's gonna 
,,be 15 so therefore the union of set X with an empty set Y is going to be the same as set X this to five eight and twelve it's not going to change but the intersection of a set with something and a set with nothing it's gonna be an empty set so just something to keep in mind now here's a question for you let's say if set a contains the numbers 3 4 5 and 7 and set B contains the numbers 2 4 5 & 8 how can you determine the intersection of a and B and a union of a and B and represent the results using a Venn diagram so circle a and circle B and it's separated form set a contains the numbers 3 4 5 and 7 B contains the numbers 2 4 5 and 8 now the intersection of these two I'm running out of space here is 4 & 5 4 & 5 are found in both but to represent that using Venn diagrams what we need to do is put the two circles together and draw it this way so this is set a and set B so in the middle is the intersection of a and B which contains these elements 4 & 5 now a also contains 3 & 7 & B also contains 2 & 8 but 4 & 5 is common to a and B so we put that in middle now the union of these two sets is basically everything it contains the numbers 2 3 4 
,,5 7 & 8 and I'm running out of space so this entire system with the two circles represents the union of a and B because it contains all the numbers 2 3 4 5 7 & 8 but the intersection is limited by this region here because it only contains the elements common to both sets so hopefully this helps you to see the relationship between intersection of sets and union of sets as a relates to Venn diagrams so that's it for this video thanks for watching and have a good day

Sets,Ksu1lo312BM,Consider the numbers
,,"1/3, 7, and negative 15. To which sets of"
,,"numbers, listed below, does each of these"
,,numbers belong? And they give us a bunch of
,,"different sets of numbers. And we could just review these. The natural numbers,"
,,and you'll see this used in different
,,"contexts in different places, but for the sake of"
,,"this video, we'll assume this is counting numbers,"
,,"and it does not equal 0. So the natural numbers are 1,"
,,"2, 3, 4, and so on and so forth. We'll assume that the whole"
,,"numbers are essentially the natural numbers plus 0. So the whole numbers are 0, 1,"
,,"2, 3, 4, so on and so forth. The integers we'll assume"
,,it's the whole numbers plus the opposite of
,,"the natural numbers, or the negative version"
,,of the natural numbers. So we would go from
,,"very negative values to maybe negative 4,"
,,"negative 3, negative 2, negative 1, 0, 1, 2, 3,"
,,"4, so on and so forth. Rational numbers. These are numbers"
,,that can be expressed as the ratio of two integers. So a rational number
,,"can be expressed as m over n, where both m"
,,"and n are integers. And of course n cannot be 0,"
,,"because anything divided by 0 is not defined. M could be 0, and in fact,"
,,"0 is a rational number, because 0 can be"
,,"represented as 0 over 1. Or really 0 over 2, or 0 over 3. I think you get the idea. Or 0 over negative 537. These are all"
,,"representations of 0, and you have an integer"
,,"in the numerator, integer in the denominator. So 0 is definitely"
,,"a rational number. You just can't have n, you can't"
,,"have the denominator, be 0. Irrational numbers are numbers"
,,that cannot be expressed in this way. And so common versions
,,of irrational numbers are numbers that you will never
,,"see digits that repeat on, go on and on forever, or have"
,,series of sequences of numbers that keep repeating
,,on and on and on. And examples of irrational
,,"numbers are square root of 2, or pi. And the ratio of the"
,,"circumference, the diameter of a circle, or you might learn"
,,"about the irrational number e, which is 2.71. And it keeps going,"
,,and it doesn't repeat. And then real numbers are
,,really all of these combined. If you combine the
,,irrational numbers and the rational
,,"numbers, then you are talking about"
,,the real numbers. Every real number is either
,,rational or irrational. So let's classify
,,what we have up here. 1/3 over here-- let me do that
,,"in a different color-- so 1/3, is it a natural number? Well no, it's not. It's not just a natural"
,,"counting number. Is it a whole number? No, it's not a whole number,"
,,"it's in fact a fraction. Is it an integer? No once again, it"
,,is not an integer. Is it a rational number? Well sure it is. It can be represented
,,"as 1 over 3. Both 1 and 3 are integers. So 1/3 is rational. And if something is rational,"
,,it cannot be irrational. There's nothing that's both
,,rational and irrational. This literally
,,means not rational. And it is also a real number. Pretty much all of these are
,,"going to be real numbers. Now, let's try 7 out. So the number 7, it"
,,is a natural number. It is just a regular
,,counting number. It is a whole number. Any natural number is also
,,going to be a whole number. And anything that is a
,,natural number that's also going to be a whole number
,,is also going to be an integer. So this is also an integer. And anything that is a natural
,,"number, a whole number, and integer, is also going"
,,"to be a rational number. And to see that, you"
,,"can write 7 as 7 over 1. In fact, you can"
,,"write any integer as that number over 1, which"
,,hopefully makes it obvious that that is also
,,"a rational number. And if it's rational,"
,,you can't be irrational. That literally
,,"means not rational. And then of course,"
,,you're going to be real. It's going to be a real number. And you're going
,,to appreciate later on in your mathematical
,,careers why we even go through the trouble of
,,saying it's a real number. Because as far as
,,"it seems right now, this kind of includes"
,,all the numbers. What you're going to
,,"see in the future is, we're going to start"
,,defining numbers that don't fall into this category. And they're a little bit
,,"philosophically interesting as well. But anyway, back to the problem. We have a negative 15. Negative 15 is not a natural"
,,"number, it's a negative number. So it's not a natural"
,,"number, natural number is only the positive"
,,"integers, we could say. Whole number, it's"
,,"not a whole number, because that's just the"
,,natural numbers and 0. It is an integer. It is the opposite
,,"of positive 15. It is an integer. It is rational, it can be"
,,"represented as 15 over 1. So it is a rational. And because it is rational,"
,,"it cannot be rational. And of course, it is also real. And we are done."

Sets,FLgiccWl434,in this video we're gonna work on some practice problems that focuses on writing sets using set-builder notation and the roster method so let's start with this problem write the set of natural numbers that is less than 6 in roster notation and in set builder notation so first we need to know what exactly are natural numbers natural numbers are integers that start with 1 and go up so natural numbers are basically positive numbers so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 these are all natural numbers 0.5 is not a 
,,natural number 0 or negative 8 is not a natural number now we want to write this in a set where it's less than 6 so we should only include 1 2 5 because 5 is less than 6 so we're not including 6 so first let's write it in roster notation in roster notation you simply need to list the elements set a contains the elements 1 2 3 4 
,,& 5 then we need to contain the elements use in braces so that's how you can describe set a using roster notation now let's describe it using set builder notation so a is the set of all X such that X is a natural number and we need to describe the limits of these values X is greater than or equal to 1 but it's less than or equal to 5 so that's how we can describe this set using set-builder notation so let's go ahead and work on some more examples number 2 write the set of whole numbers that is less than 8 in roster notation and in set builder notation so whole numbers are natural numbers but they also include 0 so 0 1 2 3 4 these are all whole and we only want it less than eight so we need to stop at seven so that's the list and let's use B as the name of the set so in roster notation set B contains the elements 0 1 2 3 all the way up to 7 so in roster notation you just simply need to list the elements in the set now let's describe it using set builder notation so we could say that B is the set of all X such that X is a whole number I'm going to use a W to represent a whole number and also X is equal to or greater than 0 but it's less than 8 as we have it in a beginner the problem now I could also say that X is equal to or greater than 0 but it's also less than or equal to 7 so both of these inequalities or compound inequalities they will describe this set of numbers so you can use this one or you can use that one doesn't matter however you do need to say that 
,,X is a whole number number 3 I'll write the set of integers that is greater than negative 4 but less than or equal to 5 used in both notations so integers can be positive or negative and they include 0 now the integer that is greater than negative 4 is negative 3 and then we have negative 2 negative 1 0 1 2 now has to be less than or equal to 5 so it includes 5 so that's the list of numbers that we have so let's use set C so in roster notation set C will contain these elements now what about in set-builder notation how can we describe it so we could say that set C or C is the set of all X's such that X is an integer I'm going to use I to describe integer and it's between negative 3 & 5 or I could say that it's greater than negative 4 but it's less than or equal to 5 so both ways work so now you know how to describe a set using set-builder notation or using the roster method number 4 write the set of positive even numbers that is less than 15 using both notations so let's use 
,,D as the name of the set and let's start with the roster notation so even numbers they have to be positive 2 is a positive even number 4 6 8 10 now we're gonna stop 
,,at 14 because it has to be less than 15 and 15 is an odd number so this is the list in Ross notation now let's describe set D using set-builder notation now instead 
,,of using the letter X I'm gonna use 2x because the numbers differ by 2 now I'm still gonna say that X is in this case we can use a natural number all of these are natural numbers and X has to be between 1 & 7 now let's make sense of this when X is 1/2 X will have a value of 2 2 times 1 is 2 and when X is 7 2 times 7 will give us the value of 14 and so from 1 to 7 we'll get the numbers 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 so when X is 2 2 X or 2 times 2 will be 4 when X is 3 2 times 3 will give us 6 when X is 4 2 times 4 will give us 8 and so forth and so that's it for this problem so that's how you can describe this set using the rostov method and a set builder notation number 5 write the set of odd numbers that is greater than or equal to negative 7 but less than 5 so let's use the letter G and let's start with frost notation now it's greater than or equal to negative 7 and negative 7 is simply a negative odd number negative 5 is also an odd number and then we have negative 3 negative 1 1 now we cannot include 5 it has to be less than 5 it's not equal to it so we need to stop at 3 so that's set g and ross notation now let's describe set g in set builder notation so once again we simply need to use 2x as opposed to X but for odd numbers we're going to add 1 to it so we're gonna say 2x plus 1 because if we simply use 2x we're going to get even numbers but if you want odd numbers use 2x plus 1 because the numbers still differs by 2 now we're gonna say that X is an integer because these are not natural numbers they're integers and at the same time we need to say X is between two numbers now which two numbers should we use to find it two numbers 
,,what we're gonna do is set a negative seven equal to two x plus one so let's start by doing that first so I'm going to subtract both sides by one negative seven minus one is two negative eight and that's equal to two x and then divide by two negative 8 divided by 2 is 4 so X has to be equal to or greater than negative 4 that's the first number now let's find the second number so we're going to set 2x plus 1 equal to the last number of the set that Street and so let's subtract both sides by 
,,1 3 minus 1 is 2 and then if we divide both sides by 2 X is 1 so X has to be between negative 4 and 1 so if we were to plug in negative 4 into this 2 times negative 
,,4 is negative 8 plus 1 that will give us negative 7 if we plug in the next number in this list that's negative 3 2 times negative 3 is negative 6 plus 1 that will give us a negative 5 and so this equation will describe this set of numbers when these numbers are plugged in into that expression so for example if I plug in x equals 0 2 times 0 is 0 plus 1 that will give me this number if I plug in negative 1 for X 2 times a negative 1 is negative 2 plus 1 that will give me negative 1 and if I 
,,plug in the last one positive 1 2 times 1 is 2 plus 1 that will give me the last number positive 3 and so you want to make sure that you have the right algebraic expression plus the values of x that go into it that will produce an output that gives you this these set of numbers and so that's it for number 5 6 right the set of positive prime numbers that is less than 12 so let's use K as the name of the set and let's do so in roster notation so 1 is a prime number and it's positive 3 actually 2 is a prime number 3 is a prime number 4 is not a prime number because 2 times 2 is 4 5 is a prime number and then we have 7 9 is not a problem number because 3 times 3 is 9 and 4 10 2 times 5 is 10 so that's not a prime number 11 is a prime number and we have to stop here it has to be less than 12 now how can we describe it 
,,using set-builder notation so let's say that K is the set of all numbers X now it's gonna be hard to write an equation that will describe these numbers so if it's difficult to write the equation use words so we could say X is a prime number and then we could say that X is between 1 and 11 or we could say that X is less than 12 both cases will be fine and that's it so if you can't come up with a mathematical expression that will describe this pattern of numbers use words keep it simple so here is the last problem of this video write a set of positive perfect square numbers that is less than 120 so let's use R as the name of the set so 1 is a perfect square 4 is a perfect square 9 is a perfect square the reason why 4 is a perfect square is because 2 times 2 is 4 or 2 squared is 4 3 squared is 9 so 9 is a perfect square what is the next perfect square in the list 4 times 4 is 16 so that's the next perfect square 5 squared is 25 6 squared is 36 7 squared is 49 8 squared is 64 9 squared is 81 10 squared is 100 11 squared is 121 but that's greater than 120 so we're gonna stop here and so those are the positives perfect square numbers that is less than 120 now let's describe the set using set-builder notation so what expression in terms of X describes these numbers it's going to be x squared and X we could say is a natural number the lowest x value that we have is 1 1 is a natural number and X is between 1 and 10 because if we plug in 1 1 squared will give us 1 and if we plug in 10 10 squared will give us 100 so any number that we plug in between 1 and 10 where it's a natural number not a decimal or a fraction it will give us all of the numbers in this set and so that's it

Sets,jAfNg3ylZAI,What I want to do in this
,,video is familiarize ourselves with the notion
,,of a set and also perform some operations on sets. So a set is really just a
,,"collection of distinct objects. So for example, I could have"
,,a set-- let's call this set X. And I'll deal with
,,numbers right now. But a set could
,,contain anything. It could contain colors. It could contain people. It could contain other sets. It could contain cars. It could contain farm animals. But the numbers will be
,,"easy to deal with just because-- well, they're numbers. So let's say I have"
,,"a set X, and it has the distinct objects in it,"
,,"the number 3, the number 12, the number 5, and the number 13. That right there is a set. I could have another set. Let's call that set Y."
,,I didn't have to call it Y. I could have called it A.
,,I could have called it Sal. I could have called it a
,,bunch of different things. But I'll just call it Y. And let's say that set
,,"Y-- it's a collection of the distinct objects, the"
,,"number 14, the number 15, the number 6, and the number 3. So fair enough, those are"
,,just two set definitions. The way that we typically
,,do it in mathematics is we put these
,,little curly brackets around the objects that
,,are separated by commas. Now let's do some basic
,,operations on sets. And the first operation that I
,,will do is called intersection. And so we would
,,say X intersect-- the intersection of X
,,and Y-- X intersect Y. And the way that I
,,"think about this, this is going to"
,,yield another set that contains the elements
,,that are in both X and Y. So I often view this
,,"intersection symbol right here as ""and."" So all of the things that"
,,"are in X and in Y. So what are those things going to be? Well, let's look at"
,,both sets X and Y. So the number 3 is in set
,,"X. Is it in set Y as well? Well, sure. It's in both. So it will be in the"
,,"intersection of X and Y. Now, the number 12, that's"
,,in set X but it isn't at Y. So we're not going
,,"to include that. The number 5, it's"
,,"in X, but it's not in Y. And then we have"
,,"the number 13 is in X, but it's not in Y. And so over"
,,"here, the intersection of X and Y, is the set that"
,,only has one object in it. It only has the number
,,3 So we are done. The intersection
,,"of X and Y is 3. Now, another common"
,,operation on sets is union. So you could have
,,the union of X and Y. And the union I often view--
,,"or people often view-- as ""or."" So we're thinking about"
,,all of the elements that are in X or Y. So
,,in some ways you can kind of imagine that
,,we're bringing these two sets together. So this is going to
,,be-- and the key here is that we care-- a set is a
,,collection of distinct objects. And the way we're
,,"conceptualizing things right here, this"
,,is the number 3. This isn't like
,,somebody's score on a test or the number of
,,apples they have. So there you could
,,have multiple people with the same number of apples. Here we're talking about
,,"the object, the number 3, so we can only have a 3 once. But a 3 is in X or Y,"
,,so I'll put a 3 there. A 12 is in X or Y. A 5 is in
,,X or Y. The 13 is in X or Y. And just to simplify
,,"things, we really don't care about order if"
,,we're just talking about a set. I've just put all of the
,,things that are in set X here. And now let's see what we
,,have to add from set Y. So we haven't put a 14 yet. So let's put a 14. We haven't put a 15 yet. We haven't put the 6 yet. And we already have
,,a 3 in our set. So there you go. You have the union of X and Y. And one way to visualize sets
,,and visualize intersections and unions and more
,,"complicated things, is using a Venn diagram. So let's say this whole box"
,,is-- you could view that as the set of all numbers. So that's all the
,,numbers right over there. We have set X-- I'll just draw
,,as circle right over here. And I could even draw
,,the elements of set X. So you have 3 and
,,5 and 12 and 13. And then we can draw
,,"set Y. And notice, I drew a little overlapping"
,,here because they overlap at 3. 3 is an element in
,,both set X and set Y. But set Y also has the
,,"numbers 14, 15, and 6. And so when we're talking"
,,"about X intersect Y, we're talking about where"
,,the two sets overlap. So we're talking about this
,,region right over here. And the only place that they
,,overlap the way I've drawn it is at the number 3. So this is X
,,intersect Y. And then X union Y is the combination
,,of these two sets. So X union Y is
,,literally everything right here that
,,we are combining. Let's do one more
,,"example, just so that we make sure we understand"
,,intersection and union. So let's say that I have set
,,"A. And set A has the numbers 11, 4, 12, and 7 in it. And I have set B, and it has"
,,"the numbers 13, 4, 12, 10, and 3 in it. So first of all,"
,,let's think about what A-- let me do that in A's color. Let's think about
,,"what A intersect B is going to be equal to. Well, it's the things"
,,that are in both sets. So I have 11 here. I don't have an 11 there. So that doesn't make
,,the intersection. I have a 4 here. I also have a 4 here. So 4 is in A and B. It's in A
,,"and B. So I'll put a 4 here. The number 12, it's in A and"
,,"B. So I'll put a 12 here. The number 7 is only in A. And the number, I"
,,"guess, 13, 10 and 3 is only in B, so we're done. The set of 4 and 12 is the"
,,"intersection of sets A and B. And we could even,"
,,"if we want to, we could even label"
,,this as a new set. We could say set C is the
,,"intersection of A and B, and it's this set"
,,right over here. Now let's think about union. Let's think about A-- I
,,want to do that in orange. Let's think about
,,A union B. What are all the elements
,,"that are in A or B? Well, we can just literally put"
,,"all the elements in A, 11, 4, 12, 7. And then put the things in"
,,"B that aren't already in A. So let's see, 13. We already put the 4 and"
,,"the 12, a 10 and a 3. And I could write this"
,,in any order I want. We don't care about order if
,,we're thinking about a set. So this right here is the union.
,,
Sets,fLMN0wtiz-4,all right so this video we're gonna look at sets and we're gonna talk about Union intersection and complement alright so let's talk about what each one is if we're given a set a and a universal set u the universal set is the set that contains everything okay and the set of all elements of you that do not belong to a is called the complement of set a and the way we write it is with this a prime here okay so so basically if you have a if you have a universal set u and you have a set a and a has some elements in it well every element that is not in this one in a but as in the universal set that's the complement of a and I'm gonna do some examples so I've 
,,got about eight examples to work alright so and then we have the intersection so given two sets a and B to set all of all elements that belong to both set sets a and B is called the intersection of the two sets and this is how we write it a intersect B and then this and then the set of all elements belonging to set a or to set B or to both sets it's called the you get of the two sets and we write it like this a union B so intersection is basically if you want to find the intersection of two sets it's the elements they have in common and the union of two sets so if you have two sets and you want the union it's just every element that's in both sets combined into one set okay so let's go ahead and get started on the example so you can see I've got about I've got eight examples to work alright so let's look at this so we want to find the complement of a well here we have the Universal set so the universal set Taine's of tech contains the set of numbers of the numbers 1 through 10 here's set a 1 3 5 7 set B and set C all right so we want the complement of a so the complement remember the complement of a is all of the elements that are not in set a but are in the universal set so you see how set a contains the numbers 1 3 5 and 7 okay so if you see that C 1 3 5 & 7 those are the elements that are in set 
,,a well which elements are not in set a but are in the universal set well you see that's 2 4 6 8 9 and 10 so the complement of a would be 2 4 6 8 9 and 10 and there's your answer okay all right so let's look at a let's look at the next one the complement of B okay so the complement of B is everything that's in the universal set that's not in set B so let's see what's in B so we've got what 3 4 5 6 so 3 4 5 6 8 and 10 8 and 10 ok so this would be what 1 2 1 2 let's see 7 & 9 and so that's the complement of B all right now let's look at a intersect B all right so a intersect B we look at sets a and we look at sets B set a and B now we want to know what do these sets have in common well let's see well B does not have a 1 so we look at the 3 well B has a 3 so there's one element that they haven't three let's see five yeah there's a 5 here and a 5 here and then seven well B doesn't have a seven so the only elements they have in common is three and five so this would be 3 5 and then a union B well all that is I mean this alright so a union B that's all of the elements from sets a and B combined into one set so we've got a 1 a 3 and C B has a 3 
,,but we only write it one time you don't write it twice ok so 1 3 and then let's say we've got a 4 here and then a 5 and then let's see there's a 6 just try to keep the numbers in order 6 and then we've got 7 8 and 10 and so there's a union B there's a union B all right now let's look at this one we've got the complement of a intersect B all right so let me go ahead I'm gonna erase this I have some room to work because we're gonna have to I'll have to do a little more work with these all right so I'm gonna bring this up just a little bit alright so what we want to do here is I need the complement of a and B okay so I need to know what elements does a complement and B have in common well I don't have the complement of a I know we had it right here but I erased it but let's go ahead and write it down so the complement of a is equal to so remember that's going to be what 2 4 6 8 9 and ten so there's the compliment of a make sure got everything one three five seven one three five 
,,seven so yeah that looks right all right so now I want to know what does a compliment and B have in common so here's a compliment here's a B well let's underline the numbers they have in common so let's say they've got a four in common okay they've got a six in common and they've got eight in common and they have a 10 in common 
,,and so those are the values they have in common so this set would be let's see that's gonna be what four six eight 10 and so there's a complement intersect B all right all right now let's look at the next one we've got a intersect B Union C okay a intersect B Union C so what we're gonna do here is notice that this is in parentheses so we need to do this first and then do the intersection with a okay so first I need to find B Union C okay so that's all the elements from B and C combined into one set that's what Union means so we've got a 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and 10 that's all the elements from both sets combined into one and yes they both have a 4 but you only write it once don't write it two times don't write it twice okay so there's B Union C so what I want to do is I want to take this set here and intersect it with a so I need to know what elements does this set and this set have in common okay so let's see well we can let's let's underline what they have in common that might make it a little easier so let's see well they both have a three they both have a five and they both have a seven okay and so that would be the answer here that would be three five seven and there's a intersect B Union C okay all right so let's look at the next one all right so we've got a union B intersect C so once again we need to do what's in the parenthesis first okay so I need B intersect C so remember B intersect C that's what these two sets have in common okay I'm finding this first so 
,,let's look what does B and C have in common well let's say they both say they both have a for they both have a 6 and they both have an 8 okay so the intersection of 
,,B and C would be 4 6 8 okay and now what I want to do I want to do this set Union a see a Union the B intersect C alright so remember Union that's everything in this set or everything in this set plus everything in this set combined into one set so that would be what one three four five six seven and eight and you can see here nothing they didn't have the same number in both sets so it was just every element okay alright so let's take a look at the last one all right so I need I need a intersect B Union C complement okay so once again I need to find what's in this first inside the parenthesis the union of B and the complement of C all right so let's see what we get we get B Union C complement all right so remember Union that's everything in this set and oh and everything in C complement well we don't have C complement so look we got to find that first don't we all right so remember the complement that's everything that's in the universal set that's not in set C so let's see let's just cross out what's in set C so that's the to the for the six seven and eight those are the elements in C but the can remember the complement that's everything that's in here that's not in here so that's going to be what one three five nine and ten okay so now I can do the intersection of B and C complement I'm sorry not 
,,the intersection but the Union I can do the union of B and C complement so the union is going to be everything and set B plus everything and C complement combined into one set so let's see we've got what a 1 a 3 4 5 6 4 5 6 8 9 and 10 that's everything from both sets combined into one set and like I've said before the 10 appears in both of them you only write at once if the number appears in both of them you only write at once all right so here's here's the set in the parentheses here now I want to do the intersection of a and this set so it's gonna be a intersect this set so let's just mark off what they have in common so they both have a 1 they both 
,,have a 3 they both have a 5 put a comma there but they don't but both of them do not have a 7 okay so the only ones the only elements they have in common is 1 3 & 5 
,,so this set would be 1 3 5 okay so I hope that helped check out my other videos give me a like share and subscribe and thanks for watching

Sets,0ZKtsUkrgFQ,What I
,,want to do in this video is think about all of
,,"all the different ways that we can represent data. So right over here, we have a list of, and I'm just using this as one form of data, a list of students' scores on, say, the last test, so"
,,"Amy got 90 percent right, Bill got 95 percent right, Cam got 100 percent right, Efra also got 100 percent right, and Farah got 80 percent right. This is one way to show data. Remember, data is just"
,,"recorded information, and it could be numeric like this, it could be quantitative,"
,,"so you're recording actual numbers, or it could even be things you could record data on"
,,"how do they like the test, and they could have scored it based on, I really liked it, I kind of liked it, I didn't like it, or they might have rated it on a scale of zero to five, which would have been numbers, but it's numbers that are"
,,"measuring peoples' opinions, as opposed to, here, we have numbers that are measuring their actual scores. So there's all different types of data, and I don't want to get into all of that, but let's just start thinking about different ways to represent this data. So this is one way, you could view this as a table where you have the name, and then you have the score. So you have your name column, and then you have your score column. And I can construct it as a table, so clearly, it looks like a table. Like that, that's one way, one very common way of representing data, just like that. That's actually how most"
,,"traditional databases record data, in tables like this. But you could also do it in other ways. So you could record it as a... Often times called a bar graph, or sometimes, a histogram, so you could put score on"
,,"the vertical axis here, and then you could have"
,,"your names over here. And let's see the scores, let's see, maybe we'll make this a 50. Actually, let me just mark them off. So this is 10, 20, 30, that's too big. 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, so that's... And then 100, so that's 100. One, two, three, four, five, that would be 50 right over there, and then you can go person by person. So Amy got a 90 on the exam, so the bar will go up to 90. So that is Amy, and then you have Bill, got a 95, so it's going to be between 90 and 100, so it's going to be right over there. Bill got a 95, and so it'll look like this. Bill, so that is Bill. And then you have Cam,"
,,"who got 100, on the exam. So, make sure, you see"
,,"I'm hand drawing it, so it's not as precise as if I were to do it on a computer. So this right over there,"
,,"that is Cam's score. Efra got the same score as Cam, so her score is going to be, let me do that in Efra's color, and that's Efra's score right there. She also got 100. So, Efra... Efra, and then finally, Farah got an 80, so 60, 70, 80, so Farah got an 80. So this is Farah's score right over here. So this is another way"
,,"of representing the data, and here we see it in visual form, but it has the same information. You can look up someone's name, and then figure out their score. Amy scored a 90, Bill scored a 95, Cam scored 100, Efra also scored 100, Farah scored an 80. And there's even other ways you can have some of this information. In fact sometimes, you might"
,,"not even know their names, and so then it would be less information but (mumbles) a list of scores. The professor might say,"
,,"Hey, here are the five scores that people got on the exam."" And they were listed 90, 95, 100... 100, and 80, now, if it was listed, this"
,,"was all the data you got, this is less information than the data that's in this bar"
,,"graph, or this histogram, or the data that's given in this table right over here, because here, not only do we know the scores, but"
,,"we know who got what score. Here, we only know the list of scores, but there's even other ways, and this is not an exhaustive video of all of the different ways     "
,,"you can represent data. You can also represent data by looking at the frequency of scores. So, the frequency of"
,,"scores right over here, so instead of writing the people, you could write the scores. So let's see, you could say this is 80, 85, 90, 95, and 100, and then you could record the frequency that"
,,people got these scores. So how many times do we
,,"have a score of an 80? Well, Farah is the only"
,,"person with a score of 80, so you put one data point there. No one got an 85, one person got a 90, so you put a data point there. One person got a 95, so you can put that data point right over there. And then two people got 100. So this is one and two. Let's see the other 100 is in this color, so I'll just do it in the color. You wouldn't necessarily have"
,,"to color code it like this. So this is another way to represent, and this axis, you could"
,,"just view it as the number. So this tells you how many 80s there were, how many 90s there are, how many 95s, and how many 100s. So this right over here, has the same data as this list of numbers. It's just another way of looking at it. And once you have your data arranged in any of these ways, we can start to ask interesting questions. We can ask ourselves things like, well, what is the range of data? What is the range in the data? And the range is just the spread between the lowest point  "
,,"and the highest point. So the range in this data, is going to be the difference between the highest score, and the highest scores are 100, and the lowest score, an 80, so the range is"
,,"going to be the difference between the max, minus the min. The maximum score minus the minimum score. So it's going to be 100 minus 80 is equal to 20, so that       "
,,"gives you a sense of things, it kind of gives you a sense of spread. You could also ask yourself, well, how many people scored below 100? And these are just interesting questions. Below 100, and you can actually answer that question, well, actually, you could have answered"
,,either of these questions with any of these different
,,"ways of looking at the data. If you say, how many"
,,"people scored below 100? Well, one, two, three? How many people scored below 100? Well, 100 is up here, so it's giong to be one, two, three. How many people scored below 100? One, two, three. How many people scored below 100? One, two, three. And so, any way you look at it, you would have gotten three. And you could also ask yourself, what is the most frequent score? So, most frequent. And once again, you could"
,,answer that question with any of these ways of
,,"representing this data. You could look at our original table and you say, look, there's only one 90, one 95, one 80, there's two 100s. So you'd say look, the        "
,,"most frequent score is 100. You'd see that over here too, you actually have two"
,,"100s, there's only one of each of the other scores. Here you also see the 200s, and here is probably the clearest if you're looking at frequency. Sometimes this might be"
,,"called a frequency plot. It's often called a frequency plot. And you see here, the most frequent one is the one that has the most dots on it which is 100. So anyway, that's just a very, high level overview of how you can look at data in different ways to represent data, but the one thing I really"
,,"want you to get from this, is that these are all different ways of representing the same data. And we could probably invent other ways of doing it as well"
,,
Sets,Uz0MtFlLD-k,Is the relation given by the
,,set of ordered pairs shown below a function? So before we even attempt
,,"to do this problem, right here, let's just remind"
,,ourselves what a relation is and what type of relations
,,"can be functions. So in a relation, you"
,,have a set of numbers that you can kind of view as
,,the input into the relation. We call that the domain. You can view them as
,,the set of numbers over which that
,,relation is defined. And then you have
,,a set of numbers that you can view as the
,,"output of the relation, or what the numbers that can"
,,"be associated with anything in domain, and we"
,,call that the range. And it's a fairly
,,"straightforward idea. So for example, let's say that"
,,"the number 1 is in the domain, and that we associate the"
,,number 1 with the number 2 in the range. So in this type of
,,"notation, you would say that the relation"
,,has 1 comma 2 in its set of ordered pairs. These are two ways of
,,saying the same thing. Now the relation can also
,,"say, hey, maybe if I have 2, maybe that is associated"
,,with 2 as well. So 2 is also associated
,,"with the number 2. And so notice, I'm just building"
,,a bunch of associations. I've visually drawn
,,them over here. Here I'm just doing
,,them as ordered pairs. We could say that we
,,have the number 3. 3 is in our domain. Our relation is
,,"defined for number 3, and 3 is associated with,"
,,"let's say, negative 7. So this is 3 and negative 7. Now this type of"
,,"relation right over here, where if you give me any"
,,"member of the domain, and I'm able to tell you exactly"
,,"which member of the range is associated with it, this is"
,,"also referred to as a function. And in a few seconds,"
,,I'll show you a relation that
,,"is not a function. Because over here, you pick"
,,"any member of the domain, and the function really"
,,is just a relation. It's really just an
,,"association, sometimes called a mapping between"
,,members of the domain and particular
,,members of the range. So you give me any
,,"member of the domain, I'll tell you exactly which"
,,"member of the range it maps to. You give me 1, I say, hey,"
,,"it definitely maps it to 2. You give me 2, it definitely"
,,"maps to 2 as well. You give me 3, it's definitely"
,,associated with negative 7 as well. So this relation is both a--
,,it's obviously a relation-- but it is also a function. Now to show you a relation
,,"that is not a function, imagine something like this. So once again, I'll"
,,"draw a domain over here, and I do this big, fuzzy"
,,cloud-looking thing to show you that I'm not
,,showing you all of the things in the domain. I'm just picking
,,"specific examples. And let's say that this big,"
,,fuzzy cloud-looking thing is the range. And let's say in this
,,relation-- and I'll build it the same way that
,,"we built it over here-- let's say in this relation,"
,,1 is associated with 2. So let's build the
,,set of ordered pairs. So 1 is associated with 2. Let's say that 2
,,"is associated with, let's say that 2 is"
,,"associated with negative 3. So you'd have 2,"
,,negative 3 over there. And let's say on top of
,,"that, we also associate, we also associate 1"
,,with the number 4. So we also created
,,an association with 1 with the number 4. So we have the ordered
,,"pair 1 comma 4. Now this is a relationship. We have, it's defined"
,,for a certain-- if this was a
,,"whole relationship, then the entire domain is"
,,"just the numbers 1, 2-- actually just the"
,,"numbers 1 and 2. It's definitely a relation, but"
,,this is no longer a function. And the reason why it's
,,"no longer a function is, if you tell me,"
,,"OK I'm giving you 1 in the domain, what member of"
,,"the range is 1 associated with? Over here, you say, well I don't"
,,"know, is 1 associated with 2, or is it associated with 4? It could be either one. So you don't have a"
,,"clear association. If I give you 1 here,"
,,"you're like, I don't know, do I hand you a 2 or 4? That's not what a function does. A function says, oh,"
,,"if you give me a 1, I know I'm giving you a 2. If you give me 2, I"
,,know I'm giving you 2. Now with that out of
,,"the way, let's actually try to tackle the"
,,problem right over here. So let's think about its
,,"domain, and let's think about its range. So the domain here,"
,,"the possible, you can view them as x"
,,"values or inputs, into this thing that could be"
,,"a function, that's definitely a relation, you could"
,,"have a negative 3. You could have a negative 2. You could have a 0. You could have a, well, we"
,,"already listed a negative 2, so that's right over there. Or you could have a positive 3. Those are the possible values"
,,"that this relation is defined for, that you could"
,,"input into this relation and figure out what it outputs. Now the range here, these"
,,are the possible outputs or the numbers
,,"that are associated with the numbers in the domain. The range includes 2, 4,"
,,"5, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, and 8. 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8. I could have drawn this"
,,"with a big cloud like this, and I could have done this"
,,"with a cloud like this, but here we're showing"
,,the exact numbers in the domain and the range. And now let's draw the
,,actual associations. So negative 3 is associated
,,"with 2, or it's mapped to 2. So negative 3 maps"
,,to 2 based on this ordered pair right over there. Then we have negative
,,2 is associated with 4. So negative 2 is
,,associated with 4 based on this ordered
,,pair right over there. Actually that
,,"first ordered pair, let me-- that"
,,"first ordered pair, I don't want to"
,,get you confused. It should just be this
,,ordered pair right over here. Negative 3 is associated with 2. Then we have negative 2-- we'll
,,do that in a different color-- we have negative 2
,,is associated with 4. Negative 2 is associated with 4. We have 0 is associated with 5. 0 is associated with 5. Or sometimes people
,,"say, it's mapped to 5. We have negative"
,,2 is mapped to 6. Now this is interesting. Negative 2 is already
,,mapped to something. Now this ordered pair is
,,saying it's also mapped to 6. And then finally--
,,"I'll do this in a color that I haven't used yet,"
,,although I've used almost all of them-- we have
,,"3 is mapped to 8. 3 is mapped to 8. So the question here,"
,,is this a function? And for it to be a function
,,"for any member of the domain, you have to know what"
,,it's going to map to. It can only map to one
,,"member of the range. So negative 3, if you put"
,,"negative 3 as the input into the function, you know"
,,it's going to output 2. If you put negative 2 into
,,"the input of the function, all of a sudden"
,,"you get confused. Do I output 4, or do I output 6? So you don't know if you"
,,output 4 or you output 6. And because there's
,,"this confusion, this is not a function. You have a member"
,,of the domain that maps to multiple
,,members of the range. So this right over here is not
,,"a function, not a function."

Sets,psyWUUkI-aw,"If x is a whole number, what"
,,other sets does x belong to? And we saw a couple of videos
,,ago that I mentioned that the notion of the set of
,,whole numbers is a little bit ambiguous. Sometimes whole number means
,,non-negative integers. And sometimes it means
,,"all integers. But in this context, and I"
,,actually looked at what the writers of this question are
,,"looking for and the standards that they care about. So from their point of view,"
,,"when they refer to whole numbers, they're referring"
,,"to non-negative integers. So they're referring to 0, 1,"
,,"2, 3, so on and so forth. And I also looked at what they"
,,"referred to-- And remember, this is just according to the"
,,writers of this question. This isn't according to how
,,everyone views these things. But they view natural numbers as
,,just the positive numbers. I told you two videos ago that
,,"some people view natural numbers as just the positive,"
,,but some people include 0 as a natural number. But in this context it's just
,,the positive integers. I shouldn't have said positive
,,"numbers, I should have said positive integers. It obviously doesn't"
,,include the numbers in between the integers. So natural are there the numbers
,,in this context. You'll see other contexts where
,,this would be described as natural. In this context the natural
,,"numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, so on and so forth. And of course, there's no"
,,"ambiguity about what integers are; everyone agrees on that. Integers are-- you know, you"
,,"could go arbitrarily negative and then negative 3, negative"
,,"2, negative 1, 0, 1, 2, 3. And you can just keep going"
,,"in the positive direction. So if x is a whole number, when"
,,they say whole numbers they mean it is non-negative. What other sets does
,,"x belong to? Well, if it's a whole number,"
,,it's anyone of these numbers. And all of these numbers
,,"are also integers. The set of whole numbers, by the"
,,"convention they're using, is this set right here. It is a subset of integers. So we know that x is"
,,also an integer. x is also a member
,,"of integers. That means a member,"
,,a member of a set. x is also a member
,,of integers. But it will not be a member of
,,"natural numbers, or at least the way that they've"
,,"defined it. Because x could be 0. 0 is considered a whole number,"
,,"but if x were 0, it would not be a member of"
,,"the natural numbers. So we can't say it's natural. All we can say is, that it's"
,,"definitely integers, it's definitely rational. Because any whole number, you"
,,"can just divide it by 1 and represent it as a fraction. So x is a member of rationals. And of course, it's also a"
,,"member of the real, which is the broadest set that"
,,we know of.
,,
Sets,UJQkqV2zGv0,What I hope
,,"to do in this video is get familiar with the notion of an interval, and also think about ways"
,,"that we can show an interval, or interval notation. Right over here I have a number line. Let's say I wanted to talk"
,,about the interval on the number line that goes from
,,negative three to two. So I care about this-- Let
,,me use a different color. Let's say I care about this
,,interval right over here. I care about all the numbers
,,from negative three to two. So in order to be more
,,"precise, I have to be clear. Am I including negative three and two, or am I not including"
,,"negative three and two, or maybe I'm just including one of them. So if I'm including"
,,"negative three and two, then I would fill them in. So this right over here, I'm"
,,"filling negative three and two in, which means that"
,,"negative three and two are part of this interval. And when you include the endpoints, this is called a closed interval. Closed interval. And I just showed you how I "
,,"can depict it on a number line, by actually"
,,"filling in the endpoints and there's multiple ways to talk about this interval mathematically. I could say that this is all of the... Let's say this number line is showing different values for x. I could say these are all of the x's that are between negative three and two. And notice, I have negative"
,,three is less than or equal to x so that's telling us
,,"that x could be equal to, that x could be equal to negative three. And then we have x is less"
,,"than or equal to positive two, so that means that x could"
,,"be equal to positive two, so it is a closed interval. Another way that we could"
,,"depict this closed interval is we could say, okay, we're"
,,"talking about the interval between, and we can use brackets because it's a closed interval, negative three and two, and once again I'm using brackets here,"
,,"these brackets tell us that we include, this"
,,"bracket on the left says that we include negative three,"
,,and this bracket on the right says that we include
,,positive two in our interval. Sometimes you might see things written a little bit more math-y. You might see x is a member of
,,the real numbers such that... And I could put these curly
,,"brackets around like this. These curly brackets say that we're talking about a set of values, and we're saying that the set of all x's that are a member of the real "
,,"number, so this is just fancy math notation, it's a member of the real numbers. I'm using the Greek letter"
,,epsilon right over here. It's a member of the
,,"real numbers such that. This vertical line here means ""such that,"" negative three is less x is less than-- negative three is less than or equal to x, is less than or equal to two. I could also write it this way. I could write x is a"
,,"member of the real numbers such that x is a member,"
,,"such that x is a member of this closed set, I'm"
,,including the endpoints here. So these are all
,,different ways of denoting or depicting the same interval. Let's do some more examples here. So let's-- Let me draw
,,"a number line again. So, a number line. And now let me do-- Let me"
,,just do an open interval. An open interval just so that we clearly can see the difference. Let's say that I want to talk about the values between negative one and four. Let me use a different color. So the values between
,,"negative one and four, but I don't want to include"
,,"negative one and four. So this is going to be an open interval. So I'm not going to include four, and I'm not going to include negative one. Notice I have open circles here. Over here had closed circles,"
,,"the closed circles told me that I included negative three and two. Now I have open circles here,"
,,"so that says that I'm not, it's all the values in"
,,"between negative one and four. Negative .999999 is going to be included, but negative one is not"
,,"going to be included. And 3.9999999 is going to be included, but four is not going to be included. So how would we-- What would be the notation for this? Well, here "
,,we could say
,,x is going to be a member of the real numbers
,,"such that negative one-- I'm not going to say less than or equal to because x can't be equal to negative one, so negative one is strictly less than x, is strictly less than four. Notice not less than or"
,,"equal, because I can't be equal to four, four is not included. So that's one way to say it. Another way I could write it like this. x is a member of the"
,,real numbers such that x is a member of... Now the interval is from
,,"negative one to four but I'm not gonna use these brackets. These brackets say, ""Hey,"
,,"let me include the endpoint,"" but I'm not going to include them, so I'm going to put the"
,,parentheses right over here. Parentheses. So this tells us that we're
,,"dealing with an open interval. This right over here,"
,,"let me make it clear, this is an open interval. Now you're probably"
,,"wondering, okay, in this case both endpoints were included,"
,,"it's a closed interval. In this case both endpoints were excluded, it's an open interval. Can you have things that"
,,"have one endpoint included and one point excluded, and"
,,"the answer is absolutely. Let's see an example of that. I'll get another number line here. Another number line. And let's say that we want to-- Actually, let me do it"
,,"the other way around. Let me write it first,"
,,and then I'll graph it. So let's say we're thinking
,,about all of the x's that are a member of the
,,real numbers such that let's say negative four is
,,"not included, is less than x, is less than or equal to negative one. So now negative one is included. So we're not going to"
,,"include negative four. Negative four is strictly less than, not less than or equal to, so x can't be equal to negative"
,,"four, open circle there. But x could be equal to negative one. It has to be less than"
,,or equal to negative one. It could be equal to negative one so I'm going to fill
,,that in right over there. And it's everything in between. If I want to write it with
,,this notation I could write x is a member of the
,,"real numbers such that x is a member of the interval, so it's going to go between"
,,"negative four and negative one, but we're not including negative four. We have an open circle here so I'm gonna put a"
,,"parentheses on that side, but we are including negative one. We are including negative one. So we put a bracket on that side. That right over there"
,,"would be the notation. Now there's other things that you could do with interval notation. You could say, well hey,"
,,everything except for some values. Let me give another example. Let's get another example here. Let's say that we wanna talk
,,about all the real numbers except for one. We want to include all
,,"of the real numbers. All of the real numbers except for one. Except for one, so we're gonna"
,,"exclude one right over here, open circle, but it can"
,,"be any other real number. So how would we denote this? Well, we could write x is a"
,,member of the real numbers such that x does not equal one. So here I'm saying x can be
,,"a member of the real numbers but x cannot be equal to one. It can be anything else, but"
,,it cannot be equal to one. And there's other ways of
,,denoting this exact same interval. You could say x is a
,,"member of the real numbers such that x is less than one, or x is greater than one. So you could write it just like that. Or you could do something interesting. This "
,,is the one that I would
,,"use, this is the shortest and it makes it very clear. You say hey, everything except for one. But you could even do something"
,,"fancy, like you could say x is a member of the real"
,,numbers such that x is a member of the set going from
,,"negative infinity to one, not including one, or x is a"
,,member of the set going from-- or a member of the
,,"interval going from one, not including one, all"
,,"the way to positive, all the way to positive infinity. And when we're talking"
,,"about negative infinity or positive infinity, you"
,,always put a parentheses. And the view there is you
,,could never include everything all the way up to infinity. It needs to be at least
,,open at that endpoint because infinity just
,,keeps going on and on. So you always want to put
,,a parentheses if you're talking about infinity
,,"or negative infinity. It's not really an endpoint, it keeps going on and on forever. So you use the notation for open interval, at least at that end, and"
,,"notice we're not including, we're not including one"
,,"either, so if x is a member of this interval or that interval, it essentially could be"
,,anything other than one. But this would have been
,,the simplest notation to describe that.
,,
Sets,HpdMJaKaXXc,Let's try to learn a thing
,,or two about ratios. So ratios are just expressions
,,that compare quantities. So that might just be a fancy
,,way-- let me just --of saying something that you may
,,or may not understand. So let me give you
,,actual examples. If I have 10 horses
,,and I have 5 dogs. And someone were to come to
,,"me and say Sal, what is the ratio is of horses to dogs? So I want to know how many"
,,horses do I have for some number of dogs. So I could say I have 10
,,horses for every 5 dogs. So I could say the ratio of
,,horses to dogs is 10:5. Or I could also write
,,that as a fraction. I could say the ratio of
,,horses to dogs is 10/5. Or I could just write it out. I could say it is 10 to 5. These all are saying
,,"the same thing. And the thing I write first,"
,,"or the thing that I write on top, is the number of horses. So this is the number"
,,of horses right there. That's the number of horses. And that's all the
,,number of horses. If I wanted to talk about the
,,"number of dogs, this is the number of dogs, that's the"
,,"number of dogs, or that's the number of dogs. I'm just-- These are all"
,,"just expressions that are comparing two quantities. Now, I just said I have 10"
,,horses for every 5 dogs. But what does that mean? That means I have 5
,,horses for every 1 dog. Sorry. Not 5 horses for every 1 dog. It means I have 2 horses
,,"for every 1 dog, right? If for 5 dogs I have 10, that"
,,"means that for every 1 of these dogs, there are 2 horses. For every one of-- every 2 of"
,,"these horses, there's 1 dog. I just kind of reasoned"
,,through that. So this is-- I have 2
,,horses for every 1 dog. But how do you get there? How do you get
,,from 10:5 to 2:1? Well you can think of what's
,,the biggest number that divides into both of these numbers? What's their greatest
,,common divisor? I have a whole video on that. The biggest number that divides
,,into both of these guys is 5. So you divide both of them by 5
,,"and you can kind of get this ratio into a reduced form. And if I write it here, it"
,,would be the same thing as 2/1 or 2 to 1. And so what's interesting about
,,"ratios, it isn't literally, or doesn't always have to be"
,,"literally, the number of horses and the numbers of"
,,dogs you have. What a ratio tells you
,,is how many horses do I have for every dog. Or how many dogs do I
,,"have for every horse. Now, just to make things clear,"
,,what if someone asked me what is the ratio of dogs to horses? So what's the difference
,,"in these two statements? Here I said horses to dogs. Here I'm saying dogs to horses. So, since I've switched the"
,,ratio-- What I'm looking for-- I'm looking for the ratio
,,"of dogs to horses, I switch the numbers. So dogs-- For every 5"
,,"dogs, I have 10 horses. Or if I divide both of"
,,"these by 5, for every 1 dog, I have 5 horses. So the ratio of dogs to"
,,horses is 5:10 or 1:5. Or you could write it this way. 1 to-- I can write it-- Let
,,me write it down here. 1/5. Or I could write 1 to 5. And the general convention--
,,This wouldn't be necessarily incorrect. That's not wrong. But the general convention is
,,"to get your ratio or your fraction, if you want to call"
,,"it that, into the simplest form or into this reduced"
,,form right there. Let's just do a couple
,,of other examples. Let's say I have 20 apples. Let's say I have 40 oranges. And let's say that I
,,have 60 strawberries. Now what is the ratio of apples
,,to oranges to strawberries? I could write it like this. I could write what is the ratio
,,of-- I'll write it like this --apples:oranges:strawberries? Well I can start off by
,,"literally saying, well for 60 strawberries-- for every 60"
,,"strawberries, I have 40 oranges and I have 20 apples. And this would be legitimate. You could say the ratio"
,,"of apples to oranges to strawberries are 20:40-- Sorry. 20:40:60. And that wouldn't be wrong. But we saw before, we could"
,,put into reduced form. So we think of what's the
,,largest number that divides into all three of these? We can't just do it into two of
,,these now because now my ratio has three actual quantities. Well the largest number
,,"that divides into all of these guys is 20. If we divide all of them by 20,"
,,"we can then say for every 1 apple, I now have-- you divide"
,,"this guy by 20 --I have 2 oranges, and I have"
,,3 strawberries. So the ratio of
,,"apples to oranges to strawberries is 1:2:3. And I got that, in every"
,,"case, by just dividing these guys all by 20. I divided by 20. I think you get"
,,the general idea. If someone were to ask you
,,what's the ratio of-- Let me just write it down because it
,,never hurts to have a little bit more clarification. If someone wanted to know
,,the ratio of strawberries to oranges-- Let me get
,,into my orange color. Strawberries to
,,oranges to apples. I thought I was going
,,"to do that in yellow. To apples. What is this ratio going to be? Well for every 3 strawberries,"
,,I have 2 oranges and I have 1 apple. So then it would be 3:2:1. The general idea is whatever
,,"order someone asks you for the different items, you put-- the"
,,"ratio is going to be in that same exact order. Now, in all of the examples so"
,,far I gave you the number of quantity-- the quantity of
,,things we had and I-- we figured out the ratio. What if it went the other way? What if I told you a ratio? What if I said the ratio of
,,boys to girls in a classroom is-- Let's say the ratio
,,of boys to girls is 2/3. Which I could've also written
,,"as 2:3 just like that. So for every 2 boys, I have"
,,"3 girls or for every 3 girls, I have 2 boys. And let's say that there are"
,,40 students in the classroom. And then someone were to ask
,,you how many girls are there? How many girls are
,,in the classroom? So this seems a little
,,bit more convoluted than what we did before. We know the total number of
,,students and we know the ratio. But how many girls
,,are in the room? So let's think
,,about it this way. The fact that the ratio
,,of boys to girls-- I'll write it like this. Boys-- Maybe I'll be
,,stereotypical with the colors. The ratio of boys to
,,"girls is equal to 2:3. Hate to be so stereotypical,"
,,but it doesn't hurt. 2:3. The ratio of boys
,,to girls is 2:3. So this stands for every
,,"3 girls, there's 2 boys. For every 2 boys,"
,,there's 3 girls. But what does it also say? It also says for every 5
,,"students, there are what? There are 2 boys and 3 girls. Now why is this"
,,statement helpful? Well how many groups of
,,5 students do I have? I have 40 students in my
,,"class right there, right? I have 40 students in my class. And for every 5 students,"
,,there are 2 boys and 3 girls. So how many groups of
,,5 students do I have? So I have a total
,,of 40 students. Let me do it in
,,this purple color. I have 40 students and then
,,there are 5 students per group. And I figured out that group
,,"just by looking at the ratio. For every 5 students, I"
,,have 2 boys and 3 girls. How many groups of 5
,,students do I have? So that means that I have 8
,,groups-- 40 divided by 5 --I have 8 groups of 5 students. Now we're wondering how
,,many girls there are. So each group is going
,,"to have 3 girls. So how many girls do I have? I have 8 groups, each"
,,of them have 3 girls. So I have 8 groups times 3
,,girls per group is equal to 24 girls in the classroom. And you could do the same
,,exercise with boys. How many boys are there? There's a couple of
,,ways you could do it. You could say for every
,,"group, there are 2 boys. There's 8 groups. There's 16 boys. Or you could say"
,,there's 40 students. 24 of them are girls. 40 minus 24 is 16. So either way you
,,get to 16 boys. And if you want to pick
,,"up a fast way to do it. It would be identical. You'd say look, 2 plus 3 is 5. For every 5 students,"
,,"2 boys, 3 girls. How many groups are there? You say 40 divided by 5"
,,is equal to 8 groups. Every group has 3 girls. So you do 8 times 3 is
,,equal to 24 girls. Let's do one that's a little
,,bit harder than that. Let's do one where I say that
,,the ratio of let's say-- Well let's go back
,,to the farm example. The ratio of sheep--
,,I'll do sheep in white. The ratio of sheep to--
,,I don't know --chickens to-- I don't know. What's another farm animal? --to pigs. The ratio of sheep to chicken
,,to pigs-- Maybe I should just say chicken right there. The ratio of sheep to chicken
,,to pigs-- Or chickens. I should say chickens. Is-- Let's say the
,,"ratio is 2:5:10. And notice, I can't"
,,reduce this anymore. There's no number that
,,divides into all of these. So this is the ratio if
,,sheep to chickens to pigs. And let's say that I have
,,a total of 51 animals. And I want to know how
,,"many chickens do I have. Well we do the same idea. For every 2 sheep, I have 5"
,,chickens and I have 10 pigs. That tells me for every 17
,,"animals-- So every group of 17 animals, what do I have? And where did I get 17 from? I just added 2 plus 5 plus 10. For every 17 animals,"
,,"I'm going to have-- Let me pick a new color. I'm going to have 2 sheep,"
,,"5 chickens, and 10 pigs. Now, how many groups of"
,,17 animals do I have? I have a total of 51 animals. So if there's 17 animals per
,,"group, 51 animals divided by 17 animals per group. I have 3 groups of 17 animals. Now I want to know"
,,how many chickens. Every group has 5 chickens. We already know that. And I have 3 groups. So I have 3 groups. Every group has 5 chickens. So I'm going to have 3     
,,"times 5 chickens, which is equal to 15 chickens. Not too bad. All I did is add these up and"
,,"say for every 17 animals, I've got 5 chickens. I've got 3 groups of 17. So for each of those"
,,"groups, I have 5 chickens. 3 times 5 is 15 chicken. You could use the same process"
,,to figure out the number sheep or pigs you might have.

Sets,OG045QBuUrg,hi guys so in this video I'm gonna talk to you through how to fill in Venn diagrams with three sets and in a problem-solving style so in these types of questions you're being given the amount of people that have answered to a particular survey or whatever and you're trying to fill those in as opposed to the elements on the Venn 
,,diagram so like we always do we're gonna start off by and drawing our Venn diagram so I've had to read through this question as you should have as well so we've got 
,,a hundred students that's your universe they're either liking English maths or Irish so the first thing I'm gonna do is draw my Venn diagrams and I'm gonna label them so I've got English I've got maths and I've got Irish and then I'm gonna draw my universe around the outside and we know in this case that the universe is equals to a hundred people and that will be important for later on now again it's important to read through all of the information so we're told that we've got 35 who like English that's the entire English circle so what I'm gonna do straightaway is put 35 into my brackets we're told at 50 like maths so again that's in total and we're told a 29 like Irish we're told a 12 like English and maths so that's the intersection we're told that eight like English and Irish again the intersection between those two circles and six like English and maths only we need to be really careful of that when we come to us and finally five like all three subjects that's the one that we should always start off with okay so you should always always always try if you can to find out which one is the intersection that's the one you should always 
,,always fill in first so five like all three subjects that's gonna go straight into the middle and we'll take that off and we've kind of used the 35 to 50 and the 29 
,,but that hasn't gone explicitly into my circles yet so let's go and look at the rest of the information so we're told a 12 like English and maths that means that that should go into this section here because we've already put in Phi people in there we need to subtract five away from the 12 to find the people that only like English and maths that's really important that you do that so 12 take five gives you seven and we're moving on into the next one that says eight like English and Irish so again looking at English and Irish that's this entire section here so we'll have to do eight take five that gives me three take that one off and then six like Irish and maths only that's just this section here because they don't like English as well so that one slots straight in so it's really important that you read these fully at this point we need to use what we have age in our brackets beside English maths and Irish so to fill out the rest of the English circle we need to say okay thirty-five people said they'd like English we've already filled in a certain amount so we filled in the seven the five and the tree so we have to do 35 minus the seven 
,,five and three and that's going to give us 20 and those two double check you can obviously add those up together as well the next one then the math circle we know that 50 people liked math overall so we're gonna have to do 50 minus 7 plus 5 plus 6 and that is going to give us 32 and finally for the irish circle we have to do 29 
,,minus the 3 the 5 and the 6 and that's gonna give us 15 the last thing you need to do is to double check that the entire universe has been accounted for so you need 
,,to add up 20 plus 7 plus 5 plus 3 plus 6 plus 32 plus 15 and that gives you a th you then need to do a hundred minus a th which gives us 12 and that goes into your universe okay guys I'd like you to have a go with this question now and your copy please pause the video try and then come back and see how you got on okay so we're gonna start like we always do we're gonna draw our three circles and we're gonna label them basketball hurling and Gaelic now we're gonna draw in our universe and in 
,,this case we know there's a hundred and ten students in our universe so we're told a forty like basketball so again that's the entire basketball circle we're told at 45 like hurting and we're told at 33 like Gaelic we're told that 11 like basketball and hurling we're told that ate like hurling and Gaelic and that five like basketball and Gaelic only so again if this on the exam like going on your line that and for like all three sports so I'm gonna fill that into my middle straightaway then I deal with the basketball underling so the basketball and hurling intersection is the entire way around here so if 11 like them and there's four already in there we need to do 11 minus 4 which gives me 7 I take that one off the next one then is that we have eight that like hurling and Gaelic so that's in here and because there's already four in there we need to put another fort out up to H and five like basketball and Gaelic only so basketball and Gaelic is just this only I should say and so therefore that's gonna be five so nine of them like basketball and Gaelic overall and then we need to go and figure out what the summations of our circles are gonna come to so in this one it's going to be 40 minus seven plus five plus four and that's going to give me 24 the next one we can do then is the Gaelic circle so that's going to be 33 minus five plus four plus four and that's going to give me 20 and finally then we need to do our hurling on which is 45 minus seven plus four plus four and that's going to give me 30 finally then we need to go and agile 24 plus seven plus four plus four plus five plus 30 plus 20 and we need to subtract that away from 110 so therefore we're going to have 110 minus 94 and that gives me 16 all right guys so this example is slightly trickier when you read through all the information you'll notice pretty quickly that there is an x value there that we haven't seen before don't panic we're gonna attempt at the exact same ways we've done it 
,,before we just need to take that into consideration as we're going through it so when you read through it you'll see you've got and 82 people being honest about their favorite fruits and we're being given apples bananas on pears so just like we've done already we're going to draw out our Venn diagrams and we're gonna label them 
,,a B and P and then our universe's around the outside and our universe is equals to 82 so 82 people should be incorporated within this Venn diagram so we're told of 39 people liked apples so we'll put that outside as we've done before we're told that 50 people like bananas and we're told of 39 people like pears we're told the 21 
,,people liked apples and bananas so again that goes into the intersection 18 like bananas and pears again intersection and 19 like apples and pears we can't do anything with those right now but we're told that X liked all three types of fruit so that X is going to go into the center of all three again don't let it panic or freak 
,,you age it's okay we're going to take it step by step right next thing we do then as we go back to the intersection so we're told the 21 liked apples and bananas so 
,,if we just think about where the apples and bananas go we need to think okay well if that was a number in there we would have just subtracted from 21 however it's a 
,,letter all we can do is write down 21 minus X until we know what X actually is I will take that one off at the moment then we're told that 18 liked bananas and pears so let's think about where bananas and pears are gonna be it's in here and again we don't know what X is so we can just write down 18 minus X and finally we're told that 19 liked apples and pears so let's look at where that would be so we need to think about is fact that the entire intersection is 19 so therefore this section is going to be 19 minus X and Paulo jeez I should have drawn a Venn diagram slightly bigger but hopefully you get the idea okay next thing we need to do then is take 
,,care of the areas in the answer circles this bit does take a little bit of time and concentration so we know that this entire a circle adds up to 39 therefore if we 
,,add together the three parts and subtracted from 39 we should be able to get the bit on the outside so basically what we need to do then is think about the fact that we have 39 and we need to subtract away 21 minus X plus X plus 19 minus X they're all the bits that are already in my a circle so let's tidy that up a little bit so that's gonna be 39 - make sure you keep everything in a bracket until you've tidied it all up so we've got 21 plus 19 that's going to give you 40 and we've got minus X plus X so straight away that's gonna cancel out and we're left with one more minus X therefore 39 apply the minus to your brackets that's gonna be minus 40 plus 
,,X that's because that minus hits off the 40 and off the minus X so that's gonna give me 39 minus 40 which gives me minus 1 plus X so that minus 1 plus X goes up into that circle next of all we're gonna look at my pair circle so that's going to be again 9 - everything in the Paris circle so my 19 minus X plus X plus 18 minus X therefore that's going to be mine or 39 minus 19 plus 18 which gives you 37 the minus X and plus X are going to cancel to your left which is the minus X that - on the 
,,8 side hits off everything inside so 39 minus 37 plus X so therefore that's going to be 2 plus X so that can go in here and finally we need to do the same for the banana pair circle so in this one it's gonna be 50 minus 21 minus X plus X plus 18 minus X so tidying that up 21 plus 18 gives you 39 the minus X and the X cancel again minus X the minus hits off everything inside the brackets that's gonna be 50 minus 39 plus X so that's going to give us 11 plus X and we pop that up inside okay guys so at this point we've done all the hard work what we need to do now is figure out what the value of x actually is if we think about it we filled in our entire Venn diagram and we know that it should add up to 82 people so what we need to do now is we need to write out a big expression and of all of the values within our Venn diagram and let it equals to 82 so that's what I'm gonna do now you just need to take this step slowly so I'm gonna start off with the a circle so I'm gonna write 2 n minus 1 plus X plus 21 minus X plus X plus 19 minus X of taking care of my a circle now I need to take care of the rest of the B circle so I've already included the 21 minus X the X and the M and that's it so now I need to put in my lab plus X and my 18 minus X and in the final part that I haven't included is my 2 plus X then I go back and actually take them all off to make sure I've included them all so I've got minus 1 plus X I've got my 21 minus X I've got my X and I've got my 19 minus X then I've got my 11 plus X my 18 minus X and 2 plus X and that should all equals 282 now we need to tidy up on the left-hand side so first of all let's have a look at all the axes so I'm just gonna put a line under all the x's and I am noticing that I've got a lot of pluses and minuses which will cancel 8 straight away so I've got a plus X there in a minus X they cancel I've got another plus X and another minus X they cancel then I've got another plus X and a minus X so I'm only left with one other X all right in X and then I need to look at all the numbers so I've got minus 1 plus 21 plus 19 + 11 + 18 + plus 2 so we're going to pop that into a calculator and get an answer and when you add those all together and your calculator you're going to get plus 70 and that's equals 282 so we want to get X by itself so 
,,you're gonna minus 70 from both sides so therefore X is equals to 12 and then all you need to do is you need to refill in your Venn diagram with with 12 instead of X so I'm gonna draw that out here again so we've got a B and P and we know that 12 goes into the middle then oppa bullish it says we've got 21 minus X so it's going to be 21 minus 12 which gives you nine between the bananas and pears only it's 18 minus X which is 18 minus 12 which gives me 6 and between apples and pears only it's 19 minus 12 which gives me 7 on the outside of a then it's minus 1 plus X so that's minus 1 plus 12 which gives me 11 with B it's 11 plus X which gives me 11 plus 12 which gives me 23 and IOP it's 2 plus X which is 2 plus 12 which gives me 14 to make sure that we've done this properly you're gonna add up each of these numbers now and you're going to check to see if they add together to give you an 82 so if you can add all those numbers together now in your calculator and they should give you 82 okay guys I'm gonna ask you to have a go with this question and you can read through it yourself and put the 1 thing I want to draw your attention to is the last sentence where it says let X represent those students who liked ice cream and chocolate but not crisps so X will not go in the same place it did in the last example but you're gonna complete this question in the same way so please pause the video have a gold filling at your Venn diagram and then collating all the information 
,,to add up to 50 and see what happens okay so I'm gonna start by drawing my three circles and my universe and we know that our universe has to add 250 okay so I'm gonna label each of them so we've got ice cream we've got chocolate and we've got crisps unfortunate because I've got two sees I can't really I could call it CH and C or but you get the idea okay first thing I'm looking out for in that sentence is or collection of sentences is do they mention all three and they do they say eight said they like all three so I'm gonna put eight into the middle we're also told that fit five said they do not like any of these so I'm gonna put 5 on the outside straightaway so those two sentences are finished with now and we're told that 28 said that they like ice cream so that goes on to the outside in my brackish we're told at 26 said they liked chocolate and we're told at 26 that they liked crisps we're told that 17 said they liked chocolate and crisps so again if we go to our intersection intersection so chocolate and crisps that's in here so because it was 17 you need to do 17 subtract 8 and that's gonna give me 9 we're told that 11 said they like crisps and ice cream so if we look at crisps and ice cream that is gonna be this circle here so we need to do 11 minus 8 which gives me 3 and we're told to let X represent those students who liked ice cream and chocolate but not crisps so ice cream and chocolate is obviously here but not crisps so it's just this section so we 
,,can actually put the axe in there straight away and now we can still do what we're always used to doing which is figuring out the outside parts so if we do the crisps bit first because that's the easiest we can just do 26 minus 3 plus 8 plus 9 so that's gonna give us 26 minus 20 which is equals to 6 so you can fill that in there then up on the top right hand side which is the chocolate circle we're going to do 26 minus X plus 8 plus 9 so it's going to give me 26 minus X plus 17 therefore it's going to be 26 minus X minus 17 and that's going to give me 9 minus X and we can go and fill that in up here so that's 9 minus X and then finally the ice cream circle is going to be 28 minus X plus 8 plus 3 that's going to give us 28 minus X plus 11 therefore that's gonna be 28 minus X minus 11 which is going to give me 17 minus X finally then we need to work out the value of X so what we need to do is we need to take all of the information in a Venn diagram and let it equals to the total which is 50 people so I'm gonna start off oops I forgot to fill that in there 17 minus X so I need to calculate the entire total of all my circles and the outside 
,,of the circles which is our universe and that equals 250 so that's going to be 17 minus X plus X plus 8 plus 3 so I've taken care of everything in my ice cream circle then the remainder of my chocolate circle which is 9 minus X plus 9 on the outside of my crisp circle which is 6 on the outside of my universe which is 5 and that 
,,is all equals 250 now I'm gonna have a look at my axes so I've got a minus X and an X they cancel straight away and I'm just left with one other minus X so I'm gonna write that down as minus X then I've got a 17 plus 8 plus 3 plus 9 plus 9 plus 6 plus 5 we're gonna pop that into our calculators now and that's gonna add together 
,,to give me fifty seven so 57 minus X is equals to 50 and then we want to get X by itself so we're gonna minus 57 from both sides therefore minus X is equals to minus seven and then we want to obviously change the X into a positive so we're going to multiply across by minus one so therefore X is equals to 7 so that basically means guys that 7 is the amount people that like ice cream and chocolate only and we've been asked to represent this information on a Venn diagram and then just calculate the value of x so we're done that's our final answer
,,
Sets,8innwDI1bv8,what is a universal set the universe is something that pretty much contains everything you can think of so does that mean the universal set is a set that contains everything yes it does but it should be suitable but what is suitable look at these three sets set a which is a set of all X such that X is a student of class five-a this set will have all students of class 5a as its elements similarly let's set B which is a set of all X such that X is a student of class 5b and set C which is a set of all X such that X is a student of class 5c we assume there are just three divisions of class five what do you think will be the universal set here it's denoted 
,,by capital u the universal set in this case would be the set of all X such that X is a student of class 5 this is where it gets interesting you could have said that 
,,the universal set is a set of all students in your school or set of all students in the world but that would not be correct the set of all students of class 5 is more suitable it means that U is like the main set and a B and C are parts of it every student of class five-a will surely be a part of the set of students of class 5 in mathematical terms we can say that set a is a proper subset of the universal set remember for a to be a proper subset of U there has to be at least one element in 
,,U that is not present in a similarly sets B and C are also proper subsets of the universal set so all the sets under consideration should be proper subsets of the universal that here is another example consider the segment a-b which looks like this it has two points in between point P and point Q just like the previous example consider three sets here let's set D be the set of all X such that X is a point on segment AP this set will contain every point that lies here in this range let e be 
,,a set of all X such that X is a point on the segment PQ which is this region and let F be the set of all X such that X is a point on segment Q be now try and think of the Universal set in this case it's simple it will be this entire segment a-b the universal set will be the set of all X such that X is a point on segment a B and 
,,remember every set under consideration will be a proper subset of the universal set you

Sets,h8EYEJ32oQ8,We will now begin our journey
,,"into the world of statistics, which is really a way"
,,to understand or get our head around data. So statistics is all about data. And as we begin our journey
,,"into the world of statistics, we will be doing"
,,a lot of what we can call descriptive statistics. So if we have a bunch
,,"of data, and if we want to tell something"
,,about all of that data without giving them
,,"all of the data, can we somehow describe it"
,,with a smaller set of numbers? So that's what we're
,,going to focus on. And then once we
,,build our toolkit on the descriptive
,,"statistics, then we can start to make"
,,"inferences about that data, start to make conclusions,"
,,start to make judgments. And we'll start to do a lot
,,"of inferential statistics, make inferences. So with that out of"
,,"the way, let's think about how we can describe data. So let's say we have"
,,a set of numbers. We can consider this to be data. Maybe we're measuring
,,the heights of our plants in our garden. And let's say we
,,"have six plants. And the heights are 4 inches,"
,,"3 inches, 1 inch, 6 inches, and another one's 1 inch,"
,,and another one is 7 inches. And let's say someone just
,,"said-- in another room, not looking at your"
,,"plants, just said, well, you know, how"
,,tall are your plants? And they only want
,,to hear one number. They want to somehow
,,have one number that represents all of these
,,"different heights of plants. How would you do that? Well, you'd say, well,"
,,how can I find something that-- maybe I want
,,a typical number. Maybe I want some number that
,,somehow represents the middle. Maybe I want the
,,most frequent number. Maybe I want the number
,,that somehow represents the center of all
,,of these numbers. And if you said any
,,"of those things, you would actually have"
,,done the same things that the people who first came
,,"up with descriptive statistics said. They said, well,"
,,how can we do it? And we'll start by thinking
,,of the idea of average. And in every day
,,"terminology, average has a very particular"
,,"meaning, as we'll see. When many people"
,,"talk about average, they're talking"
,,"about the arithmetic mean, which we'll see shortly. But in statistics, average"
,,means something more general. It really means
,,"give me a typical, or give me a middle number,"
,,or-- and these are or's. And really it's
,,"an attempt to find a measure of central tendency. So once again, you have"
,,a bunch of numbers. You're somehow trying
,,to represent these with one number we'll call
,,"the average, that's somehow typical, or middle,"
,,"or the center somehow of these numbers. And as we'll see, there's"
,,many types of averages. The first is the one that you're
,,probably most familiar with. It's the one-- and
,,"people talk about hey, the average on this exam"
,,"or the average height. And that's the arithmetic mean. Just let me write it in. I'll write in yellow,"
,,"arithmetic mean. When arithmetic is a noun,"
,,we call it arithmetic. When it's an adjective like
,,"this, we call it arithmetic, arithmetic mean. And this is really just the"
,,sum of all the numbers divided by-- this is a human-constructed
,,definition that we've found useful-- the sum of
,,all these numbers divided by the number of
,,"numbers we have. So given that, what"
,,"is the arithmetic mean of this data set? Well, let's just compute it. It's going to be 4 plus"
,,3 plus 1 plus 6 plus 1 plus 7 over the number
,,"of data points we have. So we have six data points. So we're going to divide by 6. And we get 4 plus 3 is 7,"
,,"plus 1 is 8, plus 6 is 14, plus 1 is 15, plus 7. 15 plus 7 is 22. Let me do that one more time. You have 7, 8, 14, 15,"
,,"22, all of that over 6. And we could write"
,,this as a mixed number. 6 goes into 22 three times
,,"with a remainder of 4. So it's 3 and 4/6, which is"
,,the same thing as 3 and 2/3. We could write this as a
,,decimal with 3.6 repeating. So this is also 3.6 repeating. We could write it any
,,one of those ways. But this is kind of a
,,representative number. This is trying to get
,,"at a central tendency. Once again, these are"
,,human-constructed. No one ever-- it's
,,not like someone just found some religious
,,"document that said, this is the way that"
,,the arithmetic mean must be defined. It's not as pure
,,"of a computation as, say, finding the"
,,"circumference of the circle, which there really is--"
,,that was kind of-- we studied the universe. And that just fell out of
,,our study of the universe. It's a human-constructed
,,definition that we found useful. Now there are other ways
,,to measure the average or find a typical
,,or middle value. The other very typical
,,way is the median. And I will write median. I'm running out of colors. I will write median in pink. So there is the median. And the median is literally
,,looking for the middle number. So if you were to order
,,"all the numbers in your set and find the middle one,"
,,"then that is your median. So given that, what's the"
,,median of this set of numbers going to be? Let's try to figure it out. Let's try to order it. So we have 1. Then we have another 1. Then we have a 3. Then we have a 
,,"4, a 6, and a 7. So all I did is"
,,"I reordered this. And so what's the middle number? Well, you look here. Since we have an even number of"
,,"numbers, we have six numbers, there's not one middle number. You actually have two"
,,middle numbers here. You have two middle
,,"numbers right over here. You have the 3 and the 4. And in this case, when you"
,,"have two middle numbers, you actually go halfway"
,,between these two numbers. You're essentially taking the
,,arithmetic mean of these two numbers to find the median. So the median is going
,,"to be halfway in-between 3 and 4, which is"
,,going to be 3.5. So the median in
,,this case is 3.5. So if you have an even
,,"number of numbers, the median or the middle two, the--"
,,"essentially the arithmetic mean of the middle two, or"
,,halfway between the middle two. If you have an odd
,,"number of numbers, it's a little bit"
,,easier to compute. And just so that
,,"we see that, let me give you another data set. Let's say our data"
,,set-- and I'll order it for us--
,,"let's say our data set was 0, 7, 50, I don't know,"
,,"10,000, and 1 million. Let's say that is our data set. Kind of a crazy data set. But in this situation,"
,,"what is our median? Well, here we have five numbers. We have an odd"
,,number of numbers. So it's easier to
,,pick out a middle. The middle is the number that is
,,greater than two of the numbers and is less than
,,"two of the numbers. It's exactly in the middle. So in this case,"
,,"our median is 50. Now, the third measure"
,,"of central tendency, and this is the"
,,one that's probably used least often in
,,"life, is the mode. And people often"
,,forget about it. It sounds like
,,something very complex. But what we'll see
,,"is it's actually a very straightforward idea. And in some ways, it"
,,is the most basic idea. So the mode is actually the most
,,"common number in a data set, if there is a most"
,,common number. If all of the numbers
,,"are represented equally, if there's no one single"
,,"most common number, then you have no mode. But given that"
,,"definition of the mode, what is the single most common"
,,"number in our original data set, in this data"
,,"set right over here? Well, we only have one 4. We only have one 3. But we have two 1's. We have one 6 and one 7. So the number that shows up"
,,"the most number of times here is our 1. So the mode, the most typical"
,,"number, the most common number here is a 1. So, you see, these"
,,"are all different ways of trying to get at a typical,"
,,"or middle, or central tendency. But they do it in very,"
,,very different ways. And as we study more
,,"and more statistics, we'll see that they're"
,,good for different things. This is used very frequently. The median is really good if you
,,have some kind of crazy number out here that could
,,have otherwise skewed the arithmetic mean. The mode could also be useful
,,"in situations like that, especially if you do"
,,have one number that's showing up a lot
,,"more frequently. Anyway, I'll leave you there. And we'll-- the next few videos,"
,,we will explore statistics even deeper.
,,
Sets,2oJldeE4JcU, So what I
,,want to talk about now are shapes of distributions
,,"and different words we might use to describe those shapes. So right over here, let's see, we're talking about Matt's Cafe, and we have different age buckets, so this is a histogram here. In each bucket, it tells us the number of guests that are in that age bucket. So we don't have any guests that are under the age of 20, we     "
,,"have a reasonable number between 20 and 30, we have a lot of guests at 30, in that bucket between 30 and 40, reasonable number between 40 and 50, and then as we get "
,,"older, we have fewer and fewer guests. So just when you look"
,,"at something like this, a distribution like this, something might pop out at you. It kind of looks like"
,,"if you were to imagine this were an armadillo, this would be the body of the armadillo, and then what we see to the right kind of looks like the"
,,"tail of the armadillo. We actually use those types of words to describe distributions. So this distribution right over here, it looks like it has a tail to the right. It doesn't have a tail to the left. In fact, we have no one"
,,"under the age of 20. But here when we have a few people between 60 and 70, even"
,,"fewer between 70 and 80, even fewer between 80 and 90, and you know, if it just kind of keeps going like this, this is a tail and it's on the right side, it's a right-tailed distribution. So I'd call this"
,,distribution right-tailed. I'm using Khan Academy exercises because it's a good way
,,"to see a lot of examples, and frankly, you should too because it'll help you test your knowledge. But it's not left-tailed. Left-tailed we would see"
,,"a tail going like that. Frankly, if you're"
,,"left-tailed and right-tailed, you're likely to be"
,,"approximately symmetrical. Remember symmetry, you"
,,"define a line of symmetry, and one type of symmetry"
,,"is one where both sides of that line of symmetry are mirror images of each other. You could fold over the line of symmetry, and they'll roughly meet. This one does not meet"
,,"that because if you were to say, hey, maybe there's"
,,"a line of symmetry here and you tried to fold this over, it wouldn't match up, the two sides would not match up. So I feel good saying"
,,"that it is right-tailed. So let's see. Retirement of age of each guest. Well yeah, these names aren't that great, but let's actually see"
,,"what they're saying. They're saying by age, they're telling us the number of guests. So this is the number of guests at Logan Assisted Living. So we have a lot of guests that are between 60 and 70 years old, or reasonable that are between 50 and 60, or 70 or 80, and this distribution actually looks pretty symmetrical. If I were "
,,"to draw a line of symmetry right down here, right"
,,"at around an age of, you know, the line would be right at an age of 65, I guess you could say all this is a bucket for ages 60 to 70, then you could flip it over and it looks pretty symmetrical. Not exactly, this bucket"
,,"doesn't quite match up to this one, but it's pretty close. These roughly match each other. These roughly match each other. So I feel good about saying it is approximately symmetrical. Now just to know what"
,,"these other words mean, skewed to the left, or"
,,skewed to the right. These actually have fairly
,,"technical definitions when you get further in statistics, but a, I guess, easier to"
,,"process version of them are when you're left tailed, you also tend to be skewed to the left, and when you are right-tailed, you tend to be skewed to the right. Another way to think"
,,"about skewed to the left is that your mean is to the left of your median and mode. That might not make any sense to you. You might just want to off of the tail. If you're left-tailed,"
,,"you're probably left skewed. If you're right-tailed,"
,,"you're probably right skewed. So let's keep going. Let's see another example. So this interesting. We're not given a histogram here. We're not given a bar graph. We're given a box and whiskers plot, which is really just telling us the different quartiles. So just to remind ourselves, this tells us the minimum of our data set, the bottom of our range, so the minimum value in our data set. We have at least one 11, and then the maximum"
,,"value of our data set, we have at least one 25. Now this line right"
,,over here is the median. The middle number is 21. Then the box defines the middle 50% of our numbers. So it's kind of the meat
,,of our distribution. So if we were to try to visualize what this would look like
,,"as maybe a histogram, and we don't know for"
,,"sure because we might have a whole bunch of 11s, not so much that it skews this, but we could have more than one. But a distribution that this could match up with is something that looks like having a tail down here, and then you kind of bump up here. This is the meat of the distribution. It kind of looks something like that, and I can't draw because I'm doing this on the exercises right now. But for something like that, well something like that would have a tail to the left, would have    "
,,"a tail to the left. It's range goes fairly low to the left, but it might not have"
,,"a lot of value there. If I had more values on the left side, this box would have been shifted over because a larger"
,,"percentage would have been on the left, so to speak. So this one, I feel"
,,"pretty good about saying this is skewed to the left. It's definitely not symmetrical. If it was symmetrical, the median would be pretty close to the center, the box "
,,"would be pretty centered. It's not skewed to the right. If it was skewed to the right, you would have a tail to the right, you would have, this whisker would likely "
,,"be much, much, much longer. And we're done."
,,
Sets,cLP7INqs3JM,So let's talk a little bit
,,about rational numbers. And the simple way to think
,,about it is any number that can be represented as
,,"the ratio of two integers is a rational number. So for example, any integer"
,,is a rational number. 1 can be represented as 1/1 or
,,"as negative 2 over negative 2 or as 10,000/10,000. In all of these cases, these are"
,,"all different representations of the number 1,"
,,ratio of two integers. And I obviously can
,,have an infinite number of representations
,,"of 1 in this way, the same number over"
,,the same number. The number negative 7 could be
,,"represented as negative 7/1, or 7 over negative 1, or"
,,"negative 14 over positive 2. And I could go on, and"
,,"on, and on, and on. So negative 7 is definitely"
,,a rational number. It can be represented as
,,the ratio of two integers. But what about things
,,"that are not integers? For example, let us imagine--"
,,"oh, I don't know-- 3.75. How can we represent that as"
,,"the ratio of two integers? Well, 3.75, you"
,,"could rewrite that as 375/100, which is the"
,,"same thing as 750/200. Or you could say, hey,"
,,3.75 is the same thing as 3 and 3/4-- so let
,,me write it here-- which is the same
,,"thing as-- that's 15/4. 4 times 3 is 12, plus 3 is"
,,"15, so you could write this. This is the same thing as 15/4. Or we could write this as"
,,negative 30 over negative 8. I just multiplied the
,,"numerator and the denominator here by negative 2. But just to be clear,"
,,this is clearly rational. I'm giving you multiple
,,examples of how this can be represented as
,,"the ratio of two integers. Now, what about"
,,"repeating decimals? Well, let's take"
,,"maybe the most famous of the repeating decimals. Let's say you have 0.333, just"
,,"keeps going on and on forever, which we can denote by"
,,putting that little bar on top of the 3. This is 0.3 repeating. And we've seen--
,,and later we'll show how you can convert
,,any repeating decimal as the ratio of two integers--
,,this is clearly 1/3. Or maybe you've seen things like
,,"0.6 repeating, which is 2/3. And there's many, many,"
,,many other examples of this. And we'll see any
,,"repeating decimal, not just one digit repeating. Even if it has a million"
,,"digits repeating, as long as the pattern"
,,starts to repeat itself over and over and
,,"over again, you can always represent that as"
,,the ratio of two integers. So I know what you're
,,"probably thinking. Hey, Sal, you've"
,,just included a lot. You've included all
,,of the integers. You've included all of finite
,,"non-repeating decimals, and you've also included"
,,repeating decimals. What is left? Are there any numbers
,,that are not rational? And you're probably
,,"guessing that there are, otherwise people"
,,wouldn't have taken the trouble of trying to
,,label these as rational. And it turns out-- as you
,,can imagine-- that actually some of the most famous
,,numbers in all of mathematics are not rational. And we call these numbers
,,irrational numbers. And I've listed there
,,just a few of the most noteworthy examples. Pi-- the ratio of
,,the circumference to the diameter of a circle--
,,is an irrational number. It never terminates. It goes on and on and on
,,"forever, and it never repeats. e, same thing-- never"
,,"terminates, never repeats. It comes out of continuously"
,,compounding interest. It comes out of
,,"complex analysis. e shows up all over the place. Square root of 2,"
,,"irrational number. Phi, the golden ratio,"
,,irrational number. So these things that
,,"really just pop out of nature, many of these"
,,"numbers are irrational. Now, you might say, OK,"
,,are these irrational? These are just these
,,special kind of numbers. But maybe most
,,"numbers are rational, and Sal's just picked out"
,,some special cases here. But the important thing to
,,"realize is they do seem exotic, and they are exotic"
,,in certain ways. But they aren't uncommon. It actually turns out
,,that there is always an irrational number between
,,"any two rational numbers. Well, we could go on and on. There's actually"
,,"an infinite number. But there's at least one,"
,,so that gives you an idea that you can't
,,really say that there are fewer irrational numbers
,,than rational numbers. And in a future
,,"video, we'll prove that you give me two rational"
,,"numbers-- rational 1, rational 2-- there's going to be"
,,"at least one irrational number between those, which"
,,"is a neat result, because irrational"
,,numbers seem to be exotic. Another way to think about it--
,,"I took the square root of 2, but you take the square root"
,,"of any non-perfect square, you're going to end up"
,,with an irrational number. You take the sum
,,of an irrational and a rational number-- and
,,we'll see this later on. We'll prove it to ourselves. The sum of an irrational
,,and a rational is going to be irrational. The product of an
,,"irrational and a rational is going to be irrational. So there's a lot, a lot, a"
,,lot of irrational numbers out there.
,,
Sets,2B4EBvVvf9w,What we're now
,,going to think about is finding the
,,differences between sets. And the first way
,,that we will denote this is we'll start with
,,set A. I've already defined set A. Let me do it in
,,"that same shade of green. I've already defined set A here. And in both cases, I've defined"
,,these sets with numbers. Instead of having numbers as
,,"being the objects in the set, I could have had farm animals"
,,"there or famous presidents, but numbers hopefully"
,,keep things fairly simple. So I'm going to start with
,,"set A. And from set A, I'm going to subtract set B."
,,So this is one way of thinking about the difference
,,between set A and set B. And when I've
,,"written it this way, this essentially says give me"
,,the set of all of the objects that are in A with
,,the things that are in B taken out of that set. So let's think about
,,what that means. So what's in set A with the
,,"things that are in B taken out? Well, that means-- let's take"
,,"set A and take out a 17, a 19-- or take out the 17s,"
,,"the 19s, and the 6s. So we're going to be left with--"
,,we're going to have the 5. We're going to have the 3. We're not going to have the
,,"17 because we subtracted out set B. 17 is in set B, so take"
,,"out anything that is in set B. So you get the 5, the 3. See, the 12 is not in set B,"
,,so we can keep that in there. And then the 19 is
,,"in set B, so we're going to take out"
,,the 19 as well. And so that is this
,,right over here is-- you could view it as
,,set B subtracted from set A. So one way of thinking
,,"about it, like we just said, these are all of"
,,the elements that are in set A that
,,are not in set B. Another way you
,,"could think about it is, these are all of the"
,,"elements that are not in set B, but also in set A. So"
,,let me make it clear. You could view this as
,,B subtracted from A. Or you could view this as
,,the relative complement-- I always have trouble
,,spelling things-- relative complement
,,of set B in A. And we're going to talk a
,,lot more about complements in the future. But the complement is the
,,things that are not in B. And so this is
,,"saying, look, what are all of the things that are"
,,not in B-- so you could say what are all of the things
,,"not in B but are in A? So once again, if you said all"
,,"of the things that aren't in B, then you're thinking"
,,about all of the numbers in the whole universe
,,"that aren't 17, 19, or 6. And actually, you could"
,,even think broader. You're not even just
,,thinking about numbers. It could even be the color
,,"orange is not in set B, so that would be in the"
,,absolute complement of B. I don't see a zebra
,,"here in set B, so that would be its complement. But we're saying, what are"
,,the things that are not in B but are in A? And that would be the
,,"numbers 5, 3, and 12. Now, when we visualized"
,,"this as B subtracted from A, you might be saying,"
,,"hey, wait, look, look. OK. I could imagine you"
,,took the 17 out. You took the 19 out. But what about taking the 6 out? Shouldn't you have
,,taken a 6 out? Or in traditional
,,"subtraction, maybe we would end up with a negative"
,,"number or something. And when you subtract a set, if"
,,"the set you're subtracting from does not have that element, then"
,,"taking that element out of it doesn't change it. If I start with set A, and if"
,,"I take all the 6s out of set A, it doesn't change it. There was no 6 to begin with. I could take all the"
,,"zebras out of set A; it will not change it. Now, another way to denote"
,,the relative complement of set B in A or B
,,"subtracted from A, is the notation that"
,,I'm about to write. We could have
,,written it this way. A and then we would have had
,,this little figure like this. That looks eerily
,,"like a division sign, but this also means the"
,,difference between set A and B where we're
,,talking about-- when we write it this
,,"way, we're talking about all the things in"
,,set A that are not in set B. Or the things in
,,set B taken out of set A. Or the relative
,,"complement of B in A. Now, with that out of"
,,"the way, let's think about things the"
,,other way around. What would B slash--
,,I'll just call it a slash right over here. What would B minus A be? So what would be B minus A? Which we could also
,,"write it as B minus A. What would this be equal to? Well, just going"
,,"back, we could view this as all of the"
,,things in B with all of the things in
,,A taken out of it. Or all of the things--
,,the complement of A that happens to
,,be in B. So let's think of it as
,,the set B with all of the things in
,,A taken out of it. So if we start with
,,"set B, we have a 17. But a 17 is in set A, so"
,,"we have to take the 17 out. Then we have a 19. But there's a 19 in set A, so"
,,"we have to take the 19 out. Then we have a 6. Oh, well, we don't have"
,,to take a 6 out of B because the 6 is not in set A.
,,So we're left with just the 6. So this would be just the set
,,"with a single element in it, set 6. Now let me ask another question. What would the relative"
,,"complement of A in A be? Well, this is the same"
,,thing as A minus A. And this is literally
,,"saying, let's take set A and then take all of the things"
,,"that are in set A out of it. Well, I start with the 5. Oh, but there's already a 5. There's a 5 in set A. So"
,,"I have to take the 5 out. Well, there's a 3, but"
,,"there's a 3 in set A, so I have to take a 3 out. So I'm going to take"
,,all of these things out. And so I'm just going to
,,"be left with the empty set, often called the null set. And sometimes the"
,,"notation for that will look like this, the"
,,"null set, the empty set. There's a set that has"
,,absolutely no objects in it.

Sets,l3-A0O42Lyo,the topic of sets is by far the simplest topic to grasp in mathematics since we have to tackle just three simple questions first what are sets second why do we need 
,,them and last how do we represent them let's tackle the first question in this video what are sets a set is basically a collection of things think about it what if you were asked to make a list of all the things you can see of course you can't write all the things but some of the things you would mention are a tree or cell phone a puppy people and so on and what if you were asked to write down a list of things you cannot see you would probably write oxygen heat and so on these are the things you cannot see a set is a collection of elements yes but they have to be related in some way let us look at a few more examples to understand better try to list down all the cricket playing nations you know of I would probably have said India England Australia Pakistan and so on now try to list all the oceans you have heard of if you didn't know there are five oceans in the world Pacific Atlantic Indian Arctic and Southern Ocean now here's an interesting question can we make a set of elements for all the questions you're asked for the answer is no not necessarily what if we were asked to make a list of the good teachers we know we cannot make a set here because my idea of a good tutor may be completely different from yours similarly we cannot make a list of intelligent students we know the word intelligent is not well-defined so remember another important characteristic of sets is that the elements in it should be well-defined all the elements in a set should be related and well-defined

Sets,VBzlvKP-2yI,types of sets empty set singleton set finite set infinite set equal sets equivalent sets universal set subset proper subset superset proper superset powerset empty set a set with no element this is the symbol of an empty set let's name it set e another way of writing that is using the symbol the null set the cardinality of set e is equal to zero this notation simply means the number of elements singleton set assert with one element set s is a singleton set the cardinality of set s is one finite set a set with limited elements example set F is a set of counting numbers less than 6 the elements of set F are 1 2 3 4 5 the cardinality of set F is 5 infinite set a set width and limited elements example set n is the set of counting numbers the element subset n are 1 2 3 and so on the cardinality of set n is infinite equal sets two sets are equal if they have the same elements example set E is a set of letters in the word earth the element subset e r e a R th set H is a set of letters in the word heart the elements of set H are H E a R T set E and set H have the same elements they are equal sets set e equals set H equivalent sets equivalent sets have different elements but have the same number of elements example given set F and set H the cardinality of set F is 5 and the cardinality of set H is 5 the to sets have different elements but they have the same number of elements set F is equivalent to set H Universal set Universal set is the set containing all elements at 
,,which all other sets are subsets the universal set is represented by a capital letter you example let u be the universal set set u is the set of all flowers in the English alphabet all other sets are subsets of the universal set set a is a proper subset of set you set B is also a proper subset of set u all the elements of sets a and B are also found in the universal set another example set U is a set of counting numbers sets a B and C are proper subsets of set u because a universal set contains all the elements in a particular problem subset set a is a subset of set D if and only if every element in a is also an element in B here's an example list of the possible subsets upset a number-one asset with three elements two three four sets with one element five six seven sets with two elements in number eight is an empty set how many subsets does set a health to find the number of subsets use this formula two to the power of n where n is a number of elements the cardinality of set a is 3 so 2 to the power of 3 is just 2 times 2 times 2 equals 8 proper subset set a is a proper subset of set B if there is at least one element in B not contained in a in symbol set a is a proper subset of set B example given sets a B C and D set B is a proper subset of set a set C is a proper subset of set a set D is a proper subset of set a list all the proper subsets of set a set one to three have two elements sets four five six have one element and number seven is an empty set the set itself is not a proper subset of set a how many proper subsets does set a half since the set itself is not a proper subset the formula is 2 to the power of n minus 1 where n is the number of elements the cardinality of set a is 3 using the formula to ^ 3 minus 1 equals 8 minus 1 is 7 supper set supper set is a set containing all of the elements of another set symbol set a is a supper set of set B this is just a reverse of subset proper superset set a is a proper supper set of set B if set a is a superset of set B and set a is not equal to set B in symbol set a is a proper superset of set B given set a and set B well set B is a proper subset of set a 
,,set a is a proper superset of set B power set the set of all the subsets of a set what is the power set of set s EO Bess contains all the subsets of set s how many elements does the power set of set s have since the power set contains all the subsets of a given set it follows the formula two to the power of n where n is the number of elements so the number of elements of the OBS is two to the power of three which is equal to eight
,,
Sets,xZELQc11ACY,now let's say if we have set a which contain the elements two four five six and nine and we also have set B which contain the elements two three five six seven nine 
,,and ten so what is the intersection of set a and B how can we get the answer to find the intersection we need to find out which elements are common to both sets so both sets contain a two they contain a five a six and also a nine so therefore the intersection of sets a and B it's two three actually not three but two five six and nine and that's it so that's how you could find the intersection of two sets so now let's work on some more examples you can pause the video and try this one if you want to let me sum different letters so let's say this is set C and I contain the elements 3 4 6 7 and 10 and also set D which contain the elements 3 6 8 & 9 so feel free to pause the video and determine the intersection of sets C and D go ahead and try it so which elements are common to both sets so 3 is common to both sets 6 
,,and that's it so for this particular example it's only 3 & 6 so that's the intersection of the two sets so this is the answer let's try another example let's say set F contains the elements a B C D F G and J and set G contains the elements a C G H and K so what is the intersection between sets f and G so feel free to take a minute and try it so let's see which elements are shared between both sets so both sets contain element a element C G and that is it so the intersection of F and G is going to be a C and G so as you can see finding the intersection is pretty straightforward but now what about this particular example let's say set J contains the elements 5 7 10 and 11 and set K has the elements 2 4 8 and 13 what is the intersection of J and K now notice that there is no common element shared between the two sets the elements and J are completely different from the elements in K so in that case the intersection of J and K is going to be empty there's gonna be nothing inside 
,,so if there's nothing inside if you have an empty set you have a null set so this is the answer you have to use a Greek simple fine now let's say we have set R which contains the numbers 3 4 7 and 10 and set s which is basically an empty set what is the intersection of R and s the intersection of a set with numbers and an empty 
,,set there's going to be another empty set or a null set so that's it for this one now let's focus on a second type of problem that we need to talk about and that is 
,,to find a union of two sets so let's say that set a contains two elements 1 2 3 & 4 and set B contains the elements 3 4 5 & 6 so what is the union of these two sets 
,,I think of Union I think of combining these into a larger set now notice that we do have some common numbers 3 & 4 now the union will contain everything in both sets but 3 & 4 we're not going to write it twice only once so the union of set a and B is going to be 1 2 3 4 5 & 6 so we're gonna write everything in both sets but only write it once so let's try some other examples so let's say set C is 3 comma 5 comma 9 11 and 13 and set D is 2 3 6 8 and 12 go ahead and find a union between sets 
,,C and D go ahead and try that so all we got to do is just write all the numbers in C and E so let's put it in ascending order so we have a 2 of 3 there's a 5 a 6 there's no 7 so we have an 8 a 9 there's no 10 but we have an 11 12 and 13 and so that's it so that's the union of those two sets here's another example let's say that 
,,set J contains the letters a C D and E and that set K contains the letters a B f ing go ahead and determine the union between J and K so just like before all we need to do is write all the letters so we have an a a b c d e f and g and that's it for that question let's say that set x contains the numbers 2 5 8 12 and set Y let's 
,,say is an empty set what is the union of a set with numbers and an empty set well the empty set is not going to add anything it's like saying 15 plus 0 that's gonna 
,,be 15 so therefore the union of set X with an empty set Y is going to be the same as set X this to five eight and twelve it's not going to change but the intersection of a set with something and a set with nothing it's gonna be an empty set so just something to keep in mind now here's a question for you let's say if set a contains the numbers 3 4 5 and 7 and set B contains the numbers 2 4 5 & 8 how can you determine the intersection of a and B and a union of a and B and represent the results using a Venn diagram so circle a and circle B and it's separated form set a contains the numbers 3 4 5 and 7 B contains the numbers 2 4 5 and 8 now the intersection of these two I'm running out of space here is 4 & 5 4 & 5 are found in both but to represent that using Venn diagrams what we need to do is put the two circles together and draw it this way so this is set a and set B so in the middle is the intersection of a and B which contains these elements 4 & 5 now a also contains 3 & 7 & B also contains 2 & 8 but 4 & 5 is common to a and B so we put that in middle now the union of these two sets is basically everything it contains the numbers 2 3 4 
,,5 7 & 8 and I'm running out of space so this entire system with the two circles represents the union of a and B because it contains all the numbers 2 3 4 5 7 & 8 but the intersection is limited by this region here because it only contains the elements common to both sets so hopefully this helps you to see the relationship between intersection of sets and union of sets as a relates to Venn diagrams so that's it for this video thanks for watching and have a good day

Sets,8dup8yGwBhM,hello welcome back to my channel this is Anna and today we are going to study about the types of sets I uploaded another video which was about the introduction of says you haven't watched that video you can go and watch that it will give you an overview of what sets are and it's kind of an introduction to the concept of sets so 
,,if you haven't watched it and you don't know I'm going to put the link of that video in the description box down below so let's start with today's video which is the types of sets so let's first see what are the contents of our today's video so what are we going to learn today in this video we are going to learn about what finite and infinite sets are what is an empty set or a null set what is a singleton set and what are equal in equivalent sets so let's move further alright so moving on with the first topic which is finite and infinite sets so let's see what does these words mean so finite means that something which is limited in number or quantity or countable it means that um there's a limited amount of number and you can count it they can be easily counted it's not something that you cannot count they can be 
,,easily counted all right so they are kind of limited in number or quantity and they're easily countable alright so this is what finite means okay now what is infinite infinite means that something which is unlimited in number or quantity or uncountable so it's basically the totally opposite of what finite is you cannot count an 
,,infinite quantity there's no limit to it it will go on and on and on so there's no stopping to it you cannot count it at all so the uncountable quantities are means 
,,that it's an infinite alright infinite means uncountable all right all right now let's say what does finite set means a set having limited number of elements is called a finite set alright so basically you know that in a set there are elements the things that are included and said are known as elements and they're separated by commas okay so if there's a limited amount of elements in it there's a stop to it they are countable it's known as a finite set okay for example set a is equal to the set of vowels in English alphabet which is a is equal to AE I owe you so here you can see that they are countable there's a limited amount of it they are not going 
,,on and on and on on and on so there is a stop to it so basically it's a finite set the set of vowels in English alphabet is finite set its countable okay now let's take another example set B is equal to the set of natural numbers less than 10 okay so you know that the natural number starts from 1 so the numbers less than 10 would be from 1 to 9 that's a limited number okay so B is equal to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 okay so you have put a limited limit to the numbers of natural numbers okay if you are considering for it from 1 to 9 so this is a finite set okay this is countable you can easily write it it's really comfortable okay there is no there is not something that is going on it's not something that you cannot count its countable you have put a limit to it okay all right now comes the infinite set so infinite set is basically totally the opposite of what finite set is so it means that it's definition goes as a set having unlimited number of elements is called an infinite set okay which is a set which has an unlimited number of elements the elements which are which cannot be counted there are uncountable sets uncountable elements which will go on and on and there's no stop to it you cannot count it there is no limit to it ok so this is what an infinite set is for example n is equal to the set of all natural okay so all natural numbers means from 1 to um you can say like there is no stopping to it you know that to millions trillions how many there so you know that there is no kind of stop number for a finite set you put a limit to it alright sure that you are considering it from one to hundred from one mm so you put in a limit to it all right so this till this amount you going to count so an infra-red said you cannot counter it they will be going on and on and on alright so how I going to represent it that is M is equal to bracket 1 2 3 comma dot dot so this is how you're going to represent an infinite set infinite set let me do a little recap for you 
,,is that infrared set is the one which cannot be counted it cannot be easily counted okay all right let's take another example as well o is equal to the set of odd numbers which can be written as o is equal to 1 comma 3 comma 5 comma 7 and then dot dot dot o it means that there are uncountable numbers as I mentioned earlier it will be going on and on and on so there's no limit to it unlimited number of elements so this is an example it's a perfect example of infinite set let's consider another example which is W is equal to the set of whole numbers which can be written as W is equal to 0 1 2 3 dot dot dot dot dot right so you know that numbers go from 0 whole numbers go from 0 and natural numbers go from 1 to an unlimited amount okay so this is how you going to write an infinite set this is how the set of odd numbers and set of whole numbers can be written as infinite sets only when they are a there's no limit for example if it was written from 1 it's a set of odd numbers from 1 to 99 then you were putting a limit to it so it became a finite set because you have strained the total number of numbers do a specific number okay from 1 to 99 all right in the set of whole numbers if you said set of all whole numbers less than 100 which means that from 0 to 99 it makes it a finite set because you have put a limit to it in this case there is no limit to it it's going on and on and on so it becomes a it becomes an infinite set okay okay now here's an example the example 
,,says that separate the finite and infinite sets okay so in this question we have been given four different type of sets and now we have to identify which one of them which one of them is finite and which one of them is infinite okay so let's see the sets which are the set of items in a departmental store number two set is bracket 2 4 6 8 and dot dot dot bracket closed the third one is the set of English alphabets and the set for is 1 2 3 4 and dot dot dot all right so out of this if you have star if you have listened to what I said earlier now I guess before me telling you we'll be able you will yourself be able to identify what the far out of these four what are the five which one of them are finite and which one of them are infinite ok so let's see number one the set of items in a departmental store you know that in a departmental store there are limited amount of items in it so they aren't countable which makes it finite sets right ok now look at the second one which says 
,,as two four six eight dot dot dot so it's going on and on there's no limit defined to it it is a infinite set because uncountable a number of elements are in it ok now let's see the third one the set of English alphabets okay you know that in English there are 26 and four bits in English language okay so it's finite it's limited so it becomes a finite set okay now look at part number four which is one two three four and dot dot dot dot so it's going on and on which makes it an infinite set 
,,right so number one and number three are finite sets because they are limited amount of elements and in them and number two and number four are infinite sets because there is no limit to it okay okay now comes the empty set or a null set NT or null means the same you know that from their basic meaning empty means something which has nothing in it okay so an empty seat you must have got an idea from its name empty set is one which has no element filling okay let's look at its definition I said having no element is known as an empty set or a null set okay an empty set can be written as the curly brackets and it has nothing in it okay you're going not going to write any element in it so it's going to represent a an empty set it is also denoted by Phi so the symbol you're seeing over here which has like o or a zero with a straight line in between add a horizontal vertical line in between it it's known as five phi5 it's a Greek letter Phi okay so let's take an example of empty sets the set of 20 is a set of days of 25 ours so you know that one days of 24 hours there is no day which has more than 24 hours so it's an empty set because then you 
,,cannot write any element in it there is no day of 24 25 hours so it's a empty set then let's look at another example which is a set the set of horns on a horse you know that horns are all cows I know Bulls are and or deer okay so there's no kind of horns on horse horns are seen you don't have a horse has no seen one then so it's going to be an empty set okay now comes the singleton set okay singleton as you can see the word in it single single means having only one so a single ton set is the is a set which has only one element in it okay I said having a single element is a singleton set okay for example a is equal to bracket a packet closed so there is only one element in it similarly said B is equal to racket one packet closed so there is only one element in it let's take another example C is equal to bracket six bracket closed so in all these three sets you can see there is only one element so it's a singleton set all right now comes the equivalent sets so what are equivalent sets two sets can be called equivalent sets if there is one to one correspondence between the elements of both the sets number two the number of elements in both 
,,the sets are same okay let me explain it again one-to-one correspondence between the elements of both the sets basically means that for every element of one set there is another element in the other set okay so in short or a in a short way you can understand that for the two sets to be equivalent there must be same number of elements of both of them if set a has four elements then said P must have four elements only then they will be equivalent sets let's take a look at the example okay now look at set a set a is equal to one two three four and said be here is a b c d now as you can see that a has four elements and said b has also has four elements so 
,,you can see that there is a one-to-one correspondence in between them okay for every set element of set a there is an element in set B so it's it the the both are equivalent sets and it can be denoted as a this kind of a double arrow double-faced arrow P a arrow B okay now let's take another example suppose set C is equal to 1 3 5 7 and set D is a e i o jo now here you can see that see I said C has four elements and set D has five elements so they're an equal number of elements in both the 
,,sets so here you can see that there is no one to one correspondence in between them D has more elements than C so such kind of sets are known as non equivalent sets 
,,and they can be written as C with this double-faced arrow having us / ok so this is how you're going to write it okay so this these kind of sets are known as non equivalent sets all right now comes the equal sets so as the name suggests the equal sets are equal in every manner so the equal sets are those sets in which there is one-to-one correspondence meaning that for every element of one set there is another element in the other set they are equal number of elements meaning that both of the assets must have same number of elements and the point three says that the elements are same but the orders can be changed okay now in this case elements in both 
,,the set are totally same identical elements in both sets okay but it's not necessary that the arrangement or order is same they can be arranged in any manner okay if it's written one two three four in the other side it can be three four two one okay so let me explain it with an example okay let's suppose a set a is equal to 2 4 
,,6 8 10 and set B is 4 8 10 to 6 now here you can see that in both the sets the elements are equal in number that a has 5 elements and set B has 5 elements and you can see if you look closely you can see that both of these sets have same number of elements but their order is changed here in set 8 was written 2 4 6 8 10 and inside B it's written 4 8 10 to 6 okay the elements are totally same but the orders are changed so in this case the both are equal sets it's not necessary that the orders 
,,are change it can be changed it cannot be changed but if they are changed it doesn't mean that it will become some other kind of set it will remain the equal sets okay so these such kind of pair of sets is known as the equal sets and they can be denoted as a is equal to B okay okay now let me give you a little recap of what we have started in this lecture today so number one finite sets have limited number of elements okay infinite sets have unlimited number of elements in them okay so there is no limitation to their quantity empty set has no element singleton set has only one element equivalent sets have same number of elements in both sets okay and equal sets have same elements in them in same number as well okay so this was today's lecture I hope you all enjoyed it and you must have understood what have what have been taught in it so don't forget to subscribe to my channel so that you will get notified about it whenever I'm going to upload another video and definitely I'll be uploading videos related to this session all year round okay so meet you in another video take care and bye bye

Sets,T5Qf0qSSJFI,"Hi, Im Rob.  Welcome to Math Antics. In this lesson, were going to learn how our basic number system works and were going to learn about an important concept called Place Value. The number system that we use in math is called base 10, because is uses ten different symbols for counting. Math could use other systems that are "
,,"based on a different number (like base 2 or base 8), but Ill give you ten guesses as to why the number ten is such a popular choice. The ten symbols that we use are called digits and they look like this: zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight and nine. At first glance, you might think thats only nine digits, but remember, the zero counts as one of the digits also. To see how our numbers system uses these digits to represent amounts, lets pretend that we have an apple "
,,"orchard full of apple trees, and each of these trees is loaded with big, juicy, red apples that we need to pick and then count for our records. Were going to use something called a number place to count. The best way to understand a number place is to imagine that its like a small box thats only big enough to hold one digit at a time. As we count, well change the digit thats in the number place to match how many apples weve picked. For example, if we start with no apples at all, we "
,,"put the digit 0 in the number place because zero means none. But then, as the apples start coming in from the orchard, we begin to count one, two, three, four, "
,,"five, six, seven, eight and nine. Okay, now weve got nine apples, but weve also got a problem. Weve already run out of digits to count with. The highest digit we "
,,"have is a 9,  but there are a LOT more apples left to count. What will we do? The solution is to use groups to help us count. If we pick just one more apple, well have ten, right? So lets combine those ten apples into a single group. So how many apples do we have? Ten! BUT how many GROUPS of ten apples do we have?  Ah just ONE! Does that help us with our lack of digits problem? It sure does, IF we use another number place! Instead of using this new number place to count up individual apples one at a time like we did with the first number place. Were going to use it to count apples TEN at a time. In other words, well use it to keep track of how many groups of ten apples that weve picked. For example, if weve picked only one group of ten, then well put the digit 1 in that number place. If weve picked "
,,"two groups of ten, then well put the digit 2 in that number place, and if weve picked three groups of ten, then well put the digit 3 in that number place. And so on. Do you see whats happening? Because the new number place is being used to count GROUPS of ten, its allowing us to re-use our original ten digits, but this "
,,"time they are able to count (or represent) bigger amounts. Since this new number place is for counting groups of ten, were going to name it the tens place. And well name our original number place, the ones place because we used it to count things one at a time. And heres the really important thing were not going to use "
,,"the new number place instead of the old one were going to use it along side of the old one so that we have one number place for counting by ones and another number place for counting by tens. Using these two number places together lets us represent amounts that are in-between the groups of ten. For example, if weve already picked thirty apples, then there will be a 3 in the tens place because we have three groups of ten. But there will be a 0 in the ones place, because there are no individual apples left over. But if we have picked thirty-two apples, then there will be a 3 in the tens place and a 2 in the ones place to represent the two individual apples that are not in the groups of ten. In fact, using only our ten digits and these two number places, we can count all the way from zero up to ninety-nine. At ninety-nine, both of our number places are maxed out with the highest digits and we wont be able to count any higher, UNLESS... we get another number place! If weve picked ninety-nine apples and then we pick just one more, well have exactly one-hundred apples. And if we make a group from those one-hundred apples, we can use this new number place to count how many groups of one-hundred weve picked. That means that we can re-use the same ten digits AGAIN in this new number place to "
,,count how many groups of one-hundred we have. And you guessed it its called the hundreds place because we use it to count groups of a hundred. Are you starting to see how our base 10 number system works? It uses different number places to represent the different sized groups that we use to count. And the digits in those number places tell us how many of each group we have. The digit in the ones place tells us how many ones we have. The digit in the tens place tells us how many groups 
,,"of ten we have. And the digit in the hundreds place tells us how many groups of one-hundred we have. And have you noticed that each time we got a new number place to count larger groups, we placed it to the LEFT of the previous number place. Thats important because number places are always arranged in the exact same order. Starting with the ones place, as you move to the left, the number places represent larger and larger amounts. And did you also noticed that each new number place represents groups that are exactly ten times bigger than the previous number place? Ten is ten times bigger than one"
,,and one-hundred is ten times bigger than ten. Thats really important because it helps us see the pattern for bigger number places. It helps us to see that the next 
,,"number place will count groups of ten times one-hundred, which is one-thousand. Thats why its called the thousands place. And the next number place will count groups ten times bigger than that!  Its the ten-thousands place! And the number places keep on going like that. Next is the hundred-thousands place. Then the millions place. Then ten-millions. Then one-hundred-millions. Then billions!  And so on Oh, and you may notice that when we get a lot of number places next to each other like this, its a little hard to quickly recognize which place is which. Thats why many countries use some kind of separator every three places to make them easier to keep track of. For example, in the U.S. we use a comma every three number places to make it easier to identify things like the thousands place, or the millions "
,,"place. Seeing all these number places together helps you understand what we mean by place value. In a multi-digit number, the number PLACE that a digit is in, determines its VALUE. Even though we only have ten digits, each digit can stand for different amounts depending on the place that it occupies. If the digit 5 is in the ones place, it just means five. But, if a 5 is in the tens place, then it means fifty, and if a 5 is in the hundreds place, it means five-hundred. And its the same for bigger number places. A 5 in the hundred-thousands place means five-hundred-thousand, and a 5 in the billions place means five-billion! See how a digits place effects its value? Of course, when we work with numbers in math, most of the time the number places are invisible. But the underlying pattern is always the "
,,"same. Oh, and because the number places are invisible, in certain cases youll need to use zeros to make it clear what number youre talking about. To see what I mean, imagine that this 5 is in the hundreds place to represent five-hundred, but if you make the number places invisible, then it just looks like five and not five-hundred. So to make sure people know you mean FIVE-HUNDRED, you need a 5 in the hundreds place, a 0 in the tens place, and a 0 in the ones place. Now you can tell that the 5 is in the hundreds place and it means five-hundred. Okay now a great way to see place value in action with some actual numbers is to expand them to show that theyre really combinations of different groups. When we do this, its called writing a number in Expanded Form. For example, we can expand 324 to be 300, 20 and 4, because the 3 is in the hundreds place and means three-hundred, the 2 is in the tens place and means twenty, and the 4 is in the ones place so it "
,,"just means four. So 324 in expanded form is the combination of those amounts: three-hundred plus twenty plus four. Lets try writing another number in expanded form:  6,715 We can expand this into six-thousand, (because the 6 is in the thousands place) plus seven-hundred, (because the 7 is in the hundreds place) plus ten, (because the 1 is in the tens place) and five, (because the 5 is in the ones place) So the expanded form is six-thousand plus seven-hundred plus ten plus five. Alright so do you see how our base 10 number system works? Number places are used to count different sized groups. Each group is ten times bigger than the next, and "
,,"the digits in the number places tell us how many of each group we have. The tricky part is that the number places are invisible, so you have to know how they work behind the scenes in order to make sense of multi-digit numbers. How do you like them apples? The exercises for this section will help you practice so that you get used to how place value works, which is super important if you want to be successful in math. As always, thanks for watching Math Antics and Ill see ya next time. That gives me an idea...! ...I could make pies out of these!! Learn more at www.mathantics.com"

Sets,B1HEzNTGeZ4,"Hi, this is Rob. Welcome to Math Antics! In this lesson, were gonna learn about three important math concepts called the Mean, the Median and the Mode. Math often deals with data sets, and data sets are often just collections (or groups) of numbers. These numbers may be the results of scientific measurements or surveys or other data collection methods. For example, you might record the ages of each member of you family into a data set. Or you might measure the weight of each of your pets and list them in a data set. Those data sets are fairly small and easy to understand. But you could have much bigger data sets. A really big data set might contain the cost of every item in a store, or the top speed of every land mammal, or the brightness of all the stars in our galaxy! Those data sets would contain a lot of different numbers! And if you had to look at a big data set all at one time it would be pretty hard to make sense of it or say much about it besides well thats a lot "
,,"of numbers! But thats where Mean, Median and Mode can really help us out. Theyre three different properties of data sets that can give us useful, easy to understand information about a data set so that we can see the big picture and understand what the data means about the world we live in. That sounds pretty useful, huh? So "
,,"lets learn what each property really is and find out how to calculate them for any particular data set. Lets start with the Mean. You may not have ever heard of something called the mean before, but Ill bet youve heard of the average. If so, then Ive got good news! Mean means average! Mean and average are just two different terms for the exact same property of a data set. The mean (or average) is an extremely useful property. To understand what it is, lets look at a simple data set that contains 5 numbers. As a visual aid, lets also represent those numbers with stacks of blocks whos heights correspond to their values: one, eight, three, two, six Right now, since each of the 5 numbers is different, the stacks of blocks are all different heights. But what if we rearrange the blocks with the goal of making the stacks the same height? In other words, if each stack could have the exact same amount, what would that amount be? Well, with a bit of trial and error, youll see that we have enough blocks for each stack to have a total of 4. That means that the Mean (or average) for our original data set would be 4. Some of the numbers are greater than 4 and some are less, but if the amounts could all be made the same, they would all become 4. So thats the concept of Mean; its the value youd "
,,"get if you could smooth out or flatten all of the different data values into one consistent value. But, is there a way we can use math to calculate the mean of a data set? After all, it would be very inconvenient if we always had to use stacks of blocks to do it! Theres got to be an easier way!! To learn the mathematical procedure for calculating the Mean, lets start with blocks again. But this time, instead of using trial and error, lets use a more systematic way to make the stacks all the same height. This way involves a clever combination of addition and division. We know that we want to end up with 5 stacks that all have the same number of blocks, right? So first, lets add up all of the numbers, which is like putting all of the blocks we have into one big stack. Adding up all of the numbers (or counting all the blocks) shows us that we have a total of 20. Next, we divide that number (or stack) into 5 equal parts. Since the stack has a total of 20 blocks, dividing it into 5 equal stacks means that well have 4 in each, since 20 divided by 5 equals 4. So thats the math procedure you use to find the mean of a data set. Its just two simple steps. First, you add up all the numbers in the set. And then you divide the total you get by how many numbers you added up. The answer you get is the Mean of the data set. Lets use that procedure to find the mean age of the members of this fine looking family here. If we add them all up using a calculator (or by hand if youd like) the total of the ages is 222 years. But then, we need to divide that total by the number of ages we added which is 6. 222 divided by 6 is 37.  So thats the mean age of all the members in this family. Alright, thats the Mean.  Now what about the Median? The Median is the middle of a data set. Its the number that "
,,"splits the data set into two equally sized group or halves. One half contains members that are greater than or equal to the Median, and the other half contains members that are less than or equal to the Median. Sometimes finding the Median of a data set is easy, and sometimes its hard. Thats because finding the middle value of a data set requires that its members be in order from the least to the greatest (or vice versa). And if the data set has a lot of numbers, it might take a lot of work to put them in the right order if they arent already that way. So to make things easier, lets start with a really basic data set that isnt in order. Its pretty easy to see that we can put this data set in order from the least to the greatest value just by switching the 2 and the 1. There, now we have the data set {1, 2, 3} and finding the Median (or middle) of this data set is easy! Its just 2 because the 2 is located exactly in the middle. That almost seems too easy, doesnt it? But dont worry it gets harder! But before we try a harder problem, I want to point out that sometimes the Mean and the Median of a data set are the same number, and "
,,"sometimes theyre not. In the case of our simple data set {1, 2, 3}, the Median is 2 and the Mean is also 2, as you can see if we rearrange the amounts or follow the procedure we learned to calculate the Mean. But what about the first data set that we found the mean of? We determined than the Mean of this data set is 4. But what about the Median? Well, the Median is the middle, and since this data set is already in order from least to greatest, its easy to see that the 3 is located in the "
,,"middle since it splits the other members into two equal groups. So for this data set, the Mean is 4 but the Median is 3. So to find the Median of a set of numbers, first you need to make sure that all the numbers are in order and then you can identify the member thats exactly in the middle by making sure theres an equal number of members on either side of it. Okay, ...so far so good.  But some of you may be wondering, What if a data set doesnt have an obvious middle member? All of the "
,,"sets weve found the Median of so far have an odd number of members. But, what if it has an even number of members? like the data set {1, 2, 3, 4} There isnt a member in the middle that splits the set into two equally sized groups. If thats the case, we can actually use what we learned about the Mean to help us out. If the data set has an even number of members, then to find the Median, we need to take the middle TWO numbers and calculate the Mean (or average) of those two. By doing that, were basically figuring out what number WOULD be exactly half way between the two middle numbers, and that number will be our Median. For example, in the set {1, "
,,"2, 3, 4} we need to take the middle TWO numbers (2 and 3) and find the Mean of those numbers. We can do that by adding 2 and 3 and then dividing by 2. 2 plus 3 equals 5 and 5 divided by 2 is 2.5 So the Median of the data set is 2.5 Even though the number 2.5 isnt actually a member of the data set, its the Median because it represents the middle of the data set and it splits the members into two equally sized groups. Okay, so now you know the difference between Mean and Median. But what about the Mode of a data set?  What in the world does that mean? Well, Mode is just a technical word for the value in a data set that occurs most often. In the data "
,,"sets weve seen so far, there hasnt even been a Mode because none of the data values were ever repeated. But what if you had this data set? This set has 6 members, "
,,"but some of the value are repeated. If we rearrange them, you can see that theres one 1, two 2s and three 3s The Mode of this data set is the value that occurs most often (or most frequently) so that would be 3 since theres three 3s. Now dont get confused just because the number 3 was repeater 3 times. The mode is the number thats repeated most often, NOT how many times it was repeated. As I mentioned, if each member in a data set occurs only once, it had no mode, but its also "
,,"possible for a data set to have more than one mode. Heres an example of a data set like that: In this set, the number 7 is repeated twice but so is the number 15. That means they tie for the title of Mode.  This set has two modes: 7 and 15. Okay, so now that you know what the Mean, Median and Mode of a data set are. Lets put all that new information to use on one final real-world example. Suppose theres this guy who makes and sells custom electric guitars. Heres a table showing how many guitars he sold during each month of the year. Lets find the Mean, Median and Mode of this data set. First, to find the Mean we need to add up the number of guitars sold in each month. You can do the addition by hand or you can use a calculator if you want to. Either way, be careful since thats a lot of numbers to add up and "
,,"we dont want to make a mistake. The answer I get is 108. So thats the total he sold for the whole year, but to get the Mean sold each month, we need to divide that total by the number of months which is 12. 108 divided by 12 is 9, so the Mean (or average) is 9. Next, to find the Median of the data set, were going to have to rearrange the 12 data points in order from smallest to largest so we can figure out what the middle value is. There, thats better. Since theres an even number of members in this set, we cant just choose the middle number, so were going to have to pick the middle two numbers and then find the Mean of them. 9 and 10 are in the "
,,"middle since theres an equal number of data values on either side of them. So we need to take the Mean of 9 and 10. Thats easy, 9 plus 10 equals 19 and then 19 divided by 2 is 9.5 So, the Median number of guitars sold is 9.5. That means that in half of the months, he sold more than 9.5, and in half of the months, he sold less "
,,"than 9.5. Last of all, lets identify the Mode of this data set (if there is one). We lets see theres two 8s in the data set Oh but theres three 10s.  That looks like the most frequent number, so 10 is the Mode of this data set. Its the result that occurred most often. Alright, so thats the basics of Mean, Median, and Mode. They are three really useful properties of data sets and now you know how to find them. But sometimes, the hardest part about Mean, Median and Mode is just remembering which is which. So remember that Mean means average, Median is in the middle, and Mode starts with M O which can remind you that its the number that occurs Most Often. Remember, to get good at math, you need to do more than just watch videos about it. You need to Practice! So be sure to try finding the Mean, "
,,"Median and Mode on your own. As always, thank for watching Math Antics, and Ill see ya next time. Learn more at www.mathantics.com"

Sets,NybHckSEQBI,"Hi! This is Rob. Welcome to Math Antics. In this lesson, we're going to learn some really important things about a whole branch of math called Algebra. The first thing you need to know is that Algebra is a lot like arithmetic. It follows all the rules of arithmetic and it uses the same four main operations that arithmetic is built on: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. But Algebra introduces a new element... the element of the unknown. When you were learning arithmetic, the only thing that was ever unknown was the answer to the problem. For example, you might have the problem 1 + 2 = what? The answer isn't known until you go ahead and "
,,"do the arithmetic. Now the important thing about Algebra is that when we don't know what a number is yet, we use a symbol in its place. that symbol is usually just any letter of the alphabet. A really popular letter to choose is the letter 'x'. So in arithmetic, we would just leave the problem like this: 1 + 2 = ""blank"" and we'd write in the answer when we did the addition. But in Algebra, we'd write it like this:  1 + 2 = x The 'x' is a place holder that stands for the number that we don't know yet. What we have here is a very basic algebraic equation. An equation is just a mathematical statement that two things are equal. An equation says, ""the things on this side of the equal sign have the same value as the things on the other side of the equal sign."" In this case, our equation is telling us that the known values on this side (1+2) are equal to what's on the other side, which happens to be the unknown value that we are calling 'x'. One of the main goals in Algebra is to figure out what the unknown values in equations are. And when you do that, it's called ""solving the equations"". In this equation, it's pretty easy to see that the unknown value is just 3. All you have to do is actually add the 1 and 2 together on this side of the equation and it turns into 3 = x, which is the same as x = 3. So now we know what 'x' is!  It's just 3. That almost seems too easy, doesnt it? And that's why in Algebra, you are usually given an equation in a more complicated form like this: x - 2 = 1. This is exactly the same equation as 1 + 2 = x, but it has been rearranged so that it's not quite as easy to tell what 'x' is. So in Algebra, solving equations is a lot like a game where you are given mixed-up, complicated equations, and it's your job to simplify them and rearrange them until it is a nice simple equation (like x = 3) where it's easy to tell what the unknown values are. We're going to learn a lot more about how you actually do that (how you solve equations) in the next several videos, but for now, let's learn some important rules about how symbols can and can't be used in algebraic equations. The first rule you need to know is that the same symbol (or letter) can be used in different algebra problems to stand for different unknown values. For example, in the problem we just solved, the letter 'x' was used to stand for the number 3, right? But 'x' could stand for a different number in a different problem. Like, if someone asks us to solve the equation, 5 + x = 10. In order for the two sides of this equation to be equal, 'x' must have the value '5' in this problem, because 5 + 5 = 10. So 'x' (or any other symbol) can stand for different values in different problems. That's okay, but what's NOT okay is for a symbol to stand for different values in the same problem at the same time! For example, what if you had the equation: x + x = 10? This equation says that if we add 'x' to 'x' we will get 10. And there are a lot of different numbers we could add together to get 10, like 6 and 4. But, if we had the first 'x' stand for 6 and the second 'x' stand for 4, then 'x' would stand for two different value at the same time and things could get really confusing! If you wanted symbols to stand for two different numbers at the same time, you would need to use two different symbols, like 'x' and 'y'. So in Algebra, whenever you see the same symbol repeated more than once in an equation, it's representing the same unknown value. Like if you see a really complicated Algebraic equation (like this), where 'x' is repeated a lot of different times, all of those 'x's stand for the same value, and it will be your job to figure out what that value is. Okay, so for any particular equation, we can't use the same letter to represent two different numbers at the same time, but what about the other way around? Could we use two different letters to represent the same number? Yes! - Here's an example of that. Let's say you have the equation: a + b = 2 What could 'a' and 'b' stand for so that the equation is true? Well, If 'a' was 0 and 'b' was 2, then the equation would be true. Or, we could switch them around. If 'a' was 2 and 'b' was 0, the equation would also be true. But there's another possibility: If 'a' was 1 and 'b' was also 1, that would make the equation true, right? So, even though 'a' and 'b' are different symbols, and would usually be used to represent different numbers, there are times when they might happen to represent the same number. Oh, and this problem can help us understand something very important about how symbols are used in Algebra. Did you notice that there were different possible solution for this equation? In other words, 'b' could have the value 0, 1, or 2 depending on what the value of 'a' was. If 'a' is 0 then 'b' must be 2 If 'a' is 1 then 'b' must be 1 If 'a' is 2 then 'b' must be 0 'b' can't have two different values at the same time, but it's value can change over time if the value of 'a' changes. In Algebra, 'b' is what's called a ""variable"" because it's value can 'vary' or change. In fact, in this equation, both 'a' and 'b' are variables because their values will change depending on the value of each other. Actually, it's really common in Algebra to refer to any letter as a variable, "
,,"since letters can stand for different values in different problems. But at Math Antics, we'll usually just use the word ""variable"" when we're talking about values that can change or vary in the same problem. Alright, so far we've learned that Algebra is a lot like arithmetic, but that in includes unknown values and variables that we can solve for in equations. There's one other really important thing that I want to teach you that will help you understand what's going on in a lot of Algebra "
,,"problems, and it has to do with multiplication. Here are the four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Although in Algebra, you'll usually see division written in fraction form, like this. In Arithmetic, all four operations have the same status, but in Algebra, multiplication get's some special treatment. In Algebra, multiplication is the 'default' operation. That means, if no other arithmetic operation is shown between two symbols, then you can just assume they're being multiplied. The multiplication is 'implied'. For example, instead of writing 'a' times 'b', you can leave out the times symbol and just write 'ab'. Since no operation is shown between these two symbols, you know that you're supposed to multiply 'a' and 'b'. Of course, you can't actually multiply 'a' and "
,,"'b' until you figure out what numbers they stand for. The advantage of this rule about multiplication is that it makes many algebraic equations less cluttered and easier to write down. For example, instead of this: a * b + c * d = 10 You could just write: ab + cd = 10. You can also use this shorthand when you are multiplying a variable and a known number... like 2x, which means the same thing as 2 times 'x' or 3y which means the same thing as 3 times 'y' Since the symbol and the number are "
,,"right next to each other, the multiplication is implied. You don't have to write it down. Finally some good news! Now I never have to write down that pesky multiplication symbol again! Oh yeah!! Ah, not so fast... there are some cases in Algebra where still need to use a multiplication symbol. For example, what if you want to show 2 x 5? If you just get rid of the times symbol and put the '2' right next to the '5', it's going to look like the two-digit number twenty-five, which is NOT the same as 2 x 5. So, whenever you need to show multiplication between two known numbers, you still have to use the times symbol, unless... you use parentheses instead. "
,,"But aren't parentheses used to show grouping in math? How can you use that to show multiplication? Ah, that's a good question. Parentheses are used to group things, "
,,"but whenever you put two groups right next to each other, with no operation between them, guess what operation is implied. Yep!  Multiplication! For example, if you "
,,"see the this, it means that the group (a+b) is being multiplied by the group (x+y). We could put a times symbol between the groups, but we don't have to because it's the default operation in Algebra. The multiplication is just implied. So, going back to our problem: 2 x 5 If you wanted to, you could put each of the numbers inside parentheses like this, and then you could get rid of the multiplication sign. Now this can't be confused with the number twenty-five, and since the groups are right next to each other, you know that you need to multiply them. Of course, it might seem strange to have just one thing inside 'group' symbols like this, but it's okay to do that in math. An alternate way that you could do the same thing would be to put just one of the numbers in parentheses, like this. Again, you won't confuse this with a two-digit number and you know that multiplication is implied. Okay, so we've learned that Algebra is a lot like arithmetic, but it involves unknown values or variables that we need to solve for. And we learned that in Algebra, the multiplication sign is usually not shown, because it's the default operation. You can just assume that two things right next to each other are being multiplied. But why do we even care about Algebra? Is it good for anything in the 'real world'? or is it just a bunch of tricky problems that keep students busy in school? Actually, Algebra is very useful for describing or ""modeling""  things in the real world. It's a little hard to see that when you are just looking at all these numbers and symbols on the page of a math book. But, it's a lot easier to see when you start taking algebraic equations and graphing their solutions. Graphing an equation is like using its different solutions to draw simple lines and curves that can be used to describe and predict things in real life. For example, there's a whole class of equations in Algebra called ""linear"" equations because they form straight lines when you graph them. Those sorts of equations could help you describe the slope of a roof or tell you how long it will take to get somewhere. Another class of algebraic equations, called ""quadratic"" equations can be used to design telescope lenses, or describe how a ball flies through the air, or predict the growth of a population. So Algebra is used all the time in fields like science, engineering, economics and computer programming. And even though you might not need Algebra to get by in your day to "
,,"day life,... ...so divide both sides by 3. That means x = 42. So... in three... two... one... YES!! Alright... now to see how much butter I need. It's still a very useful part of math. Thanks for watching Math Antics,"

Sets,lv6dC0coQeI,rock and learn Patera hiya Michael what's up my friend Kevin needs a little help studying for his earth science test do you think you could pencil us in for a session well I do know a thing or two about earth science and I hear that you're a real wizard reviewing for science tests thanks Tara kevin is already waiting for us at my super science station before we go Marco Terra boy am I happy to see you I need to get ready for my earth science test glad to help kid earth science is kind of my specialty when you study earth science you'll learn about astronomy geology meteorology and more let's start by talking about our solar system tell me what you know well the Sun is in the middle of the solar system and it provides us with light and heat good good you know anything else there are eight planets that orbit the Sun but I always have trouble remembering their order I know a fantastic way to remember the order of the planets hello who's calling professor who oh you're Kevin's mom he's snack is ready okeydoke here we'll be right there great news Kevin's mom would like to serve us a little snack sounds good to me so Kevin I didn't know that your mother was a professor oh yes she's very educated here you go enjoy oh my what just happened my very educated mother just served us nachos that's it that's the order of the planets huh I see what he's getting at take the first letter of each word in the sentence my very educated mother just served us nachos and now we'll give you the first letter of the name of each planet my mercury Dairy Venus educated mother just served Saturn Uranus Neptune my very educated mother just served us nachos Mercury Venus Earth Mars Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune my very educated mother Venus Uranus Neptune hey that's pretty cool that makes it easy to remember the planets great now back to the solar system Learning Center at my super science station but what about the ah the nachos tough going kid but nachos aren't the only things in life and the planets aren't the only things that orbit the Sun take a look at this wow that's pretty cool Terra what are all these chunks of rock between Mars and Jupiter that is known as the asteroid belt the objects in this area range in size from dust particles all the way up to Ceres which is 900 kilometers in diameter 
,,Ceres is actually considered a dwarf planet because it has a large enough mass to have a rounded shape but as you can see it's not large enough to have cleared its orbit around the Sun by that I mean there are other objects in the same orbit with Ceres all of those other chunks of rock and metal are known as asteroids is Ceres the only dwarf planet now we've got more every so often a group of professional astronomers from around the world meet to assign names to objects in space three dwarf planets they've names are theories Pluto and Eris looks like there's another asteroid belt further out that's called the Kuiper belt whoa what's that that's a common comments a collections of ice dust and small particles of rock most have long oval orbits when they pass near the Sun their ice melts and evaporates people on earth see comets as huge glowing balls with tails made of gas or dust trailing millions of miles behind them all of this is pretty cool but how does it fit into earth science learning about the solar system is important for earth science because what happens in space affects things on Earth for example let's take a closer look at how the Earth and Sun interacted see how the earth goes around or orbits the Sun yeah Marco I remember that from science class it takes a full year for one revolution 
,,around the Sun and that's what causes our seasons explain to me how the Earth's orbit causes the seasons well I know it has something to do with the tilt of the earth but I never really understood that part hmm let me see if I can help when does the Sun feel warmest early in the morning or around noon its warmest around noon correct that's because the sun's rays are more direct around noon in the morning when it's cooler the sun's rays are more indirect so the earth flips back and forth oh 
,,no no no no no no the earth keeps pretty much the same tilt but watch as she moves around the Sun see here the northern hemisphere gets more direct Sun so it is summer there and since the southern hemisphere gets the indirect light it's winter now you've got the idea if we keep moving around until we get over here then it's summer in the southern hemisphere and winter in the northern hemisphere Wow actually seeing it in action makes it easier to understand even take a look at this see how the Earth rotates on its axis it goes around once every 24 hours and that's what causes day and night the parts of Earth facing the Sun or in daylight as the Earth rotates the Sun seems to set in the West Supah I think you've really got a good idea about how things work in our solar system yes take one of these kiddo Tara I don't think it's going to be raining anytime soon inside the science station I wouldn't be so sure he looks like a flash flood we got here whether or not you wanted to brother here at the water cycle and whether learning center will learn how the water cycle affects whether on earth the Sun provides the energy that drives the whole water cycle as the Sun heats water on earth water evaporates into the air as the water vapor cools in the atmosphere it condenses into small water droplets that form 
,,clouds when the water droplets get too heavy they precipitate back to the ground then the water accumulates in aquifers rivers lakes and the oceans and the whole thing can start all over again water turns to vapor by evaporation clouds slowly okay I think I understand how the water cycle works but why does it rain and snow places other than over the water good question we get rain and snow and other precipitation in all kinds of places because the Sun heats the earth unevenly land heats and cools faster than water and we know that it's warmer near the equator than the poles all of this uneven heating keeps it cold and warm air moving and the mix changes in air pressure here's how those air pressure changes cause wind cold air weighs more than warm air so the pressure of cold air is greater when the Sun warms the air the air expands it's lighter cooler heavier air moves to where the warmer and lighter air was in other words will usually blows from areas of a high air pressure 
,,to areas of low air pressure now warm air can hold more water vapor than cold air so as the air gets colder you get condensation and then precipitation there you go 
,,but it is the temperature of the air that determines the kind of precipitation rain happens when drops of liquid water fall on the surface of the earth snow forms when the air is so cold that water vapor turns directly into ice without ever passing through a liquid state if the air is cold enough the snow will fall all the way to the ground otherwise it might melt into rain on its way down sleet refers to water droplets that freeze on their way down through really cold air unlike snow sleet goes through a liquid state before freezing the result is that sley does not light and fluffy Hale is like it mega sweet when it hails large balls of ice fall from 
,,the sky hail forms in a more complex way than sleep as ice crystals start to full wind carries them back up high into the cloud this happens over and over and the crystals grow each time eventually they get too heavy and full hard that's wild Tara I never knew weather could be so complex and that's just the surface kid but it's 
,,enough to get you started those nachos aren't settin so good are you okay she'll be fine but I'm a little worried about us if there isn't I feel much better now uh that's nice but where are we just when we should be in the geology Learning Center this is where we can learn about different kinds of rocks and how they are made take a look at all these layers of rocks little bits of Earth were washed downstream they settle to the bottom of a river lake or ocean layer after layout was deposited on top so they will press down more and more over time the layers turned into a type of rock called sedimentary rock that's right sedimentary rocks make up about three-quarters of the rocks at the Earth's surface sometimes they can give us clues about what the environment was like when those rocks were formed how can they do that well sometimes dead plants or animals get buried in the sediment they get covered up by new layers of sediments and sometimes become fossils some fossils are actually parts of an animal like its teeth or bones that have turned into stone or fossilized others are trace fossils like dinosaur footprints or tunnels made by worms 
,,but most fossils are castes the dead plants and animals decay after the sediment has turned into rock leaving behind a hollow mold salts or other minerals can fill the cast and hold its shape fossils found in the same layer of sedimentary rock are from things that lived around the same time as no layers form on top the fossils get buried deeper and deeper I think I understand so the deeper the fossils are found the older they are you've got it and times large amounts of plants are deposited in sedimentary rocks if they are compressed under a lot of pressure for a long period of time they turn into carbon this gives us coal oil natural gas and petroleum I guess that's why they're called fossil fuels you bet it is and let me tell you fossil fuels are really a gas okay sedimentary rocks make up about three-quarters of the rocks at Earth's surface you got it what about the rest of the rocks what are they glad you asked there are two other kinds of rocks igneous and metamorphic igneous rocks formed when molten rock cools and becomes solid molten rock is called magma when it is below the earth's surface but sometimes magma pushes up through cracks to the surface of the earth then it is called lava we lava cools it becomes a kind of igneous rock called volcanic rocks basalt is the most common type of volcanic rock most of the rocks on the ocean floor are basalt igneous rock can also form when magma cools slowly and becomes hard while it's deep underground rocks that form this way like granite usually have large crystals fossils are not usually found in igneous rocks the heat of a volcanic eruption tends to destroy living things and only rarely preserves any evidence of them however fossils may be found in volcanic ash deposits which are actually a kind of sedimentary rock that makes sense sedimentary rocks are made from sediment and igneous rocks are made when molten rock is cooled but what about metamorphic rocks how do they form good question kiddo metamorphic rocks are rocks that have moved or changed from one kind of rock into another metamorphic rocks were once igneous or sedimentary rocks but movement of the 
,,Earth's crust caused them to change just moving the rocks changes them no try pushing your hands together very hard do you feel heat and pressure yeah when the Earth's crust moves igneous or sedimentary rocks get squeezed by tremendous pressure which heats the rock and pulls them like taffy the original rock is changed by this heating and pulling and it becomes a metamorphic rock as you might guess any fossils that we're in this sedimentary rock will now be in the metamorphic rock but those fossils may be stretched and deformed because of the heating and pooling Baumer metamorphic rocks are the least common of the three kinds of rocks slate and marble 
,,are two examples that really whoa what's this a rock concert as a matter of fact it is ladies and gentlemen please welcome all the way from Little Rock Arkansas Petros I'm sorry males because of rocks man sorry three rounds surprise even though two rocks may be form the same way they can be made up of different kinds of minerals that's right to identify the minerals in rocks scientists use properties like color luster podna s-- and streak look at these I wonder what minerals they are hey if I describe their properties that might help me to identify them Bravo know the color of a mineral is the first thing people tend to notice but be careful most minerals can occur in more than one color luster describes how light is reflected from the surface of a mineral the two main types of luster are metallic and nonmetallic 
,,the hardness of a mineral is its ability to resist scratching the most hardest scale uses ten minerals to rank hardness take a look here a diamond is the hardest naturally occurring substance with a hardness of ten and talc is very soft so it only has a hardness of one that's all good and fine but how can I find out the hardness of the minerals in this box with a little scratching not that kind of scratching we'll use minerals and objects from the Mohs scale if your mineral sample can scratch an object save this penny but it has a higher hardness let's try this one mm-hmm good choice I like the nice metallic luster can it scratch up any looks like it does Marco that means this mineral has a hardness higher than three that's the way to do it now try scratching this quartz nope and look the quartz will scratch my mineral sample so it has a hardness between three and seven we could keep on scratching away with different materials from the Mohs scale to narrow it down even more but I think you get the idea I sure do thanks Terra another way to categorize minerals with a hardness lower than seven is to determine their streak streak does that 
,,mean some of them have racing stripes nah the streak of a mineral is the color of the powder it leaves when you scrape it across a streak plate we know your mineral 
,,has a hardness lower than seven so red that's not what I would have guessed at all don't feel too bad kid science is full of surprises have a look at this table here do any of those descriptions match your mineral let me see steel gray hardness 5.5 to 6.5 rust red streak metallic luster I'll bet this is hematite that's the way to do it great job well kid your earth science knowledge is really building up it looks like something else is building up under my chair that sort of looks like a volcano I guess it was a volcano and just look where it brought us ah the topographic Learning Center this is the perfect place to learn about how the surface of the earth changes seems like a volcano would be pretty good at changing the surface tell me about it kid he's not pimples you know I had a friend do a science fair project on volcanoes she told me there are several types she told you right there are shield volcanoes cinder cones stratovolcanoes and more that's a lot of volcanoes so what's the difference between the types shield volcanoes are built by layer upon layer of lava their eruptions travel great distances from a central event or group events so they have brought the flat rounded shape they kind of look like a shield lying on the ground that's a great way to remember the name but while they may look 
,,"flat from above they can still get pretty tall mano Lowa is the largest shield volcano Mauna LOA's means long mountain but it stands over 13,000 feet above sea level and it rises over 28,000 feet from the ocean floor it would be the world's tallest mountain if it weren't mostly underwater Maui Wowi actually it's on the Big Island of Hawaii the eruptions of shield volcanoes usually don't have much ash and they are fairly safe for scientists to monitor but some other kinds of volcanoes can throw hot ash and cinders into the air these can form a pyroclastic flow which travels very fast and burns almost everything in its path that's the truth the temperature of a pyroclastic flow can reach over 500 degrees Celsius whoa what kind of volcano can do that stratovolcanoes can they are quite beautiful like yours truly but they tend to be tall and symmetric with steep sides a few stratovolcanoes that you might have heard of our Mount Fuji in Japan and in the USA you'll find Mount st. Helens and Mount Rainier in Washington State and Mount Hood in Oregon not organ or red gun those stratovolcanoes really are beautiful what about cinder cones are the little guys you can often find cinder cones on the flanks of shield volcanoes and stratovolcanoes when a cinder cone volcano erupts cinders of lava are blown into the air and fall around the opening of the volcano the pile of cinders forms a small oval-shaped volcano that can grow to about 1,000 feet but some are much smaller many cinder cone volcanoes have a bowl-shaped crater at the opening hey Marco what causes volcanoes in the first place to explain that let's dig a little deeper deeper "
,,into the earth thirties earth is divided into four layers the solid inner core the liquid outer core and the mantle that's the thickest layer and last and least is the crust because it's the thinnest layer the rocky outer crust is made of plates that fit together sort of like on puzzle pieces these plates move a little bit each 
,,year as they slide on top of a weak layer of the mantle this hotter deeper layer of the mantle can be pushed and pulled like putty the whole process is called plate 
,,tectonics the edges of the Earth's plates touch each other as they move the plates may just slide past each other but the plates can also spread apart or even crash 
,,together sometimes when two plates collide large mountain ranges such as the Himalayas are for that happens if the two plates have the same density so they fold as they move together much like two kitchen rugs push together that explains mountains but I wanted to know how volcanoes are formed hold your horses kid if colliding plates have different densities one plate can be forced back down into the deeper regions of the earth that plate can begin to melt when it reaches a depth which is hot enough the molten crust arises back towards the surface where it helps make volcanoes and islands whoo that's a long process is that how all volcanoes are formed well no here's another way as the plates move hot spots under the crust may find weak places in the plates or between two plates that are moving apart this will allow magma to come to the surface from deep within the earth and the result is a volcanic eruption which can add new landmass to existing land or even form new islands okay let me get this straight volcanoes can form where the plates are pushing together where they're pulling apart or anywhere the Earth's crust is weak that's the way the cookie crumbles and the Earth's crust now that you have an idea of how Earth's surface can be built up let's talk about how it can be worn down weathering is the process that causes rocks to crack and fragment since rocks form in different ways and are made up of different minerals they react differently when exposed to temperature changes moisture particles in the air or pressure changes I suppose that means there are different kinds of weathering that's right Kevin one thing that causes weathering is frost when water freezes it has an unusual property unlike most materials that contract when they are cooled water expands when it solidifies into ice this can put incredible pressure on rocks water gets into the pores or cracks of the rocks and then free this so when the water freezes it expands and causes pieces of the rock to break off alright another kind of weathering is abrasion that can happen when rocks rub against each other like when Oh Rock rolls downhill or when it tumbles in rivers winds can cause abrasion to wind sometimes carries dirt or sand that can wear down rocks as it blows against them plants like moss and lichen can wedge their way into pores crevices and cracks in rocks seeds from other plants can get into crevices too as they grow they cause the rocks to crack apart I heard that wetting and drying of rocks can make them break up oh yes the combination of wetting and drying is very effective at breaking up clay but that's because clay swears when it gets wet and then shrinks and crumbles as it does oh I get it the process of wetting and drying only weathers some kinds of rocks sometimes rocks break down because the minerals they are made of react with chemicals in water or air for example carbonic acid is created when carbon dioxide dissolves in water and this acid can dissolve limestone and eventually cause the formation of caves and caverns ooh look at the stalactites and stalagmites you're a regular little spelunker 
,,huh stalactites hold tight to the ceiling of the cave and stalagmites might reach the ceiling someday what a smarty now erosion is simply the moving of sediments or 
,,rock particles moving water is the most powerful force of erosion on earth the world's rivers deliver about 20 billion tons of sediment to the oceans each year that's a lot of erosion and that's why you can see fan-shaped Delta's at the mouths of some rivers such as the Nile v-shaped valleys canyons and gorges are also carved by streams and rivers flowing through the mountains moving air or wind is another important mover of sediment especially in dry regions when tiny sand grains are lifted and carried by the wind they can sculpt rocks into a variety of shapes sand dunes are hills of sand deposited by the wind such as those at Great Sand Dunes National Park in Colorado but of all the things that cause erosion my favorite is a glacier glaciers form when snow piles up over time and turns to ice the glacier begins to flow outwards and downwards under the pressure of its own weight like great rivers of ice glaciers have sculpted mountains and carved out u-shaped valleys Valley glaciers flow down valleys and continental glaciers such as the ones on Greenland and Antarctica flow outward in all the directions glaciers reshape the underlying and surrounding landscape as they move by eroding rock from one place and depositing it in another that's called deposition glaciers rivers and wind are major forces of deposition that can build up the earth in some places and I think I've got the scoop on erosion erosion is when the earth is worn down it can happen because of water wind or ice that's right kid weathering and erosion work together to reshape the surface of the earth water and cracks of rocks can turn to ice in the winter and 
,,make the cracks bigger over time bits and pieces of the rock break off and fall away winds can pick up these small bits and we're down weaker parts of rock rain can 
,,watch the small bits away over time these processes can work together to leave interesting formations such as the arches in Utah or the hoodoos in bryce canyon canyons look like fun places I'd like to travel to see them someday well right now we need to travel to our next learning center right this way Wow hey wait Marco I think my chair ran out of gas ah it looks like we need an alternative energy source don't worry balance this on your head okay but how will this solar panel help we're indoors just our way to see hiya boys I see you used a perpetual resource to get here perpetual resource yep a perpetual resource is one that cannot be affected by human use perpetual resources are also called inexhaustible resources they include things like solar energy that can be converted into electricity solar energy can also be used to heat water or air for homes and businesses sounds like we should use solar energy for everything well solar energy is very dependent on the time of day the time of year and the weather so in order to be efficient a large surface area is required to collect the energy from the Sun but scientists are working on ways to get around that hmm is solar energy the only perpetual resource oh no there's always the wind remember that the wind is caused by uneven heating of Earth by the Sun so it's an indirect form of solar energy the wind blows stronger and more consistently in some areas wind turbines and wind farms can be built in those places to convert the wind energy into electricity and there's also geothermal energy heat from the earth can be used to make steam or hot water to heat buildings or generate electricity some scientists are even looking at ways to utilize the oceans to produce energy for us without causing any environmental damage they've come up with a few ways of tapping the energy from tides and we might even find a way to use temperature differences in the ocean to produce energy in some regions the surface water can be 40 or more degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the deep water so perpetual resources includes solar wind geothermal and ocean energy what other kinds of resources are there glad you asked kiddo there are renewable resources and non renewable resources I've heard of renewable resources they can be replenished as fast or faster than we use them that's true but the problem is that usually the demand for resources like wood crops soil and water increases over time if the demand gets too high these resources cannot be replenished fast enough we have to be careful and keep things in balance that does sound like a good thing to do and what about non-renewable resources I guess those can't be replenished at all when they're gone they're really gone non-renewable resources like a natural gas oil and coal that we get from 
,,fossil fuels will eventually run out if we keep using them energy efficiency and conservation are so important we need to make non-renewable resources last as long as possible while we are looking for new alternatives energy efficiency is the use of technology to perform the same function with less energy like putting tinting on your windows to keep out the sunlight that heats up buildings in the summertime no that's to make it look cool energy conservation is any behavior that causes us to use less energy like turning off lights when they're not being used exactly Kevin and by using energy-efficient light bulbs you can save a lot on your electric bill another way to conserve energy is by insulating and weatherizing homes and buildings that way you use less air conditioning and heating you can also save on heating and cooling by placing trees shrubs or other landscaping to block the wind and provide shade but we can conserve other resources besides just energy such as wood and water there are many ways to help save water around the house it turn off the water while you're brushing your teeth take short showers instead of Bath's and be sure to fix any leaks I worked with my mom to convince the people in our neighborhood to find a garbage service that recycles we separate out plastic glass aluminum cans and paper for recycling excellent by recycling you are not only conserving resources but you are also helping to keep unnecessary garbage out of landfills yeah thanks for helping to keep the earth a cleaner place to live kiddo you're welcome Tara and thanks to both of you for helping me study earth science I'm ready to ace my test I'm so proud of you well I should be getting back home Marko I'm ready to teleport okey-dokey huh hey science fans to quiz yourself on earth science you can download a practice test at my website just visit w-w-w that mark or the pencil dot-com show now that we've reviewed some of the material from earth science let's see 
,,how well you might do on the practice test for those of you following along you might want to use pause when the question first comes up to see if you can choose the right answer before Kevin let's begin with some questions about this solar system one look at the diagram of our solar system below what is the name of Planet 5 oh 
,,yeah mark oh my very educated mother just that starts with J Jupiter that's answer B fantastical sometimes you might be asked to fill in your answer right on the page with the questions but this test has a separate answer sheet be sure to ask your teacher how you're supposed to might the answers on your test let's put the test over the answer sheet just under the question we are answering that way we can make sure we fill in the right bubbles to which objects in our solar system have long tails when they are close to the Sun and are made mostly of rock and ice a planets be asteroids see dwarf planets d comets the only one of these things I remember having tails are the Comets you'll have a great memory our answer is d3 what causes day and night on earth a the Earth orbits the Sun na earth orbiting the Sun combined with the tilt of the Earth's axis is what gives us seasons not day and night B the moon orbits the earth the moon orbiting the earth causes the tides to rise and fall on the earth but it doesn't cause day and night C the Earth rotates on its axis I think this is the right answer right - you are see the Sun that lights up half of the earth the parts that are in the sunlight are experiencing a day the parts that aren't in the sunlight are experiencing at night and if we could look down at the earth from the North Pole we would see that the earth is rotating counterclockwise so the Sun seems to come up in the east and set in the West maybe I should check this last answer just to make certain C is the best choice good thinking Kevin D the Sun orbits the earth that's ridiculous everyone knows that the Sun doesn't orbit the Earth that means our answer is C the Earth rotates on its axis let's move on to questions about the water cycle and whether for what supplies the energy to drive the water cycle can you remember what I told you I remember Terra you said the energy source that drives the whole water cycle is the Sun you are really starting 
,,to get on my good side okay so our answer is a Sun good job now let's see if you can get this next one five the picture shows a place where air currents will form due to the uneven heating of the earth in which direction will air currents most likely move let's see warm air rises and the cool air will come in to replace it so a 
,,from the lake toward the land looks right but let me check all the answers be straight up above the lake no that's not right see from the land toward the lake that's backwards D all of the above that can't be right so our answer is egg I'm glad that you look at all of the answers carefully some students make the mistake of choosing all of the above every time it's an answer choice not our boy he's too smart to do something like that ah thanks Terra now do you remember anything from the geology Learning Center I sure do sedimentary rock is formed in layers and the deeper the layers the older they are they ought to make this next question pretty simple six the rock column above shows the layers in a sedimentary rock formation the three core samples to the right were taken from the rock column on the left according to this information which fossil is the oldest well the deepest layer is layer one so it is the oldest since the fossil on the bottom of core sample X came from layer one it is the oldest fossil so the answer is C let's see if you can get the answer to this next to geology question seven why are most fossils found in sedimentary 
,,rocks let me read through the answers a fossils can be distorted in metamorphic rocks that's true you bet it is metamorphic rocks are made by pressure and heat on other types of rocks that could really mess up any fossils in the rock well let's look at all the answer choices be igneous rocks were too hot when they formed considering that igneous rocks were made of molten rock I'm sure they were too hot to preserve any fossils what about C sedimentary rocks are best for preserving organisms 
,,this one's also true so the answer must be d all of the above you're a real gem we'll take a look at one more geology question 8 the chart below shows part of Mohs hardness scale for minerals a student is testing an unknown mineral for hardness the unknown mineral is tested against fluoride but neither mineral scratches the other which of the following conclusions can the student accurately make if the unknown mineral didn't scratch fluorite and fluorite didn't scratch the unknown mineral they both must have a hardness of 4 keep that in mind while we look at the possible answers a the unknown mineral and orthoclase will not scratch each other ortho Clay's is harder than fluorite so orthoclase would scratch the unknown mineral a is wrong be the unknown mineral will scratch calcite that's true yep calcite is lower on the hardness scale but let's not be too hasty read the last to answer choices see the unknown mineral will scratch orthoclase that's the exact opposite of what would happen d the unknown mineral will not scratch gypsum that doesn't seem right no way gypsum is even lower on the hardness scale than calcite so our answer is beep 
,,this kid has a mountain of information in his head you think so let's see if he remembers what was said about Earth's changing topography 9 mountains may be formed when a volcano's erupt that's true some of the volcanoes even have the word mount in their name like Mount Fuji but I remember that mountains are formed other ways too let me check the rest of the answers B plates of the Earth's crust collide that's true too Terrace said the Himalayas were formed that way great memory kid hmm see says both a and B and D says none of the above so I'm gonna have to say that C is the right answer perfecto 10 which of these processes can be caused by movement of the Earth's plates let's see the highest mountain range in the world the Himalayas were formed by plates colliding and the islands of Hawaii were formed because of 
,,a plate moving over a hot spot some of those Islands still have volcanic eruptions that makes all of the answers true so our answer is it D all of the above let's see what you remember about weathering and erosion 11 moving water was the most important factor in forming which of these a sand dunes at Great Sand Dunes National Park no Tara said those were formed by wind be the Grand Canyon I'm pretty sure that was formed by a river although I don't know what the name of the river is that would be the Colorado River see the Andes Mountains from what we discussed mountains are built from volcanic eruptions or plate tectonics not moving water you've got a 
,,good head on your shoulders kid D Kilauea volcano that's made out of flowing lava not moving water so the answer is B the Grand Canyon nice work whoo that's a nice picture I'd like to go there someday and the men at the bottom of the picture gives you some perspective as to how large the arch really is all right all right let's 
,,get down to business read the question please 12 the landform below is an arch found in Arches National Park in Utah which type of weathering or erosion is not responsible for shaping this arch here's one of those questions that has to be read carefully the word not makes a big difference in the answer I'll choose let's see Tara talked about the combination of water ice weathering and wind all playing a part in forming arches so I think the answer is a glaciers because glaciers did not help shape the arch right you are you're a smart kid so let's see how bright you are when it comes to energy and resources available on earth no problem thirteen which of the following is a renewable resource a tree that's renewable as long as we don't use them faster than new trees can grow I think this is the answer but I'll check them all to be sure I'm so glad you have good test taking skills be natural gas that's a non-renewable resource see solar energy ah this is one of the perpetual or 
,,inexhaustible resources you told me about not a renewable one no matter how much we use the perpetual resources they'll always be around D oil no that's a fossil fuel all fossil fuels are non-renewable resources so the only renewable resource here is the tree that makes the ants at a 14 watering plants and grass in the early morning is one way to conserve water why a plants only absorb water in the morning no plants can absorb water any time of day take a look at the next one okay Marco be 
,,less water evaporates into the air in the cool morning this leaves more water for plants to absorb and allows shorter watering times that's true sea water used in the morning can be recycled in the evening that doesn't make sense if some sort of system is in place to catch unused water to be recycled it can be used anytime not just in the morning D water is more pure in the morning this one doesn't make sense either I guess that means you're sticking with answer B then yep and now for the last question 15 which of the following is not a way to help conserve energy a plant trees in the landscaping around buildings the trees wood provides shade from the 
,,Sun and help to block wind which would help with cooling and heating bills but the question is asking which one is not a way to conserve energy how about B turn off 
,,machines when they're not being used that's definitely a way to conserve energy check the next one sure thing Marco see both a and B no those are both good ways to conserve energy so that means our answer must be D take lots of bubble baths Wow you did a great job on this practice earth science test I agree nice work hey science fans you can download this earth science test at my website just visit www.marsianstudio.webs.com you

Sets,JeVSmq1Nrpw,"Hi!  Welcome to Math Antics. Now that you know all about fractions, from watching all of our fractions videos, its time to learn about something called percentages. Percentages are super important. Have you ever been in a math class and heard another student ask the teacher: Um.. excuse me teacher Ah when are we ever gonna use this stuff? Ya know like in real life? Well when it comes to percentages, the answer is one-hundred percent of the time. Well alright maybe not a hundred percent of the time but a lot! Percentages are used every day to calculate things like: how much sales tax you pay when you buy something. how much something costs when its on sale. how much fiber is in your granola bar. or how much money you can make if you invest it in the stock market. Thats all real life stuff for sure. So, you can see that its really important to understand percentages and how we use them in math. Alright then are you ready to learn the key to understanding percentages, or percents as theyre called for short? Drum roll please A percent is a fraction! Whaaaat? Thats right a percent IS a fraction! And since you already know all about fractions, learning about percents is gonna be easy. But a percent isnt just any old fraction.  A percent is a special fraction that always has 100 as the bottom number. If its a percent, then no matter what the top number is, the bottom number will be 100. In fact, because the bottom number of a percent is always 100, we dont even write it. Instead, we use this handy little symbol (%) called a percent sign. Whenever you see this symbol after a number, it means the number is a percent. Its really a fraction with 100 on the bottom, but its just being written in this more compact form. ...like this number 15 here. Its got the percent sign after it, so we read it as ""15 percent"", and because a percent is really a fraction that always has 100 as the bottom number, we know that it means the same thing "
,,"as 15 over 100. Percents make even more sense if you know what the word precent means. The prefix of the word (per) means for each or for every.  Ya know like if someone said, only one cookie per person. And the root word (cent) is Latin for 100.  Thats why theres 100 cents in a dollar. So, percent literally means per 100 and thats why theyre shortcuts for writing fractions that have 100 as the bottom number. Alright then, so whenever you see a percent like this, you know it can be replaced with (or converted) to a fraction. Lets look at a few examples so you see the pattern. 3% means 3 over 100 10% means 10 over 100 25% means 25 over 100 "
,,"and 75% means 75 over 100 These are percents and these are the fractions that they stand for. Theres a few other interesting percents that we should take a look at. like this one:  0% can you have 0% ? Yes!  0% would just mean 0 over 100.  Its what we like to call a zero fraction cuz its value is just zero. Remember, its okay to have zero on the top of a fraction, but not the bottom! Alright then, what about 100%.  Well 100% just means 100 over 100.  Thats what we like to call a whole fraction. The top number is the same as the bottom, so its value is just one whole, or 1. Okay then, 0% is just zero, and 100% is just 1. But what about numbers bigger than 100?  Can you have 126% ? Yep, it works exactly the same way.  126% just means 126 over 100. And you know from the fractions videos, thats what we call an improper fraction. The top number is bigger than the bottom number, so the fractions value will be greater than 1. Alright team, I want you to go out there and give me a-hundred and TEN percent effort in today's game! But coach it would be improper for us to give a-hundred and ten percent effort in todays game. Okay, so now you know the key to percentages.  that theyre just special fractions that always have 100 as the bottom number. But theres one more thing that I need to tell you about in this video, and thats decimals. Do you remember in the video about fractions and decimals that you can convert any fraction into its decimal value? Sometimes it was kind of tricky converting to a decimal if we had to divide the top number by the bottom number. But other times, like when we had base-10 fractions, it was easy because decimal number places are made for counting base-10 fractions, (like tenths, hundredths and thousandths). Well guess what  Percents ARE base-10 fractions!  They are hundredths because their bottom number is always 100. That means its really easy to re-write a percentage as a decimal number. You can do it the same way as we did in the base-10 fractions video. For example,  we know that 15% is just 15 over 100, right?  Thats its fraction form. But it also has the decimal form 0.15 because THIS is the hundredths place and 0.15 means 15 hundredths. So, we can re-write 15% as a fraction (15 over 100) OR as a decimal (0.15) And now that you know WHY we can easily convert a percentage to a decimal, let me show you a really simple trick for doing it. First, you start with the number in percent form like this: 35% Next, you imagine where the decimal point should be in the number 35. Its not shown, but if it was, it would be right here next to the ones place. (Now remember, 35 and 35.0 are the same value.) Now that you know where the decimal point is, just move it two number places to the left (away from the percent symbol) and draw it in right there. Last of all, once you have moved the decimal point, you erase the percent sign because you dont have a percent anymore. Moving the "
,,"decimal point two places to the left converted it into the decimal value of that percent. Lets try converting a few more percents into their decimal values so you can get the hang of it. For 62 percent, we move the decimal point two places to the left and get 0.62 (Remember, we can put an extra zero in front of the decimal point to be a place holder and to make the decimal point easier to notice.) For 75 percent, we move the decimal point and get 0.75 For 99 percent, we move the decimal point to get 0.99 Pretty Cool, huh? Okay, but what about 4% ?  You might wonder how we can move the decimal point two places over when our number only has one digit. But all we need to do is use a zero as a place holder in the number place thats missing. Then, when we move the decimal point two places over, we end up with the decimal value of 0.04. Now that makes sense because 4 is in the hundredths place and 4% is 4 over 100. And in the same way, 1% would just be 0.01.  Again, we need that "
,,"extra zero placeholder. Heres a few more interesting examples: 0% would be just 0.00 And if we have 100% and we move the decimal point two places to the left, we end up with 1.00 But 1.00 is the same value as 1.  Thats why 100% represent one whole. And if we have 142%, we move the decimal point to get 1.42 Thats a value greater than one which is what wed expect because 142% is really an improper fraction (142 over 100) Its value should be greater than 1. Alright, so now you know that a "
,,"percent is a special fraction that always has 100 as the bottom number. And you know that you can re-write percents in either their fraction form OR their decimal form. 25% is 25 over 100 or 0.25 But keep in mind that you could go the other way too. If someone gives you a fraction with 100 as the bottom number, you can re-write "
,,"it in percent form. If you get 12 over 100, you can say thats 12% And if you get 80 over 100, you can say thats 80% OR If you get the decimal 0.10, you can say thats 10% and if you get the decimal 0.38, you can say thats 38% So, thats the key to percentages.  Theyre another way to write fractions and decimals. But theres a lot more to learn about how theyre used in math, and well learn more about that in the next few videos. But for now, you should be sure that you really understand the basics of percentages by doing the exercises for this section. Thanks for watching Math Antics, and Ill see ya next time!

Sets,8innwDI1bv8,what is a universal set the universe is something that pretty much contains everything you can think of so does that mean the universal set is a set that contains everything yes it does but it should be suitable but what is suitable look at these three sets set a which is a set of all X such that X is a student of class five-a this set will have all students of class 5a as its elements similarly let's set B which is a set of all X such that X is a student of class 5b and set C which is a set of all X such that X is a student of class 5c we assume there are just three divisions of class five what do you think will be the universal set here it's denoted 
,,by capital u the universal set in this case would be the set of all X such that X is a student of class 5 this is where it gets interesting you could have said that 
,,the universal set is a set of all students in your school or set of all students in the world but that would not be correct the set of all students of class 5 is more suitable it means that U is like the main set and a B and C are parts of it every student of class five-a will surely be a part of the set of students of class 5 in mathematical terms we can say that set a is a proper subset of the universal set remember for a to be a proper subset of U there has to be at least one element in 
,,U that is not present in a similarly sets B and C are also proper subsets of the universal set so all the sets under consideration should be proper subsets of the universal that here is another example consider the segment a-b which looks like this it has two points in between point P and point Q just like the previous example consider three sets here let's set D be the set of all X such that X is a point on segment AP this set will contain every point that lies here in this range let e be 
,,a set of all X such that X is a point on the segment PQ which is this region and let F be the set of all X such that X is a point on segment Q be now try and think of the Universal set in this case it's simple it will be this entire segment a-b the universal set will be the set of all X such that X is a point on segment a B and 
,,remember every set under consideration will be a proper subset of the universal set you

Sets,fw1kyM0F00Y,integers good day students welcome back to my classroom for today's lesson you will learn how to describe the set of integers and identify real life situations to make use of it and compare integers let us begin integers are whole numbers which consists of zero positive and negative numbers let's take a look at this number line 
,,this number line is divided into right and left part by the number zero zero is an integer that is neither negative nor positive the numbers on the right side of 0 are the positive integers these positive integers are can be written with or without the positive sign while the numbers to the left of zero are the negative integers which must be written with the negative sign remember that integers are whole numbers fractions and decimals are not considered as integers some real-world situations can be modeled by integers let's take a look at this example the sea level represents zero while below the sea level represents negative numbers and above sea level represents by the positive numbers if we say 40 feet above sea level that means it is equivalent to positive 40 feet well if we say 40 feet below sea level it means it is equivalent to negative 40. now let's try another situational phrases which can also be represented by integers we have here 15 feet above the ground our clue word here is the word above which represents positive number this means that it can be represented by positive 15. another one we have ten floors up our key word here is the word up it means that it is positive then next one we have five steps backwards our clue word here is the word buff it means that we are going to move five steps backward so that is negative five and lastly we have decrease of nine points it can be represented by negative nine wonderful now if we are asked this question what is two units to the right of three it means that we need to move two units or two times to the right of the number three let's try it there it means two units to the right of three is positive five this also represents addition where when we add two and three that gives us positive five another example what is five units to the left of zero this means that we need to move five times to the left from zero so let's try great job so that is negative five this also represents subtraction where zero minus five is negative five now let's learn how to compare integers in comparing integers we need to understand that the numbers to the right of zero gets bigger and bigger while the numbers to the left of zero get smaller and smaller therefore zero is greater than negative numbers but less than positive numbers let's try an example let's compare zero and negative five since negative five is a negative integer and it can be found to the left of number zero this means that zero 
,,is greater than negative five let's have another example let's compare zero and positive five since five here is positive and it can be found to the right of zero this means that zero is less than positive five awesome we also need to understand that all positive numbers are greater than negative numbers it means that negative numbers are less than positive numbers let's have an example let us compare positive three and negative five when we take a look at here it seems that negative five is greater than positive three but since all positive numbers are greater than negative numbers it means that positive three is greater than negative five let's have 
,,another one this time let us compare negative four and positive one again all negative numbers are less than positive numbers these means that negative four is less 
,,than positive one now let's have another one what about we compare positive 18 and negative 25 since all positive numbers are greater than negative numbers it means 
,,that positive 18 is greater than negative 25 awesome now let's go to another one now what if we are comparing negative numbers since negative numbers get smaller and smaller it means that the bigger the number the smaller it is sounds confusing right let's have an example let us compare negative three and negative five it seems 
,,that negative five is greater than negative three but here negative three is closer to number zero this means that negative three is greater than negative five let's have another example let us compare negative four and negative two since negative four is bigger than negative two it means that negative four is less than negative two great job how about this one great job negative 40 is less than negative 21. wonderful great job students you made it now here are things that you learned today you

Sets,RnR57m46c8U,alright guys grab your papers and pencils get ready to practice a math assessment I'm going to give you one minute to try the problem on your own then I'm going to go through it your minute starts now all right Charlene has a special brownie recipe she needs 2 and 2/5 cups of sugar and 1 in 1/12 of cups of sugar for the icing how much sugar does she need in all essentially we are adding these two numbers together a shortcut is if I take the whole number part of that 1 and 2 and add those together 1 plus 2 equals 3 so we're going to need at least 3 and then the fraction that goes with it I can eliminate choices a and B because they're not at least 3 cups then I'm just adding the fractions we have 1/12 plus 2/5 to add fractions you have to have a common denominator in this case it's 60 to turn it into sixtieths we put 1 times 5 and 12 times 5 2 times 12 and 5 times 12 which gives us 5 60th plus 24 60th or 29 over 60 which matches our answer here 3 and 29 60th try question 2 you have 60 seconds starting now looking at the four different statements actually three different statements here we need to find out which one's not true or true I'm 
,,"sorry in order to do that we have to get these two equal or equivalent fractions what I mean by that is they need to both be fractions that they need to have the same denominator to turn this point zero four into a fraction it really is saying 4 over 100 so actually I'm going to put that for over 100 right down here to turn 11 2015 to something with the same denominator as this one we multiply the top and bottom by 4 giving us 44 over 100 now if we read that statement 4,400 Sizzlin for one "
,,hundredths you would clearly say no this is not true so a is out we need to do the same strategy here kind of working a little more quickly 13 over 100 and then this we take times 5 times 5 we get 10 over 100 is 10 over 100 greater than 13 over 100 No so we've eliminated two choices here 6% if you don't know is actually 6 out of 100 to get this to the hundreds we take it times 2 times 2 we get 6 over 100 equals Helu that we've found our choice question 3 I accidentally hit the timer so you 
,,have 51 seconds left to solve this problem all right mr. Scott spent 3925 on basketball cards he purchased four packs this is a unit rate problem if we write this as a fraction thirty-nine point two five or thirty nine dollars twenty five cents per four packages how much did he spend was it between six and seven seven and eight 
,,eight nine nine and ten the fastest way to get to this is use estimation if I instead say well that's close to $40 for four packs that I could quickly deduce is ten 
,,dollars per one pack the reason I did that it's hard to divide 39 point two five divided by four in your head but 40 divided by four is easy so it's about ten dollars a pack a little bit less so we look at these choices well it's clearly not between six and seven it's not seven and eight and it's not eight and nine it's definitely going to fall in the range of nine dollars and $10 actually closer to ten dollars as we found all right problem 4 here we go 60 seconds all right if I had a calculator I just take 4 divided by 50 and I'd be done since I don't I have to convert this to a decimal form I need to get the bottom or the denominator into the into 100 so I take that times 2 but I also take the top times 2 and that's going to give me 8 over 100 which is equivalent to point 0 8 choice is d all right question 5 here we go all right ms stork bought dinner for 12 people the cost of the dinner was 126 84 what's the average cost of each person's dinner now you're going to think of this as a unit rate problem where you have $126 84 cents per 12 people okay we need to figure out the fastest way to get to the cost now you could just divide 120 6.8 4/12 but remember you don't have a calculator so we're going to use estimation I'm going to drop this down to 120 dollars and I'm going to divide it by 12 that we can do in our head we say that's it ten dollars a meal it's actually going to be slightly more because we forgot to include this six dollars 84 cents but if I look 
,,at the answers if it's got to be more than $10 a Zout bees out sees out and here's our choice letter D number six here we go Oh all right takes two and three-quarter gallons of paint to paint each wall on miss Reed's house if she needs to paint three walls how much paint will she need well she's going to need three times two and three quarters we need to figure out three times two and three quarters as quickly as we can how I would approach this is I take three times two gives me six then I take three times the three quarters and I think of that three quarters plus 3/4 plus three quarters you know there's several ways you can do this in your head gives me nine fourths or two in 1/4 adding these two together I get 8 and 1/4 or choice B number seven here we go alright here we go guys David waited in lunch line for 1/2 an hour if you can't see that Raymond waited for 1/4 hour how much longer did David wait then Raymond so we need to figure out how to take David's time 1/2 hour and subtract Raymond's time of 1/4 hour we need the same denominator so if I take this times 2 what I end up getting is 2 quarters of an hour minus one quarter of an 
,,hour giving me David waited one quarter of an hour longer choice see last question for today number 8 ready set go all right Girona Cabaye is four boxes of brownie mix each box cost three dollars sixty-seven cents what's the best estimate of the total cost with four boxes so in other words we have to take four times three dollars and 67 cents now you may have different methods of doing this here's the method I would use because we want to get an estimate I would take four times three so right there we get twelve dollars then I would take four times sixty cents which gives me two dollars and forty cents and then I would take four times seven cents which gives me twenty-eight cents if I add all those together and I don't even have to add them perfectly I get fourteen dollars and sixty-eight cents and what that tells me is that between fourteen and fifteen dollars now there's other ways of doing this you may have different ways you could actually round this up to three dollars and seventy cents and that would give you a pretty good estimate it kind of depends on how you see those numbers but estimating we need between fourteen and fifteen dollars you just completed eight problems from your math assessment practice we put you on a timer to illustrate the idea that you only have about one minute to complete these problems we will see you tomorrow

Sets,AAY1bsazcgM,"Hi! Welcome to Math Antics. In this lesson, were going to learn about an important concept in Geometry called Perimeter. Perimeter is just a fancy math term that "
,,means the distance (or length) around a shape. ...but
,,what exactly does the distance around a shape mean? Well... distance (or length) is a 1-dimensional quantity that we can measure with units like
,,"centimeters, inches or miles. That means that perimeter is also a 1-dimensional quantity that we can measure with units of length. For example, the perimeter of a shape wouldnt be just 10, but it could be 10 cm. Or, instead of being just 25, it could be 25 miles. The units are REALLY important"
,,"when youre talking about perimeter! Okay, but what exactly do we mean by,"
,,around a shape? It seems like there would be a lot of different ways
,,to go around a shape. Some of them would be short
,,"and some of them would be very long. Well, perimeter means the absolute shortest distance possible around a shape. That would be the distance youd get if you traced the path exactly around the border (or edge) of a shape. A good way to see what perimeter is, is to imagine that you could walk right along the edge of a shape, like this 5-sided polygon. Imagine starting at one of the polygons vertices and then walking along each side until you got all the way back to the point that you started from. The total distance you traveled would be the perimeter of that shape. In this case, if the length of each side of the polygon was 10 meters, the total length you would travel along all 5 sides would add up to 50 meters. Another good way to see what perimeter is, is to imagine that you could take a shape, like this square, and break it at one of its corners. Then, you could unfold the shape until it formed a straight line.  The length of that line is the perimeter of the shape. Doing this helps you understand why perimeter is a 1-dimensional quantity, even though it applies to 2-dimensional shapes like this square. Its 1-dimensional because its the distance of the lines that go around the 2-dimensional shape. Okay, so now that you know what perimeter is, how do we measure or calculate it for different geometric shapes? Well... that depends on the shapes. Finding the perimeter of shapes that have curves, like circles or hearts or things like that, can be tricky. In fact, well wait and talk about the perimeter of a circle in another video. In this video, were just going to focus on how to find the perimeter of polygons. Since polygons are made from only straight sides, its easy to find their perimeter. If you know the length of each side, all you have to do is add them up, and the total length you end up with is the perimeter of the polygon. Lets try doing that with a few examples so you see how it works... the first polygon well try is a triangle. "
,,"This triangle has three sides that are each a different length: 3cm, 4cm and 5cm. Now, to find the perimeter of the triangle, all we have to do is add up the lengths of those three sides. 3 + 4 + 5 = 12 But dont forget.  Its not just 12. Its 12 centimeters. Always remember to also put down the units of the perimeter. Okay, that was easy.  Lets try another one. This time our polygon is a rectangle.  And you can see that the shorter sides are each 5m long and the longer sides are each 10m long. So... lets add them all up. We can add up the sides in any order we want to, as long as we dont forget any sides or accidentally count any of them twice. And I think Ill add up the two short sides first. 5 + 5 = 10 Next, Ill add up the two longer sides. 10 + 10 = 20 And now, if I add up those two answers, Ill get the total for all 4 sides. 10 + 20 = 30 So, the perimeter of this rectangle is 30 METERS! Ha!  You thought I was going to forget my units, didnt you. Not this time! Ah, heres another good example. This is a 6-sided regular polygon. A regular polygon means that all its sides are exactly the same length. Thats good because this diagram only shows the length of ONE side. (4 cm). But since the polygon is regular, we know that all the sides must also be 4 cm long. Now, we could just add up "
,,"all the sides like we did before, but since they are all the same, we can use multiplication as a shortcut. Thats because multiplication is really just repeated addition. All we have to do is multiply the number of sides (6) by the length of the sides (4 cm). 6 x 4 = 24 so that means the total perimeter must be 24. 24 what?    "
,,"                                 . Ooo - Centimeters !!! Thats better.                            . And this formula works for ANY regular polygon, no matter how many sides there are. If the sides are ALL THE SAME LENGTH,  you can just multiply the number of sides by the side length, and you have the perimeter! Okay, let's try "
,,one more example. This polygon also has six sides but its NOT a regular polygon. The sides are different lengths and this ones really tricky because they only show us
,,the length of four of the sides. The other two are missing!
,,"So how can we figure them out? Problems like this come up all the time in math; problems where you arent quite given all the information. When you have this kind of problem, the key is to use what you DO know to figure out what you DONT know.  Heres what I mean... Look closely at the two vertical sides that we DO know the lengths of (4 inches and 6 inches) Now... imagine that those two vertical sides could be moved straight across to the other side... the side that we dont know the length of. By doing that, you can see that the missing length would just be the combination of the two vertical lengths we DO know: 4 inches and 6 inches. And since 4 + "
,,"6 = 10, the missing vertical side must be 10 inches long. Notice that we can do the same thing for the horizontal sides that we do know. If we imagine those moving down to the side that we dont know, we see that its length must equal the combination of those two lengths. 10 inches plus 5 inches equals 15 inches. There, weve used the lengths that we DID know to figure out the lengths that we DIDNT know. And now that we know the length of ALL the sides, we can just add them all up to get "
,,"the perimeter. 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 And then 15 + 15 = 30 30 + 10 = 40 and last of all, 40 + 10 = 50 So, the sum of all the sides is 50 inches."
,,"Thats the perimeter of this shape. And thats the end of this lesson. Weve learned that Perimeter is the distance (or length) around a geometric shape, and weve learned how to calculate it for any polygon. You just add up the lengths of all the sides and the total length is the perimeter. Oh... and dont forget your units! Also, dont forget that to get good at math takes practice! Thanks for watching Math Antics"

Sets,tyDKR4FG3Yw,welcome to discrete mathematics let's start with set theory which is a very fundamental notion in the entirety of mathematics so what is a set a set is a collection 
,,of objects called elements and this is very vague because we can have a set about anything we want and usually we talk about sets by drawing little circles so for instance if I want to set up let's say the numbers 1 2 & 3 I can draw a circle I can put the numbers 1 2 & 3 in there and that is a set containing numbers 1 2 & 3 and 
,,we can write this formally in curly braces and writing all of the elements inside so in this case our set contains 1 2 & 3 and we can give this a label and maybe call this a so these are all different ways of representing the same thing a is the set 1 2 & 3 which looks like a circle containing elements 1 2 & 3 of course this is 
,,just visual and this notation in curly braces is called a lists notation because you're listing them all now sets can be finite or they can be infinite so we can have a set a containing all the numbers between 1 & 9 or we can have the set of positive integers that go from 1 all the way up to infinity and in this case this is an 
,,infinite set so these dots mean that there's an implied pattern that just goes on forever so here that plus if we have 1 2 3 4 we put dot dot we mean that it goes 5 
,,6 7 8 9 10 so on and so forth so those are really the fundamental notions of sets now there's some additional points these sets and that is that repeated elements are only listed once so if we have a set a bacb a even though a is repeated three times we only write at once B is repeated twice we only write at once and C is repeated once so this set a BA CBA is the same set as ABC and they would both be drawn as circles with some element a some element B and some elements C if we don't care about the amount of numbers of these things in there we don't care if there's three A's we don't care if there's two B's we just want to know what's inside our circle there's also no order in a set and then a diagram this is easy to see because there's no order in a circular diagram but essentially the set three to one is the same thing as a set one two three and it's also the same thing as the set to one three so on and so forth there's no order to these sets so those are two pretty important parts usually on an exam you might be given a set that has repeated elements and they might ask you how big is this set how many things are in it and if you're not sure about repeated elements then you might get the wrong answer there's a few common sets that we should talk about one of them is the natural numbers the first time I made this video controversy and there's still some controversy but there's two ways to do the natural numbers one of them is to start with zero do 1 2 3 all the way up forever and ever a another group of mathematicians starts the natural numbers with 1 2 3 so on and so forth I'm going to refer to the natural numbers starting with 1 as the positive integers and I talk about natural numbers anywhere else I will usually mean including 0 but I may be more specific about it so I will specify whether it includes 0 or not but typically with 1 2 3 so on and so forth I'll use Z plus the integers are a set of numbers which are either positive or negative and they're whole numbers so all the way from negative infinity negative 2 negative 1 0 1 2 all the way to positive infinity so that is Z that's very important notion which we use a lot in discrete math and then rational numbers all these kind of hard to list so I'm going to cheat a little bit for now and I'm going to say well we have like 1 over 1 1 over 2 1 over 3 2 over 3 so on and so forth and in a few slides we'll figure out a better way to write this so of course rational numbers are any numbers you can write as a fraction so elements and cardinality now we know what sets are now we know some additional pointers about sets we know some common sets but we want to be able to talk about the things in those sets and how big those sets are so I have C and I have a set containing yellow blue and red so these are the primary colors fact sets don't have to be all mathematics they can be words too and have meaning in the real world so I want to say something like yellow is an element of C and this means that yellow is inside of our set C now how do we write this well we have an element yellow and we want to say it's part of a set C so in order to write this in notation we use this Epsilon so yellow is in the set C what about saying green is not in the set C so I want to say Green is not in here in fact 
,,we don't see it in the set C so what were you to say Green is not in C well we use the set membership symbol and we just put a line through it to mean Green is not in our set see how do we talk about the size of this I would say the size of C is 3 which means the amount of things in C is 3 there are 3 different elements in C well we just draw these absolute value bars around it so we say that the absolute value or the size of C is equal to 3 and that's just that the cardinality of C is 3 so now we can talk about whether things are intercepts and how many things are in our sets now there's one particularly interesting set that contains nothing at this is called the empty set and this is written with this symbol and if I wanted to write it in the set notation with curly braces it would look like this it has a left curly brace or right curly brace and there's nothing inside of it because it's empty so what's the size of this set well there's nothing in it so the size of it is zero and there's only one set that has a size of zero and that is the empty set so here's the question and I'm throwing this right at you right away because this trips people up all the time what is the size of the set containing the empty set so I'm asking if I have a set containing the empty set what's the size of that set well 
,,this empty set is an element of the larger set so the size of the set containing the empty set is one because this set itself there's a big set has one element it has an empty set as an element so sets can have sets as elements we'll see another example later but typically I like to look where the commas are so if they like a big set and a comma then another big set and that's all it's in the set and there be two elements in this case we have these empty braces but there's something inside 
,,of it so therefore there's an element in that set this is difference of course than the size of the set containing nothing this would be zero so we can see the contrast between these two sets this is the empty set on the right well this is a set containing the empty set on the left the left one has a size of 1 the right one has 
,,a size of zero and we can see the differences visually okay so that's the empty set there'll be more questions about the empty set when we get to the subsets video so more tricky stuff will happen there the next thing we should talk about is set builder notation so before I introduce the rational numbers MSI Delta is 1 over 1 1 
,,over 2 1 over 3 2 over 3 so on and so forth it's going to be a better way of representing this entire set and this is set builder notation or we can call it maybe predicate notation where we define elements as variables so for instance I can say this is the set containing elements that are of the form M over m such that so the straight bar means such that and now I'm going to give a rule so the left is like the form that it takes and on the right side we're going to give it a rule we're going to say that m and n have to be integers and also M has to not be 0 so that way we're not dividing by 0 and this expresses the entire set of rational numbers I'm saying look take any two integers m and n we could put em on top of N and as long as n is in 0 it's going to be in that set soul do another example with even integers so we can write all the way to negative infinity negative 4 negative 2 0 2 & 4 so on and so forth to infinity or we could do this in set builder notation so we could say this is the set of 2 n such that n is an integer so what this means is we take an integer n so let's say we take one then in our set we add 2 times that integer so 2 times 1 so we add 2 let's say we take 2 then we take 2 times 2 and put it are set for let's say we take negative 1 when we take negative 1 times 2 and then we get negative 2 in our set as well and this just goes on forever so for every n that is an integer we add 2n to our set and that gives us a set of even integers so here's a more linguistic example so something we can flying in the real world to see how this notation works I have a desk and on this desk I have a drink I have a laptop and I have a microphone and there's some other things on my desk that I could list but let's just say my desk only has these three things now this is one way I 
,,can talk about things I can say I got these two strengths of soft office microphone on my desk or I could write this in set builder notation if I might have a lot more things or maybe I want to be bagged or maybe I'm not entirely sure what's on my desk but I know there's things on my desk so I could rewrite this as the scent of 
,,X so this is a variable X and what's the condition for X X is on my desk yeah so this is kind of cheating right but they're the same set so the first one I'm listing all these items individually the second one I'm saying look it's the set of variables X and whatever X is it just happens to be on my desk so everything that's on my desk is just going to shove it in as X and it's going to build a set with it so that's the set builder notation and of course mathematically we do this very formally with the course numbers and formulas and notation while of course if you do a linguistics example with words it's much more wordy it's much more flexible much more floaty but they both convey the same meaning so if you didn't quite understand the mathematic example then hopefully you'll be able to translate this desk example 
,,back into the mathematics after all maybe understanding this at a more fundamental level so here I have some exercises and these all refer to the or the first two refer to the set D as the third one is completely different try them yourself and if not well I'll give you the answers now so list the elements of D D is the set of X in positive integers such that X is less than 6 so I'm going to take all X less than 6 and adds into the set if it's positive integer so this means that I can have 
,,one because one is a positive integer n is less than six let's do this in a different color two three four and five can I add six I can't add six because X is not less than six can I add zero well I can't add zero because I want the X's that are in positive integers and zero is not a positive integer okay what's the cardinality 
,,of D then well this is easier because I've already written out all the elements in my set so I see there's five things there so I can say the cardinality of B is equal to five because it contains the numbers one two three four and five now here's another question and this is what I alluded to before what is the cardinality of the set containing the empty set and the set a B okay so how many elements are in the set and when we look at sense it's kind of like looking into a box and saying well what can I see I see an empty set and I see another set so really what I see inside this box if I were to draw this out is a box containing nothing and a box containing a and B so the stuff inside of these boxes essentially with a cardinality question these things are invisible you can't see what's going on so the question is 
,,how many things do we see inside that set what is the size how many elements are in that set that big box and the answer to this is two and so I said look at the commas here so we have an empty set which is the first thing then we have a comma then we have this other entire set so there's two things we can see now how does this 
,,differ from let's say if we have a set containing the empty set the set a and then the set containing B well this is different of course so in this example if I were to draw this we have a box containing nothing in it we have a box with a in it and then we have another box with being it so how many elements do we see well we can't see inside these boxes but if we just open our box and take a look we'll see three other boxes so in other words the size of this would be three one more example 
,,let's say we took away one of these so now I have something that looks like this I have the empty set I have the element a and I have a set containing B once again there are three elements that we can see we can see this box containing something they can see the element a and then we can see this box containing something else which happens to be B so once again this cardinality is equal to three so that is it for the introduction to set Theory video if you have any questions please leave them in the comments below and I will do my best to answer them

Sets,qc8LHRMs6FQ,today we will learn about factors first let us understand what we mean by the factor of a number let us take the number 12 to begin with let us find out the pairs of numbers that give 12 as their product 1 into 12 is equal to 12 2 into 6 is equal to 12 3 into 4 is equal to 12 so we get 3 pairs of numbers that give us the product 12 no other pair of numbers when multiplied will give the product 12 now let us take each pair of number separately and understand what it means let us take the first pair 1 into 12 is equal to 12 here when we divide 12 by 1 we get the quotient as 12 and when we divide 12 by 12 we get the quotient as 1 in both the cases the remainder is 0 thus it means that 12 is divisible by 1 and 12 pair to 2 into 6 is equal to 12 here when we divide 12 by 2 we get the quotient as 6 and if we divide 12 by 6 we get the quotient as 2 in both the cases the remainder is 0 thus it means that 12 is divisible by 2 and 6 pair 3 3 into 4 is equal to 12 here if we divide 12 by 3 we get the quotient as 4 and if we divide 12 by 4 we get the quotient as 3 here also we get the remainder as 0 in both the divisions thus it means that 12 is divisible by 3 and 4 thus we now understand that 12 is divisible by 1 2 3 4 6 and 12 hence we see that the numbers 1 2 3 4 6 and 12 are the factors of 12 hence we can define factor of a number as a number which exactly divides the given number or we can see that factors are numbers you can multiply together to get given number now 
,,let us look at certain points which we need to understand related to a factor with the help of some examples point 1 1 is a factor of every number look at the examples 1 into 6 is equal to 6 8 divided by 1 is equal to 8 thus 1 multiplied by any number gives the number itself as the product and any number divided by 1 also gives 
,,the number itself as the quotient hence we conclude that 1 is a factor of every number point to every number is a factor of itself we know that 6 into 1 is equal to 
,,6 8 divided by 8 is equal to 1 thus any number multiplied by 1 gives the number itself as the product and any number divided by itself gives 1 as the quotient hence 
,,every number is a factor of itself 3 the factor of a number is always less than or equal to the number look at the factors of 12 which we found out earlier they are 
,,1 2 3 4 6 and 12 note that the factors 1 2 3 4 & 6 are less than 12 and the last factor 12 is equal to 12 thus it shows that the factor of a number is always less than or equal to the number for every number except one has at least two factors one and the number itself let us look at the factors of 7d are one and seven no other 
,,pair of numbers when multiplied together will give the product seven that is the number seven has at least two factors one and seven that is number one and the number seven itself hence we can see that every number except one has at least two factors one and the number itself do remember these points properly they will help you 
,,to find the factors as we go further now let us find the factors of one more number let us take the number 30 the pairs of numbers which give the product 30 are 1 into 30 is equal to 30 2 into 15 is equal to 33 into 10 is equal to 30 5 into 6 is equal to 30 thus the factors of 30 are 1 2 3 5 6 10 15 and 30 now look at these factors and remember these points 1 a factor of a number exactly divides that number to one is a factor of every number three every number is a factor of itself for the 
,,factor of a number is always less than or equal to the number five every number except one has at least two factors one and the number itself wasn't it easy to learn about factors why don't you try to find the factors of some numbers yourself

Sets,GUkkmML6PA8,do welcome once again children of grade five we're here again to explore more about mathematics in particular sets but before we get into today's lesson we are going to look at the homework from the previous lesson so let's get started the activity that you had to complete for homework says write equal or equivalent for the following pairs of sets write equal or equivalent for the following pairs of sets number one we have the first set with one as its member and another set with a as its member so the pair of set children is it equal or equivalent now because the two sets have different members we are sure that they are not equal however they both have one member so they are equivalent number one equivalent number two the first set has the members six eight nine and the next set says composite numbers less than nine composite numbers less than nine so what are the composite numbers less than nine let's see composite numbers have more than two factors so the numbers with more than two factors that are less than nine are four six eight four six and eight now three members so would number two be equal or equivalent if you said equivalent you are correct number three the first set has members 1 4 9 16 1 4 9 16. its pair has members square numbers less than 25 square numbers less than 25 so we have to figure out what are the square numbers less than 25 so the square numbers which means when we multiply a number by itself that is a square number the result is a square number so let's see one times one will give us one two times two four three times three nine and four times four sixteen five times five 25 but they said less than 25 so the square numbers less than 25 are 1 4 9 16. so it means that the pair of sets are equal number four the first set has members 0 1 2 3 and its pair has members that are whole numbers from 0 to 3 whole numbers from 0 to 3. now the whole numbers from 0 to 3 are 0 1 2 3. so it means children that that pair of sets they are also equal equal let's look at number five the first set for number five has members one two three four five one two three four five and its pair has members that are natural numbers less than six natural numbers less than six now we know that natural numbers are the whole numbers from one zero is not a natural number so the natural numbers less than six are one two three four five so it means again we have equal sets equal sets and the last of the homework number six the first set has members x y zero x y zen and its pair has members that are consonants between a and e consonants between a and e so let's list the consonants between a and e the consonants are b c d b c d so we can definitely see that those two sets are not equal but they are equivalent since they have the same number of members so that's it for our homework today we are going to continue to look at sets however we are looking at the union and intersection of sets so today we will be able to define the terms 
,,union and intersection and we will also be able to find the union and intersection of given sits are you ready to get into the lesson i sure am let's dive right into it first we are going to look at the union of sets so when you hear the word union what do you think of so i am sure that you would have come up with answers like unite join bring together all of those words are correct the union of two sets is all the elements of each of the two sets combined the union of two sets is all the elements of each of the two sets combined which means we bring together or rejoin all the members of the two sets when we find the union of sets we number one we unite or join the members of the different sets we do not list a member more than once we list the members in curly brackets and separate each with a comma when we find 
,,the union of sets children we unite or join the members of the different sets we do not list a member more than once we list the members in curly brackets and separate each with commas the symbol for union is the symbol for union is let's look at an example here we have two sets set a equals one two three four set b equals two 4 6. can you see that now if we ask to find the union of set a and set b this is how we write it e the symbol for union b so a union b equals and remember we're listing those members in curly brackets and we're going to separate each with a comma a union b equals let's join those two sets together one two three four six one two three four six children we must ensure that we include all the members of the two sets however we do not list a member twice so if you notice in set a you have the members 2 and four those members are also found in set b when we are finding the union of the two sets we do not list the members 2 and 4 twice let's look at another example here we have what we call a venn diagram remember in a previous lesson we said that we can represent sets in loops or in shapes now here in the venn diagram we have set a and we have set b a union b would be all the members of the two sets in seti the members are do you know which members are in set a correct if you said 
,,2 five seven that is indeed correct two five and seven are members of set a now what are the members of set b that's correct also one two five and eight are the members of set b one two five and eight are the members of set b now i am sure that you have noticed that the members two and five belong to both sets 2 and 5 belong to 
,,both sets now when we're finding the union of set a and b we're going to bring those two sets together so we're joining their members so the members of a union b are 1 2 5 seven eight now i'm sure you would have picked up that no member was repeated one two 5 7 8 are the members of a union b so once again children what do you understand by the term union union means to join together or unite the members of two or more sets excellent job so now that we understand what the union of sets is about we're going to look at the intersection of two sets intersection of two sets so what the term intersection means sometimes when you're traveling on the road your parents would say we are at an intersection what do you understand by that think about that a little okay if you said an intersection is where two roads meet or across you are absolutely correct so today we're going to look at intersection of sets so the intersection of two sets is all the elements that are common to both sets 
,,again the intersection of two sets are all the members or elements that are common to both sets so when we say common what do we mean the members that are the same the members that can be found in both sets the symbol for intersection children is this the symbol for intersection so let's look at an example we have set a equals 1 two three four and set b equals two four six now we are going to look at a intersect b a intersect b so if we're looking at a intersect b it means that we have to look at all those members that are common to set a and set b are the members that are the same in both set a and b have you recognized those members as yet now a intersect b equals two four so two and 4 are the members that are the same in set a as well as in set b great job boys and girls so so far you know what the term union means and now you know what the term intersection means let's look at intersection using a venn diagram so example two we have this venn diagram now which part of the two sets a and b is shaded which part or section of the two sets a and b is shaded of course we can see that the middle section or the part where the two sets join 
,,or where they meet that part is called the intersection remember earlier we said when two rows roads cross we have an intersection well set a and set b they're overlapping in the middle so that is the intersection of the two sets the members that are found in the middle belong to both sets that's what intersection means so now you have a full understanding of what the term intersection means we have to also learn two other terms now when we talk about intersection of sets you must understand the terms joint sets and disjoint sits joint sets and this joint sits now joint sets have common members that is they intersect these joint sets do not have common members that is they do not intersect here is an example of disjoint sets are they intersecting children no because they have no common members so let's recap the union of two or more sets would be those members that we join together when we join the members of two or more sets together we would have found the union of those sets remember also we do not list members more than once the symbol for union is the symbol for union is the intersection of two sets would be all the members that are common in both sets so the members that are the same belong to the intersection and if we are to represent those sets using a venn diagram we have to draw those sets joining or intersecting the common members would be in the center of the two sets the symbol for intersection is the symbol for intersection is so boys and girls today we would have learned about union and inter-section of sets like always you have homework to complete your homework for today says list the union and intersection of the following sets list the union and intersection of the following sets now an example is done for you example we have set x equals the first three multiples 
,,of six set y equals factors of 24 now before we can find the union or the intersection of sets we must list the members of these sets so the members of set x are 6 12 18. the members of set y are 1 2 3 4 6 8 12 24 so x union y which means we are joining those two sets together or rejoining the members of those two sets together 
,,is one 2 3 4 6 8 12 18 24 and x intersect y which means we're looking for the common members of set x and set y these members are six and twelve six and twelve so now that you have an example done for you children please ensure you complete the homework and when we begin the next lesson on sets we are going to explore the answers thank you very much see you until next time you

Sets,8dup8yGwBhM,hello welcome back to my channel this is Anna and today we are going to study about the types of sets I uploaded another video which was about the introduction of says you haven't watched that video you can go and watch that it will give you an overview of what sets are and it's kind of an introduction to the concept of sets so 
,,if you haven't watched it and you don't know I'm going to put the link of that video in the description box down below so let's start with today's video which is the types of sets so let's first see what are the contents of our today's video so what are we going to learn today in this video we are going to learn about what finite and infinite sets are what is an empty set or a null set what is a singleton set and what are equal in equivalent sets so let's move further alright so moving on with the first topic which is finite and infinite sets so let's see what does these words mean so finite means that something which is limited in number or quantity or countable it means that um there's a limited amount of number and you can count it they can be easily counted it's not something that you cannot count they can be 
,,easily counted all right so they are kind of limited in number or quantity and they're easily countable alright so this is what finite means okay now what is infinite infinite means that something which is unlimited in number or quantity or uncountable so it's basically the totally opposite of what finite is you cannot count an 
,,infinite quantity there's no limit to it it will go on and on and on so there's no stopping to it you cannot count it at all so the uncountable quantities are means 
,,that it's an infinite alright infinite means uncountable all right all right now let's say what does finite set means a set having limited number of elements is called a finite set alright so basically you know that in a set there are elements the things that are included and said are known as elements and they're separated by commas okay so if there's a limited amount of elements in it there's a stop to it they are countable it's known as a finite set okay for example set a is equal to the set of vowels in English alphabet which is a is equal to AE I owe you so here you can see that they are countable there's a limited amount of it they are not going 
,,on and on and on on and on so there is a stop to it so basically it's a finite set the set of vowels in English alphabet is finite set its countable okay now let's take another example set B is equal to the set of natural numbers less than 10 okay so you know that the natural number starts from 1 so the numbers less than 10 would be from 1 to 9 that's a limited number okay so B is equal to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 okay so you have put a limited limit to the numbers of natural numbers okay if you are considering for it from 1 to 9 so this is a finite set okay this is countable you can easily write it it's really comfortable okay there is no there is not something that is going on it's not something that you cannot count its countable you have put a limit to it okay all right now comes the infinite set so infinite set is basically totally the opposite of what finite set is so it means that it's definition goes as a set having unlimited number of elements is called an infinite set okay which is a set which has an unlimited number of elements the elements which are which cannot be counted there are uncountable sets uncountable elements which will go on and on and there's no stop to it you cannot count it there is no limit to it ok so this is what an infinite set is for example n is equal to the set of all natural okay so all natural numbers means from 1 to um you can say like there is no stopping to it you know that to millions trillions how many there so you know that there is no kind of stop number for a finite set you put a limit to it alright sure that you are considering it from one to hundred from one mm so you put in a limit to it all right so this till this amount you going to count so an infra-red said you cannot counter it they will be going on and on and on alright so how I going to represent it that is M is equal to bracket 1 2 3 comma dot dot so this is how you're going to represent an infinite set infinite set let me do a little recap for you 
,,is that infrared set is the one which cannot be counted it cannot be easily counted okay all right let's take another example as well o is equal to the set of odd numbers which can be written as o is equal to 1 comma 3 comma 5 comma 7 and then dot dot dot o it means that there are uncountable numbers as I mentioned earlier it will be going on and on and on so there's no limit to it unlimited number of elements so this is an example it's a perfect example of infinite set let's consider another example which is W is equal to the set of whole numbers which can be written as W is equal to 0 1 2 3 dot dot dot dot dot right so you know that numbers go from 0 whole numbers go from 0 and natural numbers go from 1 to an unlimited amount okay so this is how you going to write an infinite set this is how the set of odd numbers and set of whole numbers can be written as infinite sets only when they are a there's no limit for example if it was written from 1 it's a set of odd numbers from 1 to 99 then you were putting a limit to it so it became a finite set because you have strained the total number of numbers do a specific number okay from 1 to 99 all right in the set of whole numbers if you said set of all whole numbers less than 100 which means that from 0 to 99 it makes it a finite set because you have put a limit to it in this case there is no limit to it it's going on and on and on so it becomes a it becomes an infinite set okay okay now here's an example the example 
,,says that separate the finite and infinite sets okay so in this question we have been given four different type of sets and now we have to identify which one of them which one of them is finite and which one of them is infinite okay so let's see the sets which are the set of items in a departmental store number two set is bracket 2 4 6 8 and dot dot dot bracket closed the third one is the set of English alphabets and the set for is 1 2 3 4 and dot dot dot all right so out of this if you have star if you have listened to what I said earlier now I guess before me telling you we'll be able you will yourself be able to identify what the far out of these four what are the five which one of them are finite and which one of them are infinite ok so let's see number one the set of items in a departmental store you know that in a departmental store there are limited amount of items in it so they aren't countable which makes it finite sets right ok now look at the second one which says 
,,as two four six eight dot dot dot so it's going on and on there's no limit defined to it it is a infinite set because uncountable a number of elements are in it ok now let's see the third one the set of English alphabets okay you know that in English there are 26 and four bits in English language okay so it's finite it's limited so it becomes a finite set okay now look at part number four which is one two three four and dot dot dot dot so it's going on and on which makes it an infinite set 
,,right so number one and number three are finite sets because they are limited amount of elements and in them and number two and number four are infinite sets because there is no limit to it okay okay now comes the empty set or a null set NT or null means the same you know that from their basic meaning empty means something which has nothing in it okay so an empty seat you must have got an idea from its name empty set is one which has no element filling okay let's look at its definition I said having no element is known as an empty set or a null set okay an empty set can be written as the curly brackets and it has nothing in it okay you're going not going to write any element in it so it's going to represent a an empty set it is also denoted by Phi so the symbol you're seeing over here which has like o or a zero with a straight line in between add a horizontal vertical line in between it it's known as five phi5 it's a Greek letter Phi okay so let's take an example of empty sets the set of 20 is a set of days of 25 ours so you know that one days of 24 hours there is no day which has more than 24 hours so it's an empty set because then you 
,,cannot write any element in it there is no day of 24 25 hours so it's a empty set then let's look at another example which is a set the set of horns on a horse you know that horns are all cows I know Bulls are and or deer okay so there's no kind of horns on horse horns are seen you don't have a horse has no seen one then so it's going to be an empty set okay now comes the singleton set okay singleton as you can see the word in it single single means having only one so a single ton set is the is a set which has only one element in it okay I said having a single element is a singleton set okay for example a is equal to bracket a packet closed so there is only one element in it similarly said B is equal to racket one packet closed so there is only one element in it let's take another example C is equal to bracket six bracket closed so in all these three sets you can see there is only one element so it's a singleton set all right now comes the equivalent sets so what are equivalent sets two sets can be called equivalent sets if there is one to one correspondence between the elements of both the sets number two the number of elements in both 
,,the sets are same okay let me explain it again one-to-one correspondence between the elements of both the sets basically means that for every element of one set there is another element in the other set okay so in short or a in a short way you can understand that for the two sets to be equivalent there must be same number of elements of both of them if set a has four elements then said P must have four elements only then they will be equivalent sets let's take a look at the example okay now look at set a set a is equal to one two three four and said be here is a b c d now as you can see that a has four elements and said b has also has four elements so 
,,you can see that there is a one-to-one correspondence in between them okay for every set element of set a there is an element in set B so it's it the the both are equivalent sets and it can be denoted as a this kind of a double arrow double-faced arrow P a arrow B okay now let's take another example suppose set C is equal to 1 3 5 7 and set D is a e i o jo now here you can see that see I said C has four elements and set D has five elements so they're an equal number of elements in both the 
,,sets so here you can see that there is no one to one correspondence in between them D has more elements than C so such kind of sets are known as non equivalent sets 
,,and they can be written as C with this double-faced arrow having us / ok so this is how you're going to write it okay so this these kind of sets are known as non equivalent sets all right now comes the equal sets so as the name suggests the equal sets are equal in every manner so the equal sets are those sets in which there is one-to-one correspondence meaning that for every element of one set there is another element in the other set they are equal number of elements meaning that both of the assets must have same number of elements and the point three says that the elements are same but the orders can be changed okay now in this case elements in both 
,,the set are totally same identical elements in both sets okay but it's not necessary that the arrangement or order is same they can be arranged in any manner okay if it's written one two three four in the other side it can be three four two one okay so let me explain it with an example okay let's suppose a set a is equal to 2 4 
,,6 8 10 and set B is 4 8 10 to 6 now here you can see that in both the sets the elements are equal in number that a has 5 elements and set B has 5 elements and you can see if you look closely you can see that both of these sets have same number of elements but their order is changed here in set 8 was written 2 4 6 8 10 and inside B it's written 4 8 10 to 6 okay the elements are totally same but the orders are changed so in this case the both are equal sets it's not necessary that the orders 
,,are change it can be changed it cannot be changed but if they are changed it doesn't mean that it will become some other kind of set it will remain the equal sets okay so these such kind of pair of sets is known as the equal sets and they can be denoted as a is equal to B okay okay now let me give you a little recap of what we have started in this lecture today so number one finite sets have limited number of elements okay infinite sets have unlimited number of elements in them okay so there is no limitation to their quantity empty set has no element singleton set has only one element equivalent sets have same number of elements in both sets okay and equal sets have same elements in them in same number as well okay so this was today's lecture I hope you all enjoyed it and you must have understood what have what have been taught in it so don't forget to subscribe to my channel so that you will get notified about it whenever I'm going to upload another video and definitely I'll be uploading videos related to this session all year round okay so meet you in another video take care and bye bye

Sets,VBzlvKP-2yI,types of sets empty set singleton set finite set infinite set equal sets equivalent sets universal set subset proper subset superset proper superset powerset empty set a set with no element this is the symbol of an empty set let's name it set e another way of writing that is using the symbol the null set the cardinality of set e is equal to zero this notation simply means the number of elements singleton set assert with one element set s is a singleton set the cardinality of set s is one finite set a set with limited elements example set F is a set of counting numbers less than 6 the elements of set F are 1 2 3 4 5 the cardinality of set F is 5 infinite set a set width and limited elements example set n is the set of counting numbers the element subset n are 1 2 3 and so on the cardinality of set n is infinite equal sets two sets are equal if they have the same elements example set E is a set of letters in the word earth the element subset e r e a R th set H is a set of letters in the word heart the elements of set H are H E a R T set E and set H have the same elements they are equal sets set e equals set H equivalent sets equivalent sets have different elements but have the same number of elements example given set F and set H the cardinality of set F is 5 and the cardinality of set H is 5 the to sets have different elements but they have the same number of elements set F is equivalent to set H Universal set Universal set is the set containing all elements at 
,,which all other sets are subsets the universal set is represented by a capital letter you example let u be the universal set set u is the set of all flowers in the English alphabet all other sets are subsets of the universal set set a is a proper subset of set you set B is also a proper subset of set u all the elements of sets a and B are also found in the universal set another example set U is a set of counting numbers sets a B and C are proper subsets of set u because a universal set contains all the elements in a particular problem subset set a is a subset of set D if and only if every element in a is also an element in B here's an example list of the possible subsets upset a number-one asset with three elements two three four sets with one element five six seven sets with two elements in number eight is an empty set how many subsets does set a health to find the number of subsets use this formula two to the power of n where n is a number of elements the cardinality of set a is 3 so 2 to the power of 3 is just 2 times 2 times 2 equals 8 proper subset set a is a proper subset of set B if there is at least one element in B not contained in a in symbol set a is a proper subset of set B example given sets a B C and D set B is a proper subset of set a set C is a proper subset of set a set D is a proper subset of set a list all the proper subsets of set a set one to three have two elements sets four five six have one element and number seven is an empty set the set itself is not a proper subset of set a how many proper subsets does set a half since the set itself is not a proper subset the formula is 2 to the power of n minus 1 where n is the number of elements the cardinality of set a is 3 using the formula to ^ 3 minus 1 equals 8 minus 1 is 7 supper set supper set is a set containing all of the elements of another set symbol set a is a supper set of set B this is just a reverse of subset proper superset set a is a proper supper set of set B if set a is a superset of set B and set a is not equal to set B in symbol set a is a proper superset of set B given set a and set B well set B is a proper subset of set a 
,,set a is a proper superset of set B power set the set of all the subsets of a set what is the power set of set s EO Bess contains all the subsets of set s how many elements does the power set of set s have since the power set contains all the subsets of a given set it follows the formula two to the power of n where n is the number of elements so the number of elements of the OBS is two to the power of three which is equal to eight

Sets,sgtKab2ynrY,mathematics it isn't as scary or difficult as it sounds but for many it's the subject they absolutely i hate mathematics but i love counting my money okay but however the best thing about maths is that once you get the hang of it it can be your most scoring subject so in today's video i'm going to be sharing with you seven effective tips to tackle mathematics like an expert so let's begin tip number one make time to practice each day if you want to bring high marks in mathematics then hard 
,,work is the key every day make a habit to spend half an hour or one hour on this subject try not to study hours and hours straight this may create stress tip number 
,,two start by solving examples in every maths textbook you will get a lots of example or sample questions for a detailed explanation i have taken my brother's ncrt math textbook the most common mistake we often do is we just ignore the examples and directly start with the exercise questions so friends once you've understood a particular chapter's introduction try to solve each examples without seeing the solution if given and later compare the answers and check where you went wrong so friends through my personal experience 85 percent of question in your maths examination comes from this type of exercise or sample one tip number three clear all your doubts it's easy to get doubts in maths don't let your doubt store in your mind get them cleared as soon as you get one doubt so take help from your teacher your friends your parents your tuition teacher etc just clear your doubts tip number four note down all your formula memorize formula carefully if you can memorize it don't worry just write it on a plain sheet of paper then keep that sheet of paper in front of you whenever you are doing maths i prefer to stick this on my study table even on my wall in a short time a picture of this sheet will be created in your mind and you will be able to solve the problem with a better understanding tip number five review incorrect answers carefully you can learn a lot from your mistake in mathematics review your process where and how did you go wrong checking answers can help you better understanding as well as to increase your confidence level tip number six try to help someone else sometimes explaining a concept to another person can help you understand it more so try to help your friend who is struggling with maths problems which you know very well to solve tip number seven take math seriously and 
,,stay motivated another reason people struggle with maths is that they do not take it seriously they feel it's okay to be bad at maths or just laugh it off so embrace math instead of disregarding it mathematics is not about numbers equations computations or algorithms it is about understanding don't worry about your difficulties 
,,in mathematics always remember the expert in anything was once a beginner so do lots of practice work hard dream big and never give up so that's it all for today's video thank you so much for watching if you found this video helpful make sure to give it a big thumbs up and share it with your friends and for more awesome videos subscribe to my channel and press that bell icon for my latest updates see you in my next video bye

Sets,xZELQc11ACY,now let's say if we have set a which contain the elements two four five six and nine and we also have set B which contain the elements two three five six seven nine 
,,and ten so what is the intersection of set a and B how can we get the answer to find the intersection we need to find out which elements are common to both sets so both sets contain a two they contain a five a six and also a nine so therefore the intersection of sets a and B it's two three actually not three but two five six and nine and that's it so that's how you could find the intersection of two sets so now let's work on some more examples you can pause the video and try this one if you want to let me sum different letters so let's say this is set C and I contain the elements 3 4 6 7 and 10 and also set D which contain the elements 3 6 8 & 9 so feel free to pause the video and determine the intersection of sets C and D go ahead and try it so which elements are common to both sets so 3 is common to both sets 6 
,,and that's it so for this particular example it's only 3 & 6 so that's the intersection of the two sets so this is the answer let's try another example let's say set F contains the elements a B C D F G and J and set G contains the elements a C G H and K so what is the intersection between sets f and G so feel free to take a minute and try it so let's see which elements are shared between both sets so both sets contain element a element C G and that is it so the intersection of F and G is going to be a C and G so as you can see finding the intersection is pretty straightforward but now what about this particular example let's say set J contains the elements 5 7 10 and 11 and set K has the elements 2 4 8 and 13 what is the intersection of J and K now notice that there is no common element shared between the two sets the elements and J are completely different from the elements in K so in that case the intersection of J and K is going to be empty there's gonna be nothing inside 
,,so if there's nothing inside if you have an empty set you have a null set so this is the answer you have to use a Greek simple fine now let's say we have set R which contains the numbers 3 4 7 and 10 and set s which is basically an empty set what is the intersection of R and s the intersection of a set with numbers and an empty 
,,set there's going to be another empty set or a null set so that's it for this one now let's focus on a second type of problem that we need to talk about and that is 
,,to find a union of two sets so let's say that set a contains two elements 1 2 3 & 4 and set B contains the elements 3 4 5 & 6 so what is the union of these two sets 
,,I think of Union I think of combining these into a larger set now notice that we do have some common numbers 3 & 4 now the union will contain everything in both sets but 3 & 4 we're not going to write it twice only once so the union of set a and B is going to be 1 2 3 4 5 & 6 so we're gonna write everything in both sets but only write it once so let's try some other examples so let's say set C is 3 comma 5 comma 9 11 and 13 and set D is 2 3 6 8 and 12 go ahead and find a union between sets 
,,C and D go ahead and try that so all we got to do is just write all the numbers in C and E so let's put it in ascending order so we have a 2 of 3 there's a 5 a 6 there's no 7 so we have an 8 a 9 there's no 10 but we have an 11 12 and 13 and so that's it so that's the union of those two sets here's another example let's say that 
,,set J contains the letters a C D and E and that set K contains the letters a B f ing go ahead and determine the union between J and K so just like before all we need to do is write all the letters so we have an a a b c d e f and g and that's it for that question let's say that set x contains the numbers 2 5 8 12 and set Y let's 
,,say is an empty set what is the union of a set with numbers and an empty set well the empty set is not going to add anything it's like saying 15 plus 0 that's gonna 
,,be 15 so therefore the union of set X with an empty set Y is going to be the same as set X this to five eight and twelve it's not going to change but the intersection of a set with something and a set with nothing it's gonna be an empty set so just something to keep in mind now here's a question for you let's say if set a contains the numbers 3 4 5 and 7 and set B contains the numbers 2 4 5 & 8 how can you determine the intersection of a and B and a union of a and B and represent the results using a Venn diagram so circle a and circle B and it's separated form set a contains the numbers 3 4 5 and 7 B contains the numbers 2 4 5 and 8 now the intersection of these two I'm running out of space here is 4 & 5 4 & 5 are found in both but to represent that using Venn diagrams what we need to do is put the two circles together and draw it this way so this is set a and set B so in the middle is the intersection of a and B which contains these elements 4 & 5 now a also contains 3 & 7 & B also contains 2 & 8 but 4 & 5 is common to a and B so we put that in middle now the union of these two sets is basically everything it contains the numbers 2 3 4 
,,5 7 & 8 and I'm running out of space so this entire system with the two circles represents the union of a and B because it contains all the numbers 2 3 4 5 7 & 8 but the intersection is limited by this region here because it only contains the elements common to both sets so hopefully this helps you to see the relationship between intersection of sets and union of sets as a relates to Venn diagrams so that's it for this video thanks for watching and have a good day

Sets,MEYWV5gguAQ,hello children today i'm here to teach you chapter 2 in your textbook that's called sets so in this lesson we are trying to identify sets identify the elements of a 
,,set and we are talking about listing the elements that belong to the set and also about venn diagrams look at this one some of the items in a bag of necessities bought home in written the circle there are common features to this cluster of items what can you see beetroot go to color cabbage beans those are vegetables but when you look at these vegetables we can again divide these into three sections categories we can divide into yams green leaves and other categories we'll try to do that beetroot but it's a yeah so we can write beetroot inside this gaucho cola go to color it's a green leaves cabbage we can say other categories beans that's other categories carrot is it yeah kanku it's a greenlee also a greenlee potatoes yes eggplant we can say other categories and bitter gourd is also other categories so we got other categories so here these are groups we can identify so we'll look at another example there are several transport vessels within the circle ship bus aeroplane train boat took to so categorize them into three groups how can we categorize vehicles on land vehicles in the sky vehicles on water ship you can say vehicles on water 
,,bus vehicles online aeroplane vehicles in the sky train here and boat on water took took car bicycle and helicopter here and lorry also here so here vehicles also we can categorize into these three groups above vehicles are categorized according to the common features now we'll look at some more examples now look at this one appearing in the circle line integers now these are numbers categorize them as follows according to their common features by looking at the number odd numbers you know 
,,odd numbers are not divisible by 2 1 3 5 7 one three five seven nine even numbers what are even numbers they are two four six eight ten multiples of three what are multiples of three three times one three three times two is six three times three nine three times three nine and triangular numbers what are triangular numbers that 
,,you can make a triangle so one what's the next triangular number three then what's the next one one two three four five six six plus four again ten those are triangular numbers and multiples of five five times one five five times two ten so we can categorize these numbers 1 to 10 into these groups now when you're categorizing materials or various features what are the things we need to check sometimes color sometimes shape non-material solid liquid air or material or non-living things so by looking at any characteristic we can divide into several groups so that's what we are doing in this lesson grouping items or numbers into several categories write all the numbers odd numbers between 10 and 20 within the curly brackets so what are the odd numbers starting from 10 11 13 15 90. so those are the odd numbers in between 10 and 20. look at this example you have given 1 to 15. write down even numbers below 15 within the curly brackets what are your numbers 2 4 6 8 10 12 14. those 
,,are even numbers then write down multiples of 5 up to 15 up to 15 means you can take 15 as well but these are multiples of 5 yes 15 also considers 5 10 15. those are multiples of 5. write down the triangular numbers up to 15. so what are the triangular numbers now you know 1 1 plus 2 3 3 plus 3 6 6 plus 4 10 10 plus 5 50. you can write 15 as well write down prime numbers up to 15 within the curly brackets prime numbers what's the smallest prime number that's 2 2 3 5 7 then 11 13 so that's all so these are prime numbers so we can categorize these set of numbers into several groups can you write the name of children clever at mathematics in your class can you do that all are good in maths i can't divide children according to their ability like that some children do algebra very well some do geometry very well so all are clever so we can't identify the group so this is not i did can you write the names of children obtain more than 80 marks for the mathematics i can do that so i 
,,can look at your marks and those who are above 80 i can write their names yes can this is identifiable can you write what the melodies songs are we can't do that it's difficult not identity can you write what films are good can you do that you like films related to children we like different films so we don't know which films are good so not identifiable it will be obvious to you that there are both clusters that can be and cannot be precisely written separately what is considered as sets are the groups or clusters so what are sets sets are the groups or clusters those can be precisely separated so we'll see more examples in this lesson so what are the characteristics of a set a set is made of material or non non-material things objects of a set are called lv months so you are learning a new term elements of a set then elements of set are written within curly brackets and elements of a set should be written with a comma after each element and no element is written more than once so think about letters in maharagama if it's so you can't write m twice a here four times five times one two three four five but you are writing a only one so what are the letters if if we don't consider the capital n simple m is one letter m a h r g m you can't write again and a you can't write again so remember all these characteristics of a set the set of fingers of ana can we identify yes we can thumb index finger middle finger ring finger and small finger so appearing above is a set consisted of material elements you can touch it and you can identify that's called material the set of your most preferred subjects to study it can be maths science history english so those are called non-material elements so you can't touch it so you should be able to identify what are material elements and non-material elements elements in a set should be easily identified from each other the set of vowels of the english alphabet what are the vowels in the english alphabet e e i so you 
,,can identify those people with spiritual merit can we write down the set we cannot identify so it's not a set no elements cannot be written twice when writing sets letter sets of the maharagama so we discussed before if it's maharagama a and m only once so m a h a you can't write again r g m a you can't write again so m a h r g 
,,there are three ways to write down a set what are the three ways description as a description in words you are writing a is a set of odd numbers less than ten or letters of the word wander provinces of sri lanka so these are called sets with description now we'll see the next method listing method as a listing of elements method write the elements of this set given as a description colors of the rainbow can you remember the colors the poem related to colors one fairy came in violet one wore indigo in blue green orange yellow red they made a pretty bow one two three four five six seven seven colors are there letters of the word tenor what are the letters here all letters are different so you have to write all letters t e n o r so you have to separate them with a comma numbers of the figure two three seven five eight what are the numbers two three seven five eight so those are the sets as a listing of elements method now we'll look at the other method how we represent a set in 
,,a venn diagram so the mathematician john ben introduced the elements of sets can be written within closed figure so this is a closed figure so if we draw like this that's an open figure so in a closed figure you can put all the elements so in this set a a e i o u wobbles in a in the english alphabet so you can write all the elements inside the closed figure sometimes we use rectangles to represent the closed figure b 2 3 5 7 11 those are prime numbers so you can write inside a closed figure like this 2 3 5 7 11. that's the other way of representing sets numbers written for 2017 so this is in description method how we write that in listing element method what are the numbers written for 2017 0 1 2 7. that's the listing element method now how we represent that in a venn diagram so you can write 0 1 2 7 inside the closed figure next one multiples of 3 less than 20 so what are the multiples 3 6 9 12 1 2 3 4 5 15 and then 18 21 you can't write so these are the elements belongs to 
,,the set of multiples of 3 less than 2. so how can we represent that in a venn diagram we can write all the elements inside 3 6 9 12 15 18. letters of the word maha baduge what are the letters m a h a you can't write again b a again they are d u g and e those are the different elements so how can we represent this one in a venn diagram you can put all the letters m a h b d u g e letters of the word google what are the letters of the word google g or you can write only once g you can't write 
,,it again l e so that's the listing element method now write all the elements in a closed figure that's called venn diagram method g o l a so we discuss now three ways of representing a set descriptive method listing element method and finally venn diagram method sounds of music so we can say c d e f g a so those are the sounds of music so in english alphabet we use c d e f g a b so you can write those letter c d e f g a space flying elephants do you know i can't identify a set so that's we 
,,can't write the elements so what you call that null set of empty set no elements inside the set so we just draw a blank circle like this no elements inside odd numbers divided by 2 without a remainder do you know any odd number that divided by 2 without a remainder we can't write any elements so here this is also a this is also 
,,an empty set so no elements inside so remember this word empty set sometimes we call null set as well draw correct sign in the cage in front of those can be considered as sets months of a year yes we can identify january february like that provinces of sri lanka here's western southern northern province yes we can identify beautiful flowers we can't say this flower is beautiful or not we can't compare it's difficult to identify days of a week monday sunday tuesday wednesday yes we can identify odd numbers between 10 and 20 yes 11 13 15 like that those odd numbers beautiful girls can you say you're beautiful and you're not beautiful we can't compare so 
,,it's not a set tall man there's no limit to that so we can't identify who are taller people if we say men of people above six feet we consider as taller than you can identify men more than six feet tall yes we can identify that set so this is a set but this is not a students clever at mathematics all are clever so we can't identify the students clever at mathematics so it's difficult it's not a set good people can you identify it's difficult to identify so this is also not a set write the following sets written as descriptions with elements in sets days of school is held in the week what are the days monday tuesday stay thursday and friday numbers less than 20 counting numbers if you take 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 18 19. you can't write 20 because it's less than 20. so these are counting numbers letters of the word bamboo what are the letters b a m you can't write b again oh also you can't write twice rewrite the following sets as a description two four six eight what are those you can say even numbers less than 10 even numbers less than 10. because 10 is not there aeiyou what are those wobbles in the english alphabet vowels in the english alphabet cabbage beans beetroot carrot what are those we can say vegetables mango guava wood apple pineapple you can say fruits names of girls millimeter centimeter decimeter meter decal meter hectometer and kilometer what are those you need soft limp pigeon house sparrow crow honeysuckle mad we can identify as birds seconds minutes hours days weeks months years units of time so these are the elements and this is how we write as a description nymphaea lotus lotus lilies flowers in the water plus minus multiplication sign division operations basic operations in let's now we know how to write down any set as a description as a listing element and as a venn diagram look at this one right the following sets within venn diagram so listing method is given and you asked to put all the elements inside the 
,,closed figure so 0 2 4 6 8 sun moon stars so those are the elements sun stars abcde those are the elements so in the set c you can write inside a b c d d is c d e f 
,,g a b capital letter so this is d means d is a set these are the letters inside c d e f g a c digits in this number so this is descriptive way of writing set now how can we put these digits inside you can put 7 2 8 5 2 not again and 7 not again c a m p u s letters inside f so you can put c a m u s write the sets written in venn 
,,diagrams as a description what can you write for this one this is set p or set a i'll write this one as set a 1 three five seven nine odd numbers less than ten on numbers less than next one p q r is t we can just say letters in the alphabet letters in english alphabet this one 3 6 9 12 15 all are multiples of three multiples of 
,,3 up to 50 up to 15 you can write 15 as well if it's less than 15 you can't write write the following sets with elements countable numbers what are the countable numbers you can put one two three four five 6 7 can we write all it's difficult so what we do you can put three dots to show that it's continuing so write a couple of numbers and put only three dots instead of the rest of numbers letters in the alphabet a b c d and then you can put three dots to show that it's continuing odd numbers one three five seven nine then put three dots even numbers two four six eight three dots to show that it's continuing multiples of eight starting from 8 16 24 32 40 and then put three dots multiples of five 5 10 15 20 and then you can put three dots so write correct mark if it's correct and cross mark if it's incorrect someone is an element of the set of voice yes the name someone means a boy so set of bodies can identify that april is an element of the set of year yeah that's a month x is an element of the set of the single alphabet there's no letter in sinhala alphabet as x so that's wrong 12 is an element of the set of prime numbers is 12 a prime 
,,number no it's wrong red is an element of the set of colors in the rainbow yes that's a color list the elements of the following sets letters of the word carpenter so how can we write the letter c a r p e you can't write again and r you can't write a d so those are the elements of the word carpenter consonants of the english alphabet that means not vowels what are the consonants a b c d e you can't f g h like that so you get lot of letters so we can put three dots you can't write vowels a e i o u prime numbers below 10 what are the prime numbers below 10 2 is the lowest prime number 2 3 5 7 that's all you can't write 11 2 3 5 7. letters of the word potato what are the letters p o t a t you can't write o you can't try odd numbers between 10 and 20. so between means you can't include 10 and 20. so 11 13 15 17 90. those are the odd numbers multiples of 3 between 20 and 30 so 20 what's the multiple of 3 after 20 24 then that's 3 times 8 3 times 9 27 and 3 times 10 30. in between 
,,means you can't write 30 so just 24 and 27. now we'll look at exercise 2.1 place correct sign next to each of the expressions which clearly defined a set and cross sign which do not clearly define a set those who obtain more than 100 marks in the grade 5 scholarship examination held in 2013. so we know the names so specifically 
,,mentioned the year and the marks so we can identify students talented singers it's difficult to identify who are talented singers district of sri lanka we can colombo gold district colombo matra beautiful flowers we can't identify beautiful flowers so that's not a set numbers between 0 and 50 which are multiples of 6. so 6 12 18 we can identify people who are fortunate we can't identify those so that's not a set example number one write the set a is a prime numbers between 0 and 50 by writing all the elements that belongs to a within curly brackets a within curly brackets you write numbers between 0 and 15 all prime numbers 2 3 5 7 then 11 13. so those are the prime numbers then they ask are 1 and 17 elements of the set a when you take one it's not a prime number one is not a prime number so not an element not an 
,,element of x what about 17 17 is a prime number but it's not less than in between 0 and 50. you can write 17 is a prime number but more than 15 so that's also not an element so you can say not an element of a example number two the positive integers that are multiples of three write the elements of b within curly brackets so what you do you write down the set using capital letters and within curly brackets positive integers at multiples of 3 3 6 9 12 15 like that can you write all there's no end to so you can put three dots example number one a set p has been represented here by a venn diagram write down the set p by writing its elements within curly brackets you can write p within curly brackets 1 4 9 16 25 then write p in terms of a common property by which the elements of p can be clearly identified what are those 1 square 2 squared 4 3 squared 9 4 squared 16 square numbers so we can write p is a set we can write square numbers up to 25 because last number is 25 so up to 25 means 25 also included example 2 a is the set of positive whole numbers from 1 to 9. write down the set a in terms of a common property of its elements whole numbers from 1 to 9. so counting numbers 1 2 3 up to 9 we can say counting numbers less than counting numbers less than 10 then the second part write down the set a by listing its elements so what are the numbers one two three four five six seven eight nine represent the set a by a venn diagram so what you do you draw a closed figure like this and then label the set as a and write all the elements inside the closed figure 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 exercise 2.2 express each of the following sets by writing all the elements of each set within curly brackets how can we write days of the week sunday monday tuesday wednesday thursday and friday then how can we write prime numbers between zero and ten prime numbers between zero so two three five seven because you can't write 11 there third one c is the set multiples of 4 between 0 and 25 so you can write 4 four times two eight eight four times three twelve four times four sixty four times five twenty and twenty four so those are the elements in each set d is a set letters of the word diagram next one e districts of the western province what are the districts colombo gumpaha and kaluthara next one f digits 
,,of the numbers 21 412 what are the digits one there two four one two you can't write it again next one g is a set of multiples of 6 from 1 to 10. so 6 is the lowest 
,,one then 12 you can't write so only 6. for the sets defined above state whether the following statements are true or false saturday is an element of a saturday is an element of a yes that's true because the days of the week it's true p is an element of d p is not there so you can't write p so that's false all the elements of c are even numbers so we have to check see all the numbers in c are even numbers yes they are even numbers so that's true fourth one any multiple of 3 from 1 to 10 is an element of g so multiple of 3 from 1 to 10 means 3 6 9. we'll check g 3 6 9 so l 6 is there so you can say any multiple of 3 from 1 to 10 is an element of g it's true question number two express each of the following sets in different form by writing all the elements of each set within curly brackets represent each of these sets by a venn diagram 2. so we'll take p prime numbers less than 10. so you can write 2 3 5 7 how can we represent in a venn diagram you can draw a circle or any closed figure like this and put all the elements inside two three five seven that's p and the second one q colors of a rainbow so what are the colors violet indigo blue 
,,green orange yellow red one two three four five six seven so how can we represent that in a venn diagram you can write all the colors there violet blue green orange 
,,yellow red r will take the third one are letters of the word number letters what are the letters you can write n u m b e r all letters are different so you have to write all so how can we represent this one in a venn diagram we can draw a venn diagram r n u m b e r fourth one whole numbers between 0 and 7 between 0 and 7 means you can't include 0 and 7. so s you can write all whole numbers one two three four five six you can't write seven so when you draw the venn diagram s you can write 1 
,,2 3 4 5 6. then last one t districts of the southern province so t you can write what are the districts and matara those are the districts in southern province so how can you draw a venn diagram for that t is and martha so that's the pen diagram question number three 4 8 12 16 20 represent the set k by a venn diagram so you can 
,,draw a closed figure and label this as k and put inside all the elements 4 8 12 16 20. write down the set k in terms of a common property of its elements by which the elements can be clearly identified what are those 4 8 12 multiples of 4 up to 20 up to 20 means 20 also included multiples of 4 up to 20. question number four the 
,,set x has been represented by a venn diagram here express the set x in a different form by writing the elements of x within curly bracket so listing element method a e i o u and the second part write down the set x in terms of a common property of its elements by which the elements can be clearly identified descriptive way how can you write these are vowels in the english of vowels in the english alphabet question number five represent the set of multiples of 5 between 6 and 25 by writing down a common property by which the elements of the set can be clearly identified that means as a description so we can use any letter set a is multiples of 5 between 6 and 25 and how can you write all the elements of the set within curly brackets five you can't write five because in between 6 and 25 so 10 15 20 25 also you can't write in between means you can't write the first and the last numbers then third one by a venn diagram so you draw a closed figure and label this as a and write down all the elements inside 10 15 and 20. so we covered all theory related to sets so what are the three ways we can represent a set we can represent as a descriptive 
,,way listing element method and venn diagram method so remember when you are writing a set you have to put the elements in curly brackets and you have to put commas in between and also if there are no elements in a set we call those are empty set so practice all exercises in this exercise because you need this section in grade 10 and 11.

Sets,fjameOg-bcg,introduction free--ah can you tell which of these things belong to Whitsett yes it is so simple stamp will go in the set of stamps pencil belongs to the set of pencils and this coin belongs to the set of coins D what is a set Sonali can you see these three collections these are the sets but how do you say that these are sets a set is a collection of things which has something in common come I will explain you more about sets objectives at the end of this lesson you will be able to learn sets and their representations explained roster and set builder form of sets explain empty set learn finite and infinite sets define equal set sets and their representations a set is a collection of objects that have something in common or follow a rule for example set of coins set of girls between the age group thirteen to fifteen years the objects in a set are called its elements set notation uses curly braces with elements separated by commas so the set of out where or kesha would be a is equal to code comma at comma scarf comma gloves comma boots we're a is the name of the set and the braces indicate that the objects written between them belonged to the set thus a set is defined as a collection of distinct object representation of sets sets are usually designated with capital letters elements of a set are usually designated with lowercase letters objects elements and members of a set are synonymous terms for example capital a is a set and a is an element in capital a also when we say an element a is in a set a we use the Greek symbol epsilon to show it epsilon denotes the phrase belongs to and if something is not in a set use this symbol this means does not belong to example set a is 1 2 3 you can see that one belongs to a but 5 does not belong to a some common sets in mathematics methods of representation of sets there are two methods of representing a set roster or tabular form and set builder form roster form roster notation is a list of elements separated 
,,by commas enclosed in curly braces the curly braces are used to indicate that the elements written between them belong to that set let's look at some examples of sets listed with roster notation R is equal to a comma E comma I comma o comma U G is equal to 0 comma 1 comma 2 comma 3 comma 4 comma 5 comma 6 comma 7 comma 8 comma 9 T is equal to Monday comma Tuesday comma Wednesday comma Thursday comma Friday set builder set builder notation has the general form given below : in set builder notation is always read as such that set builder notation is frequently used when the roster method is either inappropriate or inadequate for example X such that X less than 6 and X is a counting number is the set of all counting numbers less than 6 note this is the same set as 1 2 3 4 5 examples of roster form of sets a variation of the simple roster method uses the ellipsis when the pattern is obvious and the set is large the set of odd counting numbers less than or equal to nine thousand seven is one three five seven up to nine thousand seven set of all counting numbers is represented by one two three and so on the set of all even positive integers less than 7 is described in the roster form as 2 4 6 the set of odd natural numbers is represented by 1 3 5 and so on the set of letters forming the word school is s c h o l or h o l c s here the order of listing elements has no relevance examples of set-builder form of sets the set of all X such that X is greater than 0 the set of all X such that X is any number except 11 set of all X such that X is any number less than 5 the empty set empty or null set is a set that contains no elements it 
,,is also known as a null set or a void set empty set is denoted by these symbols examples a is equal to 2 6 8 and B is equal to 3 5 7 let's see represent the intersection of the sets a and B C is equal to a null set because there is no element common between the two sets let's now solve an example solve modulus of 6 X minus 7 plus 10 is equal to 0 solution step 1 modulus of 6x minus 7 plus 10 is equal to 0 step 2 modulus of 6x minus 7 is equal to minus 10 which is never true subtract 10 from each side step 3 so the solution set is empty set or a null set finite and infinite sets finite set a set which is empty or consists of a definite number of elements is called finite set for example a is equal to whole numbers between 0 and hundred B is equal to primary colors C is equal to prime numbers less than 12 are the finite sets in finite set an infinite set is a set with an infinite number of elements it is not possible to explicitly list out all the elements of an infinite set for example X is a set of atoms in the universe Y is the set of prime numbers W is a set of even whole numbers are in finite sets equal and unequal sets two sets P and Q are said to be equal if they have exactly the same elements and we write P is equal to Q otherwise the sets are said to be unequal and we write P is not equal to 
,,Q examples of equal set the set a is equal to three four six and B is equal to 6 3 4 are equal because they have same elements a set does not change if one or more elements of the set are repeated for example the sets a is equal to 5 6 7 and B is equal to 6 6 5 7 7 are equal since each element of a is in B and vice versa that is why we generally do not repeat any element in describing a set did you know nearly all mathematical concepts are now defined formally in terms of set and set theoretic concepts for example mathematical structures as diverse as graphs manifolds rings and vector spaces are all defined as sets having various XZ Ematic properties equivalence and order relations are ubiquitous in mathematics and the theory of relations is entirely grounded in set theory summary let us summarize what we have learned a set is a well-defined collection of objects a set which does not contain any element is called empty set a set which consists of a definite number of elements is called finite set otherwise the set is called infinite two sets a and B are said to be equal if they have exactly the same elements

Sets,EwY6p-r_hyU,"What goes up must come down. A ball you throw in the air. An apple that drops from a tree. Even you, when you're on a trampoline at someone's awesome birthday party.  But why? My friends let me introduce you to one of the most wonderful forces in the universe. It's one we are all experiencing right now without even trying. Fasten your seat belt because we are going to explore the power of gravity. If I told you that you just won the lottery what would you do? If you are like me, you jump up and down and scream. And after you're done freaking out and jumping in the air you'd (jump) land on your feet, right? But why would you land back on the ground instead of just floating off into space? It's because of a little something we called gravity. Gravity is what pulls everything toward the ground, including you. Without the force of gravity, there would be no life on Earth. Air, water, animals, everything would fly off into space. There'd be no you, no me, no french fries, nada. Think of gravity like the invisible super glue that holds our massive world together. You can't see it but it's always there. An English Scientists named Isaac Newton "
,,"was the first person to seriously study gravity over 300 years ago. There's a famous story about him that you might have heard. Supposedly, Sir Isaac was hanging out underneath an apple tree thinking.. Probably, partly napping when an apple fell from the tree and conked him on the head. That's when Sir Isaac had an ""Aha!"" moment. Why did the apple fall down to the ground, and not up, or sideways? He realized that a special kind of force which we now know as gravity was acting on all of the "
,,"objects on Earth. Pulling them toward it. Once the apple became too heavy for its stem to hold it anymore, the gravitational pull of earth brought the apple down into Newton's noggin Newton also realized it doesn't matter how  heavy an object is either. Whether you're holding an apple or a bowling ball or a feather. If you let go of it, that suck is going down. We're gonna make a whole video about this later. Basically, he determined that what goes up must come down Sir Isaac was a pretty smart too. Okay, so you know that if you jump up you'll eventually land back on the ground. And you know that an apple drop down will land on the ground too. But what if you throw something in front of you? or the left? or to the right? To see how gravity will act, pick up the tennis ball or any small round object and hold it in "
,,"your hand. Let's toss it on the air and watch it fall to the ground. No surprise here. Okay. Now pick it up and hold it over your head. Let go and watch it fall once more. Again, not a shocker. Now, throw it to your left. All down. Pitch it to the right. And watch it go down again. No matter where you throw the ball, it's going "
,,down. So we've determined that near the surface of the earth where we all are gravity is the cause that produces the effect of all unsupported objects falling down. 
,,"The ball will go up or to the left or to the right for a little bit. But eventually, its going to be pulled back down to the ground no matter what. Gravity is gotta "
,,"hold on, well, everything. So, eventually everything that you can think of can be thrown up in the air and will come back down even if you throw it to the left or right or any other direction. That's gravity doing its thing. But when you really think about it, which way is down exactly? I mean, the earth is round and there are all kinds of things on what we think of as the bottom of the Earth. So, how does gravity keep them from falling of? I know a penguin  who can answer that question. So, you know that the earth is round and you know that gravity is the force that pulls objects down. But if the Earth is round and there's stuff at the bottom of the Earth, say a penguin in Antartica. Why doesn't gravity pull the penguin down off of the Earth? I mean does gravity really pull down? When we talk about gravity and we say things like up or down. We don't mean those things in the sense that you're used to. In this case, up just means away from the earth and down means toward it. So when you hear people say gravity pulls things down to Earth. They really mean that gravity pulls things toward the Earth. Now, think of it this way. Gravity is the force of attraction between any two objects made of matter, right? Well, I have a news for you You're made of matter and so as the Earth. That means you and the earth have an attraction to each other. Ahhh, you guys. Anyway, the scientific argument for gravity is that any object that's on or close to Earth's surface and is made up of less matter than Earth will be pulled in by our planet's stronger gravitational pull. Wanna do a little demonstration? To show how Earth's gravity can pull an object like the penguin we mention before toward it. No matter where on Earth that penguin is All you need is a tennis ball and a rubber band. Oh! And your index finger. Now let's pretend the tennis ball is Earth and the rubber represents the force of gravity. That makes your finger are adorable little penguins Just chilling in on the surface of the Earth. Now, stretch the rubber band around your tennis ball Earth and stick your finger under the rubber band. Now, try to lightly pull your finger away from the ball. The penguin is trying to jump off the Earth. Eventhough penguins can't fly. What are you doing penguin? But, what happens? Not much. Your finger doesn't get far before the rubber band pulls it back toward the ball right? And the effect is the same no matter where your finger penguin is on your earth ball. Whether  it's at the top or the side on the very bottom the same thing happens. The penguin is forced back to earth no matter how hard it tries to jump off . So, "
,," what does this mean? It means that no matter where on earth an object is, the planet's gravitational pull will draw the object toward it. And  that's how you should think about gravity. It's the force that pulls things toward earth. So, basically we have gravity to think for the fact that penguins stick to the bottom of the  earth and I for one am grateful. I like  penguins, interesting huh? When we say  that gravity pulls down, what we really mean is that it pulls everything towards the center of the earth. But what if I want to take a break from the earth? What if I'm an astronaut and I want to take a vacation on the moon. How can I possibly escape "
,,"the gravity of the earth? And if I can what will happen as I get closer to the moon? I guess there's only one way to  find out. You know how many people have actually been on the moon? 12 that's all. But one  day, we may go back there. We have a lot more to learn about the moon and space in general. So someday maybe in your   lifetime we'll send astronauts out there to study and explore Do you want to be one of them? If you do let me give you some  helpful tips about a little thing called gravity. because you're gonna need to know all about what gravity is and how  it works if you're going to escape the pull of earth and fly to the moon. Now you already know that astronauts can leave the earth, but it takes a lot of effort to boldly go where few have gone  before But once astronauts reach the speed called escape velocity They're able to overcome the force of Earth's gravity and get into orbit around our planet or head on over to the moon. So this brings up an interesting question. What happens when an object gets away from Earth's gravity but close to the moon's gravity? You already know that gravity is the  force that keeps us from flying off the  surface of the earth. And you know that gravity pulls things not down but towards the Earth's center. You also know that gravity exists between any objects that have mass and the greater an object's masses the greater the effect of its gravity or pull on other objects  is. But there's something more, remember Isaac Newton the apple tree guy he  determined that the amount of gravitational force or pull between two objects also depends on how far apart  they are so the farther away something is from the earth the lesser will feel  the pull of Earth's gravity and the closer it gets to the moon. the more it will feel the moon's gravity pulling "
,,"on it. let's do a little pretending to see what happens to something when it moves closer to an object that has really large mass. and therefore, a really strong pull of gravity. If you've ever made a wish on a shooting star, you've seen the effect of Earth's gravity pulling on an object Shooting stars which are actually meteors; occur when pieces of rock break off from a passing comet or asteroid and get too close to the Earth. For example, say this globe represents the earth and the marble represents a piece of space rock that's flying by. You can see that there's a big huge difference in size between the two objects. And if we were to put them on a "
,,"scale, We'd see that there's a big difference in their mass too. Our model Earth has larger mass if the space rock is far away from the Earth then it can  go on its "
,,"merry way since it won't be affected by the Earth's gravity. But if it gets too close, then it and the Earth engage in a bit of tug-of -war since both have gravity they  pull on one another. It's not much of a fight though. The more massive heart has a much larger gravitational pull. So the rock gets caught in Earth's gravity and most of the time it gives us a brilliant streak of light, we call a meteor. But what does this mean for our space travelers? Well, when an astronaut ship takes off for the moon and moves away from the Earth. The farther from Earth it goes the less it feels the pull of Earth's gravity and as it gets closer to the moon, the spaceship begins to feel the tug of the moon's gravity more. So even though the moon has a smaller mass than the Earth and has less of a pull on the ship than Earth does. Once the ship gets closer to the moon than the Earth, the moon's gravity pulls the ship toward it and then the astronauts can make a safe landing. So we can make the argument that two things affect the pull of gravity. First the size of the object, objects with a bigger mass have a stronger pull of gravity. And second the distance between objects, the farther apart objects are the weaker the the pull of gravity between them. And the closer together they are the stronger the pull of gravity. All of this means that when the day comes that you're flying a spaceship to the moon you just have to escape from Earth's gravity and then get close enough to the moon to enter its gravity. Remember  that when you're grown  up and you're welcome. If you want to thank me you can just name a crater or something after me when you get there. So here's what we know so far, whether on Earth or in space anything that has mass will exert the force of gravity. And on Earth everything falls towards the middle of the Earth at the same rate. But hold up a sec, you've probably noticed that if you drop a piece of paper or a feather. It takes longer to reach the ground than something like a rock or a ball. So, what's up with that? It's time to investigate. I don't care who you are, if you live anywhere near this planet then your no stranger to gravity. The force that affects every object on Earth and beyond, because of gravity whether you're an astronaut on the International Space Station or ordinary clumsy earthbound human who happens to drop her books a lot. All things caught in our planet's gravity will, in some way, have the  potential to fall to Earth. But objects fall differently, right? Like when I knock a piece of paper off my desk It takes a lot longer to fall to the ground than if I knock a book off  "
,,"my desk. So what's up with that? Why do things seem to fall at different speeds on Earth? Well, we already know that all objects have mass. We have a certain amount "
,,"of matter in them and when gravity pulls on an object it gives the object weight. Now a long time ago, people used to  think that heavier things fell faster than lighter things because that's what our senses told us I mean it certainly looks like the book falls faster than the piece of paper And why would we expect anything else that would be like dropping a hammer and a feather and expecting them to hit the ground at the same time. Except the thing I just said about the hammer and the feather. Someone did actually try that and they did both hit the ground at the same time. It just didn't happen on Earth, true story. When astronaut Dave Scott was on the moon in 1971, he did an experiment. Where he dropped a falcon feather and a hammer from the same height and they hit the ground at the same time. Now, how can that be? If you drop a hammer and a feather on Earth, the feather would take a lot longer to reach the ground. So, what does the Earth have that the moon doesn't? For one thing, an atmosphere. The gases that make up the Earth's atmosphere push against objects as they fall. And the push of the air against the falling object causes friction, we call that friction air resistance. So, on Earth the features flat fluffy shape makes it run into more air resistance than the hammer does. This makes it fall more slowly than the hammer but since the moon has almost no atmosphere there's almost no air resistance. So, the two objects fell at the same rate. So, it seems to me that it's the resistance of air pushing against objects that really affects how fast objects fall and that means that experiment time. But you don't have to go to the moon to do this, so don't pack your bags or anything. All you need are two pieces of paper that are the same size. Crumple one of the pieces into a tight ball and leave the other  ones smooth and flat. Now drop each piece of paper from the same height, let's say a meter and then write down in a table how long it takes each each piece to reach the ground. You'll see it takes a flat of paper longer than the crumpled paper to hit the floor this is evidence that an object's shape affects how fast it seems to fall to Earth because the two pieces of paper are exactly the same. They have the mass. But air resistance makes the flat paper seem to fall "
,,"more slowly than the crumpled paper. So based on the results of our experiment we can say at least here on  Earth objects appear to fall at different rates, not because they have different masses or weights but because of air resistance. The force that the Earth's atmosphere has  on objects as they fall. So there you have it! Gravity is the force that exert it by everything that has mass. And its felt by everything equally. Even though falling objects on Earth might not always look like that's the case. I mean if you don't believe me you can go to the moon and do the old hammer and feather experiment for yourself or you can just trust me.

Sets,lv6dC0coQeI,rock and learn Patera hiya Michael what's up my friend Kevin needs a little help studying for his earth science test do you think you could pencil us in for a session well I do know a thing or two about earth science and I hear that you're a real wizard reviewing for science tests thanks Tara kevin is already waiting for us at my super science station before we go Marco Terra boy am I happy to see you I need to get ready for my earth science test glad to help kid earth science is kind of my specialty when you study earth science you'll learn about astronomy geology meteorology and more let's start by talking about our solar system tell me what you know well the Sun is in the middle of the solar system and it provides us with light and heat good good you know anything else there are eight planets that orbit the Sun but I always have trouble remembering their order I know a fantastic way to remember the order of the planets hello who's calling professor who oh you're Kevin's mom he's snack is ready okeydoke here we'll be right there great news Kevin's mom would like to serve us a little snack sounds good to me so Kevin I didn't know that your mother was a professor oh yes she's very educated here you go enjoy oh my what just happened my very educated mother just served us nachos that's it that's the order of the planets huh I see what he's getting at take the first letter of each word in the sentence my very educated mother just served us nachos and now we'll give you the first letter of the name of each planet my mercury Dairy Venus educated mother just served Saturn Uranus Neptune my very educated mother just served us nachos Mercury Venus Earth Mars Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune my very educated mother Venus Uranus Neptune hey that's pretty cool that makes it easy to remember the planets great now back to the solar system Learning Center at my super science station but what about the ah the nachos tough going kid but nachos aren't the only things in life and the planets aren't the only things that orbit the Sun take a look at this wow that's pretty cool Terra what are all these chunks of rock between Mars and Jupiter that is known as the asteroid belt the objects in this area range in size from dust particles all the way up to Ceres which is 900 kilometers in diameter 
,,Ceres is actually considered a dwarf planet because it has a large enough mass to have a rounded shape but as you can see it's not large enough to have cleared its orbit around the Sun by that I mean there are other objects in the same orbit with Ceres all of those other chunks of rock and metal are known as asteroids is Ceres the only dwarf planet now we've got more every so often a group of professional astronomers from around the world meet to assign names to objects in space three dwarf planets they've names are theories Pluto and Eris looks like there's another asteroid belt further out that's called the Kuiper belt whoa what's that that's a common comments a collections of ice dust and small particles of rock most have long oval orbits when they pass near the Sun their ice melts and evaporates people on earth see comets as huge glowing balls with tails made of gas or dust trailing millions of miles behind them all of this is pretty cool but how does it fit into earth science learning about the solar system is important for earth science because what happens in space affects things on Earth for example let's take a closer look at how the Earth and Sun interacted see how the earth goes around or orbits the Sun yeah Marco I remember that from science class it takes a full year for one revolution 
,,around the Sun and that's what causes our seasons explain to me how the Earth's orbit causes the seasons well I know it has something to do with the tilt of the earth but I never really understood that part hmm let me see if I can help when does the Sun feel warmest early in the morning or around noon its warmest around noon correct that's because the sun's rays are more direct around noon in the morning when it's cooler the sun's rays are more indirect so the earth flips back and forth oh 
,,no no no no no no the earth keeps pretty much the same tilt but watch as she moves around the Sun see here the northern hemisphere gets more direct Sun so it is summer there and since the southern hemisphere gets the indirect light it's winter now you've got the idea if we keep moving around until we get over here then it's summer in the southern hemisphere and winter in the northern hemisphere Wow actually seeing it in action makes it easier to understand even take a look at this see how the Earth rotates on its axis it goes around once every 24 hours and that's what causes day and night the parts of Earth facing the Sun or in daylight as the Earth rotates the Sun seems to set in the West Supah I think you've really got a good idea about how things work in our solar system yes take one of these kiddo Tara I don't think it's going to be raining anytime soon inside the science station I wouldn't be so sure he looks like a flash flood we got here whether or not you wanted to brother here at the water cycle and whether learning center will learn how the water cycle affects whether on earth the Sun provides the energy that drives the whole water cycle as the Sun heats water on earth water evaporates into the air as the water vapor cools in the atmosphere it condenses into small water droplets that form 
,,clouds when the water droplets get too heavy they precipitate back to the ground then the water accumulates in aquifers rivers lakes and the oceans and the whole thing can start all over again water turns to vapor by evaporation clouds slowly okay I think I understand how the water cycle works but why does it rain and snow places other than over the water good question we get rain and snow and other precipitation in all kinds of places because the Sun heats the earth unevenly land heats and cools faster than water and we know that it's warmer near the equator than the poles all of this uneven heating keeps it cold and warm air moving and the mix changes in air pressure here's how those air pressure changes cause wind cold air weighs more than warm air so the pressure of cold air is greater when the Sun warms the air the air expands it's lighter cooler heavier air moves to where the warmer and lighter air was in other words will usually blows from areas of a high air pressure 
,,to areas of low air pressure now warm air can hold more water vapor than cold air so as the air gets colder you get condensation and then precipitation there you go 
,,but it is the temperature of the air that determines the kind of precipitation rain happens when drops of liquid water fall on the surface of the earth snow forms when the air is so cold that water vapor turns directly into ice without ever passing through a liquid state if the air is cold enough the snow will fall all the way to the ground otherwise it might melt into rain on its way down sleet refers to water droplets that freeze on their way down through really cold air unlike snow sleet goes through a liquid state before freezing the result is that sley does not light and fluffy Hale is like it mega sweet when it hails large balls of ice fall from 
,,the sky hail forms in a more complex way than sleep as ice crystals start to full wind carries them back up high into the cloud this happens over and over and the crystals grow each time eventually they get too heavy and full hard that's wild Tara I never knew weather could be so complex and that's just the surface kid but it's 
,,enough to get you started those nachos aren't settin so good are you okay she'll be fine but I'm a little worried about us if there isn't I feel much better now uh that's nice but where are we just when we should be in the geology Learning Center this is where we can learn about different kinds of rocks and how they are made take a look at all these layers of rocks little bits of Earth were washed downstream they settle to the bottom of a river lake or ocean layer after layout was deposited on top so they will press down more and more over time the layers turned into a type of rock called sedimentary rock that's right sedimentary rocks make up about three-quarters of the rocks at the Earth's surface sometimes they can give us clues about what the environment was like when those rocks were formed how can they do that well sometimes dead plants or animals get buried in the sediment they get covered up by new layers of sediments and sometimes become fossils some fossils are actually parts of an animal like its teeth or bones that have turned into stone or fossilized others are trace fossils like dinosaur footprints or tunnels made by worms 
,,but most fossils are castes the dead plants and animals decay after the sediment has turned into rock leaving behind a hollow mold salts or other minerals can fill the cast and hold its shape fossils found in the same layer of sedimentary rock are from things that lived around the same time as no layers form on top the fossils get buried deeper and deeper I think I understand so the deeper the fossils are found the older they are you've got it and times large amounts of plants are deposited in sedimentary rocks if they are compressed under a lot of pressure for a long period of time they turn into carbon this gives us coal oil natural gas and petroleum I guess that's why they're called fossil fuels you bet it is and let me tell you fossil fuels are really a gas okay sedimentary rocks make up about three-quarters of the rocks at Earth's surface you got it what about the rest of the rocks what are they glad you asked there are two other kinds of rocks igneous and metamorphic igneous rocks formed when molten rock cools and becomes solid molten rock is called magma when it is below the earth's surface but sometimes magma pushes up through cracks to the surface of the earth then it is called lava we lava cools it becomes a kind of igneous rock called volcanic rocks basalt is the most common type of volcanic rock most of the rocks on the ocean floor are basalt igneous rock can also form when magma cools slowly and becomes hard while it's deep underground rocks that form this way like granite usually have large crystals fossils are not usually found in igneous rocks the heat of a volcanic eruption tends to destroy living things and only rarely preserves any evidence of them however fossils may be found in volcanic ash deposits which are actually a kind of sedimentary rock that makes sense sedimentary rocks are made from sediment and igneous rocks are made when molten rock is cooled but what about metamorphic rocks how do they form good question kiddo metamorphic rocks are rocks that have moved or changed from one kind of rock into another metamorphic rocks were once igneous or sedimentary rocks but movement of the 
,,Earth's crust caused them to change just moving the rocks changes them no try pushing your hands together very hard do you feel heat and pressure yeah when the Earth's crust moves igneous or sedimentary rocks get squeezed by tremendous pressure which heats the rock and pulls them like taffy the original rock is changed by this heating and pulling and it becomes a metamorphic rock as you might guess any fossils that we're in this sedimentary rock will now be in the metamorphic rock but those fossils may be stretched and deformed because of the heating and pooling Baumer metamorphic rocks are the least common of the three kinds of rocks slate and marble 
,,are two examples that really whoa what's this a rock concert as a matter of fact it is ladies and gentlemen please welcome all the way from Little Rock Arkansas Petros I'm sorry males because of rocks man sorry three rounds surprise even though two rocks may be form the same way they can be made up of different kinds of minerals that's right to identify the minerals in rocks scientists use properties like color luster podna s-- and streak look at these I wonder what minerals they are hey if I describe their properties that might help me to identify them Bravo know the color of a mineral is the first thing people tend to notice but be careful most minerals can occur in more than one color luster describes how light is reflected from the surface of a mineral the two main types of luster are metallic and nonmetallic 
,,the hardness of a mineral is its ability to resist scratching the most hardest scale uses ten minerals to rank hardness take a look here a diamond is the hardest naturally occurring substance with a hardness of ten and talc is very soft so it only has a hardness of one that's all good and fine but how can I find out the hardness of the minerals in this box with a little scratching not that kind of scratching we'll use minerals and objects from the Mohs scale if your mineral sample can scratch an object save this penny but it has a higher hardness let's try this one mm-hmm good choice I like the nice metallic luster can it scratch up any looks like it does Marco that means this mineral has a hardness higher than three that's the way to do it now try scratching this quartz nope and look the quartz will scratch my mineral sample so it has a hardness between three and seven we could keep on scratching away with different materials from the Mohs scale to narrow it down even more but I think you get the idea I sure do thanks Terra another way to categorize minerals with a hardness lower than seven is to determine their streak streak does that 
,,mean some of them have racing stripes nah the streak of a mineral is the color of the powder it leaves when you scrape it across a streak plate we know your mineral 
,,has a hardness lower than seven so red that's not what I would have guessed at all don't feel too bad kid science is full of surprises have a look at this table here do any of those descriptions match your mineral let me see steel gray hardness 5.5 to 6.5 rust red streak metallic luster I'll bet this is hematite that's the way to do it great job well kid your earth science knowledge is really building up it looks like something else is building up under my chair that sort of looks like a volcano I guess it was a volcano and just look where it brought us ah the topographic Learning Center this is the perfect place to learn about how the surface of the earth changes seems like a volcano would be pretty good at changing the surface tell me about it kid he's not pimples you know I had a friend do a science fair project on volcanoes she told me there are several types she told you right there are shield volcanoes cinder cones stratovolcanoes and more that's a lot of volcanoes so what's the difference between the types shield volcanoes are built by layer upon layer of lava their eruptions travel great distances from a central event or group events so they have brought the flat rounded shape they kind of look like a shield lying on the ground that's a great way to remember the name but while they may look 
,,"flat from above they can still get pretty tall mano Lowa is the largest shield volcano Mauna LOA's means long mountain but it stands over 13,000 feet above sea level and it rises over 28,000 feet from the ocean floor it would be the world's tallest mountain if it weren't mostly underwater Maui Wowi actually it's on the Big Island of Hawaii the eruptions of shield volcanoes usually don't have much ash and they are fairly safe for scientists to monitor but some other kinds of volcanoes can throw hot ash and cinders into the air these can form a pyroclastic flow which travels very fast and burns almost everything in its path that's the truth the temperature of a pyroclastic flow can reach over 500 degrees Celsius whoa what kind of volcano can do that stratovolcanoes can they are quite beautiful like yours truly but they tend to be tall and symmetric with steep sides a few stratovolcanoes that you might have heard of our Mount Fuji in Japan and in the USA you'll find Mount st. Helens and Mount Rainier in Washington State and Mount Hood in Oregon not organ or red gun those stratovolcanoes really are beautiful what about cinder cones are the little guys you can often find cinder cones on the flanks of shield volcanoes and stratovolcanoes when a cinder cone volcano erupts cinders of lava are blown into the air and fall around the opening of the volcano the pile of cinders forms a small oval-shaped volcano that can grow to about 1,000 feet but some are much smaller many cinder cone volcanoes have a bowl-shaped crater at the opening hey Marco what causes volcanoes in the first place to explain that let's dig a little deeper deeper "
,,into the earth thirties earth is divided into four layers the solid inner core the liquid outer core and the mantle that's the thickest layer and last and least is the crust because it's the thinnest layer the rocky outer crust is made of plates that fit together sort of like on puzzle pieces these plates move a little bit each 
,,year as they slide on top of a weak layer of the mantle this hotter deeper layer of the mantle can be pushed and pulled like putty the whole process is called plate 
,,tectonics the edges of the Earth's plates touch each other as they move the plates may just slide past each other but the plates can also spread apart or even crash 
,,together sometimes when two plates collide large mountain ranges such as the Himalayas are for that happens if the two plates have the same density so they fold as they move together much like two kitchen rugs push together that explains mountains but I wanted to know how volcanoes are formed hold your horses kid if colliding plates have different densities one plate can be forced back down into the deeper regions of the earth that plate can begin to melt when it reaches a depth which is hot enough the molten crust arises back towards the surface where it helps make volcanoes and islands whoo that's a long process is that how all volcanoes are formed well no here's another way as the plates move hot spots under the crust may find weak places in the plates or between two plates that are moving apart this will allow magma to come to the surface from deep within the earth and the result is a volcanic eruption which can add new landmass to existing land or even form new islands okay let me get this straight volcanoes can form where the plates are pushing together where they're pulling apart or anywhere the Earth's crust is weak that's the way the cookie crumbles and the Earth's crust now that you have an idea of how Earth's surface can be built up let's talk about how it can be worn down weathering is the process that causes rocks to crack and fragment since rocks form in different ways and are made up of different minerals they react differently when exposed to temperature changes moisture particles in the air or pressure changes I suppose that means there are different kinds of weathering that's right Kevin one thing that causes weathering is frost when water freezes it has an unusual property unlike most materials that contract when they are cooled water expands when it solidifies into ice this can put incredible pressure on rocks water gets into the pores or cracks of the rocks and then free this so when the water freezes it expands and causes pieces of the rock to break off alright another kind of weathering is abrasion that can happen when rocks rub against each other like when Oh Rock rolls downhill or when it tumbles in rivers winds can cause abrasion to wind sometimes carries dirt or sand that can wear down rocks as it blows against them plants like moss and lichen can wedge their way into pores crevices and cracks in rocks seeds from other plants can get into crevices too as they grow they cause the rocks to crack apart I heard that wetting and drying of rocks can make them break up oh yes the combination of wetting and drying is very effective at breaking up clay but that's because clay swears when it gets wet and then shrinks and crumbles as it does oh I get it the process of wetting and drying only weathers some kinds of rocks sometimes rocks break down because the minerals they are made of react with chemicals in water or air for example carbonic acid is created when carbon dioxide dissolves in water and this acid can dissolve limestone and eventually cause the formation of caves and caverns ooh look at the stalactites and stalagmites you're a regular little spelunker 
,,huh stalactites hold tight to the ceiling of the cave and stalagmites might reach the ceiling someday what a smarty now erosion is simply the moving of sediments or 
,,rock particles moving water is the most powerful force of erosion on earth the world's rivers deliver about 20 billion tons of sediment to the oceans each year that's a lot of erosion and that's why you can see fan-shaped Delta's at the mouths of some rivers such as the Nile v-shaped valleys canyons and gorges are also carved by streams and rivers flowing through the mountains moving air or wind is another important mover of sediment especially in dry regions when tiny sand grains are lifted and carried by the wind they can sculpt rocks into a variety of shapes sand dunes are hills of sand deposited by the wind such as those at Great Sand Dunes National Park in Colorado but of all the things that cause erosion my favorite is a glacier glaciers form when snow piles up over time and turns to ice the glacier begins to flow outwards and downwards under the pressure of its own weight like great rivers of ice glaciers have sculpted mountains and carved out u-shaped valleys Valley glaciers flow down valleys and continental glaciers such as the ones on Greenland and Antarctica flow outward in all the directions glaciers reshape the underlying and surrounding landscape as they move by eroding rock from one place and depositing it in another that's called deposition glaciers rivers and wind are major forces of deposition that can build up the earth in some places and I think I've got the scoop on erosion erosion is when the earth is worn down it can happen because of water wind or ice that's right kid weathering and erosion work together to reshape the surface of the earth water and cracks of rocks can turn to ice in the winter and 
,,make the cracks bigger over time bits and pieces of the rock break off and fall away winds can pick up these small bits and we're down weaker parts of rock rain can 
,,watch the small bits away over time these processes can work together to leave interesting formations such as the arches in Utah or the hoodoos in bryce canyon canyons look like fun places I'd like to travel to see them someday well right now we need to travel to our next learning center right this way Wow hey wait Marco I think my chair ran out of gas ah it looks like we need an alternative energy source don't worry balance this on your head okay but how will this solar panel help we're indoors just our way to see hiya boys I see you used a perpetual resource to get here perpetual resource yep a perpetual resource is one that cannot be affected by human use perpetual resources are also called inexhaustible resources they include things like solar energy that can be converted into electricity solar energy can also be used to heat water or air for homes and businesses sounds like we should use solar energy for everything well solar energy is very dependent on the time of day the time of year and the weather so in order to be efficient a large surface area is required to collect the energy from the Sun but scientists are working on ways to get around that hmm is solar energy the only perpetual resource oh no there's always the wind remember that the wind is caused by uneven heating of Earth by the Sun so it's an indirect form of solar energy the wind blows stronger and more consistently in some areas wind turbines and wind farms can be built in those places to convert the wind energy into electricity and there's also geothermal energy heat from the earth can be used to make steam or hot water to heat buildings or generate electricity some scientists are even looking at ways to utilize the oceans to produce energy for us without causing any environmental damage they've come up with a few ways of tapping the energy from tides and we might even find a way to use temperature differences in the ocean to produce energy in some regions the surface water can be 40 or more degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the deep water so perpetual resources includes solar wind geothermal and ocean energy what other kinds of resources are there glad you asked kiddo there are renewable resources and non renewable resources I've heard of renewable resources they can be replenished as fast or faster than we use them that's true but the problem is that usually the demand for resources like wood crops soil and water increases over time if the demand gets too high these resources cannot be replenished fast enough we have to be careful and keep things in balance that does sound like a good thing to do and what about non-renewable resources I guess those can't be replenished at all when they're gone they're really gone non-renewable resources like a natural gas oil and coal that we get from 
,,fossil fuels will eventually run out if we keep using them energy efficiency and conservation are so important we need to make non-renewable resources last as long as possible while we are looking for new alternatives energy efficiency is the use of technology to perform the same function with less energy like putting tinting on your windows to keep out the sunlight that heats up buildings in the summertime no that's to make it look cool energy conservation is any behavior that causes us to use less energy like turning off lights when they're not being used exactly Kevin and by using energy-efficient light bulbs you can save a lot on your electric bill another way to conserve energy is by insulating and weatherizing homes and buildings that way you use less air conditioning and heating you can also save on heating and cooling by placing trees shrubs or other landscaping to block the wind and provide shade but we can conserve other resources besides just energy such as wood and water there are many ways to help save water around the house it turn off the water while you're brushing your teeth take short showers instead of Bath's and be sure to fix any leaks I worked with my mom to convince the people in our neighborhood to find a garbage service that recycles we separate out plastic glass aluminum cans and paper for recycling excellent by recycling you are not only conserving resources but you are also helping to keep unnecessary garbage out of landfills yeah thanks for helping to keep the earth a cleaner place to live kiddo you're welcome Tara and thanks to both of you for helping me study earth science I'm ready to ace my test I'm so proud of you well I should be getting back home Marko I'm ready to teleport okey-dokey huh hey science fans to quiz yourself on earth science you can download a practice test at my website just visit w-w-w that mark or the pencil dot-com show now that we've reviewed some of the material from earth science let's see 
,,how well you might do on the practice test for those of you following along you might want to use pause when the question first comes up to see if you can choose the right answer before Kevin let's begin with some questions about this solar system one look at the diagram of our solar system below what is the name of Planet 5 oh 
,,yeah mark oh my very educated mother just that starts with J Jupiter that's answer B fantastical sometimes you might be asked to fill in your answer right on the page with the questions but this test has a separate answer sheet be sure to ask your teacher how you're supposed to might the answers on your test let's put the test over the answer sheet just under the question we are answering that way we can make sure we fill in the right bubbles to which objects in our solar system have long tails when they are close to the Sun and are made mostly of rock and ice a planets be asteroids see dwarf planets d comets the only one of these things I remember having tails are the Comets you'll have a great memory our answer is d3 what causes day and night on earth a the Earth orbits the Sun na earth orbiting the Sun combined with the tilt of the Earth's axis is what gives us seasons not day and night B the moon orbits the earth the moon orbiting the earth causes the tides to rise and fall on the earth but it doesn't cause day and night C the Earth rotates on its axis I think this is the right answer right - you are see the Sun that lights up half of the earth the parts that are in the sunlight are experiencing a day the parts that aren't in the sunlight are experiencing at night and if we could look down at the earth from the North Pole we would see that the earth is rotating counterclockwise so the Sun seems to come up in the east and set in the West maybe I should check this last answer just to make certain C is the best choice good thinking Kevin D the Sun orbits the earth that's ridiculous everyone knows that the Sun doesn't orbit the Earth that means our answer is C the Earth rotates on its axis let's move on to questions about the water cycle and whether for what supplies the energy to drive the water cycle can you remember what I told you I remember Terra you said the energy source that drives the whole water cycle is the Sun you are really starting 
,,to get on my good side okay so our answer is a Sun good job now let's see if you can get this next one five the picture shows a place where air currents will form due to the uneven heating of the earth in which direction will air currents most likely move let's see warm air rises and the cool air will come in to replace it so a 
,,from the lake toward the land looks right but let me check all the answers be straight up above the lake no that's not right see from the land toward the lake that's backwards D all of the above that can't be right so our answer is egg I'm glad that you look at all of the answers carefully some students make the mistake of choosing all of the above every time it's an answer choice not our boy he's too smart to do something like that ah thanks Terra now do you remember anything from the geology Learning Center I sure do sedimentary rock is formed in layers and the deeper the layers the older they are they ought to make this next question pretty simple six the rock column above shows the layers in a sedimentary rock formation the three core samples to the right were taken from the rock column on the left according to this information which fossil is the oldest well the deepest layer is layer one so it is the oldest since the fossil on the bottom of core sample X came from layer one it is the oldest fossil so the answer is C let's see if you can get the answer to this next to geology question seven why are most fossils found in sedimentary 
,,rocks let me read through the answers a fossils can be distorted in metamorphic rocks that's true you bet it is metamorphic rocks are made by pressure and heat on other types of rocks that could really mess up any fossils in the rock well let's look at all the answer choices be igneous rocks were too hot when they formed considering that igneous rocks were made of molten rock I'm sure they were too hot to preserve any fossils what about C sedimentary rocks are best for preserving organisms 
,,this one's also true so the answer must be d all of the above you're a real gem we'll take a look at one more geology question 8 the chart below shows part of Mohs hardness scale for minerals a student is testing an unknown mineral for hardness the unknown mineral is tested against fluoride but neither mineral scratches the other which of the following conclusions can the student accurately make if the unknown mineral didn't scratch fluorite and fluorite didn't scratch the unknown mineral they both must have a hardness of 4 keep that in mind while we look at the possible answers a the unknown mineral and orthoclase will not scratch each other ortho Clay's is harder than fluorite so orthoclase would scratch the unknown mineral a is wrong be the unknown mineral will scratch calcite that's true yep calcite is lower on the hardness scale but let's not be too hasty read the last to answer choices see the unknown mineral will scratch orthoclase that's the exact opposite of what would happen d the unknown mineral will not scratch gypsum that doesn't seem right no way gypsum is even lower on the hardness scale than calcite so our answer is beep 
,,this kid has a mountain of information in his head you think so let's see if he remembers what was said about Earth's changing topography 9 mountains may be formed when a volcano's erupt that's true some of the volcanoes even have the word mount in their name like Mount Fuji but I remember that mountains are formed other ways too let me check the rest of the answers B plates of the Earth's crust collide that's true too Terrace said the Himalayas were formed that way great memory kid hmm see says both a and B and D says none of the above so I'm gonna have to say that C is the right answer perfecto 10 which of these processes can be caused by movement of the Earth's plates let's see the highest mountain range in the world the Himalayas were formed by plates colliding and the islands of Hawaii were formed because of 
,,a plate moving over a hot spot some of those Islands still have volcanic eruptions that makes all of the answers true so our answer is it D all of the above let's see what you remember about weathering and erosion 11 moving water was the most important factor in forming which of these a sand dunes at Great Sand Dunes National Park no Tara said those were formed by wind be the Grand Canyon I'm pretty sure that was formed by a river although I don't know what the name of the river is that would be the Colorado River see the Andes Mountains from what we discussed mountains are built from volcanic eruptions or plate tectonics not moving water you've got a 
,,good head on your shoulders kid D Kilauea volcano that's made out of flowing lava not moving water so the answer is B the Grand Canyon nice work whoo that's a nice picture I'd like to go there someday and the men at the bottom of the picture gives you some perspective as to how large the arch really is all right all right let's 
,,get down to business read the question please 12 the landform below is an arch found in Arches National Park in Utah which type of weathering or erosion is not responsible for shaping this arch here's one of those questions that has to be read carefully the word not makes a big difference in the answer I'll choose let's see Tara talked about the combination of water ice weathering and wind all playing a part in forming arches so I think the answer is a glaciers because glaciers did not help shape the arch right you are you're a smart kid so let's see how bright you are when it comes to energy and resources available on earth no problem thirteen which of the following is a renewable resource a tree that's renewable as long as we don't use them faster than new trees can grow I think this is the answer but I'll check them all to be sure I'm so glad you have good test taking skills be natural gas that's a non-renewable resource see solar energy ah this is one of the perpetual or 
,,inexhaustible resources you told me about not a renewable one no matter how much we use the perpetual resources they'll always be around D oil no that's a fossil fuel all fossil fuels are non-renewable resources so the only renewable resource here is the tree that makes the ants at a 14 watering plants and grass in the early morning is one way to conserve water why a plants only absorb water in the morning no plants can absorb water any time of day take a look at the next one okay Marco be 
,,less water evaporates into the air in the cool morning this leaves more water for plants to absorb and allows shorter watering times that's true sea water used in the morning can be recycled in the evening that doesn't make sense if some sort of system is in place to catch unused water to be recycled it can be used anytime not just in the morning D water is more pure in the morning this one doesn't make sense either I guess that means you're sticking with answer B then yep and now for the last question 15 which of the following is not a way to help conserve energy a plant trees in the landscaping around buildings the trees wood provides shade from the 
,,Sun and help to block wind which would help with cooling and heating bills but the question is asking which one is not a way to conserve energy how about B turn off 
,,machines when they're not being used that's definitely a way to conserve energy check the next one sure thing Marco see both a and B no those are both good ways to conserve energy so that means our answer must be D take lots of bubble baths Wow you did a great job on this practice earth science test I agree nice work hey science fans you can download this earth science test at my website just visit www.marsianstudio.webs.com you

Sets,l3-A0O42Lyo,the topic of sets is by far the simplest topic to grasp in mathematics since we have to tackle just three simple questions first what are sets second why do we need 
,,them and last how do we represent them let's tackle the first question in this video what are sets a set is basically a collection of things think about it what if you were asked to make a list of all the things you can see of course you can't write all the things but some of the things you would mention are a tree or cell phone a puppy people and so on and what if you were asked to write down a list of things you cannot see you would probably write oxygen heat and so on these are the things you cannot see a set is a collection of elements yes but they have to be related in some way let us look at a few more examples to understand better try to list down all the cricket playing nations you know of I would probably have said India England Australia Pakistan and so on now try to list all the oceans you have heard of if you didn't know there are five oceans in the world Pacific Atlantic Indian Arctic and Southern Ocean now here's an interesting question can we make a set of elements for all the questions you're asked for the answer is no not necessarily what if we were asked to make a list of the good teachers we know we cannot make a set here because my idea of a good tutor may be completely different from yours similarly we cannot make a list of intelligent students we know the word intelligent is not well-defined so remember another important characteristic of sets is that the elements in it should be well-defined all the elements in a set should be related and well-defined
,,
Sets,fLMN0wtiz-4,all right so this video we're gonna look at sets and we're gonna talk about Union intersection and complement alright so let's talk about what each one is if we're given a set a and a universal set u the universal set is the set that contains everything okay and the set of all elements of you that do not belong to a is called the complement of set a and the way we write it is with this a prime here okay so so basically if you have a if you have a universal set u and you have a set a and a has some elements in it well every element that is not in this one in a but as in the universal set that's the complement of a and I'm gonna do some examples so I've 
,,got about eight examples to work alright so and then we have the intersection so given two sets a and B to set all of all elements that belong to both set sets a and B is called the intersection of the two sets and this is how we write it a intersect B and then this and then the set of all elements belonging to set a or to set B or to both sets it's called the you get of the two sets and we write it like this a union B so intersection is basically if you want to find the intersection of two sets it's the elements they have in common and the union of two sets so if you have two sets and you want the union it's just every element that's in both sets combined into one set okay so let's go ahead and get started on the example so you can see I've got about I've got eight examples to work alright so let's look at this so we want to find the complement of a well here we have the Universal set so the universal set Taine's of tech contains the set of numbers of the numbers 1 through 10 here's set a 1 3 5 7 set B and set C all right so we want the complement of a so the complement remember the complement of a is all of the elements that are not in set a but are in the universal set so you see how set a contains the numbers 1 3 5 and 7 okay so if you see that C 1 3 5 & 7 those are the elements that are in set 
,,a well which elements are not in set a but are in the universal set well you see that's 2 4 6 8 9 and 10 so the complement of a would be 2 4 6 8 9 and 10 and there's your answer okay all right so let's look at a let's look at the next one the complement of B okay so the complement of B is everything that's in the universal set that's not in set B so let's see what's in B so we've got what 3 4 5 6 so 3 4 5 6 8 and 10 8 and 10 ok so this would be what 1 2 1 2 let's see 7 & 9 and so that's the complement of B all right now let's look at a intersect B all right so a intersect B we look at sets a and we look at sets B set a and B now we want to know what do these sets have in common well let's see well B does not have a 1 so we look at the 3 well B has a 3 so there's one element that they haven't three let's see five yeah there's a 5 here and a 5 here and then seven well B doesn't have a seven so the only elements they have in common is three and five so this would be 3 5 and then a union B well all that is I mean this alright so a union B that's all of the elements from sets a and B combined into one set so we've got a 1 a 3 and C B has a 3 
,,but we only write it one time you don't write it twice ok so 1 3 and then let's say we've got a 4 here and then a 5 and then let's see there's a 6 just try to keep the numbers in order 6 and then we've got 7 8 and 10 and so there's a union B there's a union B all right now let's look at this one we've got the complement of a intersect B all right so let me go ahead I'm gonna erase this I have some room to work because we're gonna have to I'll have to do a little more work with these all right so I'm gonna bring this up just a little bit alright so what we want to do here is I need the complement of a and B okay so I need to know what elements does a complement and B have in common well I don't have the complement of a I know we had it right here but I erased it but let's go ahead and write it down so the complement of a is equal to so remember that's going to be what 2 4 6 8 9 and ten so there's the compliment of a make sure got everything one three five seven one three five 
,,seven so yeah that looks right all right so now I want to know what does a compliment and B have in common so here's a compliment here's a B well let's underline the numbers they have in common so let's say they've got a four in common okay they've got a six in common and they've got eight in common and they have a 10 in common 
,,and so those are the values they have in common so this set would be let's see that's gonna be what four six eight 10 and so there's a complement intersect B all right all right now let's look at the next one we've got a intersect B Union C okay a intersect B Union C so what we're gonna do here is notice that this is in parentheses so we need to do this first and then do the intersection with a okay so first I need to find B Union C okay so that's all the elements from B and C combined into one set that's what Union means so we've got a 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and 10 that's all the elements from both sets combined into one and yes they both have a 4 but you only write it once don't write it two times don't write it twice okay so there's B Union C so what I want to do is I want to take this set here and intersect it with a so I need to know what elements does this set and this set have in common okay so let's see well we can let's let's underline what they have in common that might make it a little easier so let's see well they both have a three they both have a five and they both have a seven okay and so that would be the answer here that would be three five seven and there's a intersect B Union C okay all right so let's look at the next one all right so we've got a union B intersect C so once again we need to do what's in the parenthesis first okay so I need B intersect C so remember B intersect C that's what these two sets have in common okay I'm finding this first so 
,,let's look what does B and C have in common well let's say they both say they both have a for they both have a 6 and they both have an 8 okay so the intersection of 
,,B and C would be 4 6 8 okay and now what I want to do I want to do this set Union a see a Union the B intersect C alright so remember Union that's everything in this set or everything in this set plus everything in this set combined into one set so that would be what one three four five six seven and eight and you can see here nothing they didn't have the same number in both sets so it was just every element okay alright so let's take a look at the last one all right so I need I need a intersect B Union C complement okay so once again I need to find what's in this first inside the parenthesis the union of B and the complement of C all right so let's see what we get we get B Union C complement all right so remember Union that's everything in this set and oh and everything in C complement well we don't have C complement so look we got to find that first don't we all right so remember the complement that's everything that's in the universal set that's not in set C so let's see let's just cross out what's in set C so that's the to the for the six seven and eight those are the elements in C but the can remember the complement that's everything that's in here that's not in here so that's going to be what one three five nine and ten okay so now I can do the intersection of B and C complement I'm sorry not 
,,the intersection but the Union I can do the union of B and C complement so the union is going to be everything and set B plus everything and C complement combined into one set so let's see we've got what a 1 a 3 4 5 6 4 5 6 8 9 and 10 that's everything from both sets combined into one set and like I've said before the 10 appears in both of them you only write at once if the number appears in both of them you only write at once all right so here's here's the set in the parentheses here now I want to do the intersection of a and this set so it's gonna be a intersect this set so let's just mark off what they have in common so they both have a 1 they both 
,,have a 3 they both have a 5 put a comma there but they don't but both of them do not have a 7 okay so the only ones the only elements they have in common is 1 3 & 5 
,,so this set would be 1 3 5 okay so I hope that helped check out my other videos give me a like share and subscribe and thanks for watching

Sets,GY6Q2f2kvY0,hello welcome back to algebra in this lesson we're gonna cover the concept of what is a function now in the last section we talked about relations and functions and 
,,algebra and how they're very similar to one another and how a function is different from a relation now we're going to take and turn our attention specifically to the concept of a function because this I've mentioned before functions are basically what you're going to use throughout algebra throughout geometry throughout calculus physics chemistry engineering pretty much any type of advanced learning that you're gonna get into and learning is going to involve the concept of a function so in this lesson what I want to do is is go a little bit deeper into what a function is illustrate it for you and give you some examples of very common functions that we will see as we get into more of our advanced study of algebra so at the end of this you should have an idea of what a function really is and examples of some common functions that we'll be using as we go along forward into the class now I could write the definition down on the board but honestly it's very simple to understand it so I'm just gonna read it to you and then I'll draw a picture to illustrate it a function in math or in algebra is a mathematical I'm gonna call it a machine but you can think of it as a mathematical object right or a construct that takes X values as the input to the machine right and it outputs Y values or we say f of X functions of X we call them for now Y values well that's what we've been calling them up until this point in a one-to-one correspondence so what it means is you have a black box here it's something that we call a function the input to the machine is values that we call X and it performs some functional operation and output the output on the other side is another number called Y what we call in a one-to-one correspondence that means that there's only one value of Y for every input value of X and 
,,we talked about this a lot in the last section because relations in general are different they can have more than one value of y for each value of x but for functions for every input you put in you only get one output that's what the basic the basic difference is so if we wanted to draw it and we do want to draw it I like drawing things especially with this because it makes it very easy to understand so here we have a black box we call it a machine right but what we're really saying is it's some kind of calculation in here and inside of this we're representing as the function f of X right now this notation does not mean f x x so you kind of have to kind of reprogram yourself a little bit because it looks like f is x x it doesn't mean that it means F is some function it's a function of X so we put it in parentheses to show you that you're taking values of X and you're sticking them into the function now these values of X where do they come from well you feed those values in from the outside and these are the X values so you see you have numbers you're putting in the X values and then you operate on it on this function of X that's why it's parentheses X and the output comes out of the other side so that's why we say this is a machine kind of it taints these numbers and it does something to them and then output the output comes out the other end and so also say that this is the output values and the outputs that come out are called f of X but up until now we've basically been using functions a lot even even though you haven't realized that we've been talking about lines and lines or functions just like most objects in math that we're gonna learn about are going to be functions well you've already used one it's called a line that's a function of X remember we stick the x value in and we get the Y value out so here's where we kind of have to kind of take a step back and talk candidly with you a little bit right so a lot of students get confused when we talk about functions because we've been learning about lines we learn y equals MX plus B right we take the value of x we calculate the value of y and then you get 
,,to this idea of a function which is kind of the same thing you're taking the value it's going in you calculate something and then out comes the value out you see what we were learning this concept of functions now it's exactly what you've already been doing it's no real different it's just a relabeling before we said that y is equal to MX plus B here we're just saying instead of calling it Y we're gonna say the output value is called f of X this is the way you read f of X it's a function of X so everything that you've learned up until this point about line specifically applies to functions you take input values you count laid out put values it's just in the past we always called those output values why here we're calling them f of X so then you might say why are we renaming and it doesn't make a lot of sense well 
,,it's because as you get more and more advanced math there's a whole branch of mathematics called function theory that that you kind of have to crawl before you walk 
,,so when we first started we talked about Y is equal to MX plus B or whatever function that we have we don't really talk about functions in the beginning because we're just getting used to the idea of plotting things on graphs and soap and so on and so forth but as soon as you have that idea of the line under your belt and you basically have already been dealing with your very first functions which are called linear functions functions of letter lines now we can take the training wheels off 
,,and say hey what you've been doing in the past is really a function and so what it is it's a mathematical machine inside the machine before we've learned it's MX plus B that's the function that you've been dealing with so far but this function can be anything it can be all kinds of things that we'll talk about as we go more and 
,,more through math and we'll learn several of them here but anyway you take inputs you calculate things and you get outputs all right so let's do a couple of quick examples just to illustrate so here's an example all right here's an example function f of X is equal to 2x plus 3 now you should recognize this because if I cover up 
,,the f of X part and if I just put y equals 2x plus 3 what would it look like you should recognize that this is a line right it has a y-intercept of 3 and it has a slope of 2 and we know how to calculate that we can either plot the y-intercept and then do rise over run and draw the line we can do that but if it were y is equal to 2x plus 3 you also know that you can write a table you can stick values of X into into this place and calculate the corresponding Y values now we're just relabeling everything and we're saying we're not calling it y is equal to this anymore we're saying f of X means this is a function of X and this is what the function is equal to now this specific function is called a linear function so now you're kind of getting kind of grown up a little bit and you're studying and you start using fancy 
,,terms like linear function linear just means line function means its function means it takes an input and you get a single output out there's a one-to-one correspondence for every input you get one input out only one that's what a function is and of course we talked about the vertical line test before because every time you draw that vertical line you only intersects in one spot you only have one output for every input that's what a function is so this is an example of a linear function and if you wanted to graph this it would be basically exactly what we did a long time ago when we started talking about lines we can take the input values and we can list them over here and we can put it a table with the output values so we put the input values of X into the machine and we take the output values as we calculate them on the output side and then we're gonna have XY points although we don't call them X&Y anymore we call them X and f of X but you plot them as X and Y's we always have so we can for instance take negative two is an input negative 1 0 1 and 2 and of course we can go on from negative infinity to positive infinity calculating values until we're you know blue in the face so how do you calculate this you take the negative 2 into the function which means you put it into the value of x which means what you have here is the way you write it is f of negative 2 means you're taking negative 2 and you're sticking it into the function this does not mean F times 2 
,,or an F times negative 2 it doesn't mean this is multiplied this means that we take the negative 2 we stick it into the function which means we substitute it into the position where X is so we have 2 times negative 2 plus 3 so what do we have here this is negative 4 plus 3 what do we have here negative 1 right that's what we get for the first value and then for the next value we can say all right let's take F and we'll stick negative 1 in so it's F of negative 1 that's how you say it out loud so it'll be 2 times sticking negative 1 in here plus 3 this is gonna be negative 2 plus 3 and what do you get here you get 1 for the second value all right and then the third value we're plugging in a value of zero so it's f evaluated at 0 or F of 0 is equal to 2 times 0 plus 3 this is going to give you 0 plus 3 so we can just write 3 down that's the easiest way to write that and then we can now evaluate at X is equal to 1 so we say X f of 1 is 2 times 1 plus 3 so here you have 2 plus 3 
,,is 5 and the last one F evaluated at 2 make sure you read it as F of 2 2 times 2 plus 3 this is 4 plus 3 is 7 so I can kind of shortcut a little bit there so you have negative 1 1 3 5 & 7 what do you think this is gonna look like when you plot it I mean you already know it's gonna be a line but just to for completeness let's go 
,,ahead and quickly draw it real quick we're not gonna use the big graph paper because we've done this so many times so we have X but instead of writing Y up here which is what we've done before we'll write f of X so you're plotting for the x-values you're plotting the x-values and for the y-values you're just plotting these f of 
,,X values so for functions you need to start thinking of x and f of X what the function has done it's operated on the values of X it spits out an output value that you call f of X so you plot x verses f of X so now we have the values of x here we'll just go ahead and start I guess I should have drawn it in the negative direction 
,,as well right because what we're really plotting is let's go negative 2 negative 1 this is 0 this is 1 and this is 2 and it looks like our Y values go up 2 let's just go up to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 this is 7 this is 5 this is 3 this is 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and we have a little bit of a negative value as well so with a negative 1 so what we're gonna do is plot it negative 2 comma negative 1 so negative 2 is here comma negative 1 it's a little hard to write but it's basically right around here and then what we have next is negative 1 comma 1 which means negative 1 for X positive 1 for y which is right around there then we have 0 comma 3 so 0 comma 3 1 2 3 is about right around there and then we have 1 comma 5 1 comma 5 is around there and then 2 comma 7 2 comma 7 is around there now I know it's not perfect and it's I'm actually 
,,really close to the board so I can't really read them too easily but it's a straight line you can more or less see it's a straight line so I'm just proving to you even though we've done in a million times before with lines that when you have something that looks like 2x plus 3 for your function that's what we call a linear function so you need to start using and understanding the terminology of algebra as much as this much of what I'm trying to teach you here is the terminology in addition 
,,to the math right so when you see something like you have a linear function it looks like this it sounds very complicated all it means is it's a line right so if you ever have something that asks you once you learned about functions in your exam or something and it asks you you know here are two points you know write me an equation of the function here well it's exactly the same as writing the equation of the line that you've been doing over and over again first you find the slope between those points and then you write MX plus B or you can use the point-slope form Y minus y1 equals M times X minus x1 and you basically do it exactly the same way it's just that instead of saying Y is equal to this you say f of X is equal to this so we're doing mostly terminology here but from pretty much here on out we're gonna be 
,,talking about functions functions of X right so this is called a linear function I want to go through a couple of additionals just to give you some examples of what 
,,other functions might look like let's say that we're going to take input values of X and we're going to calculate what the function looks like if it looks like f of 
,,X is equal to x squared now the first thing is you should notice that this is not a line at all I mean the equation of a line is MX plus B number times X plus number right but this looks nothing like that because you have an exponent here so right away you know that all lines should look like MX plus you should have that in your mind this doesn't look like that so it's not gonna look like a lie right so we're gonna go ahead and show you how that looks right now though just to keep it on even footing we'll choose the same exact points negative 2 negative 1 0 1 & 2 as values and we'll stick them in here so we'll take and operate on the first one F of negative 2 is negative 2 squared make sure you stick the entire negative quantity into B squared negative 2 times negative 2 is positive 4 here we'll have a function evaluated at negative 1 stick the negative 1 in there negative 1 times negative 1 is positive 1 we'll take the 0 in there we'll evaluate it at 0 0 squared 0 times 0 is of course 0 switch colors just to break it up a little bit we'll take F evaluated at 1 is going to be 1 squared 1 times 1 is 1 and then in 2 you can see the pattern here it's just gonna be 2 squared which is 4 now notice the interesting thing about this x squared function here even for the negative values of X we ended up getting positive values on the output f of X but the positive values of course we always get positive values so the interesting thing is because you have a function that's squared no matter what the input is if it's positive or negative you're still gonna get a positive answer so let's take a look and see what this graph looks like just to compare it here so we will go and look over here and see what this looks like so let's say we have here's negative 1 here's negative 2 here's 0 of course and 
,,here's one here's 2 and let's say we have 1 2 3 4 let's call this vibe right now let's plot this guy and take a look at what we have negative 2 comma 4 means a negative 2 way up here at 4 that's what it looks like at the beginning then negative 1 comma 1 negative 1 comma 1 is way down here then we have 0 comma 0 that's right at 
,,the origin then we have 1 comma 1 1 over here 1 up is right there and then 2 comma 4 is up here now it looks like you could just draw a little light lip sorry little line segments to connect them like a little line segment here little different line segments here different line segments here a different line segment here and it 
,,does look like that at first glance but if I had put more points in here like if I put negative one and a half if I put negative 0.5 if I put point five if I put one and a half or if I put like a hundred points in there in between all of these numbers to get a lot of granularity and exactly what it looks like what you would actually find is the function would trace a path more like this it would be a curved kind of deal that kind of goes and it just kisses the axis there and then it goes back up like this it gets very steep at the ends here this guy is not a linear it's not a linear function that's called a quadratic function we're gonna talk a whole lot about quadratic functions later on so don't worry about it I'm just giving you the the name of it so that you can kind of get used to it roll it off your tongue a little bit but the idea of a quadratic function just means that you have X with a square power any function with X that has a square power we call it a quadratic function and they're pretty much always gonna look something like this sometimes they might go upside-down but they're always gonna be a smiley face or a frowny face like this kind of doing this now notice he gets very steep up here and over here because everything's squared so here when I starting if I would go to the next the next one it would be 3 comma 9 we have 3 times 3 is 9 or 4 comma 16 or 5 comma 25 you see what's going on here 6 comma 36 because you're squaring it so as you get farther in X it's getting really really steep so this thing gets really really steep as you get just past and go into the positive territory or in the negative territory here as well alright so that's a quadratic function now what I want to do is I've Illustrated by plotting points to show you hey this is called a linear function you've already talked about it it's a line here we have I have we haven't learned much about it but it's called a quadratic function by the way if you want to see that written down it looks like this quadratic function right but the point of this lesson isn't really to learn too much about this or too much about this the point of 
,,this is just for you to get the idea of a function in your mind and have some practical examples of what functions look like so what I want to do before we close the lesson is I want to illustrate what a few more functions look like kind of a tour of what you might see some functions that might look like in algebra and beyond all right so here's some functions that we can talk about we can say we already talked about f of X is equal to x squared we just drew it here but just for completeness I will go ahead and put it in its place a quadratic function it looks like this he starts up high it kisses the x axis and then goes back up high again and you saw that by us plotting our points just like we did a minute ago of course we already talked about the linear function which is just a line now let's take a look at what this function over here looks like f of x equals x to the third power so it's not x squared it's X to the third power this is called a cubic function and if you were to plot this of course it's freehand so forgive me a little bit it's actually gonna look pretty interesting it's gonna start down low it's gonna go kiss the axis 
,,and go through it and then it's gonna go up this direction right now what I want to do is I want to get all of these on the board and then once they get them all on 
,,the board I'm gonna go back through them and kind of explain why they look the way that they do but first I just want you to kind of get an idea of hey here's what a quadratic function of x squared type function looks like here's what an X cubed function looks like let's get through them all and then we'll go and talk about them a little bit more let's say we have f of X is equal to X to the fourth power because you can have these quartic functions we call them we got this guy right here and so we can draw this guy now it's interesting as well it's gonna be really really really yeah let me do it like this really really really steep and they're really really really flat and then really really really steep again notice it kind of looks a little bit like a quadratic it's just much steeper and then at the bottom it gets really really flat and we'll talk about that later I haven't drawn any numbers I don't want to get into the details here I want to show you kind of the overview of what these look like another one I want to share with you is important f of X is going to be equal to 1 over X alright talk about this later but I want to just draw it for you right here's X and there's f of X now this one's interesting it actually split into two parts it goes really a PI like this and then curves down and then on the negative side it goes like this some kind of little draw a little Haros here if you like I'll explain why it looks like this in just a minute but that's what the 1 over X looks like this is a hyperbola and then we will talk about one last one right and the last one I want to talk about is f of X is equal to the absolute value of x right what do you think that's gonna look like absolute value of x is a kind of a triangle shape thing it's a straight line sorry I put a little curve in that I didn't intend to let me try to draw that a little bit better it's a straight line it's best I can do anyway and then it's a straight line this way mirror image reverse and it has a hard like a point right in the center there a little cusp right there now one little bonus one I'll drive will do this on the last page because I really want you to understand the idea behind a lot of this stuff and where we're going with this right here's X here's a function that you won't learn until much much later in trigonometry at the end of algebra 2 and also in trigonometry it's called the sine function sine of X this is kind of a bonus you're not going to use this too much now but I want to show you that these functions can look pretty interesting this function starts here and it goes up and it goes down goes up goes down and it goes like this forever so in the reverse direction it goes like this and so on it's a wave basically so just a little bit of a fun fact for you when you get into more advanced studies and you talk about radio waves any kind of wave that you might have like study in nature it looks like this which is a sine function notice it passes the vertical line test just like any other function you can only cut it in one place but it goes up and down and up and down so this is what a radio wave would look like traveling to userspace well let's come down to earth a little bit and talk a little bit about these functions this one makes sense because we already plotted it and so it's doing this because we're squaring everything that's our everything getting very very large this one is looking like this because it's cubed so when you look at the positive values of X it just it's just multiplying by itself three times so if X is 2 then it's 2 times 2 times 2 if X is 3 then it's 3 times 3 times 3 if X is 4 then it's 4 times 4 times 4 so it gets really really really big really really fast but on the negative side notice it curves down like this because if you have negative 1 then it'll be negative 1 times negative 1 times negative 1 so negative times negative times negative will give you a negative value it'll still get really big in the negative direction but it'll be negative because it'll have again on the negative side negative 4 times negative 4 times negative 4 will give you negative large number for instance so it's gonna get really really big in the negative sense and that's why it doesn't quite mirror this it kind of starts in the negative sense and then it goes back up in the positive sense now this one is to the 4th power that means it's getting even steeper than this because you're 
,,multiplying it times 4 so if X was 5 it would be 5 times 5 times 5 times 5 so it gets really really really steep fast but in this region it bottoms out so flatly because it between negative 1 and 1 when you have decimals there if it let's say X was 0.5 then it would be 0.5 times 0.5 times 0.5 times 0.5 so in the decimal regions 
,,in there you're multiplying by a decimal over and over again so it cuts it down and gets it really close to 0 like a bathtub down here that's why it gets so flat here this one does it as well but not quite as much as this one now this one's called the hyperbola because you're dividing by X so when X gets really really big like 1 over let's say X is 100 1 over 100 it gets really close to 0 but as as X gets really really close to 0 over here like let's say let's put X is equal to 0.5 then it 
,,would be 1 over 0.5 let's say X is 0.1 really really close to 0 let's say X is point oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 1 then you say 1 divided by 0.001 which gives you a really big number so you divide by the small numbers and gives you a big number you divide by the big numbers gives you a small number exactly the same thing happens over here but with negative numbers so that's why when you're dividing by the negative of X it does the same thing but over on the negative side for Y and then the final ones the absolute value because over here it makes sense what's the absolute value of two it's just going to be two what's the absolute value of three it's going to be three what's the absolute value of 17 is gonna be 17 but over here what's the absolute value of negative 5 4 if X is negative 5 it'll be positive 5 and so on so any negative value you put into this function gives you a positive value out so the point of this was not for you to memorize these functions the point of this was just to show you just kind of a potpourri of what some some functions look like so what we're gonna do is we'll be talking a whole lot more about these linear functions as we go through the class we've already done that lot then we'll be talking a lot about quadratic functions because quadratic functions with with the parabolas like this they make up quite a bit of science and math right so we'll be studying that a lot but along the way we will get into cubic functions and you may have some other hyperbolas and things like this and then when you get on into advanced math you'll have crazier functions that look like waves right but the point is for you not to memorize them the point is for you to know what functions are every one of these functions passes the vertical line test slice any of these functions vertically and they only get cut in one place even this one it only gets cut in one place so their function so that brings me back full circle a function is a mathematical machine that takes X values for input and outputs Y values for output in a one-to-one correspondence meaning for every value of the input X you only get one value of the output and when you plot that then if we say that it passes the vertical line test and that's a function so make sure you understand this follow me on through the rest of the lessons we'll be talking about functions for the rest of our time together so I want to introduce it here and then we'll get to the following lessons where we talk about different types of functions and how to solve equations with functions and do all kinds of things all of which are really important in all branches of science math and engineering

Sets,RnR57m46c8U,alright guys grab your papers and pencils get ready to practice a math assessment I'm going to give you one minute to try the problem on your own then I'm going to go through it your minute starts now all right Charlene has a special brownie recipe she needs 2 and 2/5 cups of sugar and 1 in 1/12 of cups of sugar for the icing how much sugar does she need in all essentially we are adding these two numbers together a shortcut is if I take the whole number part of that 1 and 2 and add those together 1 plus 2 equals 3 so we're going to need at least 3 and then the fraction that goes with it I can eliminate choices a and B because they're not at least 3 cups then I'm just adding the fractions we have 1/12 plus 2/5 to add fractions you have to have a common denominator in this case it's 60 to turn it into sixtieths we put 1 times 5 and 12 times 5 2 times 12 and 5 times 12 which gives us 5 60th plus 24 60th or 29 over 60 which matches our answer here 3 and 29 60th try question 2 you have 60 seconds starting now looking at the four different statements actually three different statements here we need to find out which one's not true or true I'm 
,,"sorry in order to do that we have to get these two equal or equivalent fractions what I mean by that is they need to both be fractions that they need to have the same denominator to turn this point zero four into a fraction it really is saying 4 over 100 so actually I'm going to put that for over 100 right down here to turn 11 2015 to something with the same denominator as this one we multiply the top and bottom by 4 giving us 44 over 100 now if we read that statement 4,400 Sizzlin for one "
,,hundredths you would clearly say no this is not true so a is out we need to do the same strategy here kind of working a little more quickly 13 over 100 and then this we take times 5 times 5 we get 10 over 100 is 10 over 100 greater than 13 over 100 No so we've eliminated two choices here 6% if you don't know is actually 6 out of 100 to get this to the hundreds we take it times 2 times 2 we get 6 over 100 equals Helu that we've found our choice question 3 I accidentally hit the timer so you 
,,have 51 seconds left to solve this problem all right mr. Scott spent 3925 on basketball cards he purchased four packs this is a unit rate problem if we write this as a fraction thirty-nine point two five or thirty nine dollars twenty five cents per four packages how much did he spend was it between six and seven seven and eight 
,,eight nine nine and ten the fastest way to get to this is use estimation if I instead say well that's close to $40 for four packs that I could quickly deduce is ten 
,,dollars per one pack the reason I did that it's hard to divide 39 point two five divided by four in your head but 40 divided by four is easy so it's about ten dollars a pack a little bit less so we look at these choices well it's clearly not between six and seven it's not seven and eight and it's not eight and nine it's definitely going to fall in the range of nine dollars and $10 actually closer to ten dollars as we found all right problem 4 here we go 60 seconds all right if I had a calculator I just take 4 divided by 50 and I'd be done since I don't I have to convert this to a decimal form I need to get the bottom or the denominator into the into 100 so I take that times 2 but I also take the top times 2 and that's going to give me 8 over 100 which is equivalent to point 0 8 choice is d all right question 5 here we go all right ms stork bought dinner for 12 people the cost of the dinner was 126 84 what's the average cost of each person's dinner now you're going to think of this as a unit rate problem where you have $126 84 cents per 12 people okay we need to figure out the fastest way to get to the cost now you could just divide 120 6.8 4/12 but remember you don't have a calculator so we're going to use estimation I'm going to drop this down to 120 dollars and I'm going to divide it by 12 that we can do in our head we say that's it ten dollars a meal it's actually going to be slightly more because we forgot to include this six dollars 84 cents but if I look 
,,at the answers if it's got to be more than $10 a Zout bees out sees out and here's our choice letter D number six here we go Oh all right takes two and three-quarter gallons of paint to paint each wall on miss Reed's house if she needs to paint three walls how much paint will she need well she's going to need three times two and three quarters we need to figure out three times two and three quarters as quickly as we can how I would approach this is I take three times two gives me six then I take three times the three quarters and I think of that three quarters plus 3/4 plus three quarters you know there's several ways you can do this in your head gives me nine fourths or two in 1/4 adding these two together I get 8 and 1/4 or choice B number seven here we go alright here we go guys David waited in lunch line for 1/2 an hour if you can't see that Raymond waited for 1/4 hour how much longer did David wait then Raymond so we need to figure out how to take David's time 1/2 hour and subtract Raymond's time of 1/4 hour we need the same denominator so if I take this times 2 what I end up getting is 2 quarters of an hour minus one quarter of an 
,,hour giving me David waited one quarter of an hour longer choice see last question for today number 8 ready set go all right Girona Cabaye is four boxes of brownie mix each box cost three dollars sixty-seven cents what's the best estimate of the total cost with four boxes so in other words we have to take four times three dollars and 67 cents now you may have different methods of doing this here's the method I would use because we want to get an estimate I would take four times three so right there we get twelve dollars then I would take four times sixty cents which gives me two dollars and forty cents and then I would take four times seven cents which gives me twenty-eight cents if I add all those together and I don't even have to add them perfectly I get fourteen dollars and sixty-eight cents and what that tells me is that between fourteen and fifteen dollars now there's other ways of doing this you may have different ways you could actually round this up to three dollars and seventy cents and that would give you a pretty good estimate it kind of depends on how you see those numbers but estimating we need between fourteen and fifteen dollars you just completed eight problems from your math assessment practice we put you on a timer to illustrate the idea that you only have about one minute to complete these problems we will see you tomorrow

Sets,MEYWV5gguAQ,hello children today i'm here to teach you chapter 2 in your textbook that's called sets so in this lesson we are trying to identify sets identify the elements of a 
,,set and we are talking about listing the elements that belong to the set and also about venn diagrams look at this one some of the items in a bag of necessities bought home in written the circle there are common features to this cluster of items what can you see beetroot go to color cabbage beans those are vegetables but when you look at these vegetables we can again divide these into three sections categories we can divide into yams green leaves and other categories we'll try to do that beetroot but it's a yeah so we can write beetroot inside this gaucho cola go to color it's a green leaves cabbage we can say other categories beans that's other categories carrot is it yeah kanku it's a greenlee also a greenlee potatoes yes eggplant we can say other categories and bitter gourd is also other categories so we got other categories so here these are groups we can identify so we'll look at another example there are several transport vessels within the circle ship bus aeroplane train boat took to so categorize them into three groups how can we categorize vehicles on land vehicles in the sky vehicles on water ship you can say vehicles on water 
,,bus vehicles online aeroplane vehicles in the sky train here and boat on water took took car bicycle and helicopter here and lorry also here so here vehicles also we can categorize into these three groups above vehicles are categorized according to the common features now we'll look at some more examples now look at this one appearing in the circle line integers now these are numbers categorize them as follows according to their common features by looking at the number odd numbers you know 
,,odd numbers are not divisible by 2 1 3 5 7 one three five seven nine even numbers what are even numbers they are two four six eight ten multiples of three what are multiples of three three times one three three times two is six three times three nine three times three nine and triangular numbers what are triangular numbers that 
,,you can make a triangle so one what's the next triangular number three then what's the next one one two three four five six six plus four again ten those are triangular numbers and multiples of five five times one five five times two ten so we can categorize these numbers 1 to 10 into these groups now when you're categorizing materials or various features what are the things we need to check sometimes color sometimes shape non-material solid liquid air or material or non-living things so by looking at any characteristic we can divide into several groups so that's what we are doing in this lesson grouping items or numbers into several categories write all the numbers odd numbers between 10 and 20 within the curly brackets so what are the odd numbers starting from 10 11 13 15 90. so those are the odd numbers in between 10 and 20. look at this example you have given 1 to 15. write down even numbers below 15 within the curly brackets what are your numbers 2 4 6 8 10 12 14. those 
,,are even numbers then write down multiples of 5 up to 15 up to 15 means you can take 15 as well but these are multiples of 5 yes 15 also considers 5 10 15. those are multiples of 5. write down the triangular numbers up to 15. so what are the triangular numbers now you know 1 1 plus 2 3 3 plus 3 6 6 plus 4 10 10 plus 5 50. you can write 15 as well write down prime numbers up to 15 within the curly brackets prime numbers what's the smallest prime number that's 2 2 3 5 7 then 11 13 so that's all so these are prime numbers so we can categorize these set of numbers into several groups can you write the name of children clever at mathematics in your class can you do that all are good in maths i can't divide children according to their ability like that some children do algebra very well some do geometry very well so all are clever so we can't identify the group so this is not i did can you write the names of children obtain more than 80 marks for the mathematics i can do that so i 
,,can look at your marks and those who are above 80 i can write their names yes can this is identifiable can you write what the melodies songs are we can't do that it's difficult not identity can you write what films are good can you do that you like films related to children we like different films so we don't know which films are good so not identifiable it will be obvious to you that there are both clusters that can be and cannot be precisely written separately what is considered as sets are the groups or clusters so what are sets sets are the groups or clusters those can be precisely separated so we'll see more examples in this lesson so what are the characteristics of a set a set is made of material or non non-material things objects of a set are called lv months so you are learning a new term elements of a set then elements of set are written within curly brackets and elements of a set should be written with a comma after each element and no element is written more than once so think about letters in maharagama if it's so you can't write m twice a here four times five times one two three four five but you are writing a only one so what are the letters if if we don't consider the capital n simple m is one letter m a h r g m you can't write again and a you can't write again so remember all these characteristics of a set the set of fingers of ana can we identify yes we can thumb index finger middle finger ring finger and small finger so appearing above is a set consisted of material elements you can touch it and you can identify that's called material the set of your most preferred subjects to study it can be maths science history english so those are called non-material elements so you can't touch it so you should be able to identify what are material elements and non-material elements elements in a set should be easily identified from each other the set of vowels of the english alphabet what are the vowels in the english alphabet e e i so you 
,,can identify those people with spiritual merit can we write down the set we cannot identify so it's not a set no elements cannot be written twice when writing sets letter sets of the maharagama so we discussed before if it's maharagama a and m only once so m a h a you can't write again r g m a you can't write again so m a h r g 
,,there are three ways to write down a set what are the three ways description as a description in words you are writing a is a set of odd numbers less than ten or letters of the word wander provinces of sri lanka so these are called sets with description now we'll see the next method listing method as a listing of elements method write the elements of this set given as a description colors of the rainbow can you remember the colors the poem related to colors one fairy came in violet one wore indigo in blue green orange yellow red they made a pretty bow one two three four five six seven seven colors are there letters of the word tenor what are the letters here all letters are different so you have to write all letters t e n o r so you have to separate them with a comma numbers of the figure two three seven five eight what are the numbers two three seven five eight so those are the sets as a listing of elements method now we'll look at the other method how we represent a set in 
,,a venn diagram so the mathematician john ben introduced the elements of sets can be written within closed figure so this is a closed figure so if we draw like this that's an open figure so in a closed figure you can put all the elements so in this set a a e i o u wobbles in a in the english alphabet so you can write all the elements inside the closed figure sometimes we use rectangles to represent the closed figure b 2 3 5 7 11 those are prime numbers so you can write inside a closed figure like this 2 3 5 7 11. that's the other way of representing sets numbers written for 2017 so this is in description method how we write that in listing element method what are the numbers written for 2017 0 1 2 7. that's the listing element method now how we represent that in a venn diagram so you can write 0 1 2 7 inside the closed figure next one multiples of 3 less than 20 so what are the multiples 3 6 9 12 1 2 3 4 5 15 and then 18 21 you can't write so these are the elements belongs to 
,,the set of multiples of 3 less than 2. so how can we represent that in a venn diagram we can write all the elements inside 3 6 9 12 15 18. letters of the word maha baduge what are the letters m a h a you can't write again b a again they are d u g and e those are the different elements so how can we represent this one in a venn diagram you can put all the letters m a h b d u g e letters of the word google what are the letters of the word google g or you can write only once g you can't write 
,,it again l e so that's the listing element method now write all the elements in a closed figure that's called venn diagram method g o l a so we discuss now three ways of representing a set descriptive method listing element method and finally venn diagram method sounds of music so we can say c d e f g a so those are the sounds of music so in english alphabet we use c d e f g a b so you can write those letter c d e f g a space flying elephants do you know i can't identify a set so that's we 
,,can't write the elements so what you call that null set of empty set no elements inside the set so we just draw a blank circle like this no elements inside odd numbers divided by 2 without a remainder do you know any odd number that divided by 2 without a remainder we can't write any elements so here this is also a this is also 
,,an empty set so no elements inside so remember this word empty set sometimes we call null set as well draw correct sign in the cage in front of those can be considered as sets months of a year yes we can identify january february like that provinces of sri lanka here's western southern northern province yes we can identify beautiful flowers we can't say this flower is beautiful or not we can't compare it's difficult to identify days of a week monday sunday tuesday wednesday yes we can identify odd numbers between 10 and 20 yes 11 13 15 like that those odd numbers beautiful girls can you say you're beautiful and you're not beautiful we can't compare so 
,,it's not a set tall man there's no limit to that so we can't identify who are taller people if we say men of people above six feet we consider as taller than you can identify men more than six feet tall yes we can identify that set so this is a set but this is not a students clever at mathematics all are clever so we can't identify the students clever at mathematics so it's difficult it's not a set good people can you identify it's difficult to identify so this is also not a set write the following sets written as descriptions with elements in sets days of school is held in the week what are the days monday tuesday stay thursday and friday numbers less than 20 counting numbers if you take 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 18 19. you can't write 20 because it's less than 20. so these are counting numbers letters of the word bamboo what are the letters b a m you can't write b again oh also you can't write twice rewrite the following sets as a description two four six eight what are those you can say even numbers less than 10 even numbers less than 10. because 10 is not there aeiyou what are those wobbles in the english alphabet vowels in the english alphabet cabbage beans beetroot carrot what are those we can say vegetables mango guava wood apple pineapple you can say fruits names of girls millimeter centimeter decimeter meter decal meter hectometer and kilometer what are those you need soft limp pigeon house sparrow crow honeysuckle mad we can identify as birds seconds minutes hours days weeks months years units of time so these are the elements and this is how we write as a description nymphaea lotus lotus lilies flowers in the water plus minus multiplication sign division operations basic operations in let's now we know how to write down any set as a description as a listing element and as a venn diagram look at this one right the following sets within venn diagram so listing method is given and you asked to put all the elements inside the 
,,closed figure so 0 2 4 6 8 sun moon stars so those are the elements sun stars abcde those are the elements so in the set c you can write inside a b c d d is c d e f 
,,g a b capital letter so this is d means d is a set these are the letters inside c d e f g a c digits in this number so this is descriptive way of writing set now how can we put these digits inside you can put 7 2 8 5 2 not again and 7 not again c a m p u s letters inside f so you can put c a m u s write the sets written in venn 
,,diagrams as a description what can you write for this one this is set p or set a i'll write this one as set a 1 three five seven nine odd numbers less than ten on numbers less than next one p q r is t we can just say letters in the alphabet letters in english alphabet this one 3 6 9 12 15 all are multiples of three multiples of 
,,3 up to 50 up to 15 you can write 15 as well if it's less than 15 you can't write write the following sets with elements countable numbers what are the countable numbers you can put one two three four five 6 7 can we write all it's difficult so what we do you can put three dots to show that it's continuing so write a couple of numbers and put only three dots instead of the rest of numbers letters in the alphabet a b c d and then you can put three dots to show that it's continuing odd numbers one three five seven nine then put three dots even numbers two four six eight three dots to show that it's continuing multiples of eight starting from 8 16 24 32 40 and then put three dots multiples of five 5 10 15 20 and then you can put three dots so write correct mark if it's correct and cross mark if it's incorrect someone is an element of the set of voice yes the name someone means a boy so set of bodies can identify that april is an element of the set of year yeah that's a month x is an element of the set of the single alphabet there's no letter in sinhala alphabet as x so that's wrong 12 is an element of the set of prime numbers is 12 a prime 
,,number no it's wrong red is an element of the set of colors in the rainbow yes that's a color list the elements of the following sets letters of the word carpenter so how can we write the letter c a r p e you can't write again and r you can't write a d so those are the elements of the word carpenter consonants of the english alphabet that means not vowels what are the consonants a b c d e you can't f g h like that so you get lot of letters so we can put three dots you can't write vowels a e i o u prime numbers below 10 what are the prime numbers below 10 2 is the lowest prime number 2 3 5 7 that's all you can't write 11 2 3 5 7. letters of the word potato what are the letters p o t a t you can't write o you can't try odd numbers between 10 and 20. so between means you can't include 10 and 20. so 11 13 15 17 90. those are the odd numbers multiples of 3 between 20 and 30 so 20 what's the multiple of 3 after 20 24 then that's 3 times 8 3 times 9 27 and 3 times 10 30. in between 
,,means you can't write 30 so just 24 and 27. now we'll look at exercise 2.1 place correct sign next to each of the expressions which clearly defined a set and cross sign which do not clearly define a set those who obtain more than 100 marks in the grade 5 scholarship examination held in 2013. so we know the names so specifically 
,,mentioned the year and the marks so we can identify students talented singers it's difficult to identify who are talented singers district of sri lanka we can colombo gold district colombo matra beautiful flowers we can't identify beautiful flowers so that's not a set numbers between 0 and 50 which are multiples of 6. so 6 12 18 we can identify people who are fortunate we can't identify those so that's not a set example number one write the set a is a prime numbers between 0 and 50 by writing all the elements that belongs to a within curly brackets a within curly brackets you write numbers between 0 and 15 all prime numbers 2 3 5 7 then 11 13. so those are the prime numbers then they ask are 1 and 17 elements of the set a when you take one it's not a prime number one is not a prime number so not an element not an 
,,element of x what about 17 17 is a prime number but it's not less than in between 0 and 50. you can write 17 is a prime number but more than 15 so that's also not an element so you can say not an element of a example number two the positive integers that are multiples of three write the elements of b within curly brackets so what you do you write down the set using capital letters and within curly brackets positive integers at multiples of 3 3 6 9 12 15 like that can you write all there's no end to so you can put three dots example number one a set p has been represented here by a venn diagram write down the set p by writing its elements within curly brackets you can write p within curly brackets 1 4 9 16 25 then write p in terms of a common property by which the elements of p can be clearly identified what are those 1 square 2 squared 4 3 squared 9 4 squared 16 square numbers so we can write p is a set we can write square numbers up to 25 because last number is 25 so up to 25 means 25 also included example 2 a is the set of positive whole numbers from 1 to 9. write down the set a in terms of a common property of its elements whole numbers from 1 to 9. so counting numbers 1 2 3 up to 9 we can say counting numbers less than counting numbers less than 10 then the second part write down the set a by listing its elements so what are the numbers one two three four five six seven eight nine represent the set a by a venn diagram so what you do you draw a closed figure like this and then label the set as a and write all the elements inside the closed figure 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 exercise 2.2 express each of the following sets by writing all the elements of each set within curly brackets how can we write days of the week sunday monday tuesday wednesday thursday and friday then how can we write prime numbers between zero and ten prime numbers between zero so two three five seven because you can't write 11 there third one c is the set multiples of 4 between 0 and 25 so you can write 4 four times two eight eight four times three twelve four times four sixty four times five twenty and twenty four so those are the elements in each set d is a set letters of the word diagram next one e districts of the western province what are the districts colombo gumpaha and kaluthara next one f digits 
,,of the numbers 21 412 what are the digits one there two four one two you can't write it again next one g is a set of multiples of 6 from 1 to 10. so 6 is the lowest 
,,one then 12 you can't write so only 6. for the sets defined above state whether the following statements are true or false saturday is an element of a saturday is an element of a yes that's true because the days of the week it's true p is an element of d p is not there so you can't write p so that's false all the elements of c are even numbers so we have to check see all the numbers in c are even numbers yes they are even numbers so that's true fourth one any multiple of 3 from 1 to 10 is an element of g so multiple of 3 from 1 to 10 means 3 6 9. we'll check g 3 6 9 so l 6 is there so you can say any multiple of 3 from 1 to 10 is an element of g it's true question number two express each of the following sets in different form by writing all the elements of each set within curly brackets represent each of these sets by a venn diagram 2. so we'll take p prime numbers less than 10. so you can write 2 3 5 7 how can we represent in a venn diagram you can draw a circle or any closed figure like this and put all the elements inside two three five seven that's p and the second one q colors of a rainbow so what are the colors violet indigo blue 
,,green orange yellow red one two three four five six seven so how can we represent that in a venn diagram you can write all the colors there violet blue green orange 
,,yellow red r will take the third one are letters of the word number letters what are the letters you can write n u m b e r all letters are different so you have to write all so how can we represent this one in a venn diagram we can draw a venn diagram r n u m b e r fourth one whole numbers between 0 and 7 between 0 and 7 means you can't include 0 and 7. so s you can write all whole numbers one two three four five six you can't write seven so when you draw the venn diagram s you can write 1 
,,2 3 4 5 6. then last one t districts of the southern province so t you can write what are the districts and matara those are the districts in southern province so how can you draw a venn diagram for that t is and martha so that's the pen diagram question number three 4 8 12 16 20 represent the set k by a venn diagram so you can 
,,draw a closed figure and label this as k and put inside all the elements 4 8 12 16 20. write down the set k in terms of a common property of its elements by which the elements can be clearly identified what are those 4 8 12 multiples of 4 up to 20 up to 20 means 20 also included multiples of 4 up to 20. question number four the 
,,set x has been represented by a venn diagram here express the set x in a different form by writing the elements of x within curly bracket so listing element method a e i o u and the second part write down the set x in terms of a common property of its elements by which the elements can be clearly identified descriptive way how can you write these are vowels in the english of vowels in the english alphabet question number five represent the set of multiples of 5 between 6 and 25 by writing down a common property by which the elements of the set can be clearly identified that means as a description so we can use any letter set a is multiples of 5 between 6 and 25 and how can you write all the elements of the set within curly brackets five you can't write five because in between 6 and 25 so 10 15 20 25 also you can't write in between means you can't write the first and the last numbers then third one by a venn diagram so you draw a closed figure and label this as a and write down all the elements inside 10 15 and 20. so we covered all theory related to sets so what are the three ways we can represent a set we can represent as a descriptive 
,,way listing element method and venn diagram method so remember when you are writing a set you have to put the elements in curly brackets and you have to put commas in between and also if there are no elements in a set we call those are empty set so practice all exercises in this exercise because you need this section in grade 10 and 11.

Sets,OR7anlalX_g,good day to all grade 7 learners this is your school on air in mathematics 7. i am teacher joanne your teacher in mathematics 7. before we begin make sure that you are in a comfortable place and can clearly hear me in your radio and or see me in your screen have you taken your snacks it is very important that your stomach is full and your body is in good condition so your mind is alert and ready to listen and understand the lesson that we are going to discuss today at this point please get 
,,your module 3 for the lesson problems involving sets i repeat our lesson for today is problems involving sets after listening in this episode you are expected to solve problems using venn diagram a simple way of illustrating set subset and set operation is through a venn diagram in the previous lessons you were taught about these concepts today you will be learning more of its uses but before we proceed to our lesson let's describe the set notation given by the shaded region let us start number one the figure shows elements which belong to set a or set b or to both sets or elements common to set a and set b this is a union b number two elements are common to set a and set b the shaded region is a intersection b number three elements which belong to set a this is simply a or set a number four elements of u that do 
,,not belong to b this is complement of b or b prime and number five elements which belong to set a but which do not belong to set b this is difference of a and b or a minus b there are more interesting lessons ahead stay focused and enjoy learning about venn diagram now in solving problems using venn diagram we have to be familiarized with the terms or words used that can be aid in solving problems we have these four terms union intersection difference and complement if there is a word or then the operation to be used is union for intersection we have the words and or all three for difference if we read the word but not and only meaning take away and for complement if we have two sets neither nor or neither of the three neither one of the three then that is complement sometimes you will encounter the word but not that also means complement there are many simple real life problems that could be solved applying the concepts of venn diagram but this is impossible if you don't have the idea about the setup of this diagram let us explore further how this diagram could solve the many real-life problems let us consider this situation a class of 
,,25 students were surveyed and asked if they have a brother or a sister eight students said they have only a brother six students said they have only a sister another six said they have both a brother and a sister and five said they don't have a brother or a sister let us see the setup of this given problem in venn diagram draw the venn diagram and put up the data needed inside the venn diagram put 6 in the intersection or at the center where two sets overlap because it says in the given problem six said they have both brothers and sisters take note we have the word end therefore it is intersection it said they have brother only put eight in brothers only six said they have sister only put six in sisters only and last is five students said they don't have sisters or brothers meaning they are only child put this data outside the two sets but inside the u remember these illustrations because there are more interesting activities in the next lessons which are related to this concept keep going a simple way of illustrating set subset and set operation is through venn diagram here universal set or u is represented by a simple plane area bounded by a rectangle and its subsets are represented by circles since venn diagrams are visual representations of relationships they are very useful in showing similarities and differences between sets in fact set problems can be better solved using venn diagrams try to look at this example out of 50 students 23 joined mathematics club and 32 joined english club if eight joined in both mathematics and english club how many have joined the english club only how about in mathematics club only how many are neither in mathematics nor in english club in solving set problems it is easier to follow the technique start inside out this is done by putting the common elements first in the center of the two or three overlapping steps most of the time when putting the elements working backwards starting from the last given data helps solve set problems easily let us apply this technique in answering the problem mentioned earlier arrange the given data we have out of 50 students 23 joined the 
,,mathematics club 32 joined the english club eight joined in both mathematics and english club but in start inside out technique the data go this way remember there are three questions to be answered one how many have joined the english club only two how about in mathematics club only and for the last question how many are neither in mathematics nor in english club illustrate the venn diagram of the problem and start filling the diagram starting from the center of two overlapping sets as marked by the arrow then work backward starting from the last given data the last given data here is eight joined in both mathematics and english club put 8 at the center where the 2 sets overlap 32 join the english club subtract 8 from 32 from means you need to write 32 first before 8 that is 32 less 8 equals 24. put 24 in english club only this completes the 32 students 23 join the mathematics club again subtract 8 from 23 that is 23 minus 8 equals 15. put 15 in mathematics club only this completes the 23 students out of 50 students add all the elements who joined the two clubs that is 15 plus 8 plus 24 equals 47 since the total is 47 and not equal to 50 subtract 47 from 50. 50 minus 47 equals 3 put 3 outside the two sets but inside the u this completes the 50 students fill in the venn diagram with all the elements and answer the questions how many have joined the mathematics club only the answer is 15 students joined the mathematics club only number two how many have joined the english club only the answer is 24 students joined the english club only and for number three how many are neither in mathematics nor english club the answer is three students are neither in mathematics nor english club awesome this technique works the next problem will surely excite you a group of 50 students went to a tour 
,,in palawan province out of the 50 students 24 joined the trip to coron 18 went to batahara reef 20 visited el nido 12 made a trip to coron and to bataharif 15 saw to bataharif and el nido 11 made a trip to coron in el nido and then saw the three tourist spots the questions are how many students went to coron only how many students went to tubataharif only how many have joined the el nido trip only and how many did not go to any tourist spots let's answer the given problem by first arranging the given data 50 students went in a tour in palawan province 24 joined the trip to coron 18 went to bataharif 20 visited el nido 12 made a trip to coron into batajar reef 15 saw to bataharif and el nido 11 made a trip to coron and el nido and 10 saw the three tourist spots in solving set problems with three sets you can also apply the technique start inside out make a venn diagram draw three overlapping sets inside the u you can represent the given sets with any letter of the alphabet c represents coron e represents el nido and t represents tubataharif take note use the start inside out technique start feeding the sets from the inside out the last given data here is 10 saw the three two spots put ten at the center where the three sets overlap eleven made a trip to coron and el nido subtract ten from eleven eleven minus ten equals one put one in set c and e this completes the eleven students fifteen saw tuba taharif and el nido subtract 10 from 15 15 minus 10 equals 5 put 5

,,many students did not go to any of the tourist spots the answer is 16 students did not go to any of the tourist spots i hope all of you understood our lesson this day i know you are ready to explore more problems in your module now let's have a recap of what we have discussed today in solving set problems it is easier to follow 
,,the technique start inside out this is done by putting the common elements first in the center of two or three overlapping sets most of the time when putting the elements working backward starting from the last given data helps solve set problems easily if you have questions or clarifications you can message your teacher through group chat messenger or facebook if available be sure that you will finish all the activities in your module so that you can submit on the scheduled time once again one lesson has been done today additional activities are attached to your modules you are encouraged to answer the activities for you to improve your skill in solving problems involving sets be sure to tune in in our school on air every day at scheduled time at dwndfm 88.5 kilohertz or watch on cmd cable television or watch on

Sets,xZELQc11ACY,now let's say if we have set a which contain the elements two four five six and nine and we also have set B which contain the elements two three five six seven nine 
,,and ten so what is the intersection of set a and B how can we get the answer to find the intersection we need to find out which elements are common to both sets so both sets contain a two they contain a five a six and also a nine so therefore the intersection of sets a and B it's two three actually not three but two five six and nine and that's it so that's how you could find the intersection of two sets so now let's work on some more examples you can pause the video and try this one if you want to let me sum different letters so let's say this is set C and I contain the elements 3 4 6 7 and 10 and also set D which contain the elements 3 6 8 & 9 so feel free to pause the video and determine the intersection of sets C and D go ahead and try it so which elements are common to both sets so 3 is common to both sets 6 
,,and that's it so for this particular example it's only 3 & 6 so that's the intersection of the two sets so this is the answer let's try another example let's say set F contains the elements a B C D F G and J and set G contains the elements a C G H and K so what is the intersection between sets f and G so feel free to take a minute and try it so let's see which elements are shared between both sets so both sets contain element a element C G and that is it so the intersection of F and G is going to be a C and G so as you can see finding the intersection is pretty straightforward but now what about this particular example let's say set J contains the elements 5 7 10 and 11 and set K has the elements 2 4 8 and 13 what is the intersection of J and K now notice that there is no common element shared between the two sets the elements and J are completely different from the elements in K so in that case the intersection of J and K is going to be empty there's gonna be nothing inside 
,,so if there's nothing inside if you have an empty set you have a null set so this is the answer you have to use a Greek simple fine now let's say we have set R which contains the numbers 3 4 7 and 10 and set s which is basically an empty set what is the intersection of R and s the intersection of a set with numbers and an empty 
,,set there's going to be another empty set or a null set so that's it for this one now let's focus on a second type of problem that we need to talk about and that is 
,,to find a union of two sets so let's say that set a contains two elements 1 2 3 & 4 and set B contains the elements 3 4 5 & 6 so what is the union of these two sets 
,,I think of Union I think of combining these into a larger set now notice that we do have some common numbers 3 & 4 now the union will contain everything in both sets but 3 & 4 we're not going to write it twice only once so the union of set a and B is going to be 1 2 3 4 5 & 6 so we're gonna write everything in both sets but only write it once so let's try some other examples so let's say set C is 3 comma 5 comma 9 11 and 13 and set D is 2 3 6 8 and 12 go ahead and find a union between sets 
,,C and D go ahead and try that so all we got to do is just write all the numbers in C and E so let's put it in ascending order so we have a 2 of 3 there's a 5 a 6 there's no 7 so we have an 8 a 9 there's no 10 but we have an 11 12 and 13 and so that's it so that's the union of those two sets here's another example let's say that 
,,set J contains the letters a C D and E and that set K contains the letters a B f ing go ahead and determine the union between J and K so just like before all we need to do is write all the letters so we have an a a b c d e f and g and that's it for that question let's say that set x contains the numbers 2 5 8 12 and set Y let's 
,,say is an empty set what is the union of a set with numbers and an empty set well the empty set is not going to add anything it's like saying 15 plus 0 that's gonna 
,,be 15 so therefore the union of set X with an empty set Y is going to be the same as set X this to five eight and twelve it's not going to change but the intersection of a set with something and a set with nothing it's gonna be an empty set so just something to keep in mind now here's a question for you let's say if set a contains the numbers 3 4 5 and 7 and set B contains the numbers 2 4 5 & 8 how can you determine the intersection of a and B and a union of a and B and represent the results using a Venn diagram so circle a and circle B and it's separated form set a contains the numbers 3 4 5 and 7 B contains the numbers 2 4 5 and 8 now the intersection of these two I'm running out of space here is 4 & 5 4 & 5 are found in both but to represent that using Venn diagrams what we need to do is put the two circles together and draw it this way so this is set a and set B so in the middle is the intersection of a and B which contains these elements 4 & 5 now a also contains 3 & 7 & B also contains 2 & 8 but 4 & 5 is common to a and B so we put that in middle now the union of these two sets is basically everything it contains the numbers 2 3 4 
,,5 7 & 8 and I'm running out of space so this entire system with the two circles represents the union of a and B because it contains all the numbers 2 3 4 5 7 & 8 but the intersection is limited by this region here because it only contains the elements common to both sets so hopefully this helps you to see the relationship between intersection of sets and union of sets as a relates to Venn diagrams so that's it for this video thanks for watching and have a good day

Sets,_CG4Ut-kc2w,here's Alex Kenosha what materials did he bring Paris amass activity Neela Sabina protractor ruler pencil calculator and graphing paper pet animals Mary she was asked what colors can be seen in the rainbow Sabina to enumerate them faster just think of the acronym ROYGBIV R stands for red Oh for orange Y for yellow G for green B 
,,is blue I for indigo and V stands for violet C teacher Mike nah man I didn't get my even numbers from 2 to 30 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 these three groups are examples of what we mathematically call sets so what is a sad sad is a well defined group of objects called elements that share a common characteristic so we can call this group the set of math materials brought by Alex for their method DVD consisting of the elements protractor ruler pencil calculator and graphing paper obviously these objects or elements share a common characteristic these are the only math materials brought by Alex so we can clearly see who a no material on talega and invoke dito know bit bit me Alex for their method Eva T therefore this group is well defined again our first set is the set of math materials brought by Alex further method Eva T our second group is also well defined and we call this the set of colors in the rainbow consisting of the elements red orange yellow green blue indigo and violet the same can be said for the third group this is obviously well defined and we can call this the set of all even numbers from 2 to 30 consisting of 
,,these elements now let's try to answer this can we make a set of beautiful features no why because your list may be different from mine your idea of beauty may be different from others hence him people too well defined so we cannot make a set here what about this set of precedents better president in an unknown name organ is Sean long Benza notice in this specific so again condition well defined however if we change it to set of all former and current President of the Philippines ibig sabihin Latin American president a nun filipinas then definitely this is well defined so maha-bhagavata Yan Lang said listing from Emilio Aguinaldo until Rodrigo Duterte 
,,now what about set of our letters but letters of what alphabet usually casts a pug Electra Nakata all entire English alphabet param a Greek alphabet naman @e baba so again this is not well defined perro if we change it to the set of all letters in the English alphabet then this is now well-defined vowel and we can then make a set listing all 26 letters from A to Z so we can learn from all of our examples that what differentiates a set from any group is that it must be well defined now let's try to write or present formally the first three sets we've mentioned here generally we use uppercase or capital letters in naming a set so if we let a be the set of these math materials brought by Alex for their math activity we can just simply write capital a here with an equal symbol and enclose the elements with braces then gal gopinatha lick it off for the second set if we let C be the set of all colors in the rainbow then we just write C equals and enclose the elements again with braces and we do this again for the third set which we can let us at Eve so we just defined set and wrote our sample sets here in math terms we will continue discussing in the next series of videos more topics about sets thanks for watching if you like the video click the like button and don't forget to subscribe god bless you

,,- by even numbers yes so therefore that is an element thanks 7 is 7 an element or not an element of set C and set C I counting numbers so I'm 7 bar I could consider 
,,it as a counting number yes so that is an element next negative 2 is negative 2 an element or not an element of set C a negative 2 bar I guess I'm us among accounting numbers No so therefore this is not an element because negative 2 is an integer next it is an is not an element of set B because it is not an even rather an odd number so I'm eat I hindi esha add number so therefore this is not an element next 3 M 3 bar I element or not an element of set D but I cannot in a set B sub a add numbers so um 3 by at number yes so this is an element and the last one we five-five is blank offset a and fiber I even number no so this is not an element all right let's talk about well-defined set the a no Bernadine Monell among well define or not well-defined example I have here such a the set of primary colors eeny Meeny biome primary colors might be began at end of course we have red blue and yellow so therefore this is considered well defined set set a is a well defined set max set B set of beautiful girls in school okay this example or this set is not considered well defined so this is not a well-defined set why because of the word beautiful okay 
,,so per column bagua Paris offend maganda she say Oh me mass maganda or Paris know Hindi she maganda so ibig sabihin it's not well defined in d mu not in Shama IPP guy nah Perry Perry hotel so ibig sabihin this is not a well-defined set okay mallamma nothing will define sure if the adjective is present in a given set so detour you beautiful that makes the set not well defined so yeah not attend anything next set C set of months in a year so we all know that that is from January to December so this is a well defined set set the set of a popular outdoor so this is again not a well-defined set because of the word popular next e set of excellent singers so 
,,this is also not well defined because of the word excellent what if for me sang Macaulay Gustav on singers I'm Madeleine comenta Paris I own in there so that makes it not well-defined set up percent F we have set of even numbers so even numbers 2 4 6 8 10 so this is I will define set next empty set or a null set a set with no members or elements so hapa gang said more well um members or elements Wallachian Lemann ibig sabihin that is an empty set or an asset Samaritan symbol Nagina gamma John for empty said it looks like a bracket for it now said it looks like a oval with a slash so again we can make use of symbol for empty set and null set what are the examples set of triangles with foresight so set a is the set of triangles with four sides so Marin County but even Placid and triangle is mentally cui if we angle our triangle equilateral triangles isosceles scalene right obtuse triangle acute triangle so Marin Tyagi but if I'm passing and try and get now Marin Bank triangle 
,,Nam my four sites of course wallah so this is an example of empty set or Nelson course of a beginning is in at all give the set of triangles with foresight you just 
,,have to answer empty set or null set next set B is the set of months in the year start with B so Marin bong month name now manga mines the Nexus I'm iliza be voila we only have three a M s.o.b I know n B well a time B so if it's a behind this is also a now set or empty set set C set of all numbers less than zero we all know that a whole number starts with zero so Marin Popham MASMA Bob us a zero voila so the is also an example of empty set or an asset neck's cardinality this refers to the number of elements in a given set so apart engineering in a man I belong peanut bebe Lancome Elana elements that is already cardinality we are already talking about cardinality it is denoted by the symbol small letter n again it must be small how EE this cardinality of set a so it is written as small letter N and then the name of the set enclosed by parentheses again the symbol for cardinality small letter N and then the name of the cell and close by the parentheses so this is an example hey so I have here set a set of primary colors so for set a we have yellow red blue now can t not I know my cardinality because a big number B elements so for the set of primary colors we have yellow red and blue we have three elements right so we will be writing cardinality of set a is equal to 3 so 3 is and number 3 is the number of elements so small letter n the name of the set enclosed by the parentheses and then the number of elements another example school days in a week so for set B we 
,,have Mondays to Fridays so how many elements do we have 1 2 3 4 5 so we have cordiality upset be ignored it is already be because the name of the set is B cardinality of set B is equal to 5 because we have five elements mere entire mood among elements Nana Paula orb sassette B now what if there is no elements in a given cell what will be its cardinality example set of days in a week starts with a Maren bang around an axis in Milazzo a Monday that is M Tuesday Thursday that is T Wednesday is w Friday is a Saturday and Sunday is s so Maren back so a party maintenant cardinality I know some of you will answer and this a or Nancy but this is wrong okay why remember that a final appeal the first two the number of elements you should have written the number pay some illaallah gain at and a number belong come on peanut and on I what are the elements of days in a week starts with a a Tom Petty nothing is a good empty set or now said cassy walla Hanuman illallah gain elements pair oh 
,,come on tonight on oh my cardinality since it refers to the number of elements belong so that button illallah gain a tonight the Heidi nullity upset a is equal to 0 
,,K remember that solely think oh come on T not a known I I know I know among elements you should answer empty set or now said paraffin antimatter know my cardinality

Sets,sgtKab2ynrY,mathematics it isn't as scary or difficult as it sounds but for many it's the subject they absolutely i hate mathematics but i love counting my money okay but however the best thing about maths is that once you get the hang of it it can be your most scoring subject so in today's video i'm going to be sharing with you seven effective tips to tackle mathematics like an expert so let's begin tip number one make time to practice each day if you want to bring high marks in mathematics then hard 
,,work is the key every day make a habit to spend half an hour or one hour on this subject try not to study hours and hours straight this may create stress tip number 
,,two start by solving examples in every maths textbook you will get a lots of example or sample questions for a detailed explanation i have taken my brother's ncrt math textbook the most common mistake we often do is we just ignore the examples and directly start with the exercise questions so friends once you've understood a particular chapter's introduction try to solve each examples without seeing the solution if given and later compare the answers and check where you went wrong so friends through my personal experience 85 percent of question in your maths examination comes from this type of exercise or sample one tip number three clear all your doubts it's easy to get doubts in maths don't let your doubt store in your mind get them cleared as soon as you get one doubt so take help from your teacher your friends your parents your tuition teacher etc just clear your doubts tip number four note down all your formula memorize formula carefully if you can memorize it don't worry just write it on a plain sheet of paper then keep that sheet of paper in front of you whenever you are doing maths i prefer to stick this on my study table even on my wall in a short time a picture of this sheet will be created in your mind and you will be able to solve the problem with a better understanding tip number five review incorrect answers carefully you can learn a lot from your mistake in mathematics review your process where and how did you go wrong checking answers can help you better understanding as well as to increase your confidence level tip number six try to help someone else sometimes explaining a concept to another person can help you understand it more so try to help your friend who is struggling with maths problems which you know very well to solve tip number seven take math seriously and 
,,stay motivated another reason people struggle with maths is that they do not take it seriously they feel it's okay to be bad at maths or just laugh it off so embrace math instead of disregarding it mathematics is not about numbers equations computations or algorithms it is about understanding don't worry about your difficulties 
,,in mathematics always remember the expert in anything was once a beginner so do lots of practice work hard dream big and never give up so that's it all for today's video thank you so much for watching if you found this video helpful make sure to give it a big thumbs up and share it with your friends and for more awesome videos subscribe to my channel and press that bell icon for my latest updates see you in my next video bye

Sets,lv6dC0coQeI,rock and learn Patera hiya Michael what's up my friend Kevin needs a little help studying for his earth science test do you think you could pencil us in for a session well I do know a thing or two about earth science and I hear that you're a real wizard reviewing for science tests thanks Tara kevin is already waiting for us at my super science station before we go Marco Terra boy am I happy to see you I need to get ready for my earth science test glad to help kid earth science is kind of my specialty when you study earth science you'll learn about astronomy geology meteorology and more let's start by talking about our solar system tell me what you know well the Sun is in the middle of the solar system and it provides us with light and heat good good you know anything else there are eight planets that orbit the Sun but I always have trouble remembering their order I know a fantastic way to remember the order of the planets hello who's calling professor who oh you're Kevin's mom he's snack is ready okeydoke here we'll be right there great news Kevin's mom would like to serve us a little snack sounds good to me so Kevin I didn't know that your mother was a professor oh yes she's very educated here you go enjoy oh my what just happened my very educated mother just served us nachos that's it that's the order of the planets huh I see what he's getting at take the first letter of each word in the sentence my very educated mother just served us nachos and now we'll give you the first letter of the name of each planet my mercury Dairy Venus educated mother just served Saturn Uranus Neptune my very educated mother just served us nachos Mercury Venus Earth Mars Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune my very educated mother Venus Uranus Neptune hey that's pretty cool that makes it easy to remember the planets great now back to the solar system Learning Center at my super science station but what about the ah the nachos tough going kid but nachos aren't the only things in life and the planets aren't the only things that orbit the Sun take a look at this wow that's pretty cool Terra what are all these chunks of rock between Mars and Jupiter that is known as the asteroid belt the objects in this area range in size from dust particles all the way up to Ceres which is 900 kilometers in diameter 
,,Ceres is actually considered a dwarf planet because it has a large enough mass to have a rounded shape but as you can see it's not large enough to have cleared its orbit around the Sun by that I mean there are other objects in the same orbit with Ceres all of those other chunks of rock and metal are known as asteroids is Ceres the only dwarf planet now we've got more every so often a group of professional astronomers from around the world meet to assign names to objects in space three dwarf planets they've names are theories Pluto and Eris looks like there's another asteroid belt further out that's called the Kuiper belt whoa what's that that's a common comments a collections of ice dust and small particles of rock most have long oval orbits when they pass near the Sun their ice melts and evaporates people on earth see comets as huge glowing balls with tails made of gas or dust trailing millions of miles behind them all of this is pretty cool but how does it fit into earth science learning about the solar system is important for earth science because what happens in space affects things on Earth for example let's take a closer look at how the Earth and Sun interacted see how the earth goes around or orbits the Sun yeah Marco I remember that from science class it takes a full year for one revolution 
,,around the Sun and that's what causes our seasons explain to me how the Earth's orbit causes the seasons well I know it has something to do with the tilt of the earth but I never really understood that part hmm let me see if I can help when does the Sun feel warmest early in the morning or around noon its warmest around noon correct that's because the sun's rays are more direct around noon in the morning when it's cooler the sun's rays are more indirect so the earth flips back and forth oh 
,,no no no no no no the earth keeps pretty much the same tilt but watch as she moves around the Sun see here the northern hemisphere gets more direct Sun so it is summer there and since the southern hemisphere gets the indirect light it's winter now you've got the idea if we keep moving around until we get over here then it's summer in the southern hemisphere and winter in the northern hemisphere Wow actually seeing it in action makes it easier to understand even take a look at this see how the Earth rotates on its axis it goes around once every 24 hours and that's what causes day and night the parts of Earth facing the Sun or in daylight as the Earth rotates the Sun seems to set in the West Supah I think you've really got a good idea about how things work in our solar system yes take one of these kiddo Tara I don't think it's going to be raining anytime soon inside the science station I wouldn't be so sure he looks like a flash flood we got here whether or not you wanted to brother here at the water cycle and whether learning center will learn how the water cycle affects whether on earth the Sun provides the energy that drives the whole water cycle as the Sun heats water on earth water evaporates into the air as the water vapor cools in the atmosphere it condenses into small water droplets that form 
,,clouds when the water droplets get too heavy they precipitate back to the ground then the water accumulates in aquifers rivers lakes and the oceans and the whole thing can start all over again water turns to vapor by evaporation clouds slowly okay I think I understand how the water cycle works but why does it rain and snow places other than over the water good question we get rain and snow and other precipitation in all kinds of places because the Sun heats the earth unevenly land heats and cools faster than water and we know that it's warmer near the equator than the poles all of this uneven heating keeps it cold and warm air moving and the mix changes in air pressure here's how those air pressure changes cause wind cold air weighs more than warm air so the pressure of cold air is greater when the Sun warms the air the air expands it's lighter cooler heavier air moves to where the warmer and lighter air was in other words will usually blows from areas of a high air pressure 
,,to areas of low air pressure now warm air can hold more water vapor than cold air so as the air gets colder you get condensation and then precipitation there you go 
,,but it is the temperature of the air that determines the kind of precipitation rain happens when drops of liquid water fall on the surface of the earth snow forms when the air is so cold that water vapor turns directly into ice without ever passing through a liquid state if the air is cold enough the snow will fall all the way to the ground otherwise it might melt into rain on its way down sleet refers to water droplets that freeze on their way down through really cold air unlike snow sleet goes through a liquid state before freezing the result is that sley does not light and fluffy Hale is like it mega sweet when it hails large balls of ice fall from 
,,the sky hail forms in a more complex way than sleep as ice crystals start to full wind carries them back up high into the cloud this happens over and over and the crystals grow each time eventually they get too heavy and full hard that's wild Tara I never knew weather could be so complex and that's just the surface kid but it's 
,,enough to get you started those nachos aren't settin so good are you okay she'll be fine but I'm a little worried about us if there isn't I feel much better now uh that's nice but where are we just when we should be in the geology Learning Center this is where we can learn about different kinds of rocks and how they are made take a look at all these layers of rocks little bits of Earth were washed downstream they settle to the bottom of a river lake or ocean layer after layout was deposited on top so they will press down more and more over time the layers turned into a type of rock called sedimentary rock that's right sedimentary rocks make up about three-quarters of the rocks at the Earth's surface sometimes they can give us clues about what the environment was like when those rocks were formed how can they do that well sometimes dead plants or animals get buried in the sediment they get covered up by new layers of sediments and sometimes become fossils some fossils are actually parts of an animal like its teeth or bones that have turned into stone or fossilized others are trace fossils like dinosaur footprints or tunnels made by worms 
,,but most fossils are castes the dead plants and animals decay after the sediment has turned into rock leaving behind a hollow mold salts or other minerals can fill the cast and hold its shape fossils found in the same layer of sedimentary rock are from things that lived around the same time as no layers form on top the fossils get buried deeper and deeper I think I understand so the deeper the fossils are found the older they are you've got it and times large amounts of plants are deposited in sedimentary rocks if they are compressed under a lot of pressure for a long period of time they turn into carbon this gives us coal oil natural gas and petroleum I guess that's why they're called fossil fuels you bet it is and let me tell you fossil fuels are really a gas okay sedimentary rocks make up about three-quarters of the rocks at Earth's surface you got it what about the rest of the rocks what are they glad you asked there are two other kinds of rocks igneous and metamorphic igneous rocks formed when molten rock cools and becomes solid molten rock is called magma when it is below the earth's surface but sometimes magma pushes up through cracks to the surface of the earth then it is called lava we lava cools it becomes a kind of igneous rock called volcanic rocks basalt is the most common type of volcanic rock most of the rocks on the ocean floor are basalt igneous rock can also form when magma cools slowly and becomes hard while it's deep underground rocks that form this way like granite usually have large crystals fossils are not usually found in igneous rocks the heat of a volcanic eruption tends to destroy living things and only rarely preserves any evidence of them however fossils may be found in volcanic ash deposits which are actually a kind of sedimentary rock that makes sense sedimentary rocks are made from sediment and igneous rocks are made when molten rock is cooled but what about metamorphic rocks how do they form good question kiddo metamorphic rocks are rocks that have moved or changed from one kind of rock into another metamorphic rocks were once igneous or sedimentary rocks but movement of the 
,,Earth's crust caused them to change just moving the rocks changes them no try pushing your hands together very hard do you feel heat and pressure yeah when the Earth's crust moves igneous or sedimentary rocks get squeezed by tremendous pressure which heats the rock and pulls them like taffy the original rock is changed by this heating and pulling and it becomes a metamorphic rock as you might guess any fossils that we're in this sedimentary rock will now be in the metamorphic rock but those fossils may be stretched and deformed because of the heating and pooling Baumer metamorphic rocks are the least common of the three kinds of rocks slate and marble 
,,are two examples that really whoa what's this a rock concert as a matter of fact it is ladies and gentlemen please welcome all the way from Little Rock Arkansas Petros I'm sorry males because of rocks man sorry three rounds surprise even though two rocks may be form the same way they can be made up of different kinds of minerals that's right to identify the minerals in rocks scientists use properties like color luster podna s-- and streak look at these I wonder what minerals they are hey if I describe their properties that might help me to identify them Bravo know the color of a mineral is the first thing people tend to notice but be careful most minerals can occur in more than one color luster describes how light is reflected from the surface of a mineral the two main types of luster are metallic and nonmetallic 
,,the hardness of a mineral is its ability to resist scratching the most hardest scale uses ten minerals to rank hardness take a look here a diamond is the hardest naturally occurring substance with a hardness of ten and talc is very soft so it only has a hardness of one that's all good and fine but how can I find out the hardness of the minerals in this box with a little scratching not that kind of scratching we'll use minerals and objects from the Mohs scale if your mineral sample can scratch an object save this penny but it has a higher hardness let's try this one mm-hmm good choice I like the nice metallic luster can it scratch up any looks like it does Marco that means this mineral has a hardness higher than three that's the way to do it now try scratching this quartz nope and look the quartz will scratch my mineral sample so it has a hardness between three and seven we could keep on scratching away with different materials from the Mohs scale to narrow it down even more but I think you get the idea I sure do thanks Terra another way to categorize minerals with a hardness lower than seven is to determine their streak streak does that 
,,mean some of them have racing stripes nah the streak of a mineral is the color of the powder it leaves when you scrape it across a streak plate we know your mineral 
,,has a hardness lower than seven so red that's not what I would have guessed at all don't feel too bad kid science is full of surprises have a look at this table here do any of those descriptions match your mineral let me see steel gray hardness 5.5 to 6.5 rust red streak metallic luster I'll bet this is hematite that's the way to do it great job well kid your earth science knowledge is really building up it looks like something else is building up under my chair that sort of looks like a volcano I guess it was a volcano and just look where it brought us ah the topographic Learning Center this is the perfect place to learn about how the surface of the earth changes seems like a volcano would be pretty good at changing the surface tell me about it kid he's not pimples you know I had a friend do a science fair project on volcanoes she told me there are several types she told you right there are shield volcanoes cinder cones stratovolcanoes and more that's a lot of volcanoes so what's the difference between the types shield volcanoes are built by layer upon layer of lava their eruptions travel great distances from a central event or group events so they have brought the flat rounded shape they kind of look like a shield lying on the ground that's a great way to remember the name but while they may look 
,,"flat from above they can still get pretty tall mano Lowa is the largest shield volcano Mauna LOA's means long mountain but it stands over 13,000 feet above sea level and it rises over 28,000 feet from the ocean floor it would be the world's tallest mountain if it weren't mostly underwater Maui Wowi actually it's on the Big Island of Hawaii the eruptions of shield volcanoes usually don't have much ash and they are fairly safe for scientists to monitor but some other kinds of volcanoes can throw hot ash and cinders into the air these can form a pyroclastic flow which travels very fast and burns almost everything in its path that's the truth the temperature of a pyroclastic flow can reach over 500 degrees Celsius whoa what kind of volcano can do that stratovolcanoes can they are quite beautiful like yours truly but they tend to be tall and symmetric with steep sides a few stratovolcanoes that you might have heard of our Mount Fuji in Japan and in the USA you'll find Mount st. Helens and Mount Rainier in Washington State and Mount Hood in Oregon not organ or red gun those stratovolcanoes really are beautiful what about cinder cones are the little guys you can often find cinder cones on the flanks of shield volcanoes and stratovolcanoes when a cinder cone volcano erupts cinders of lava are blown into the air and fall around the opening of the volcano the pile of cinders forms a small oval-shaped volcano that can grow to about 1,000 feet but some are much smaller many cinder cone volcanoes have a bowl-shaped crater at the opening hey Marco what causes volcanoes in the first place to explain that let's dig a little deeper deeper "
,,into the earth thirties earth is divided into four layers the solid inner core the liquid outer core and the mantle that's the thickest layer and last and least is the crust because it's the thinnest layer the rocky outer crust is made of plates that fit together sort of like on puzzle pieces these plates move a little bit each 
,,year as they slide on top of a weak layer of the mantle this hotter deeper layer of the mantle can be pushed and pulled like putty the whole process is called plate 
,,tectonics the edges of the Earth's plates touch each other as they move the plates may just slide past each other but the plates can also spread apart or even crash 
,,together sometimes when two plates collide large mountain ranges such as the Himalayas are for that happens if the two plates have the same density so they fold as they move together much like two kitchen rugs push together that explains mountains but I wanted to know how volcanoes are formed hold your horses kid if colliding plates have different densities one plate can be forced back down into the deeper regions of the earth that plate can begin to melt when it reaches a depth which is hot enough the molten crust arises back towards the surface where it helps make volcanoes and islands whoo that's a long process is that how all volcanoes are formed well no here's another way as the plates move hot spots under the crust may find weak places in the plates or between two plates that are moving apart this will allow magma to come to the surface from deep within the earth and the result is a volcanic eruption which can add new landmass to existing land or even form new islands okay let me get this straight volcanoes can form where the plates are pushing together where they're pulling apart or anywhere the Earth's crust is weak that's the way the cookie crumbles and the Earth's crust now that you have an idea of how Earth's surface can be built up let's talk about how it can be worn down weathering is the process that causes rocks to crack and fragment since rocks form in different ways and are made up of different minerals they react differently when exposed to temperature changes moisture particles in the air or pressure changes I suppose that means there are different kinds of weathering that's right Kevin one thing that causes weathering is frost when water freezes it has an unusual property unlike most materials that contract when they are cooled water expands when it solidifies into ice this can put incredible pressure on rocks water gets into the pores or cracks of the rocks and then free this so when the water freezes it expands and causes pieces of the rock to break off alright another kind of weathering is abrasion that can happen when rocks rub against each other like when Oh Rock rolls downhill or when it tumbles in rivers winds can cause abrasion to wind sometimes carries dirt or sand that can wear down rocks as it blows against them plants like moss and lichen can wedge their way into pores crevices and cracks in rocks seeds from other plants can get into crevices too as they grow they cause the rocks to crack apart I heard that wetting and drying of rocks can make them break up oh yes the combination of wetting and drying is very effective at breaking up clay but that's because clay swears when it gets wet and then shrinks and crumbles as it does oh I get it the process of wetting and drying only weathers some kinds of rocks sometimes rocks break down because the minerals they are made of react with chemicals in water or air for example carbonic acid is created when carbon dioxide dissolves in water and this acid can dissolve limestone and eventually cause the formation of caves and caverns ooh look at the stalactites and stalagmites you're a regular little spelunker 
,,huh stalactites hold tight to the ceiling of the cave and stalagmites might reach the ceiling someday what a smarty now erosion is simply the moving of sediments or 
,,rock particles moving water is the most powerful force of erosion on earth the world's rivers deliver about 20 billion tons of sediment to the oceans each year that's a lot of erosion and that's why you can see fan-shaped Delta's at the mouths of some rivers such as the Nile v-shaped valleys canyons and gorges are also carved by streams and rivers flowing through the mountains moving air or wind is another important mover of sediment especially in dry regions when tiny sand grains are lifted and carried by the wind they can sculpt rocks into a variety of shapes sand dunes are hills of sand deposited by the wind such as those at Great Sand Dunes National Park in Colorado but of all the things that cause erosion my favorite is a glacier glaciers form when snow piles up over time and turns to ice the glacier begins to flow outwards and downwards under the pressure of its own weight like great rivers of ice glaciers have sculpted mountains and carved out u-shaped valleys Valley glaciers flow down valleys and continental glaciers such as the ones on Greenland and Antarctica flow outward in all the directions glaciers reshape the underlying and surrounding landscape as they move by eroding rock from one place and depositing it in another that's called deposition glaciers rivers and wind are major forces of deposition that can build up the earth in some places and I think I've got the scoop on erosion erosion is when the earth is worn down it can happen because of water wind or ice that's right kid weathering and erosion work together to reshape the surface of the earth water and cracks of rocks can turn to ice in the winter and 
,,make the cracks bigger over time bits and pieces of the rock break off and fall away winds can pick up these small bits and we're down weaker parts of rock rain can 
,,watch the small bits away over time these processes can work together to leave interesting formations such as the arches in Utah or the hoodoos in bryce canyon canyons look like fun places I'd like to travel to see them someday well right now we need to travel to our next learning center right this way Wow hey wait Marco I think my chair ran out of gas ah it looks like we need an alternative energy source don't worry balance this on your head okay but how will this solar panel help we're indoors just our way to see hiya boys I see you used a perpetual resource to get here perpetual resource yep a perpetual resource is one that cannot be affected by human use perpetual resources are also called inexhaustible resources they include things like solar energy that can be converted into electricity solar energy can also be used to heat water or air for homes and businesses sounds like we should use solar energy for everything well solar energy is very dependent on the time of day the time of year and the weather so in order to be efficient a large surface area is required to collect the energy from the Sun but scientists are working on ways to get around that hmm is solar energy the only perpetual resource oh no there's always the wind remember that the wind is caused by uneven heating of Earth by the Sun so it's an indirect form of solar energy the wind blows stronger and more consistently in some areas wind turbines and wind farms can be built in those places to convert the wind energy into electricity and there's also geothermal energy heat from the earth can be used to make steam or hot water to heat buildings or generate electricity some scientists are even looking at ways to utilize the oceans to produce energy for us without causing any environmental damage they've come up with a few ways of tapping the energy from tides and we might even find a way to use temperature differences in the ocean to produce energy in some regions the surface water can be 40 or more degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the deep water so perpetual resources includes solar wind geothermal and ocean energy what other kinds of resources are there glad you asked kiddo there are renewable resources and non renewable resources I've heard of renewable resources they can be replenished as fast or faster than we use them that's true but the problem is that usually the demand for resources like wood crops soil and water increases over time if the demand gets too high these resources cannot be replenished fast enough we have to be careful and keep things in balance that does sound like a good thing to do and what about non-renewable resources I guess those can't be replenished at all when they're gone they're really gone non-renewable resources like a natural gas oil and coal that we get from 
,,fossil fuels will eventually run out if we keep using them energy efficiency and conservation are so important we need to make non-renewable resources last as long as possible while we are looking for new alternatives energy efficiency is the use of technology to perform the same function with less energy like putting tinting on your windows to keep out the sunlight that heats up buildings in the summertime no that's to make it look cool energy conservation is any behavior that causes us to use less energy like turning off lights when they're not being used exactly Kevin and by using energy-efficient light bulbs you can save a lot on your electric bill another way to conserve energy is by insulating and weatherizing homes and buildings that way you use less air conditioning and heating you can also save on heating and cooling by placing trees shrubs or other landscaping to block the wind and provide shade but we can conserve other resources besides just energy such as wood and water there are many ways to help save water around the house it turn off the water while you're brushing your teeth take short showers instead of Bath's and be sure to fix any leaks I worked with my mom to convince the people in our neighborhood to find a garbage service that recycles we separate out plastic glass aluminum cans and paper for recycling excellent by recycling you are not only conserving resources but you are also helping to keep unnecessary garbage out of landfills yeah thanks for helping to keep the earth a cleaner place to live kiddo you're welcome Tara and thanks to both of you for helping me study earth science I'm ready to ace my test I'm so proud of you well I should be getting back home Marko I'm ready to teleport okey-dokey huh hey science fans to quiz yourself on earth science you can download a practice test at my website just visit w-w-w that mark or the pencil dot-com show now that we've reviewed some of the material from earth science let's see 
,,how well you might do on the practice test for those of you following along you might want to use pause when the question first comes up to see if you can choose the right answer before Kevin let's begin with some questions about this solar system one look at the diagram of our solar system below what is the name of Planet 5 oh 
,,yeah mark oh my very educated mother just that starts with J Jupiter that's answer B fantastical sometimes you might be asked to fill in your answer right on the page with the questions but this test has a separate answer sheet be sure to ask your teacher how you're supposed to might the answers on your test let's put the test over the answer sheet just under the question we are answering that way we can make sure we fill in the right bubbles to which objects in our solar system have long tails when they are close to the Sun and are made mostly of rock and ice a planets be asteroids see dwarf planets d comets the only one of these things I remember having tails are the Comets you'll have a great memory our answer is d3 what causes day and night on earth a the Earth orbits the Sun na earth orbiting the Sun combined with the tilt of the Earth's axis is what gives us seasons not day and night B the moon orbits the earth the moon orbiting the earth causes the tides to rise and fall on the earth but it doesn't cause day and night C the Earth rotates on its axis I think this is the right answer right - you are see the Sun that lights up half of the earth the parts that are in the sunlight are experiencing a day the parts that aren't in the sunlight are experiencing at night and if we could look down at the earth from the North Pole we would see that the earth is rotating counterclockwise so the Sun seems to come up in the east and set in the West maybe I should check this last answer just to make certain C is the best choice good thinking Kevin D the Sun orbits the earth that's ridiculous everyone knows that the Sun doesn't orbit the Earth that means our answer is C the Earth rotates on its axis let's move on to questions about the water cycle and whether for what supplies the energy to drive the water cycle can you remember what I told you I remember Terra you said the energy source that drives the whole water cycle is the Sun you are really starting 
,,to get on my good side okay so our answer is a Sun good job now let's see if you can get this next one five the picture shows a place where air currents will form due to the uneven heating of the earth in which direction will air currents most likely move let's see warm air rises and the cool air will come in to replace it so a 
,,from the lake toward the land looks right but let me check all the answers be straight up above the lake no that's not right see from the land toward the lake that's backwards D all of the above that can't be right so our answer is egg I'm glad that you look at all of the answers carefully some students make the mistake of choosing all of the above every time it's an answer choice not our boy he's too smart to do something like that ah thanks Terra now do you remember anything from the geology Learning Center I sure do sedimentary rock is formed in layers and the deeper the layers the older they are they ought to make this next question pretty simple six the rock column above shows the layers in a sedimentary rock formation the three core samples to the right were taken from the rock column on the left according to this information which fossil is the oldest well the deepest layer is layer one so it is the oldest since the fossil on the bottom of core sample X came from layer one it is the oldest fossil so the answer is C let's see if you can get the answer to this next to geology question seven why are most fossils found in sedimentary 
,,rocks let me read through the answers a fossils can be distorted in metamorphic rocks that's true you bet it is metamorphic rocks are made by pressure and heat on other types of rocks that could really mess up any fossils in the rock well let's look at all the answer choices be igneous rocks were too hot when they formed considering that igneous rocks were made of molten rock I'm sure they were too hot to preserve any fossils what about C sedimentary rocks are best for preserving organisms 
,,this one's also true so the answer must be d all of the above you're a real gem we'll take a look at one more geology question 8 the chart below shows part of Mohs hardness scale for minerals a student is testing an unknown mineral for hardness the unknown mineral is tested against fluoride but neither mineral scratches the other which of the following conclusions can the student accurately make if the unknown mineral didn't scratch fluorite and fluorite didn't scratch the unknown mineral they both must have a hardness of 4 keep that in mind while we look at the possible answers a the unknown mineral and orthoclase will not scratch each other ortho Clay's is harder than fluorite so orthoclase would scratch the unknown mineral a is wrong be the unknown mineral will scratch calcite that's true yep calcite is lower on the hardness scale but let's not be too hasty read the last to answer choices see the unknown mineral will scratch orthoclase that's the exact opposite of what would happen d the unknown mineral will not scratch gypsum that doesn't seem right no way gypsum is even lower on the hardness scale than calcite so our answer is beep 
,,this kid has a mountain of information in his head you think so let's see if he remembers what was said about Earth's changing topography 9 mountains may be formed when a volcano's erupt that's true some of the volcanoes even have the word mount in their name like Mount Fuji but I remember that mountains are formed other ways too let me check the rest of the answers B plates of the Earth's crust collide that's true too Terrace said the Himalayas were formed that way great memory kid hmm see says both a and B and D says none of the above so I'm gonna have to say that C is the right answer perfecto 10 which of these processes can be caused by movement of the Earth's plates let's see the highest mountain range in the world the Himalayas were formed by plates colliding and the islands of Hawaii were formed because of 
,,a plate moving over a hot spot some of those Islands still have volcanic eruptions that makes all of the answers true so our answer is it D all of the above let's see what you remember about weathering and erosion 11 moving water was the most important factor in forming which of these a sand dunes at Great Sand Dunes National Park no Tara said those were formed by wind be the Grand Canyon I'm pretty sure that was formed by a river although I don't know what the name of the river is that would be the Colorado River see the Andes Mountains from what we discussed mountains are built from volcanic eruptions or plate tectonics not moving water you've got a 
,,good head on your shoulders kid D Kilauea volcano that's made out of flowing lava not moving water so the answer is B the Grand Canyon nice work whoo that's a nice picture I'd like to go there someday and the men at the bottom of the picture gives you some perspective as to how large the arch really is all right all right let's 
,,get down to business read the question please 12 the landform below is an arch found in Arches National Park in Utah which type of weathering or erosion is not responsible for shaping this arch here's one of those questions that has to be read carefully the word not makes a big difference in the answer I'll choose let's see Tara talked about the combination of water ice weathering and wind all playing a part in forming arches so I think the answer is a glaciers because glaciers did not help shape the arch right you are you're a smart kid so let's see how bright you are when it comes to energy and resources available on earth no problem thirteen which of the following is a renewable resource a tree that's renewable as long as we don't use them faster than new trees can grow I think this is the answer but I'll check them all to be sure I'm so glad you have good test taking skills be natural gas that's a non-renewable resource see solar energy ah this is one of the perpetual or 
,,inexhaustible resources you told me about not a renewable one no matter how much we use the perpetual resources they'll always be around D oil no that's a fossil fuel all fossil fuels are non-renewable resources so the only renewable resource here is the tree that makes the ants at a 14 watering plants and grass in the early morning is one way to conserve water why a plants only absorb water in the morning no plants can absorb water any time of day take a look at the next one okay Marco be 
,,less water evaporates into the air in the cool morning this leaves more water for plants to absorb and allows shorter watering times that's true sea water used in the morning can be recycled in the evening that doesn't make sense if some sort of system is in place to catch unused water to be recycled it can be used anytime not just in the morning D water is more pure in the morning this one doesn't make sense either I guess that means you're sticking with answer B then yep and now for the last question 15 which of the following is not a way to help conserve energy a plant trees in the landscaping around buildings the trees wood provides shade from the 
,,Sun and help to block wind which would help with cooling and heating bills but the question is asking which one is not a way to conserve energy how about B turn off 
,,machines when they're not being used that's definitely a way to conserve energy check the next one sure thing Marco see both a and B no those are both good ways to conserve energy so that means our answer must be D take lots of bubble baths Wow you did a great job on this practice earth science test I agree nice work hey science fans you can download this earth science test at my website just visit www.marsianstudio.webs.com you

Sets,BjJEq2RX2ac,hello everyone welcome back to deb tv i am ms dj and i'm going to be your study body for today with a joyful heart and an empowered mind and spirit learn along with 
,,me and let's be mad kaling so now bring out your pen and your self-learning module as we demystify the mathy magical world of sets in today's episode we are going to learn a whole bunch of things about sets but first let us answer these pre-assessment questions you have three seconds to answer each question timer one which of the following is a well-defined set a a set of beautiful sceneries b a set of good basketball players c a set of philippine presidents d a set of successful leaders timer the correct answer is letter c a set of philippine precedents second question which of the following is a symbol of a null or an empty set timer the correct answer is letter d that is the symbol for a null or an empty set third question which symbol is used to indicate the intersection of sets timer good job the correct answer is letter a this is the symbol to indicate the intersection of sets fourth question the following is a subset of set r which contains the letters n e and w except a the set containing n e w b the set containing e c the set containing 0 d the set containing e and w timer so what is your answer perfect the correct answer is letter c for our fifth and last p assessment question which of the following set has the cardinality equals to 5 is it a set a is the set of counting numbers less than 
,,5 b set b is the set of letters in the word racer c set c is the set of positive multiples of five or d set d is the names of the fingers timer the correct answer here is letter d since this set has five elements which are used to name the different fingers in either hands we will explore more on cardinality of sets later triangles have been regarded as a symbol of the trinitarian belief by christians while a filipino song entitled tatsulok originally performed by booklot and popularized by bamboo has politically used it to symbolize inequalities in our society now how do we describe a triangle first it has three sides it has three interior angles whose sum is always equal to 180 degrees and its shape is recognizable as one with the base and opposite it is a vertex of the triangle which for certain types of triangle is referred to as its index in this collection which does not belong to the group correct the artworn out is the four-sided figure placed on the fourth spot now what is the term used for the collection of objects or quantities in mathematics a well-defined group or collection of objects that share the same characteristics is 
,,called set the objects found in the set are called elements a set can be using capital letters from a to z and we use braces to group the elements of the set separated by commas if a set contains many elements we often use t dots called ellipses note that in listing the elements in the set each distinct element is listed once and the order of the element does not matter this means that a set can be written in different order but shall pertain to the same set like in set j which are the letters in the word idol this set is the same as set j which contains l o d i to understand what makes sets well defined let me give you some examples first set m is the set containing primary colors and we read this as set m contains the elements red yellow and blue second set s is the set of letters in the word sipnayan set s contains the element s i p n a and y and set e is the set of all even numbers thus set e contains the elements 2 4 6 8 and so on here on the other hand are not well-defined sets the set of famous dancers the set of honest people the set of punctual students in your class why because our view of fame honesty and punctuality may be subjective so we could come up with different lists of famous or honest or punctual people as my way to confirm that you have learned something from our discussion let us answer the following questions match the descriptions in column a with the word or words being described in column b write your answer in the space provided number one these are the objects contained in the set the correct answer is letter e elements are the objects contained in the set number two a well-defined group or collection of objects that share common characteristics that is letter b set is a well-defined loop or collection of objects that share common characteristics number three it is represented by three dots which is used to indicate that a set has many or infinite elements the correct answer is letter c ellipsis ellipsis is represented by 3 dots which is used to indicate that a set has many or infinite elements number four a symbol used to group the elements of a set the correct answer is letter 
,,d the brace symbol is used to group the elements of a cell now you shall go deeper into sets and relationships in sets but first let us add the following words to our vocabulary to be able to express ourselves concisely and proficiently in the language of sets the words are subset universal set empty set cardinal number of sets 
,,and disjoint sets let me give you a complete example the given is set a contains the number 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10. from this we need to find one the set of odd numbers two the set of all factors of ten three the set of multiples of four and four the set of negative integers let's say in this case a is the universal set if you form another set from set a say set o consisting only of the set of odd numbers from 1 to 10 then we can say that set o is a subset of set a please take note that the set is a subset of another if each of the element of the former is an element of the latter again using the same set a let's say we have two more sets that are subsets of set a this are set o and set b we see here that sepsis and set b are disjoint sets because they do not have elements in common how about number four in the given problem can we draw out negative integers from our given set set a okay none the empty set or null set is denoted by a circle slashed with a slant line in the middle did you know that you can insert this symbol in microsoft word by typing 2205 alt x that's awesome right and lastly the cardinal number of a finite set a is the unique counting number n such that the elements of set a have one-to-one correspondence with the elements of the set one two three ellipses up to n for example set 
,,a contains a e i o u this only means that the cardinality of set a here is five therefore if we were to answer number five in our p assessment earlier which of the following set has the cardinality equals to five is set a set a is the set of counting numbers less than 5 set b is the set of letters in the word racer set c is the 
,,set of positive multiples of five or d set b is the set of names of the fingers what is the correct answer yes very good d is the correct answer unlike the other sets the cardinality of set d is five set a has four elements that is set a contains the elements one two three four set b has also four elements because although razer is a five letter word the element r must only be written once thus set b has elements r a c e on the other hand the third set set c has infinite elements thus its cardinality is not also equal to 5. option b has a total of 5 elements namely thumb index finger middle finger three finger and pinky to completely grasp this concept let us have more examples in this activity we need to find the cardinality of the following sets set r is the set of letter in the word difficulty to solve it you need to list down all the letters in the word difficulty regardless if the letter repeats set r contains the elements d i f c u l t and y therefore the answer is n of r is equal to 8 set m is the set of odd numbers between 1 and 3. 1 and 3 are consecutive odd numbers and there are no more odd numbers between them so set m has no 
,,elements and the answer is n of m is equal to zero set k is the set of counting numbers less than five to solve you need to list down all the numbers less than five 
,,so k contains the elements one two three four therefore the answer is n of k is equal to four alfred whitehead once said to see what is general in what is particular and what is permanent in what is transitory is the aim of scientific thought as a philosopher mathematician he believes your knowledge of the particular facts of the world around you is gained from your very own sensations we use sets and its related concepts in other fields at this point we will answer the following questions 
,,to evaluate what you have learned about sets are you ready citrix it in a minute can you try answering the following for just a minute select the letter that corresponds to the correct answer timer first question which of the following is a well-defined set a a set of good writers b a set of factors of ten c a set of fashionable actresses in our country number two which of the following is a symbol of null set look at your screen for the options number three michelle listed the set of letters of survival as shown in your screen what is wrong with the set a it uses commas b it uses braces c some objects in the list are not listed once or d a lowercase letter is used to represent the name of the set question number four given the set of letters in the word love what is the cardinality of the set a 11 b a c 6 or d four let's check your test be precise and truthful okay the correct answers are number one b a set of factors of ten is the well-defined set since as we used in one of our example it has shared characteristics its elements are 1 2 5 and 10. number two the correct answer is d a symbol for null set is a circle slashed with a slant line in the middle number 3 c is the set that is wrong because some objects in the list are not listed once for number 4 the correct answer is d 4 is the cardinality

Sets,fKhMPlheUoc,hey friends we know that it's that time of the year it is the exam time if you have to study for an upcoming exam but you have less time for preparation don't worry 
,,follow these five amazing simple tips and tricks to study well and score highest marks in your exam let's get started number one plan your study time one cannot study the entire syllabus and notes a day before the exam so don't leave it to the last minute start your exam preparation and revision at least one month or 20 days before your exam date also create your own revision dynamical for your exams it motivates you to use your time effectively number two keep only the things you need while studying generally it happens that students take their mobiles laptops etc along with them while studying which constantly distract them you should never keep such devices while studying it affects your concentration and you end up wasting your time but if you are using it for your study purpose then mute the notifications and block those websites which keep on distracting you don't forget to keep your water bottle some snacks writing utensils etc number three create your own notes some of you might learn better with paragraphs of notes and some of you might learn with better diagrams and flowcharts when you start your notes preparation take out your material and a rough book read a topic thoroughly and highlight the important points next write the heading and make pointer sentence to learn easily to make it simpler you can use bullet points numberings special symbols etc tip number four test yourself once you have studied and completed a chapter or even a question answer prepare your own question paper first read the material and make your own multiple choice questions short answers fill in the blanks and long answers next close your 
,,study materials or keep them aside promise to yourself that you want cheat or copy now start answering to your own question paper once you are done imagine that you 
,,are an examiner and start correcting your answer find out the mistakes and errors you have made this is an amazing technique to motivate yourself and memorize the information thoroughly tip number five analyze the previous year's question papers sample papers help students to analyze their strengths and weakness so that they can focus on weak areas to improve their results mortal papers can be easily available in online you can just google it then download it and get printouts practicing from the sample and previous year's papers is the best way that's it all for today's video i hope these five tips and tricks will help you out to tackle your exams if

Sets,aAOlr3RGyZQ,hello in this video we will go over a set theory one of the important topics discussed in seventh grade or class seven of your school math program alright so with that said let's get started what is a set so said is nothing but a collection of distinct objects at the same time but the thing is that it's denoted by curly braces as shown here for example I have a set a which consists of a finite set of five elements one two three four and five the natural numbers the way you did note that an 
,,element that a particular element of the set is denoted by the Greek letter epsilon the other for example the number six is not an element of a is nothing but a strike over the epsilon notation or when an element is not part of the set okay a few properties associated with sets a set can be finite or infinite an example of an infinite infinite set excuse me is the set of natural numbers right because you start with one two three all the way up to infinity so another example is a set of real numbers that's an infinite set as well syenite said of course you can count the number of elements in it that's a finite set all the elements of a set are unique they have to be distinct and must be you know and all be at the same time an empty set is nothing but a set with zero elements in it and it's notated by open and closed curly braces as well as and the zero notation here that is a variant of zero and it's not related to the Greek letter Phi the number of elements in a set is called the cardinality of a set for example in as we saw previously the cardinality of a would be 5 and it's denoted by this so getting more into the details let's look at what is a union and intersection a complement and a universal set so first off in this example we have two sets here set a consists of the numbers 1 2 3 4 & 5 and set B consists of 4 5 6 7 there are two numbers here 8 & 9 which are neither in 8 nor in B so the union of a and B is determined by all the elements of a as well as all the elements of B so the union which is denoted by the symbol here it's of course all the numbers of elements in a and all the elements in B search 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 
,,since they are supposed to present a set is distinct consist of distinct elements we do not repeat 4 & 5 even though they fall in both a and B now what is the intersection of a and B the intersection of a and B denoted by an inverted U is in the elements which are common to both a and B in this example it's 4 & 5 so that's the intersection of a now what's a compliment now complement is denoted by this symbol a bar and it is all the elements that are not in a so all the elements not in a are 6 7 8 9 please note you also include the elements 8 9 as I'll come come back to that when I discuss universal scent right now so looking at a universal set Universal set is nothing but all the elements that we're looking at so not just the elements in the set a B but also the elements outside of a and B so the universe in this 
,,case then says off 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 as well as 8 9 so a bar is all the elements within the universe here that are not in the set a that is why we get 6 7 8 & 9 they are all within the universe but they are not in the set I hope that was clear enough funand topic to discuss is subsets as let's take a look at this example here right 
,,we have three sets set a consists of 1 2 3 set sequences of number 7 and set B consists of 1 2 3 4 5 6 & 7 so in this case a the subset is denoted by this notation horizontally with a bar under it and as I said a is a subset of B when the intersection of the two sets it equals a as well as the cardinality of the intersection is 
,,8 so in this example the intersection of a and B is nothing but the set a as well as the cardinality of the intersection is also a so that qualifies said a to be a subset of B in the similar fashions said C which consists of the number seven is also a subset of B because every element of C is in B and the cardinality of the intersection of C and B which is nothing but the number seven is also the set C and that's how we determine if is a subset of another another variation of a subset is what is called a proper subset or a strict subset it is denoted by this notation here and horizontal you if you would with no bar sign so what is a proper subset a proper subset is when every element of a is in B but there are some elements of B like these 4 5 6 7 which are not in a so there should be at least one element in B which is not any and that's when becomes has proper subset of B all right that was exhaustive enough hope you enjoyed this particular video if you did please give your 
,,thumbs up as well as subscribe to our Channel looking forward to talking to you soon thank you so much bye-bye

Sets,VBzlvKP-2yI,types of sets empty set singleton set finite set infinite set equal sets equivalent sets universal set subset proper subset superset proper superset powerset empty set a set with no element this is the symbol of an empty set let's name it set e another way of writing that is using the symbol the null set the cardinality of set e is equal to zero this notation simply means the number of elements singleton set assert with one element set s is a singleton set the cardinality of set s is one finite set a set with limited elements example set F is a set of counting numbers less than 6 the elements of set F are 1 2 3 4 5 the cardinality of set F is 5 infinite set a set width and limited elements example set n is the set of counting numbers the element subset n are 1 2 3 and so on the cardinality of set n is infinite equal sets two sets are equal if they have the same elements example set E is a set of letters in the word earth the element subset e r e a R th set H is a set of letters in the word heart the elements of set H are H E a R T set E and set H have the same elements they are equal sets set e equals set H equivalent sets equivalent sets have different elements but have the same number of elements example given set F and set H the cardinality of set F is 5 and the cardinality of set H is 5 the to sets have different elements but they have the same number of elements set F is equivalent to set H Universal set Universal set is the set containing all elements at 
,,which all other sets are subsets the universal set is represented by a capital letter you example let u be the universal set set u is the set of all flowers in the English alphabet all other sets are subsets of the universal set set a is a proper subset of set you set B is also a proper subset of set u all the elements of sets a and B are also found in the universal set another example set U is a set of counting numbers sets a B and C are proper subsets of set u because a universal set contains all the elements in a particular problem subset set a is a subset of set D if and only if every element in a is also an element in B here's an example list of the possible subsets upset a number-one asset with three elements two three four sets with one element five six seven sets with two elements in number eight is an empty set how many subsets does set a health to find the number of subsets use this formula two to the power of n where n is a number of elements the cardinality of set a is 3 so 2 to the power of 3 is just 2 times 2 times 2 equals 8 proper subset set a is a proper subset of set B if there is at least one element in B not contained in a in symbol set a is a proper subset of set B example given sets a B C and D set B is a proper subset of set a set C is a proper subset of set a set D is a proper subset of set a list all the proper subsets of set a set one to three have two elements sets four five six have one element and number seven is an empty set the set itself is not a proper subset of set a how many proper subsets does set a half since the set itself is not a proper subset the formula is 2 to the power of n minus 1 where n is the number of elements the cardinality of set a is 3 using the formula to ^ 3 minus 1 equals 8 minus 1 is 7 supper set supper set is a set containing all of the elements of another set symbol set a is a supper set of set B this is just a reverse of subset proper superset set a is a proper supper set of set B if set a is a superset of set B and set a is not equal to set B in symbol set a is a proper superset of set B given set a and set B well set B is a proper subset of set a 
,,set a is a proper superset of set B power set the set of all the subsets of a set what is the power set of set s EO Bess contains all the subsets of set s how many elements does the power set of set s have since the power set contains all the subsets of a given set it follows the formula two to the power of n where n is the number of elements so the number of elements of the OBS is two to the power of three which is equal to eight

Sets,MEYWV5gguAQ,hello children today i'm here to teach you chapter 2 in your textbook that's called sets so in this lesson we are trying to identify sets identify the elements of a 
,,set and we are talking about listing the elements that belong to the set and also about venn diagrams look at this one some of the items in a bag of necessities bought home in written the circle there are common features to this cluster of items what can you see beetroot go to color cabbage beans those are vegetables but when you look at these vegetables we can again divide these into three sections categories we can divide into yams green leaves and other categories we'll try to do that beetroot but it's a yeah so we can write beetroot inside this gaucho cola go to color it's a green leaves cabbage we can say other categories beans that's other categories carrot is it yeah kanku it's a greenlee also a greenlee potatoes yes eggplant we can say other categories and bitter gourd is also other categories so we got other categories so here these are groups we can identify so we'll look at another example there are several transport vessels within the circle ship bus aeroplane train boat took to so categorize them into three groups how can we categorize vehicles on land vehicles in the sky vehicles on water ship you can say vehicles on water 
,,bus vehicles online aeroplane vehicles in the sky train here and boat on water took took car bicycle and helicopter here and lorry also here so here vehicles also we can categorize into these three groups above vehicles are categorized according to the common features now we'll look at some more examples now look at this one appearing in the circle line integers now these are numbers categorize them as follows according to their common features by looking at the number odd numbers you know 
,,odd numbers are not divisible by 2 1 3 5 7 one three five seven nine even numbers what are even numbers they are two four six eight ten multiples of three what are multiples of three three times one three three times two is six three times three nine three times three nine and triangular numbers what are triangular numbers that 
,,you can make a triangle so one what's the next triangular number three then what's the next one one two three four five six six plus four again ten those are triangular numbers and multiples of five five times one five five times two ten so we can categorize these numbers 1 to 10 into these groups now when you're categorizing materials or various features what are the things we need to check sometimes color sometimes shape non-material solid liquid air or material or non-living things so by looking at any characteristic we can divide into several groups so that's what we are doing in this lesson grouping items or numbers into several categories write all the numbers odd numbers between 10 and 20 within the curly brackets so what are the odd numbers starting from 10 11 13 15 90. so those are the odd numbers in between 10 and 20. look at this example you have given 1 to 15. write down even numbers below 15 within the curly brackets what are your numbers 2 4 6 8 10 12 14. those 
,,are even numbers then write down multiples of 5 up to 15 up to 15 means you can take 15 as well but these are multiples of 5 yes 15 also considers 5 10 15. those are multiples of 5. write down the triangular numbers up to 15. so what are the triangular numbers now you know 1 1 plus 2 3 3 plus 3 6 6 plus 4 10 10 plus 5 50. you can write 15 as well write down prime numbers up to 15 within the curly brackets prime numbers what's the smallest prime number that's 2 2 3 5 7 then 11 13 so that's all so these are prime numbers so we can categorize these set of numbers into several groups can you write the name of children clever at mathematics in your class can you do that all are good in maths i can't divide children according to their ability like that some children do algebra very well some do geometry very well so all are clever so we can't identify the group so this is not i did can you write the names of children obtain more than 80 marks for the mathematics i can do that so i 
,,can look at your marks and those who are above 80 i can write their names yes can this is identifiable can you write what the melodies songs are we can't do that it's difficult not identity can you write what films are good can you do that you like films related to children we like different films so we don't know which films are good so not identifiable it will be obvious to you that there are both clusters that can be and cannot be precisely written separately what is considered as sets are the groups or clusters so what are sets sets are the groups or clusters those can be precisely separated so we'll see more examples in this lesson so what are the characteristics of a set a set is made of material or non non-material things objects of a set are called lv months so you are learning a new term elements of a set then elements of set are written within curly brackets and elements of a set should be written with a comma after each element and no element is written more than once so think about letters in maharagama if it's so you can't write m twice a here four times five times one two three four five but you are writing a only one so what are the letters if if we don't consider the capital n simple m is one letter m a h r g m you can't write again and a you can't write again so remember all these characteristics of a set the set of fingers of ana can we identify yes we can thumb index finger middle finger ring finger and small finger so appearing above is a set consisted of material elements you can touch it and you can identify that's called material the set of your most preferred subjects to study it can be maths science history english so those are called non-material elements so you can't touch it so you should be able to identify what are material elements and non-material elements elements in a set should be easily identified from each other the set of vowels of the english alphabet what are the vowels in the english alphabet e e i so you 
,,can identify those people with spiritual merit can we write down the set we cannot identify so it's not a set no elements cannot be written twice when writing sets letter sets of the maharagama so we discussed before if it's maharagama a and m only once so m a h a you can't write again r g m a you can't write again so m a h r g 
,,there are three ways to write down a set what are the three ways description as a description in words you are writing a is a set of odd numbers less than ten or letters of the word wander provinces of sri lanka so these are called sets with description now we'll see the next method listing method as a listing of elements method write the elements of this set given as a description colors of the rainbow can you remember the colors the poem related to colors one fairy came in violet one wore indigo in blue green orange yellow red they made a pretty bow one two three four five six seven seven colors are there letters of the word tenor what are the letters here all letters are different so you have to write all letters t e n o r so you have to separate them with a comma numbers of the figure two three seven five eight what are the numbers two three seven five eight so those are the sets as a listing of elements method now we'll look at the other method how we represent a set in 
,,a venn diagram so the mathematician john ben introduced the elements of sets can be written within closed figure so this is a closed figure so if we draw like this that's an open figure so in a closed figure you can put all the elements so in this set a a e i o u wobbles in a in the english alphabet so you can write all the elements inside the closed figure sometimes we use rectangles to represent the closed figure b 2 3 5 7 11 those are prime numbers so you can write inside a closed figure like this 2 3 5 7 11. that's the other way of representing sets numbers written for 2017 so this is in description method how we write that in listing element method what are the numbers written for 2017 0 1 2 7. that's the listing element method now how we represent that in a venn diagram so you can write 0 1 2 7 inside the closed figure next one multiples of 3 less than 20 so what are the multiples 3 6 9 12 1 2 3 4 5 15 and then 18 21 you can't write so these are the elements belongs to 
,,the set of multiples of 3 less than 2. so how can we represent that in a venn diagram we can write all the elements inside 3 6 9 12 15 18. letters of the word maha baduge what are the letters m a h a you can't write again b a again they are d u g and e those are the different elements so how can we represent this one in a venn diagram you can put all the letters m a h b d u g e letters of the word google what are the letters of the word google g or you can write only once g you can't write 
,,it again l e so that's the listing element method now write all the elements in a closed figure that's called venn diagram method g o l a so we discuss now three ways of representing a set descriptive method listing element method and finally venn diagram method sounds of music so we can say c d e f g a so those are the sounds of music so in english alphabet we use c d e f g a b so you can write those letter c d e f g a space flying elephants do you know i can't identify a set so that's we 
,,can't write the elements so what you call that null set of empty set no elements inside the set so we just draw a blank circle like this no elements inside odd numbers divided by 2 without a remainder do you know any odd number that divided by 2 without a remainder we can't write any elements so here this is also a this is also 
,,an empty set so no elements inside so remember this word empty set sometimes we call null set as well draw correct sign in the cage in front of those can be considered as sets months of a year yes we can identify january february like that provinces of sri lanka here's western southern northern province yes we can identify beautiful flowers we can't say this flower is beautiful or not we can't compare it's difficult to identify days of a week monday sunday tuesday wednesday yes we can identify odd numbers between 10 and 20 yes 11 13 15 like that those odd numbers beautiful girls can you say you're beautiful and you're not beautiful we can't compare so 
,,it's not a set tall man there's no limit to that so we can't identify who are taller people if we say men of people above six feet we consider as taller than you can identify men more than six feet tall yes we can identify that set so this is a set but this is not a students clever at mathematics all are clever so we can't identify the students clever at mathematics so it's difficult it's not a set good people can you identify it's difficult to identify so this is also not a set write the following sets written as descriptions with elements in sets days of school is held in the week what are the days monday tuesday stay thursday and friday numbers less than 20 counting numbers if you take 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 18 19. you can't write 20 because it's less than 20. so these are counting numbers letters of the word bamboo what are the letters b a m you can't write b again oh also you can't write twice rewrite the following sets as a description two four six eight what are those you can say even numbers less than 10 even numbers less than 10. because 10 is not there aeiyou what are those wobbles in the english alphabet vowels in the english alphabet cabbage beans beetroot carrot what are those we can say vegetables mango guava wood apple pineapple you can say fruits names of girls millimeter centimeter decimeter meter decal meter hectometer and kilometer what are those you need soft limp pigeon house sparrow crow honeysuckle mad we can identify as birds seconds minutes hours days weeks months years units of time so these are the elements and this is how we write as a description nymphaea lotus lotus lilies flowers in the water plus minus multiplication sign division operations basic operations in let's now we know how to write down any set as a description as a listing element and as a venn diagram look at this one right the following sets within venn diagram so listing method is given and you asked to put all the elements inside the 
,,closed figure so 0 2 4 6 8 sun moon stars so those are the elements sun stars abcde those are the elements so in the set c you can write inside a b c d d is c d e f 
,,g a b capital letter so this is d means d is a set these are the letters inside c d e f g a c digits in this number so this is descriptive way of writing set now how can we put these digits inside you can put 7 2 8 5 2 not again and 7 not again c a m p u s letters inside f so you can put c a m u s write the sets written in venn 
,,diagrams as a description what can you write for this one this is set p or set a i'll write this one as set a 1 three five seven nine odd numbers less than ten on numbers less than next one p q r is t we can just say letters in the alphabet letters in english alphabet this one 3 6 9 12 15 all are multiples of three multiples of 
,,3 up to 50 up to 15 you can write 15 as well if it's less than 15 you can't write write the following sets with elements countable numbers what are the countable numbers you can put one two three four five 6 7 can we write all it's difficult so what we do you can put three dots to show that it's continuing so write a couple of numbers and put only three dots instead of the rest of numbers letters in the alphabet a b c d and then you can put three dots to show that it's continuing odd numbers one three five seven nine then put three dots even numbers two four six eight three dots to show that it's continuing multiples of eight starting from 8 16 24 32 40 and then put three dots multiples of five 5 10 15 20 and then you can put three dots so write correct mark if it's correct and cross mark if it's incorrect someone is an element of the set of voice yes the name someone means a boy so set of bodies can identify that april is an element of the set of year yeah that's a month x is an element of the set of the single alphabet there's no letter in sinhala alphabet as x so that's wrong 12 is an element of the set of prime numbers is 12 a prime 
,,number no it's wrong red is an element of the set of colors in the rainbow yes that's a color list the elements of the following sets letters of the word carpenter so how can we write the letter c a r p e you can't write again and r you can't write a d so those are the elements of the word carpenter consonants of the english alphabet that means not vowels what are the consonants a b c d e you can't f g h like that so you get lot of letters so we can put three dots you can't write vowels a e i o u prime numbers below 10 what are the prime numbers below 10 2 is the lowest prime number 2 3 5 7 that's all you can't write 11 2 3 5 7. letters of the word potato what are the letters p o t a t you can't write o you can't try odd numbers between 10 and 20. so between means you can't include 10 and 20. so 11 13 15 17 90. those are the odd numbers multiples of 3 between 20 and 30 so 20 what's the multiple of 3 after 20 24 then that's 3 times 8 3 times 9 27 and 3 times 10 30. in between 
,,means you can't write 30 so just 24 and 27. now we'll look at exercise 2.1 place correct sign next to each of the expressions which clearly defined a set and cross sign which do not clearly define a set those who obtain more than 100 marks in the grade 5 scholarship examination held in 2013. so we know the names so specifically 
,,mentioned the year and the marks so we can identify students talented singers it's difficult to identify who are talented singers district of sri lanka we can colombo gold district colombo matra beautiful flowers we can't identify beautiful flowers so that's not a set numbers between 0 and 50 which are multiples of 6. so 6 12 18 we can identify people who are fortunate we can't identify those so that's not a set example number one write the set a is a prime numbers between 0 and 50 by writing all the elements that belongs to a within curly brackets a within curly brackets you write numbers between 0 and 15 all prime numbers 2 3 5 7 then 11 13. so those are the prime numbers then they ask are 1 and 17 elements of the set a when you take one it's not a prime number one is not a prime number so not an element not an 
,,element of x what about 17 17 is a prime number but it's not less than in between 0 and 50. you can write 17 is a prime number but more than 15 so that's also not an element so you can say not an element of a example number two the positive integers that are multiples of three write the elements of b within curly brackets so what you do you write down the set using capital letters and within curly brackets positive integers at multiples of 3 3 6 9 12 15 like that can you write all there's no end to so you can put three dots example number one a set p has been represented here by a venn diagram write down the set p by writing its elements within curly brackets you can write p within curly brackets 1 4 9 16 25 then write p in terms of a common property by which the elements of p can be clearly identified what are those 1 square 2 squared 4 3 squared 9 4 squared 16 square numbers so we can write p is a set we can write square numbers up to 25 because last number is 25 so up to 25 means 25 also included example 2 a is the set of positive whole numbers from 1 to 9. write down the set a in terms of a common property of its elements whole numbers from 1 to 9. so counting numbers 1 2 3 up to 9 we can say counting numbers less than counting numbers less than 10 then the second part write down the set a by listing its elements so what are the numbers one two three four five six seven eight nine represent the set a by a venn diagram so what you do you draw a closed figure like this and then label the set as a and write all the elements inside the closed figure 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 exercise 2.2 express each of the following sets by writing all the elements of each set within curly brackets how can we write days of the week sunday monday tuesday wednesday thursday and friday then how can we write prime numbers between zero and ten prime numbers between zero so two three five seven because you can't write 11 there third one c is the set multiples of 4 between 0 and 25 so you can write 4 four times two eight eight four times three twelve four times four sixty four times five twenty and twenty four so those are the elements in each set d is a set letters of the word diagram next one e districts of the western province what are the districts colombo gumpaha and kaluthara next one f digits 
,,of the numbers 21 412 what are the digits one there two four one two you can't write it again next one g is a set of multiples of 6 from 1 to 10. so 6 is the lowest 
,,one then 12 you can't write so only 6. for the sets defined above state whether the following statements are true or false saturday is an element of a saturday is an element of a yes that's true because the days of the week it's true p is an element of d p is not there so you can't write p so that's false all the elements of c are even numbers so we have to check see all the numbers in c are even numbers yes they are even numbers so that's true fourth one any multiple of 3 from 1 to 10 is an element of g so multiple of 3 from 1 to 10 means 3 6 9. we'll check g 3 6 9 so l 6 is there so you can say any multiple of 3 from 1 to 10 is an element of g it's true question number two express each of the following sets in different form by writing all the elements of each set within curly brackets represent each of these sets by a venn diagram 2. so we'll take p prime numbers less than 10. so you can write 2 3 5 7 how can we represent in a venn diagram you can draw a circle or any closed figure like this and put all the elements inside two three five seven that's p and the second one q colors of a rainbow so what are the colors violet indigo blue 
,,green orange yellow red one two three four five six seven so how can we represent that in a venn diagram you can write all the colors there violet blue green orange

,,he does or you carry the load but she carries the load here we see that the base verb do and carry remain the same for first person I and second person you but for third person he or she we need to add es of IES to the base verb the simple present tense is used to indicate the following habits for example he goes for a walk every day regular actions for example the cobbler men's shoes current situation for example I am unwell general truths of facts for example trees give oxygen the simple 
,,past tense is formed when we add the suffix IDI to base verb for example the children jumped into the river the simple past tense shows an action that happened in the past and is over now for example he worked in Dubai last year it is also used to talk about a past habit for example he exercised every day irregular verbs to not 
,,add IDI they take different forms for example he ran last night the simple future tense is formed by adding will or shall before the base verb for example I will watch television after I complete my homework the simple future tense shows an action that will happen sometime in the future for example I will be in grade 5 next year remember simple present and simple past tenses do not have helping verbs we use singular verbs such as is was washes nose etc with singular subject for example she

Sets,CqrYYiffPr0,good morning students today let us study the rules of divisibility these rules will help us determine whether a number is divisible by another number without actually carrying out the division process let us have a look at different divisibility tests divisibility by two if the number is even that is it ends in two four six eight or zero we say that the given number is divisible by two for example 26 ends in 6 thus it is divisible by 2 divisibility by 3 if the sum of the digits of the number is divisible by three we say that the given number is divisible by three for example look at the number 384 when we add up all the digits that is three plus eight 
,,plus four we get the sum as fifteen we know that 15 is divisible by three thus we conclude that 384 is divisible by three divisibility by 4 if the number formed by the last two digits of the given number is divisible by four we see that the given number is divisible by four for example look at the number 164 its last two digits 
,,"form the number 64 which is divisible by 4 thus the whole number 164 is divisible by 4 divisibility by 5 if the number ends in 5 or 0 we say that the given number is divisible by 5 for example 525 ends in 5 thus it is divisible by 5 look at this another example 330 ends in 0 hence it is also divisible by 5 divisibility by 6 if the number is divisible by both 2 and 3 we see that the given number is divisible by 6 for example look at the number 408 is it divisible by 2 the number ends in 8 thus it is divisible by 2 is it divisible by 3 4 plus 0 plus 8 is equal to 12 which is divisible by 3 which makes the number 408 divisible by 3 as well hence 408 is divisible by 6 divisibility by 8 if the number formed by the last three digits of the given number is divisible by 8 we see that the given number is divisible by 8 for example look at the number 50 3888 its last three digits form the number 8 on eighty-eight which is divisible by 8 thus 53,000 888 is divisible by 8 divisibility by nine if the sum of the digits of the number is divisible by nine we see that the given number is divisible by nine for example look at the number seven lakh twenty "
,,nine thousand six hundred thirty-nine here on adding the digits seven two nine six three and nine we get the sum as 36 which is divisible by nine thus seven lakh twenty nine thousand six hundred thirty-nine is also divisible by nine finally let us look at divisibility by ten if the number ends in a zero we say that the given number is divisible by ten for example 8620 ends in zero thus it is divisible by ten kids now it is time for you to remember all these divisibility tests and find out the answer

,,seven five is called as the first term and seven as the second term the first term in the ratio 5mr 7 is 5 because kites are mentioned first now look the ratio of balloons to kites is 7 is 2/5 as here balloons are mentioned first remember pi is 2 7 & 7 is 2 5 are not the same ratio as pi is 2 7 is 5 upon 7 and 7 is 2 5 is 7 upon pi let's solve an example right the ratio of 13 puppies to poor dogs in three days the ratio 4:13 puppies to four stalks can be written as 1:13 is to 4 to 13 then : then 4 and lastly 13 upon poor now let's solve a story problem there are 10 cows for every 18 hens in the palm find out the answers to the given ratios let's write 
,,the statements first number of cows is equal to 10 number of hens is equal to 18 firstly we find the total number of animals which we get as twenty-eight ratios are 
,,the ratio of hens to cows is 18 is to 10 which is equal to 9 is to 5 to the ratio of cows to hens is 10 is to 18 which is equal to 5 is to 9 three the ratio of cows 
,,to the total number of animals is 10 is to 28 which is equal to 5 is to 14 for the ratio off hence to the total number of animals is 18 is to 28 which is equal to 9 
,,is to 14 here as the terms had common factors we reduce them to their lowest value to find the ratio between them now let us see how to express a ratio whose second 
,,term is 100 as a percentage right 35 is to 100 as a percent firstly right 35 is to 100 as a fraction that is 35 upon 100 we already know any number with denominator

First take away 4 carrots so that each rabbit gets 1 carrot each. 4 carrots are still left. Take away these also one by one. No more carrots are left. All the carrots are distributed and each rabbit has 2 carrots. We have taken away 4 carrots 2 times. This can be written as 8 minus 4 is equal to 4. 4 minus 4 is equal to 0. Thus, 8 divided by 4 is equal to 2. This means for equal distribution, that is, for division, we do "

,,other now both of them wanted to be the first to cross they began to fight through the fighting both of them fell into the water and drowned marilla foolishness is always punished the Fox and the crow once a crow found a piece of cake and flew with it on a tree a fox passed below the tree he saw the crow with the piece of cake he wanted that cake so he said your voice must be beautiful to the silly crow opened his mouth to sing as soon as he opened his beak the piece of cake fell from his beak the clever Fox picked it up and ran away laughing Maru foolish pride always has a fall the capsular it was a hot summer afternoon a capsular sat under rotary and had his food and slept for some time there were many monkeys on the dream they saw the gap setters bundled they came down and opened the bundle they found gaps in it and they took them and went back on the train when the capsule got up he saw monkeys on the tree with his caps on their heads he shouted at them but the monkeys went higher up on the tree so he threw his cap down an angle seeing this all the monkeys threw their caps down the cap seller picked up the caps and tied them in a bundle and went on his way marvel there is always the way out of every difficulty the king and his lazy subjects there was once a king who was very sad because his people were very lazy one day he decided to test them he married some treasure in the middle of the Main Street and put huge stones on the spot he then disguised himself and waited and watched to see what his subjects would do no one cleared the road so the king himself removed the boulders and showed them the treasure that was buried there you see he said if you had only not been lazy this treasure would have been yours Mara laziness has no reward if you want something you must work for it two beggars used to sit near the temple gates every day to beg for money and food gun but was blind and could not see govern'd was Lin and could not walk one day they heard that a rich man was having a big feast for the beggars Govan said gun but I will carry you on my back if you will lead the way so grant but carried Gobind on his back and they both went to the feast how happy they were morale we must always try to help one another the bathroom you conductor uncle helps her up the steps she

Sets,3i2i9nmkG24,in our daily life we count various things for various purposes we count things using counting numbers the numbers 1 2 3 4 5 and so on are called counting numbers or 
,,natural numbers the numbers zero one two three four five and so on are called whole numbers zero has no value if placed before a natural number but it has a significant value and placed after a natural number although zero is the first whole number the first counting number is one but numbers like 1 upon to 1.8 and 2.2 are not whole numbers whole numbers on a number line on a number line numbers are represented as points and distances to represent whole numbers on a number line draw a straight horizontal ray label one end of the line as zero mark another point to the right of zero and label it as 1 the distance between 0 & 1 is the unit distance now mark points two three four and so on to the right side of 0.1 at unit distance this is how the number line will look like when we represent the whole numbers starting 
,,from the point zero negative numbers let us first understand what negative numbers are we know that zero means nothing but there are instances in real life when we use numbers that are less than zero for example in a few cold regions in the world the temperature goes below zero degrees Celsius that is negative 4 degrees Celsius 
,,or even below negative 40 degrees Celsius the numbers negative 4 and negative 40 are less than zero and are called negative numbers a negative number is any number that is less than zero for example negative eight is a number that is eight less than zero a negative number is represented with a negative sign any number without a 
,,negative sign is called a positive number which means a number that is greater than zero so while negative eight is negative eight seven is positive 7 or simply 7 integers the numbers one two three and so on the opposites negative one negative two negative three and so on and the number zero together form a different set of numbers let us understand the set of integers with the help of the following diagram in this combination each shape represents a particular number or set of numbers the 
,,circle represents zero this shape represents natural numbers the rectangle represents whole numbers the triangle represents negative numbers and this ship represents integers representation of integers on a number line integers can be represented on a number line that extends to the left to the right it is indicated by arrows and the positive integers are represented to the right of 0 and the negative integers are represented to the left of 0 positive 1 positive 2 positive 3 and so on are called positive integers the number value increases as they move away from zero negative one negative two negative three and so on are called negative integers the number value decreases as they move away from zero the integer zero is neutral it is neither positive nor negative positive integers do not need the positive sign before the number for example positive 2 can be written as just two negative integers need the negative sign before the number in the sign is not included that number is considered as positive two integers are opposites if they are each the same distance away from zero but on opposite sides of the number line one will have a positive sign the other a negative sign in the number line shown here positive three and negative three are opposite numbers now let us look at different situations where we mark our number either as positive or negative money earned or deposited is marked as positive whereas money owed or spent or withdrawn is marked as negative height above sea level is marked as positive whereas depth below sea level is marked as negative climbing up is marked as positive whereas coming down is marked as negative

Sets,u3HANGB47pA,introduction students look at these numbers these are the whole numbers now look at these numbers these are the negative numbers but what do we call a bigger collection of numbers which contains whole numbers and negative numbers those numbers are called integers come let's learn more about integers objectives at the end of this lesson you will be able to define integers write the properties of integers and write the operations on integers students what do we get if we add two integers let 
,,us see Jean has six balls his friend Solon has five balls so how many balls are there in total yes eleven balls in total from this example we can say that addition of two integers is also an integer we can see that addition of integers gives integers so integers are closed under addition look at Rena she has five chocolates if she gives three chocolates to her brother then how many chocolates are left with Rena yes you're right she is left with two chocolates in this example we see that difference of two integers is also an integer hence integers are closed under subtraction in general for any two integers a and B a plus B is an integer similarly if a 
,,and B are two integers then a minus B is also an integer let's now move to its another property that is commutative property this is a ten rupee note if we add one coin of two rupees in it we will get twelve rupees now take a coin of 2 rupee and add one note of 10 rupee in it again we will get 12 rupees or we can write it as 10 
,,plus 2 is equal to 12 and 2 plus 10 equals 12 in both the cases we get the same answer this means the integers can be added in any manner hence addition is commutative for integers in general for any two integers a and B we can say a plus B is equal to B plus a students is 5 minus minus 3 the same as -3 minus 5 now because 5 minus minus 3 is equal to 5 plus 3 which equals 8 and -3 minus 5 is equal to minus 3 minus 5 which equals minus 8 hence we can say that subtraction is not commutative for integers now observe the following examples we will take the integers minus 3 minus 2 and minus 5 look at minus 5 plus within bracket minus 3 plus minus 2 and minus 5 plus minus 3 plus minus 2 in the some minus 3 and minus 2 are grouped together and in the second minus 5 and minus 3 are grouped together in both these cases we get the answer as minus 10 this shows that addition is associative for integers in general for many integers a B and C we can say a plus B plus C is equal to a plus B plus C when we add 0 to any whole number we get the same whole number 0 is an additive identity for whole numbers similarly if we add 0 to any integer we get the 
,,same integer in general for any integer a a plus 0 is equal to a which equals 0 plus a click true or false for the correct statement we know that multiplication of whole numbers is repeated addition for example 2 plus 2 plus 2 is equal to 3 into 2 which equals 6 similarly multiplication of integers is also repeated addition for 
,,example minus 5 plus -5 plus -5 is equal to 3 into minus 5 and therefore 3 into minus 5 is equal to minus 15 let's now find the product of a positive and a negative 
,,integer firstly multiply 6 by 4 and then put minus sign before the product obtained we get minus 24 similarly 5 into minus 4 is equal to minus 5 into 4 which equals 
,,minus 20 the product of two negative integers is a positive integer we multiply the two negative integers as whole numbers in general for any two positive integers a and B minus a into minus B is equal to a into B look at these examples in the first example two negative integers are multiplied in the second example three negative integers are multiplied in the third example for negative integers are multiplying it and in the fourth example five negative integers are multiplied from these products we observe that the product of two negative integers is a positive integer the product of three negative integers is a negative integer the product of four negative integers is a positive integer we can see that in first and third examples the number of negative integers that are multiplied are even 2 & 4 respectively and the product obtained in 1 & 3 are positive integers and the number of negative integers that are multiplied in 2 & 4 are odd and the products obtained in 2 & 4 are 
,,negative integers hence we can say that if the number of negative integers in a product is even then the product is a positive integer and if the number of negative 
,,integers in a product is odd then the product is a negative integer product of two integers is again an integer for example minus 20 into minus 5 is equal to 100 minus 15 into 17 is equal to minus 255 so we can say that integers are closed under multiplication in general a into B is an integer for all integers a and B now observe this example we can say that 3 into minus 4 is equal to minus 4 into 3 and therefore multiplication is commutative for integers in general for any two integers a and B a into B is equal to B into a the product of a negative integer and 0 is 0 for example minus 3 into 0 equals 0 0 into minus 4 equals 0 minus 5 into 0 is equal to 0 0 into minus 6 is equal to 0 in general for any integer a a into 0 is equal to 0 into a which equals 0 when we multiply 1 with any integer we get the same integer for example minus 3 into 1 is equal to minus 3 1 into 5 is equal to 5 that means 1 is the multiplicative identity for integers in general for any integer a we have a into 1 is equal to 1 into a which equals a but when we multiply any integer with minus 1 we get additive inverse of the integer in these examples minus 3 has become 3 minus 6 has become 6 13 has become minus 13 and minus 25 has become 25 the product of three integers does not depend upon the grouping of integers and this is called the associative property for multiplication of integers for any three integers a B and C a into B into C is equal to a into B into C for example 7 into minus 6 into minus 4 is equal to 7 into minus 6 into minus 4 now let us move towards the distributive property of multiplication for any integers a B and C a into B plus C 
,,is equal to a into B plus a into C for example minus 2 into 3 plus 5 is equal to minus 2 into 3 plus minus 2 into 8 similarly for any three integers a B and C a into B minus C is equal to a into B minus a into C for example 4 into 3 minus 8 is equal to 4 into 3 minus 4 into 8 click on true or false if we know that division is the inverse operation of multiplication since 3 into 5 is equal to 15 so 15 divided by 5 is equal to 3 and 15 divided by 3 is equal to 5 when we divide a negative integer by a positive integer we divide them as whole numbers and then put a minus sign before the caution thus we get a negative integer in general for any two positive integers a and B a divided by minus B is equal to minus a divided by B where B is not equal to zero when we divide a negative integer by a negative integer we first divide them as whole numbers and then put a positive sign in general for any two integers a and B minus a divided by minus B is equal to a divided by B where B is not equal to zero division is not commutative for integers for example minus 8 divided by minus 4 is not equal to minus 4 divided by minus 8 any integer divided by zero is meaningless and zero divided by an integer other than zero is equal to zero any integer divided by one gives the same integer for example minus 8 divided by 1 
,,is equal to minus 8 minus 11 divided by 1 is equal to minus 11 but if any integer is divided by minus 1 it does not give the same integer for example minus 8 divided by minus 1 is equal to 8 11 divided by minus 1 is equal to minus 11 summary let us summarize what we have learned integers are a bigger collection of numbers which 
,,is formed by whole numbers and their negatives if a and B are any integers then a plus B and a minus B are again integers if a and B are any integers then a plus B is equal to B plus a for all integers a and B a and B are any integers then a plus B plus C is equal to a plus B plus C for all integers a B and C integers zero is the identity under addition that is a plus zero is equal to zero plus a which equals a for any integer a product of a positive and a negative integer is a negative integer whereas the product of two negative integers is a positive integer product of even number of negative integers is positive whereas the product of odd number of 
,,negative integers is negative if a and B are any integers then a into B is an integer if a and B are any integers then a into B is equal to B into a the integer one 
,,is the identity and a multiplication and that is 1 into a is equal to a into 1 for any integer a if a B and C are any integers then a into B into C is equal to a into B into C if a B and C are any integers a into B plus C is equal to a into B plus a into C for any three integers a B and C when a positive integer is divided by a 
,,negative integer the quotient obtained is a negative integer and vice versa Division of a negative integer by another negative integer gives a positive integer as quotient for any integer a we have a divided by zero is not defined and a divided by one is equal to a

Sets,jKo_NrYcAaA,good morning children today I will teach you all a number system that is used worldwide called the International number system look at this table it shows the periods the places and to place values in this system the six digit numbers are placed in the ones and the thousands periods the seven digit numbers are placed in the ones the thousands and the millions periods here each period consists of three places the once period consists of the places ones tens and hundreds the thousandth period has the places thousands ten thousands and hundred thousands and the millions period has millions ten millions and hundred millions since we are studying numbers up to seven digits in this grade we will learn only up to the millions place now let us learn to read and write numbers using the International number system we write 
,,the numbers in the standard form using commas and read the numbers using the periods look at the example on the board we begin from the right and insert a comma after every three digits that is we divide the number into its periods then read each period separately so we write the given number in standard form as 1 comma 3 for 7 
,,comma 8 2 one and we read it as 1 million three hundred forty seven thousand eight hundred twenty one it's number name is written like this similarly we can write seven digit numbers in the standard form using the periods example eight million four hundred thousand three hundred seven place the digits in the place value chart starting with eight million in the millions period next four hundred thousand in the thousands period lastly 307 in the ones period here also we write the number in the standard form using comma as eight comma 4 0 0 comma 3 zero seven let us try one more example we write this number in standard form as 3 comma 0 0 0 comma 8 4 3 we read this number as 3 million 843 did you notice here we did not read the place value of the zeros but we did write them to show the place value its number name is 
,,3 million 843 wasn't it interesting to learn the International number system

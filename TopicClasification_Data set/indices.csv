XZRQhkii0h0,"You already know that we can view multiplication as repeated addition. So, if we had 2 times 3 (2 × 3), we could literally view this as 3 2's being added together. So it could be 2 + 2 + 2. Notice this is [COUNTING: 1, 2] 3 2's. And when you add those 2's together, you get 6. What we're going to introduce you to in this video is the idea of repeated multiplication – a new operation that really can be viewed as repeated multiplication. And that's the operation of taking an 'exponent.' And it sounds very fancy. But we'll see with a few examples that it's not too bad. So now, let's take the idea of 2 to the 3rd power (2^3) – which is how we would say this. (So let me write this down in the appropriate colors.) So 2 to the 3rd power. (2^3.) So you might be tempted to say, ""Hey, maybe this is 2 × 3, which would be 6."" "
,"But remember, I just said this is repeated multiplication. So if I have 2 to the 3rd power, (2^3), this literally means multiplying 3 2's together. So this would be "
,"equal to, not 2 + 2 + 2, but 2 × ... (And I’ll use a little dot to signify multiplication.) ... 2 × 2 × 2. Well, what's 2 × 2 × 2? Well that is equal to 8. (2 × 2 × "
,"2 = 8.) So 2 to the 3rd power is equal to 8. (2^3 = 8.) Let's try a few more examples here. What is 3 to the 2nd power (3^2) going to be equal to? And I'll let you think about that for a second. I encourage you to pause the video. So let's think it through. This literally means multiplying 2 3's. So let's multiply 3 – (Let me do that in yellow.) Let's multiply 3 × 3. So this is going to be equal to 9. Let’s do a few more examples. What is, say, 5 to the – let's say – 5 to the 4th power (5^4)? And what you'll see here is this number is going to get large very, very, very fast. So 5 to the 4th power (5^4) is going to be equal to multiplying 4 5's together. So 5^4 = 5 × 5 × 5 × 5. Notice, we have [COUNTING: 1, 2, 3] 4 5's. And we are multiplying them. We are not adding them. This is not 5 × 4. This is not 20. This is 5 × 5 × 5 × 5. So what is this going to be? Well 5 × 5 is 25. (5 × 5 = 25.) 25 × 5 is 125. (25 × 5 = 125.) 125 × 5 is 625. (125 × 5 = 625.)"

25gGVMaynPk,hello children today i am here to teach you chapter 24 in your textbook that's indices so in this lesson we are recognizing what are index notations and power of another number and expand a power and write its value so this is an important lesson so you need to do this in grade 7 8 9 10 till you do all levels then after that this is important in a level as well look at this number 8 write 8 as a product of prime factors so how you find out the prime factors you can divide take 8 you can divide this by 2. you get 4 divide this by 2 again you get 2 divide this by 2 again you get 1 so you can write 8 as 2 into 2 into 2 2 three times so we can write instead of writing two times two times two we can write this as two to the power of three so when you take this number 2 to the power of 3 we call this 2 as the base and the power this we say that's the index sometimes we call exponents or power so you can read this number as 2 to the power of 3 2 to the power of 3 25 what are the prime factors of 25 take 25 you can divide by 5 that's 5 5 times 525 divide by 5 again you get 1 so 25 you can write 5 times 5 5 2 times 5 to the power 2. so this is 5 
,to the power of 2 and you can say 5 squared so when the power is 2 you can say squared now write this one 7 to the power of 2 7 to the power of 2 or 7 squared same thing 11 to the power of 2 or 11 squared take eight eight we can write two and two and two we did that before two times two times two or you can write 2 to the power 
,3. so 2 to the power 3 is there another name first you can say 2 to the power of 3 or 3 cube so 3 means q so power 3 you can say q 2 cube so cube we can use for the 
,power 3. now write down 5 to the power of 3 5 to the power of 3 cube of 5 simple cube of 5 7 to the power of 3 cube of 7 10 to the power of 3 and cube of 10. so power 2 is squared and power 3 is cube right how you read these numbers this one already done 9 to the power 3 9 to the power of 3 cube of 9. so likewise you can write 13 to the power of 13 to the power of 2 how can you write there 13 square square of 13 you can write square of 30 13 squared here 6 to the power of 3 i'll write all this 4 to the power of 4 to the power of 2 write the number 8 to the power of 3 twenty to the power of two fifteen to the power of three then you can write power 3 as cube of 6. this one 4 squared square of 4 this one 8 to the power three you can write eight cubed cube of eight twenty squared square of twenty and 15 to the power 
,of 3 that means cube of 15. fill in the blanks so you need to identify what's the base and index so 11 to the power of 7 base is 11 power is 7 that's index 9 to the 
,power of 4 base is 9 and index is 4. now try to do this 3 to the power 11 3 is the base and 11 is the index 5 to the power of 8 5 is the base and 8 is the index 10 to the power 5 10 is the base and 5 is the index 6 to the power 3 base is 6 power or index is 3. write these in index notation so that means you have to write in base and index form three how many threes are there one two three four five so you can write three to the power of five how many sevens are there one two three four seven to the power of how many eights are there one two three four five eight to the power of five how many elevens are there three eleven to the power of three how many tens one two three four five 10 to the power of 5. this one how many fives one two three four five six how many minus threes so make sure that you put brackets one 
,two three four three how many minus elevens are there two power two how many ones are there one two three 4 5 but here 1 to the power any number is 1 23 23 3 times 23 to the power of 3. expand and write as a product 7 to the power 3 7 3 times three to the power six three six times eight to the power four 8 4 times 9 to the power 5 9 5 times 10 to the power two ten two times minus five to the power four minus five four times minus 11 to the power 3 minus 11 three times write as a power of a 
,number so first one write 32 as a power of 2 so what you can do you can divide and see you can divide by 2 you get 16. you can divide this by 2 again 8 divide by 2 get 4 divide by 2 again 2 and divide by 2 again you get 1 till you get 1 you divide so how many twos are there one two three four five five twos are there so you can 
,write this one as two to the power of 5. so 32 as a power of 2 that's 2 to the power of 5. right 125 as a power of 5 then we divide by 5 and say 5 times 2 10 and for 25 that's 5. divide by 5 again you get 5. divide by 5 again you get 1. so 5 3 times you can write as 5 to the power of 3. look at this one right 121 as a power of 11. so take 121 and divide by 11 11 times 11 and 1. you get 11 twice so you can write this one as 11 squared write 81 as a power of 3 so divide by 3 3 times 2 6 and for 21 that's 27 divide by 3 again 9 divide by 3 again 3 divided by 3 again that's 1. so you can write 81 3 4 times that means 3 to the power of four write 36 as a power of six divide by six six times six thirty six six times one six twice that means you can write this is 6 squared write 343 as a power of 7 divide by 7 7 times 4 
,28 28 and you get 63 63 means nine seven times seven and seven times one seven three times that means 7 to the power of 3 and write 64 as a power of divided by eight eight times eight sixty-four eight times one eight into eight or you can write eight squared write 243 as a power of 3 divided by 3 3 times 8 24 and 1 3 times 27 3 
,times again 9 divide by 3 again 3 and divide by 3 again 1. so how many 3's are there 5 1 2 3 4 5 3 to the power of 5 right 64 as a power of 4 divide by 4 4 times 1 4 24 that's 6 4 times 4 16 and then again one four three times four times four times four four to the power of three right 625 as a power of five divided by 5 5 times 1 5 for 12 that's 2 for 25 that's 5. divide by 5 again 2 and 5. divide by 5 again 5 divided by 5 again that's 1. so you get only 5 4 times 5 into 5 into 5 into 5. so 5 to the power of 4. write 729 as a power of 9 divide by 9 9 times eight one nine times nine again divide by nine you get one so nine three times nine to the power of three write these in index notation how many twos are there three how many threes you get two here how many threes two how many fives one two three how many 3 is here 1 2 3 how many 7s 2 how many 11's that's two and how many thirteens that's two here how many twos two and how many fives that's three here again eighths and ninths eights twice and nines one two three how many fives are there three and how many elevens that's two how many fours one two three how many sevens one two three how many elevens here three how many thirteens one two three how many sixes here three and how many sevens 1 2 3 write the following numbers as a product of 2 3 5 so 
,you have to divide either by 2 3 or 5. so take 12 you can divide by 2 first that's 6. again you can divide by 2 that's 3. now you have to divide by 3 and you get 1. 
,so you can write 12 as 2 times 2 times 3 so 2 to the power of 2 and 1 3. 20 you can divide by 2 first you get 10. divide by 2 again you get 5. now you can divide by 
,5. you get 1 there 2 times 2 times 5 2 to the power of 2 and 5 54 divide by 2 2 times 2 4 for 14 that's 7. divide by 3 now get 9 divide by 3 again that's 3 divided by 3 again you get 1. so it's 1 2 and 3 3 times so you can write 2 into 3 to the power of 3 or 3 cube 50 you can divide by 2 25 now you can divide by 5 5 times 1. so 
,50 you can write 2 times 5 into 5 or you can simplify and write 5 squared now look at this one 18 divide by 2 9. now you can divide by 3 divide by 3 again you get 1. this is 2 times 3 times 3 or you can write 2 and 3 to the power of 2. 36 you can divide by 2 that's 18. divide by 2 again 9 divide by 3 again 3 3 and divide by 3 again that's 1. 2 twice and 3 twice so 2 to the power of 2 and 3 to the power of 2 both twice 242 divide by 2 you get 1 2 1 divide by what 11 11 times 11 121 divided by 11 you get 1 so 2 and 2 11 so 2 into 11 squared 75 you can divide by 3 3 times 2 6 and for 15 that's 5. divide by 5 again 5 divide by 5 again you get 1. so 3 times 5 times 5 you can write as 3 into 5 squared 24. how can we divide you can start with 2 12 again you can divide by 2 again by 2 and now you can divide by 3 2 into 2 
,into 2 into 3 2 3 times and 3 once 98 now divide by 2 49 then you get you can divide by 7 and again 7. 2 times 7 times 7 2 into 7 squared instead of 7 times 7 that's 7 squared find the value and use symbols greater less or equal signs so you are comparing two index notations 2 squared and 3 squared so what is 2 squared 2 into 2 
,that's 4. 3 squared 3 into 3 9. now which one is bigger 3 squared is bigger so you can write 2 squared is less than 3 squared 3 to the power 3 or 5 squared 3 to the 
,power 3 is 3 times 3 times 3 you get 27 5 squared 5 times 5 25 so you can write 3 to the power 3 is greater than 5 squared because 27 is more than 25 2 to the power 
,4 2 into 2 into 2 into 2 you get 2 times 2 4 4 times 2 8 8 times 2 16. 4 squared means 4 times 4 that's also 16. so what can you say about this one 2 to the power 4 
,is equal to 4 squared 3 to the power 4 and 9 squared 3 times 3 times 3 times 3 9 here and 9 here 9 times 9 81. 9 squared means 9 times 9 81 so both are the same 3 to the power 4 is same as 9 squared squared and 6 squared 7 times 7 49 6 times 6 36 so 49 is bigger 7 squared is greater than 6 squared 10 squared and 5 to the power 3 10 times 10 you get 100 5 into 5 into 5 3 times 25 times 5 125 so that's bigger so you can write 10 squared is smaller than 5 to the power of 3. 4 to the power 4 or 8 to the power 3 4 into 4 into 4 into 4 you get 64 times 4 256 8 to the power 3 8 times 8 64 64 times 8 now 500 12. so which one is bigger 8 to the power 3. so 4 to the power 4 is smaller than less than 8 to the power of 3 7 cube or 8 q 7 times 7 times 7 49 times 7. 343 8 times 3 8 times 8 times 8 we did that before 512 which one is bigger this is bigger so 7 to the power 3 is less than 8 to the power of 3 or 8 cubed write 64 as power of 2 power of 4 and power of 8 so you can divide separately so we'll do first power of 2 divide by 2 okay 32 16 8 four two and one one two three four five six two six times so you can write 2 to the power of 6 and as a power of 4 you have to divide by 4 4 times 1 4 6 4 times again 4 4 times 1 4 into 4 into 4 or 4 to the power of 3. now as a power of 8 you have to divide by 8 8 times 8 64 and 1 so 8 times 8 means 8 square so here 64 we can write as power of 2 power of 4 as well as power of 8 write 81 as power of 3 so divide by 3 and say and it's 27 divided by 3 9 divided by 3 3 divided by 3 1 3 4 times you can write 3 to the power of 4 now as a power of 9 you divide by 9 get 9 into 9 9 squared find the value so when you are asked to find the value you have to do separately and multiply 2 to the power of 4. now without expanding can you tell me what's 2 to the power of 
,4 that's 16. 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 that's 60. you can write 16 there 3 squared 3 into 3. that's 9 3 times 3 9 now you can multiply these two 9 times 6 54 9 times 1 9 9 plus 5 14. so 145 3 to the power 3 3 3 times that's 27 4 squared means 4 times 4 that's 16. now multiply 27 and 16 10 and 6 you get here multiplied by 1 6 times 7 42 and 6 times 2 12 12 plus 4 16 so you get when you add it 432 next one 2 to the power 2 that means 2 times 2 4. 5 to the power 3 5 times 5 times 5 so you get 
,125 so what's the value of four times five twenty four times two eight plus two ten four times one four four plus one five so answer is five hundred three squared three times three that's nine seven squared seven times seven forty-nine now multiply nine times forty-nine nine times nine eighty one eight remaining nine times four 
,thirty six and eight forty four four hundred and forty one 6 squared 6 into 6 36 2 to the power 3 2 times 2 times 2 that's 8. now 36 times 8. 8 times 6 48 4 remaining 8 times 3 24 plus 4 28 this one 4 squared 4 times 4 that's 16. three squared three times three that's nine sixteen times nine hundred forty-four 5 squared 5 into 5 that's 25 6 into 6 6 squared that's 36 36 into 25 twenty and five five times six thirty five times three fifteen plus three eighty so when you add it you get nine 900 9 squared 9 times 9 2 squared 2 times 2. so 81 here 2 times 2 4 4 times 1 4 4 times 8 32 so 324 11 squared 11 times 11 you get 121 two times two that's four so multiply by four four times one four eight four four hundred eighty four ten squared is hundred ten times ten 3 squared 3 times 3 that's 9. so you get 900 as the answer now three numbers so same thing 2 times 2 you get 4. 3 times 3 you get 9 5 only once so you get 4 times 5 20 20 times nine hundred eighty this one three squared three times three that's nine five squared five times five twenty five and 1 7 so 9 times 7 63 63 times 25 20 and 5 and five times three fifteen five times six thirty 
,plus one thirty one so when you add it thousand five hundred and seventy five fill in the blanks 49 so the base is 7 so we know 7 times 7 power is 2 121 is 11 times 
,11 so 11 square 3 to the power 4 3 times 3 9 3 times 3 9 9 times 9 81 100 125 as something to the power of 3 we know that 5 times 5 times 5 5 to the power of 3 81 it's a square number 9 times 9 9 squared 81 as power of 4 something power of 4 we know that 3 times 3 9 9 times 9. so 3 to the power 4 is 81 121 is 11 times 11 11 squared so 169 is 13 times 13 that's 13 square find the value of 4 squared what's 4 squared 4 times 4 16. find the value of 2 to the power 4 2 4 times you get 4 4 into 4 16 again so what can you say about these two write down the relationship between the two numbers both are the same so 4 squared is same as 2 to the power of 4. fill in the blanks so you have to give the base index index notation and the value three four times so three is the base power is four and this is three to the power four what's the number eighty one five three times five is the base three times they are so index is three five times five twenty five twenty five times five hundred and twenty five seven twice seven is the base power is two seven squared forty nine ten three times ten is the base three is the index ten times ten times 10 to the power 3 is 1000 11 twice 11 is the base 2 is the index 11 squared is 121 2 is the base here how many times 4 times 2 to the power of 4 16. now we look at the exercise 
,and examples in your textbook example number one write three four times using index notation so three one two three four four times find the value so how do you find out the value so we can expand it and find the value one two three four five six two times two times two eight two times 2 times 2 8 8 times 8 64. write down using 
,indices so here 2 3 times 1 2 3 and 5 twice 5 squared find the value of 5 squared and 7 to the power 3 you can do separately 5 squared means 5 times 5 25 7 to the power 3 7 times 7 49 49 times 7 343 now you have to multiply these two 343 times 25 twenty and five six eight six and five times five times three fifteen and five times four twenty plus one twenty one and two there are five times three fifteen plus two seventy now add it you get 8575 this one find the value of 2 to the power 4 and 3 squared so 2 to the power 4 means 2 4 times and 3 twice so here you get 16. 3 to the power 3 is 9. now multiply these two 9 times 6 54 5 remaining 9 times 1 9 plus 5 you get 14 144 24.1 fill in the blanks in the following table so you need to fill index form 4 to the power 3 base is 4 and index is 3 here 5 4 times so 5 is the base index is 4. you get 625 here 2 to the power 3 given that means 2 times 2 times 2 base is 2 power is 3. so what's the value you get 8. base is 2 power is 2 2 times 2 that's 4 here 5 to the power 3 means base is 5 index is 3 so 5 times 5 times 5 and what's the value of 5 to the power 3 5 times 5 25 25 times 5 125 write down 
,using index notation each of the following numbers which has been expressed as a product find also the value of each product so index notation 5 to the power of 2. so 5 times 5 you get 25 10 into 10 into 10 10 to the power 3 that's thousand three three times three to the power of three that's twenty seven one one to the power of three that's 1 1 to the power any number is 1 1 to the power 1 2 3 4 5. that's that's 1 7 4 times 7 to the power 4 so here 49 and 49 49 times 49 we need to find out 40 and 9 4 times 9 36 and 4 times 4 16 plus 3 90. 9 times 9 81 8 remaining 9 times 4 36 plus 8 44. now add it so you get 2 401 here 5 squared 3 squared so 3 squared 5 squared and one seven three squared three times three you get nine five squared five times five twenty-five times seven what you get 9 times 7 63 63 times 25 20 and 5. five times three fifteen five times six thirty plus one thirty one thousand five hundred and seventy five this one you get 3 3 times 4 squared and 6. what's the value there 3 to the power 3 is 3 times 3 times 3 27 4 squared that's 4 times 4 16 times 6. so what's the value so first we can find out 16 times 6 that's 96 and multiply by 27 20 and seven two times nine eighteen plus one ninety seven times six forty two four remaining nine seven times nine sixty three sixty three plus four you get sixty seven edit two thousand five hundred and ninety two two thousand five hundred and ninety two write each of the following numbers which has been expressed in words in index form and as a product and then write down its value right so what's the first one 2 to the power 2. so you have to write in index form and as a product and then write down its value as well 2 to the power of 2 that means 2 times 2 you get 4 4 cubed 4 to the power of 3 4 times 4 times 4 that means 16 times 4 64. 6 squared 6 squared is so 6 into 6 36 3 to the power of 4 3 to the power of 4 3 4 times you get eighty-one two to the power of six to the power of six two six times you get sixty four three cubed three to the power three three times three times three you get 9 times 3 27 evaluate evaluate means find the value 2 to the power of 2 means 2 times 2 and 1 3 2 times 2 4 4 times 3 12 2 to the power of 3 2 3 times and 1 3. so this is 8 eight times three twenty-four two squared two into two three squared three into three two squared is four three squared is nine nine times four 36 3 to the power of 4 3 times 3 times 3 times 3 so you get 9 and 9 nine times nine eighty-one two to the power of two two squared means two times two three squared means three and three four squared means four and four four three times three nine four times four sixteen so 36 times 16 36 and 16 will multiply 6 times 6 36 3 remaining 6 times 3 18 18 plus 3 21 576 example 1 x plus 81 as a power of 3 that means we are dividing by 3. you get 27 divided by 3 9 divided by 3 3 and you get 1. how many threes are there 3 4 times you can write 3 to the power of 4 125 has a power of 5 so you divide by 5 5 times 25 and again five times five pi times one five times five times five you can write as five to the power of three exercise 24.2 what 
,is 2 times 5 equal to 2 times 5 equal to 10 what is 5 to the power of 5 to the power 2 equal to that's 5 into 5 25 what is 3 times 4 3 times 4 means multiplication that's 12. what is 4 to the power of 3 4 to the power of 3 four times four times four sixteen times four sixty-four write 32 as a power of two divide by two you get 16 8 4 and 2 so till you get 1 divide how many 2's are there 1 2 3 4 5 you can write 2 to the power of 5 right 144 has a power of 12. so divide by 12. 12 times 12 144 that's twice 12 times 12 12 to the power of 2. write down 64. as a power of 2 divide by 2 and c divide by 2 you get 16 again 2 again 2 and 2. how many twos one two 
,three four five six six twos are there so two to the power of six as a power of four you divide by 4 64 divide by 4 now 16 and another 4 you get 1 4 times 4 times 4 
,that means 4 to the power of three as a power of eight you divide by eight eight times eight eight squared 81 as a power of 3 81 divided by 3 divide by 3 again 3 again till you get 1 3 times 3 times 3 times 3 3 to the power of 4 as a power of 9 that means divide by 9 9 times 9 81 you get 1. so 9 times 9 9 squared indicate the truth of falsehood of the following statements 2 to the power of 3 is 8. we'll check it 2 times 2 times 2 that's 8. 8 is equal to 8. so that's true three squared three into three nine nine is not equal to six false 3 squared 3 times 3 9. 9 is equal to 8. wrong that's false 5 squared 5 times 5 that's 25 25 is not equal to 10. that's also false two to the power of five two times two times two times two times two you get to the power five is thirty two that's true 3 squared 3 times 3 that's 9. so that's equal to 9 that's true 2 to the power 4 2 into 2 into 2 into 2 that's 16. 4 squared 4 into 4 that's also 16 so 16 is equal to 16. that's true 2 to the power of 4 we found that 16 not 8. 16 is not equal to 8 so that's false 7 to the power of 3 7 times 7 times 7 49 plus 7 340 so that's not equal to 27 so this is false 5 to the power 3 5 times 5 times 5 you get 125 is not equal to 15 that's false 3 to the power 5 3 times 3 times three times three times three so you get 243 that's equal to 243 that's true now we look at miscellaneous exercises what are the base and the index of 7 squared basis 7 and index is 2 write down the following products using index notation 5 how many times 1 2 3 4. four how many times two and seven one two three here three how many times one two three four five eight once two three times three twice and five once four three times five ones and seven four times here here and there but you can count how many twos one two three how many threes one two three and how many fives one two find the value of each of the following expressions 2 to the power of 4 that means 2 4 times and 5 twice 5 times 5 25 2 to the power of 4 is 16 16 times 25 25 and five times six thirty five times one five plus three eight so 400 this one 3 squared 3 times 3 that's 9. 7 squared 7 times 7 49 now multiply by 9 9 times 9 81 8 remaining 9 times 4 36 plus 8 400. so 44 so 441 11 squared that means 11 times 11 10 squared is 10 times ten so this is hundred eleven 
,times eleven hundred and twenty one so hundred and twenty one and put two zeros because you are multiplying by hundred two to the power three two three times that's 
,eight five squared means five two times that's 25 and one seven is there 25 times 8 25 times 4 100 another 100 200 200 into seven thousand four hundred two times 2 4. 3 times 3 times 3 what's that 27 so 4 27 and 5 times 5 25 25 times 400 100 times 27 is 2 thousand 27 and two zeros so 2 700. fill in the blanks 36 base is 6 6 times 6 36 so twice 8 2 into 2 into 2 2 to the power of 3. 125 5 into 5 into 5 3 times 10 squared 10 into 10 hundreds 3 to the power 4 3 times 3 9 3 times 3 9 9 times 9 
,81 write down 256 as a power of 2 we divide by 2 you get 128 divided by 2 64 divided by 2 32 16 8 4 2 y how many twos are there one two three four five six seven eight two to the power of eight as a power of four you divide by four now times 6 24 and 4 4 times again you get 6 24 4 times 4 and 4 times 1 so how many times 4 4 times so 4 to the power of 4 16. so divide by 16 and say 1 and 25 minus 16 you get 9 for 96 that's 96 times 6 another 61 16 squared write down 729 as a power of 3 divided by 3 3 times 2 3 times 4 3 times 3 again by 3 81 again by 3 27 3 9 3 3 and 1. did you get 1 you divide 1 2 3 4 5 6 3 to the power of 6 as a power of 9 means you have to divide by 9 9 times 8 1 9 times 9 81 so 9 to the power of 3 as a power of 27 divide by 27 and 6 27 times 2 54 so subtract that's 189 so 7 again 189 so 27 times 1 so 27 squared fill in the blanks appropriately with either the symbol less or greater 2 to the power of 3 we already know that's 8 3 squared is 9 so this side is 
,bigger so you can put greater than sign 3 to the power of 4 81 4 to the power of 3 4 times 4 times 4 64. so this one is bigger 2 to the power of 4 is 16 4 squared is 16. so you can put equal sign 8 to the power of 1 8 1 to the power of 8 1 so 8 is bigger 2 to the power of 4 is 16 4 squared is 16 equal 3 squared is 9 6 this one is bigger greater so we covered all theory related to indices to represent a number using index notation is to write a repeated product of a number in a concise way so 2 to the power of 5. in the expression 2 to the power of 5 the base is 2 and the index is 5. the number can be written as a power of a given number division is used to find the index when expressing a number as a power of another number so practice all the exercises and examples and thorough with indices you

kITJ6qH7jS0,Welcome to the presentation
,on level one exponent rules. Let's get started
,with some problems. So if I were to ask you what 2
,"-- that's a little fatter than I wanted it to be, but let's"
,keep it fat so it doesn't look strange -- 2 the third times --
,and dot is another way of saying times -- if I were to
,"ask you what 2 to the third times 2 to the fifth is, how"
,"would you figure that out? Actually, let me use a skinnier"
,"pen because that does look bad. So, 2 to the third"
,times 2 to the fifth. Well there's one way that I
,think you do know how to do it. You could figure out that
,"2 to the third is 9, and that 2 to the fifth is 32. And then you could"
,"multiply them. And 8 times 32 is 240,"
,"plus it's 256, right? You could do it that way. That's reasonable because it's"
,not that hard to figure out 2 to the third is and what
,2 to the fifth is. But if those were much larger
,numbers this method might become a little difficult. So I'm going to show you using
,exponent rules you can actually multiply exponentials or
,exponent numbers without actually having to do as much
,arithmetic or actually you could handle numbers much
,larger than your normal math skills might allow you to. So let's just think what
,2 to the third times 2 to the fifth means. 2 to the third is 2
,"times 2 times 2, right? And we're multiplying that"
,times 2 to the fifth. And that's 2 times 2
,times 2 times 2 times 2. So what do we have here? We have 2 times 2 times
,"2, times 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 2. Really all we're doing is we're"
,"multiplying 2 how many times? Well, one, two, three, four,"
,"five, six, seven, eight. So that's the same thing"
,as 2 to the eighth. Interesting. 3 plus 5 is equal to 8. And that makes sense because 2
,"to the 3 is 2 multiplying by itself three times, to the"
,"fifth is 2 multiplying by itself five times, and then"
,"we're multiplying the two, so we're going to multiply"
,2 eight times. I hope I achieved my goal
,of confusing you just now. Let's do another one. If I said 7 squared
,"times 7 to the fourth. That's a 4. Well, that equals 7 times 7,"
,"right, that's 7 squared, times and now let's"
,do 7 to the fourth. 7 times 7 times 7 times 7. Well now we're multiplying
,"7 by itself six times, so that equal 7 to the sixth. So in general, whenever I'm"
,"multiplying exponents of the same base, that's key, I can"
,just add the exponents. So 7 to the hundredth power
,"times 7 to the fiftieth power, and notice this"
,is an example now. It would be very hard without
,"a computer to figure out what 7 to the hundredth power is. And likewise, very hard without"
,a computer to figure out what 7 to the fiftieth power is. But we could say that this is
,"equal to 7 to the 100 plus 50, which is equal to 7 to the 150. Now I just want to give you a"
,"little bit of warning, make sure that you're multiplying. Because if I had 7 to the 100"
,"plus 7 to the 50, there's actually very little"
,I could do here. I couldn't simplify
,this number. But I'll throw out one to you. If I had 2 to the 8 times
,"2 to the 20, we know we can add these exponents. So that gives you 2"
,"to the 28, right? What if I had 2 to the"
,8 plus 2 to the 8? This is a bit of a
,trick question. Well I just said if
,"we're adding, we can't really do anything. We can't really simplify it. But there's a little trick"
,"here that we actually have two 2 to the 8, right? There's 2 to the 8 times"
,"1, 2 to the 8 times 2. So this is the same thing as 2"
,"times 2 to the 8, isn't it? 2 times 2 to the 8. That's just 2 to"
,"the 8 plus itself. And 2 times to the 8, well"
,that's the same thing as 2 to the first times 2 to the 8. And 2 to the first times 2 to
,the 8 by the same rule we just did is equal to 2 to the 9. So I thought I would just
,throw that out to you. And it works even with
,negative exponents. If I were to say 5 to the
,"negative 100 times 3 to the, say, 100 -- oh sorry, times"
,5 -- this has to be a 5. I don't know what my
,brain was doing. 5 to the negative 100 times
,"5 to the 102, that would equal 5 squared, right? I just take minus 100 plus 102. This is a 5. I'm sorry for that"
,"brain malfunction. And of course, that equals 25. So that's the first"
,exponent rule. Now I'm going to show you
,"another one, and it kind of leads from the same thing. If I were to ask you what 2 to"
,"the 9 over 2 to the 10 equals, that looks like that could"
,be a little confusing. But it actually turns out to be
,"the same rule, because what's another way of writing this? Well, we know that this is also"
,the same thing as 2 to the 9 times 1 over 2 to
,"the 10, right? And we know 1 over 2 to the 10. Well, you could re-write right"
,"this as 2 the 9 times 2 to the negative 10, right? All I did is I took 1 over 2 to"
,the 10 and I flipped it and I made the exponent negative. And I think you know
,"that already from level two exponents. And now, once again, we can"
,just add the exponents. 9 plus negative 10 equals 2 to
,"the negative 1, or we could say that equals 1/2, right? So it's an interesting"
,thing here. Whatever is the bottom
,"exponent, you could put it in the numerator like we did here,"
,but turn it into a negative. So that leads us to the second
,"exponent rule, simplification is we could just say that this"
,"equals 2 to the 9 minus 10, which equals 2 to"
,the negative 1. Let's do another
,problem like that. If I said 10 to the 200 over
,"10 to the 50, well that just equals 10 to the 200"
,"minus 50, which is 150. Likewise, if I had 7 to the"
,"fortieth power over 7 to the negative fifth power,"
,this will equal 7 to the fortieth minus negative 5. So it equals 7 to
,the forty-fifth. Now I want you to think about
,"that, does that make sense? Well, we could have re-written"
,this equation as 7 to the fortieth times 7 to
,"the fifth, right? We could have taken this 1 over"
,"7 to the negative 5 and turn it into 7 to the fifth, and that"
,would also just be 7 to the forty-five. So the second exponent rule I
,just taught you actually is no different than that first one. If the exponent is in the
,"denominator, and of course, it has to be the same base and"
,"you're dividing, you subtract it from the exponent"
,in the numerator. If they're both in the
,"numerator, as in this case, 7 to the fortieth times 7 to the"
,"fifth -- actually there's no numerator, but they're"
,"essentially multiplying by each other, and of course, you have"
,to have the same base. Then you add the exponents. I'm going to add one variation
,"of this, and actually this is the same thing but it's a"
,little bit of a trick question. What is 2 to the 9
,"times 4 to the 100? Actually, maybe I shouldn't"
,"teach this to you, you have to wait until I teach"
,you the next rule. But I'll give you
,a little hint. This is the same thing as 2 the
,9 times 2 squared to the 100. And the rule I'm going to teach
,you now is that when you have something to an exponent and
,"then that number raised to an exponent, you actually"
,multiply these two exponents. So this would be 2 the
,9 times 2 to the 200. And by that first rule
,"we learned, this would be 2 to the 209. Now in the next module"
,I'm going to cover this in more detail. I think I might have
,just confused you. But watch the next video and
,then after the next video I think you're going to be ready
,to do level one exponent rules. Have fun.
,
BUJKEDqGp1U,hi I'm Lucy and in this video we're going to look at the laws of indices you should already know what indices are maybe forgotten watched this video first the laws of indices make solving complex problems involving powers much easier and they are also essential for understanding a lot of algebra processors so there are six laws 
,that we need to know multiplying and dividing with indices raising a power to a power what a power of zero means and then fractional and negative indices we're going to look at the first four in this video and then the last two in part two I promise you they really are quite logical right so multiplying indices look at how these are simplified what do you notice hopefully you can see that when we multiply indices we just add the powers together so 3 plus 4 is 7 because really it is 2 3 times x - 4 times giving us 7 twos and three plus two plus one is six looking at the final example see how we treat the numbers and the indices differently so we do 4 multiplied by 5 first and add the indices second a really important thing to know is that the base has to be the same so here because they are both base two we can add the 3 and the 4 but on this one we can't do anything because one is base 2 and one is base 3 so what happens when we divide with indices have a look and see if you 
,can work it out when we divide entities we subtract the powers but again the base must be the same so for this one we do the numbers first and subtract the indices second this is because if I wrote the equation out filly it would be the same as writing this just as you do any simplify fractions we can cancel down our numbers and our letters say we cancel the 20 and the 5 to become before and we start by cancelling out the B's so to divide indices we divide the numbers and we subtract the powers so what do you notice about these 3 when powers are raised to a power we multiply the powers together on this one be a little careful don't forget because the 3 is also inside the brackets it needs squaring 2 hence 9 but then 6 multiplied by 2 is 12 if we write this out it would be 3 B 6 x 3 e 6 and we know that when we multiply indices we add the powers so 3 x 3 is 9 and 6 plus 6 is 12 so just remember when we raise a power to a power we just multiply the two powers together so what'd you notice about the power of zero anything to the power of zero is one but why is this let's use our knowledge of fractions and also dividing indices to see why do you agree that anything divided by itself is one so a to the power of three goes into a to the power of three once that's our first equation and then using our indices knowledge when we divide we subtract the powers to 3 minus 3 is 0 and that's our second equation we've done the same calculation in two different ways therefore 
,the two answers must equal one another so combining these two things and nothing to the power of zero equals one here are some questions for you to give a go yourself pause the video work out the answers and click play when you're ready to check did you get them right so here are the four laws that we've seen so far make sure you understand why they work and then you don't need to stress about learning them watch part two to discover how fractional and negative indices work if you liked the video give it a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe comment below if you have any questions why not check out our few school app as well until next time

TWv6f7rwjF4, If we think about something
,"like two to the third power, we could view this as taking three twos and multiplying them together,"
,"so two times two times two, or equivalently, we could"
,say this is the same thing as taking a one and then
,"multiplying it by two three times, so actually, let's just"
,"go with this definition right over here, and this, of course, is going to be equal to eight. Now what would, based on"
,"this definition I just did, what would two to the second power be? Well, this would be one times two twice, so one times two times two, which, of course, would be equal to four. What would two to the first power be? Well, that would be one, and we would multiply it by one two, one times two, which, of course, is equal to two. Now let's ask ourself"
,an interesting question. Based on this definition
,"of what an exponent is, what would two to the zeroth power be? I encourage you to just think"
,"about that a little bit. If you were the mathematics community, how would you define two to the zero power so it is consistent with"
,"everything that we just saw. Well, the way we just talked"
,"about it, we just said exponentiation is you start"
,"with a one and you multiply it by the base zero times, so"
,"we're not gonna multiply it by any two, so we're just"
,"gonna be left with a one. So does this make sense that two to the zero power is equal to one? Well, let's think about it another way, and let's do a different base. "
,"That was with two, but"
,let's say we have three and I could say three to
,"the fourth power, that's three times three times three times three which is going to be equal to 81, and let me just write down that this is going to be equal to 81. If I said three to the third power, that's three times three"
,times three which is 27. Three to the second
,power is equal to nine. Three to the first
,"power is equal to three. Do you notice a pattern every time we decrease the exponent here by one? We want three to the fourth, and now we go three to the third. What happened to the value? Well, going from 81 to 27,"
,"we divided by three, and that makes sense,"
,"because we're multiplying by one less three, so we divide by three to go from 81 to 27, we"
,"divide by three again if our exponent goes down by one, and we divide by three again"
,"when we go from nine to three, divide by three, so based"
,"on this, what do you think three to the zero power should be? Well, the pattern is every time we decrease our exponent by"
,"one, we divide by the base, and so we should divide by three again would be the logic if"
,"we follow that pattern, and so three divided by"
,three would get us one again. So I know it might seem a little
,bit counter intuitive that something to the zeroth power
,"is going to be equal to one, but this is how the mathematics"
,community has defined it because it actually makes a lot of sense. Either if you view an
,exponent as taking a one and multiplying it by the base
,"the exponent number of times, so I'm gonna multiply"
,"one by two three times, or if you just follow"
,"this pattern, every time you decrease the exponent by one, you're going to be dividing by the base. Either of those would get"
,"you to the conclusion that two to the zero power is one,"
,"or three to the zero power is one, or frankly, any number"
,"to the zero power is one. So if I have any number,"
,"let's say I have some number a to the zero power, this is"
,going to be equal to one. Now I have an interesting
,"question for you, and let's just say this is the case when a does not equal zero. I'll leave you a little bit of a puzzle for you to think about. What do you think is"
,zero to the zeroth power? What should zero to the zero power be? And what's interesting
,about zero to the zero power is you'll get a different
,answer if you use this technique versus if you use this
,technique right over here. This technique would actually
,"get you to being one, while this technique would"
,"have you divide by zero, which we don't know how to do. Anyway, I'll leave you there to ponder the mysteries of zero to the zeroth power."

Fp4n7Qk221U,grade six math number 1.1 exponents an exponent is a number that tells us how many times to multiply a base number to itself a base number is used as a repeated factor the 3 is the base number the little red 2 is an exponent and what it means is 3 times 3 the little red 2 is telling the 3 how many times 2 multiplied to itself same and then the 3 times 3 or the repeated factors saying how to read and write exponents if you see a 5 with a little to as an exponent we say 5 squared or we say 5 
,to the second power or we can even say the 2nd power of 5 it means 5 times 5 and it equals 25 if we saw a 5 with a little 3 above it if you remember from fifth grade math that means 5 cubed 5 to the third power the third power of 5 it means 5 times 5 times 5 it means 125 125 okay remember last year when we were doing cubes we were doing cube units and a unit cube had a length a width and a height and we were doing length width and height and we were multiplying like that and we were putting we were saying inches cubed or centimeters cubed do you remember that that was at the end of last year so yeah that's cubed okay that means there's three things that we're multiplying see any number can be a base or a repeated factor 2 times 2 times 2 could be 2 to the third power or 2 cubed 6 times 6 times 6 times 6 could be 6 to the 4th power or 10 times 10 times 10 times 10 whoops we're missing one it should be times 10 can be 10 to the fifth power seemed supposed to be 10 of 5 of them 
,1 2 3 4 5 that's right 10 to the 5th power we can write equations that have exponents if you've got one two three four twos you have two to the fourth power and then you've got two threes you've got three to the second power that's how you'd read it if there was a little to remember its to the second power or squared we could say three squared but it saves energy and ink well we don't use ink and math we use graphite right pencils are now made out of graphite so your pencil appreciates you 
,saving it if we have three sevens 7 times 7 times 7 we have 7 cubed or 7 to the third power and we've got one two three four five nines 9 to the fifth power see we use order on ordinal numbers like you use for the grades in school it's called ordinal what that means is like first second third those are ordinal numbers and those 
,are the numbers we use for the powers it's the first power to the second power to the third power to the fourth power to the fifth power just like you would say for 
,"a second third fourth fifth grade okay if we have a 5 with a 3 up here it's 5 to the 3rd power that means 5 times 5 times 5 and we're multiplying it to 2 times 2 we're multiplying it to 4 so we would actually go like this and we would solve the 5 to the 3rd power and we would solve the 2 to the 2nd power and then we would multiply them because we always do exponents first so 5 times 5 is 25 25 times 5 is 125 2 times 2 is 4 and now we do 125 times 4 4 hundredths is 404 25 s is another hundred that's 500 see like mental math okay but be very very careful because 2 to the 3rd power does not equal 3 to the 2nd power mmm-hmm they are not interchangeable it's not like 2 times 3 or three times two it is not like that at all two to the third power means 2 times 2 times 2 2 times 2 is 4 and 4 times 2 is 8 3 to the second power is 3 times 3 that's 9 so don't think that that is what you're supposed to multiply together it's telling you how many times to multiply this to itself okay powers of 10 are written as exponents 10 to the third power means 10 times 10 times 10 and a real cool tricky rule whatever the exponent is on the 10 this works for powers of 10 it doesn't work for these guys but if it's a power of 10 whatever the exponent is means you make a 1 and that many zeros it works it's very quick and core so if you see 10 to the 5th power you write a 1 and 5 zeroes 10 to the 7th power you write a 1 in 7 zeroes okay when the exponent is a 1 then it's just equal to the base 5 to the first power is 5 7 to the first power 7 10 to the first power is 10 1 to the first power is 1 but beware of a zero for an exponent this doesn't mean it's 5 degrees outside when you see it in algebra or in math it could be a zero exponent zero exponents make any number equal 1 5 to the zero power equals 1 and 7 to the 0 power equals 1 999,000 to the zero power equals 1 it doesn't matter what the number is it's going to equal 1 if it's got a zero exponent and it's because of the "
,zero exponent rule and I'm gonna explain more of that when we start dividing fractions okay now have you ever heard someone say it grew exponentially well that means that multiplied to itself over and over if this was like I don't know a virus or a bacteria and it grew exponentially it was a 2 and then it became a 2 times 2 it became a 4 then it became a four times two which became an eight and then an eight times two which became a sixteen in the sixteen times two which became a thirty-two that's growing exponentially it's multiplying by that number over and over and over again so two to the fifth power is equal to 32 isn't that cool so it's a really 
,neat way of writing a lot of multiplication in a quick short way scientists like it because they don't need to write out a bunch of multiplication they can just write two to the fourth power and get their point across in their notes and stuff figures the scientists would find an easy way to write big math isn't it so that's our 
,little video on exponents and I'll see you next video I hope you enjoyed this and I hope it helped

HpdMJaKaXXc,Let's try to learn a thing
,or two about ratios. So ratios are just expressions
,that compare quantities. So that might just be a fancy
,way-- let me just --of saying something that you may
,or may not understand. So let me give you
,actual examples. If I have 10 horses
,and I have 5 dogs. And someone were to come to
,"me and say Sal, what is the ratio is of horses to dogs? So I want to know how many"
,horses do I have for some number of dogs. So I could say I have 10
,horses for every 5 dogs. So I could say the ratio of
,horses to dogs is 10:5. Or I could also write
,that as a fraction. I could say the ratio of
,horses to dogs is 10/5. Or I could just write it out. I could say it is 10 to 5. These all are saying
,"the same thing. And the thing I write first,"
,"or the thing that I write on top, is the number of horses. So this is the number"
,of horses right there. That's the number of horses. And that's all the
,number of horses. If I wanted to talk about the
,"number of dogs, this is the number of dogs, that's the"
,"number of dogs, or that's the number of dogs. I'm just-- These are all"
,"just expressions that are comparing two quantities. Now, I just said I have 10"
,horses for every 5 dogs. But what does that mean? That means I have 5
,horses for every 1 dog. Sorry. Not 5 horses for every 1 dog. It means I have 2 horses
,"for every 1 dog, right? If for 5 dogs I have 10, that"
,"means that for every 1 of these dogs, there are 2 horses. For every one of-- every 2 of"
,"these horses, there's 1 dog. I just kind of reasoned"
,through that. So this is-- I have 2
,horses for every 1 dog. But how do you get there? How do you get
,from 10:5 to 2:1? Well you can think of what's
,the biggest number that divides into both of these numbers? What's their greatest
,common divisor? I have a whole video on that. The biggest number that divides
,into both of these guys is 5. So you divide both of them by 5
,"and you can kind of get this ratio into a reduced form. And if I write it here, it"
,would be the same thing as 2/1 or 2 to 1. And so what's interesting about
,"ratios, it isn't literally, or doesn't always have to be"
,"literally, the number of horses and the numbers of"
,dogs you have. What a ratio tells you
,is how many horses do I have for every dog. Or how many dogs do I
,"have for every horse. Now, just to make things clear,"
,what if someone asked me what is the ratio of dogs to horses? So what's the difference
,"in these two statements? Here I said horses to dogs. Here I'm saying dogs to horses. So, since I've switched the"
,ratio-- What I'm looking for-- I'm looking for the ratio
,"of dogs to horses, I switch the numbers. So dogs-- For every 5"
,"dogs, I have 10 horses. Or if I divide both of"
,"these by 5, for every 1 dog, I have 5 horses. So the ratio of dogs to"
,horses is 5:10 or 1:5. Or you could write it this way. 1 to-- I can write it-- Let
,me write it down here. 1/5. Or I could write 1 to 5. And the general convention--
,This wouldn't be necessarily incorrect. That's not wrong. But the general convention is
,"to get your ratio or your fraction, if you want to call"
,"it that, into the simplest form or into this reduced"
,form right there. Let's just do a couple
,of other examples. Let's say I have 20 apples. Let's say I have 40 oranges. And let's say that I
,have 60 strawberries. Now what is the ratio of apples
,to oranges to strawberries? I could write it like this. I could write what is the ratio
,of-- I'll write it like this --apples:oranges:strawberries? Well I can start off by
,"literally saying, well for 60 strawberries-- for every 60"
,"strawberries, I have 40 oranges and I have 20 apples. And this would be legitimate. You could say the ratio"
,"of apples to oranges to strawberries are 20:40-- Sorry. 20:40:60. And that wouldn't be wrong. But we saw before, we could"
,put into reduced form. So we think of what's the
,largest number that divides into all three of these? We can't just do it into two of
,these now because now my ratio has three actual quantities. Well the largest number
,"that divides into all of these guys is 20. If we divide all of them by 20,"
,"we can then say for every 1 apple, I now have-- you divide"
,"this guy by 20 --I have 2 oranges, and I have"
,3 strawberries. So the ratio of
,"apples to oranges to strawberries is 1:2:3. And I got that, in every"
,"case, by just dividing these guys all by 20. I divided by 20. I think you get"
,the general idea. If someone were to ask you
,what's the ratio of-- Let me just write it down because it
,never hurts to have a little bit more clarification. If someone wanted to know
,the ratio of strawberries to oranges-- Let me get
,into my orange color. Strawberries to
,oranges to apples. I thought I was going
,"to do that in yellow. To apples. What is this ratio going to be? Well for every 3 strawberries,"
,I have 2 oranges and I have 1 apple. So then it would be 3:2:1. The general idea is whatever
,"order someone asks you for the different items, you put-- the"
,"ratio is going to be in that same exact order. Now, in all of the examples so"
,far I gave you the number of quantity-- the quantity of
,things we had and I-- we figured out the ratio. What if it went the other way? What if I told you a ratio? What if I said the ratio of
,boys to girls in a classroom is-- Let's say the ratio
,of boys to girls is 2/3. Which I could've also written
,"as 2:3 just like that. So for every 2 boys, I have"
,"3 girls or for every 3 girls, I have 2 boys. And let's say that there are"
,40 students in the classroom. And then someone were to ask
,you how many girls are there? How many girls are
,in the classroom? So this seems a little
,bit more convoluted than what we did before. We know the total number of
,students and we know the ratio. But how many girls
,are in the room? So let's think
,about it this way. The fact that the ratio
,of boys to girls-- I'll write it like this. Boys-- Maybe I'll be
,stereotypical with the colors. The ratio of boys to
,"girls is equal to 2:3. Hate to be so stereotypical,"
,but it doesn't hurt. 2:3. The ratio of boys
,to girls is 2:3. So this stands for every
,"3 girls, there's 2 boys. For every 2 boys,"
,there's 3 girls. But what does it also say? It also says for every 5
,"students, there are what? There are 2 boys and 3 girls. Now why is this"
,statement helpful? Well how many groups of
,5 students do I have? I have 40 students in my
,"class right there, right? I have 40 students in my class. And for every 5 students,"
,there are 2 boys and 3 girls. So how many groups of
,5 students do I have? So I have a total
,of 40 students. Let me do it in
,this purple color. I have 40 students and then
,there are 5 students per group. And I figured out that group
,"just by looking at the ratio. For every 5 students, I"
,have 2 boys and 3 girls. How many groups of 5
,students do I have? So that means that I have 8
,groups-- 40 divided by 5 --I have 8 groups of 5 students. Now we're wondering how
,many girls there are. So each group is going
,"to have 3 girls. So how many girls do I have? I have 8 groups, each"
,of them have 3 girls. So I have 8 groups times 3
,girls per group is equal to 24 girls in the classroom. And you could do the same
,exercise with boys. How many boys are there? There's a couple of
,ways you could do it. You could say for every
,"group, there are 2 boys. There's 8 groups. There's 16 boys. Or you could say"
,there's 40 students. 24 of them are girls. 40 minus 24 is 16. So either way you
,get to 16 boys. And if you want to pick
,"up a fast way to do it. It would be identical. You'd say look, 2 plus 3 is 5. For every 5 students,"
,"2 boys, 3 girls. How many groups are there? You say 40 divided by 5"
,is equal to 8 groups. Every group has 3 girls. So you do 8 times 3 is
,equal to 24 girls. Let's do one that's a little
,bit harder than that. Let's do one where I say that
,the ratio of let's say-- Well let's go back
,to the farm example. The ratio of sheep--
,I'll do sheep in white. The ratio of sheep to--
,I don't know --chickens to-- I don't know. What's another farm animal? --to pigs. The ratio of sheep to chicken
,to pigs-- Maybe I should just say chicken right there. The ratio of sheep to chicken
,to pigs-- Or chickens. I should say chickens. Is-- Let's say the
,"ratio is 2:5:10. And notice, I can't"
,reduce this anymore. There's no number that
,divides into all of these. So this is the ratio if
,sheep to chickens to pigs. And let's say that I have
,a total of 51 animals. And I want to know how
,"many chickens do I have. Well we do the same idea. For every 2 sheep, I have 5"
,chickens and I have 10 pigs. That tells me for every 17
,"animals-- So every group of 17 animals, what do I have? And where did I get 17 from? I just added 2 plus 5 plus 10. For every 17 animals,"
,"I'm going to have-- Let me pick a new color. I'm going to have 2 sheep,"
,"5 chickens, and 10 pigs. Now, how many groups of"
,17 animals do I have? I have a total of 51 animals. So if there's 17 animals per
,"group, 51 animals divided by 17 animals per group. I have 3 groups of 17 animals. Now I want to know"
,how many chickens. Every group has 5 chickens. We already know that. And I have 3 groups. So I have 3 groups. Every group has 5 chickens. So I'm going to have 3     
,"times 5 chickens, which is equal to 15 chickens. Not too bad. All I did is add these up and"
,"say for every 17 animals, I've got 5 chickens. I've got 3 groups of 17. So for each of those"
,"groups, I have 5 chickens. 3 times 5 is 15 chicken. You could use the same process"
,to figure out the number sheep or pigs you might have.
,
vDqOoI-4Z6M,When we're dealing
,"with basic arithmetic, we see the concrete"
,numbers there. We'll see 23 plus 5. We know what these numbers
,"are right over here, and we can calculate them. It's going to be 28. We can say 2 times 7. We could say 3 divided by 4. In all of these cases, we"
,know exactly what numbers we're dealing with. As we start entering into
,the algebraic world-- and you probably have seen
,this a little bit already-- we start dealing with
,"the ideas of variables. And variables, there's"
,a bunch of ways you can think about
,"them, but they're really just values in expressions"
,where they can change. The values in those
,"expressions can change. For example, if"
,"I write x plus 5, this is an expression"
,right over here. This can take on
,some value depending on what the value of x is. If x is equal to
,"1, then x plus 5, our expression right over here,"
,"is going to be equal to 1. Because now x is 1. It'll be 1 plus 5, so x"
,"plus 5 will be equal to 6. If x is equal to, I don't"
,"know, negative 7, then x plus 5 is going to be equal to--"
,"well, now x is negative 7. It's going to be negative 7"
,"plus 5, which is negative 2. So notice x here is a"
,"variable, and its value can change depending on the context. And this is in the"
,context of an expression. You'll also see it in the
,context of an equation. It's actually
,important to realize the distinction between an
,expression and an equation. An expression is
,"really just a statement of value, a statement of"
,some type of quantity. So this is an expression. An expression would
,"be something like what we saw over here, x plus 5. The value of this"
,expression will change depending on what the
,value of this variable is. And you could just evaluate
,it for different values of x. Another expression could be
,"something like, I don't know, y plus z. Now everything is a variable. If y is 1 and z is 2,"
,it's going to be 1 plus 2. If y is 0 and z is
,"negative 1, it's going to be 0 plus negative 1. These can all be evaluated,"
,and they'll essentially give you a value depending
,on the values of each of these variables that
,"make up the expression. An equation, you're"
,essentially setting expressions to be equal to each other. That's why they're
,"called equations. You're equating two things. An equation, you'll"
,see one expression being equal to
,"another expression. For example, you could say"
,something like x plus 3 is equal to 1. And in this situation where you
,"have one equation with only one unknown, you can"
,actually figure out what x needs to be
,in this scenario. And you might even
,"do it in your head. What plus 3 is equal to 1? Well, you could do"
,"that in your head. If I have negative 2,"
,"plus 3 is equal to 1. In this context, an"
,equation is starting to constrain what value
,this variable can take on. But it doesn't have to
,necessarily constrain it as much. You could have something like
,x plus y plus z is equal to 5. Now you have this expression is
,equal to this other expression. 5 is really just an
,expression right over here. And there are some constraints. If someone tells you
,"what y and z is, then you're going to get an x. If someone tells"
,"you what x and y is, then that constrains what z is. But it depends on what"
,"the different things are. For example, if we said y is"
,"equal to 3 and z is equal to 2, then what would be"
,x in that situation? If y is equal to 3
,"and z is equal to 2, then you're going to have"
,the left-hand expression is going to be x plus 3 plus 2. It's going to be x plus 5. This part right over here is
,just going to be 5. x plus 5 is equal to 5. And so what plus
,"5 is equal to 5? Well, now we're"
,constraining that x would have to be equal to 0. Hopefully you realize
,"the difference between expression and equation. In an equation,"
,essentially you're equating two expressions. The important thing
,to take away from here is that a variable can
,take on different values depending on the
,context of the problem. And to hit the point
,"home, let's just evaluate a bunch of expressions"
,"when the variables have different values. For example, if we had the"
,"expression x to the y power, if x is equal to 5"
,"and y is equal to 2, then our expression here"
,"is going to evaluate to, well, x is now going to be 5. y is going to be 2. It's going to be 5"
,"to the second power, or it's going to evaluate to 25. If we changed the values-- let"
,me do that in that same color-- if we said x is equal to
,"negative 2 and y is equal to 3, then this expression"
,would evaluate to-- let me do it in
,that-- negative 2. That's what we're
,"going to substitute for x now in this context. And y is now 3, negative"
,"2 to the third power, which is negative 2 times"
,"negative 2 times negative 2, which is negative 8. Negative 2 times negative 2 is"
,"positive 4, times negative 2 again is equal to negative 8. We could do even"
,more complex things. We could have an expression
,"like the square root of x plus y and then minus x, like that. Let's say that x is equal"
,to 1 and y is equal to 8. Then this expression
,"would evaluate to, well, every time we see an x,"
,"we want to put a 1 there. So we would have a 1 there,"
,"and you'd have a 1 over there. And every time you see a y,"
,"you would put an 8 in its place in this context. We're setting these variables. So you'd see an 8. Under the radical sign,"
,you would have a 1 plus 8. So you'd have the principal
,"root of 9, which is 3. This whole thing would simplify. In this context, when"
,"we set these variables to be these things, this whole"
,thing would simplify to be 3. 1 plus 8 is 9. The principal root of that is 3. And then you'd have 3 minus
,"1, which is equal to 2."

8htcZca0JIA,"Welcome to the presentation on exponents. If I were to ask you what -- let me make sure this pen is the right width-- if I were to ask you what two times three is, well I think at this point this should be pretty easy for you. That's the same thing as two plus two plus two, which equals six. You didn't have to do this. You all know that two times three is equal to six. So what we're going to do now is we're going to learn exponents which are the same thing that multiplication is to addition, exponents are to multiplication. I'll explain that in a second. I know that probably confused you. If I were to say what two to the third power is, instead of two "
,"plus two plus two, this is equal to two times two times two, which equals eight. Or if I were to say three the second power, that is equal to three times three. Remember, I said three times two would be three plus three. So the first three times three this equals nine, and three plus three equals six. The reason why I'm doing this is because there's always this temptation when you first learn exponents is to multiply. When I first learned it and I saw three to the second power or three squared, I'd always be like oh, that's six. But you also remember it's three times three, which equals nine. Let's do some more problems. If I were to tell you negative "
,"four squared. Once again, that's the same thing as negative four times negative four. Well, we all learn from multiplying negative numbers that a negative times a negative is a positive. And then four times four, well this equals positive sixteen. You don't have to write the positive, I'm just doing that for emphasis. If I would ask you what negative four to the third power is, well that equals negative four times negative four times negative four. Well we know already that negative four times negative four, that this equals sixteen, positive sixteen, and then we multiply that times negative four. And then that equals minus sixty-four. So something very interesting here to observe. When I took a negative number, and we call this the base, when the base is negative, in this case, negative four, and I raise it to an even power, I got a positive number, right? Negative four to an even power is positive sixteen, and when I took a negative number to an odd power, to three, I got a negative number. And that makes sense because every time you multiply by a negative number again, it switches signs. I'll show you the, I guess you'd call it the simplest example. Negative one to the one power is equal to negative one, right? Because that's just negative one times itself one time. And if I said negative one squared, well that's negative one times negative one, well that equals positive one. But if I said negative one to the third power, once again that's negative one times negative one times negative one. Well now this equals negative one times negative one is positive one times negative one equals negative one again. So I could tell "
,"you what negative one to the fifty-first power is. Because fifty-one is odd, we know that that is equal to negative one. If it was a fifty then it would be a positive one. Hope I didn't confuse you too much. Let's do a couple more problems. If I asked you what five to the third power is, well that will go into five times five times five, which equals one hundred and twenty-five. So really if I were ask to ask what negative five to the third power is, that would be negative five times negative five times negative five, which would be negative one hundred and twenty-five. Now one principle of exponents that might not seem completely intuitive to you at first is when I raise something to the zero power. So let's say I had two to the zero power. It turns out that anything to the zero power is equal to one. So two to the zero power is one, three to the zero power is equal to one, negative nine hundred to the zero power is equal to one. And let me see if I can give you a little bit of intuition of why that is actually the case. So if I were to ask you, let's do three to the fourth power. That equals three times three times three times three, which equals eighty-one. three to the third power is equal to twenty-seven, this three times three times three. three to second power is equal to nine. three to the first power is equal to three. Now we're going to say what's three to zero power? Well we already know, I already told you the rule, anything with the zero power is equal to one, but this will hopefully give you some intuition. When we went from the fourth power to the third power, we divided by three, right? eighty-one divided by three is twenty-seven. When you went from the third power to the second power, we divided by three. When we went from the second power from nine to three, we divided by three. So it kind of makes logical sense that when we go from the first power to the zero power, we'll just divide by three again. So three divided by three is one. Hopefully that gives you a little bit of an intuitive sense. You might want to replay that and think about why that is. And there's actually other aspects of exponents that why this also makes sense, why something to the zero power is equal to one. But let's just do some more problems in the time we have. I don't want to get you too confused. So if I were to ask you seven squared, well that's seven times seven, that's forty-nine. If I asked you negative six to the third power -- parentheses around here so you know it's a whole negative six to the third power-- that equals negative six times negative six times negative six. Negative six times negative six is positive thirty-six times negative six, and that equals what? It's one hundred and eighty and thirty-six, that's minus two hundred and sixteen, if my mental math is correct. You could have actually multiplied it out. I think you're getting the point at this point. Oh, and another thing, if I told you zero to the hundredth power, well, that's pretty easy. That's zero times itself one hundred times, which is still equal to zero. If I were to ask you one to the thousandth power, well that's just equal to one, right? You can multiply one by itself as many times as you want and you're still going to get one. And remember, if I had negative one to the one thousandth power, well, this is an even exponent so you're still going to get one. If it was negative one to the one thousand and one, then it would be negative one. I think you remember why this is, because when you multiply a negative times itself an even number of times, the negatives cancel out. And then if you multiply it by a negative one more time it becomes a negative number again. Well let's just do some normal problems. I just want to make sure you get the basics of exponents down. If I were to tell you -- let me think of a good one-- eight squared, that equals eight times eight equals sixty-four. If I were to tell you twenty-five squared, that's twenty-five times twenty-five, which equals six hundred and twenty-five. Powers of two is always very interesting. It's especially interesting if you "
,"one day go into computer science. So two to the fourth power, that's two times two times two times two. So two times two is four so this equals sixteen. And I did something very interesting here kind of on purpose. Notice that two to the fourth is equal to four times four, right? Because we did four times four here. I'm going to detail this more later on, but I want to think about what that means. Because four itself is the same thing as two squared. So we learned, just real fast, two to the fourth is the same thing as two squared times two squared. So I'll let you sit and think about that, but other than that I think you have the general idea of how basic exponents work, and I think you're ready to try the level one exponent module. have fun."

lZfXc4nHooo,We already know a good
,"bit about exponents. For example, we know"
,if we took the number 4 and raised it to
,"the third power, this is equivalent"
,to taking three fours and multiplying them. Or you can also view it
,"as starting with a 1, and then multiplying the 1"
,"by 4, or multiplying that by 4, three times. But either way, this is"
,"going to result in 4 times 4 is 16, times 4 is 64. We also know a little bit"
,"about negative exponents. So for example, if I were take"
,"4 to the negative 3 power, we know this negative"
,tells us to take the reciprocal 1/4 to the third. And we already know
,"4 to the third is 64, so this is going to be 1/64. Now let's think about"
,fractional exponents. So we're going to think about
,what is 4 to the 1/2 power. And I encourage you
,to pause the video and at least take a guess
,"about what you think this is. So, the mathematical"
,"convention here, the mathematical definition"
,"that most people use, or in fact that all people use here,"
,is that 4 to the 1/2 power is the exact same thing
,as the square root of 4. And we'll talk in the
,"future about why this is, and the reason why this"
,"is defined this way, is it has all sorts of"
,neat and elegant properties when you start manipulating
,the actual exponents. But what is the
,"square root of 4, especially the"
,"principal root, mean? Well that means,"
,"well, what is a number that if I were to"
,"multiply it by itself, or if I were to have"
,two of those numbers and I were to multiply
,"them, times each other, that same number,"
,"I'm going to get 4? Well, what times"
,itself is equal to 4? Well that's of
,course equal to 2. And just to get a sense of why
,"this starts to work out, well remember, we could"
,have also written that 4 is equal to 2 squared. So you're starting to see
,something interesting. 4 to the 1/2 is equal to
,"2, 2 squared is equal to 4. So let's get a couple"
,"more examples of this, just so you make sure"
,you get what's going on. And I encourage you to pause
,it as much as necessary and try to figure
,it out yourself. So based on what
,"I just told you, what do you think 9 to the"
,"1/2 power is going to be? Well, that's just"
,"the square root of 9. The principal root of 9, that's"
,"just going to be equal to 3. And likewise, we"
,"could've also said that 3 squared is, or"
,"let me write it this way, that 9 is equal to 3 squared. These are both true statements. Let's do one more like this. What is 25 to the"
,"1/2 going to be? Well, this is just"
,"going to be 5. 5 times 5 is 25. Or you could say, 25"
,"is equal to 5 squared. Now, let's think about what"
,happens when you take something to the 1/3 power. So let's imagine taking
,8 to the 1/3 power. So the definition here
,is that taking something to the 1/3 power
,is the same thing as taking the cube
,root of that number. And the cube root is just
,"saying, well what number, if I had three of that"
,"number, and I multiply them, that I'm going to get 8. So something, times something,"
,"times something, is 8. Well, we already know that 8 is"
,equal to 2 to the third power. So the cube root of
,"8, or 8 to the 1/3, is just going to be equal to 2. This says hey,"
,"give me the number that if I say that number, times"
,"that number, times that number, I'm going to get 8. Well, that number is 2 because"
,"2 to the third power is 8. Do a few more examples of that. What is 64 to the 1/3 power? Well, we already know that"
,4 times 4 times 4 is 64. So this is going to be 4. And we already wrote over here
,that 64 is the same thing as 4 to the third. I think you're starting to see
,"a little bit of a pattern here, a little bit of symmetry here. And we can extend this idea to"
,arbitrary rational exponents. So what happens if I were
,"to raise-- let's say I had, let me think of a good number"
,"here-- so let's say I have 32. I have the number 32, and I"
,"raise it to the 1/5 power. So this says hey,"
,give me the number that if I were to
,"multiply that number, or I were to repeatedly"
,"multiply that number five times, what is that, I would get 32. Well, 32 is the same thing as"
,"2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 2. So 2 is that number, that"
,"if I were to multiply it five times, then"
,I'm going to get 32. So this right over here
,"is 2, or another way of saying this kind of same"
,statement about the world is that 32 is equal to
,2 to the fifth power.
,
zM_p7tfWvLU,"In this video, I want to do a"
,"bunch of examples involving exponent properties. But, before I even do that,"
,let's have a little bit of a review of what an exponent
,even is. So let's say I had 2
,to the third power. You might be tempted to
,"say, oh is that 6? And I would say no,"
,"it is not 6. This means 2 times itself,"
,three times. So this is going to be equal to
,"2 times 2 times 2, which is equal to 2 times 2 is 4. 4 times 2 is equal to 8. If I were to ask you what 3 to"
,"the second power is, or 3 squared, this is equal to 3"
,times itself two times. This is equal to 3 times 3. Which is equal to 9. Let's do one more of these. I think you're getting the
,"general sense, if you've never seen these before. Let's say I have 5 to"
,the seventh power. That's equal to 5 times
,"itself, seven times. 5 times 5 times 5 times 5"
,"times 5 times 5 times 5. That's seven, right? One, two, three, four,"
,"five, six, seven. This is going to be a really,"
,"really, really, really, large number and I'm not going to"
,"calculate it right now. If you want to do it by hand,"
,"feel free to do so. Or use a calculator, but this"
,"is a really, really, really, large number. So one thing that you might"
,appreciate very quickly is that exponents increase
,very rapidly. 5 to the 17th would be even a
,"way, way more massive number. But anyway, that's a review"
,of exponents. Let's get a little bit steeped
,"in algebra, using exponents. So what would 3x-- let me do"
,this in a different color-- what would 3x times
,"3x times 3x be? Well, one thing you need to"
,"remember about multiplication is, it doesn't matter what"
,order you do the multiplication in. So this is going to be the same
,thing as 3 times 3 times 3 times x times x times x. And just based on what we
,"reviewed just here, that part right there, 3 times 3,"
,"three times, that's 3 to the third power. And this right here, x times"
,itself three times. that's x to the third power. So this whole thing can be
,rewritten as 3 to the third times x to the third. Or if you know what 3 to the
,"third is, this is 9 times 3, which is 27. This is 27 x to the"
,"third power. Now you might have said, hey,"
,wasn't 3x times 3x times 3x. Wasn't that 3x to
,the third power? Right? You're multiplying 3x times
,"itself three times. And I would say, yes it is. So this, right here, you could"
,"interpret that as 3x to the third power. And just like that, we stumbled"
,on one of our exponent properties. Notice this. When I have something times
,"something, and the whole thing is to the third power, that"
,equals each of those things to the third power times
,each other. So 3x to the third is the same
,"thing is 3 to the third times x to the third, which is"
,27 to the third power. Let's do a couple
,more examples. What if I were to ask you what
,6 to the third times 6 to the sixth power is? And this is going to be a really
,"huge number, but I want to write it as a power of 6. Let me write the 6 to the sixth"
,in a different color. 6 to the third times 6 to the
,"sixth power, what is this going to be equal to? Well, 6 to the third, we"
,know that's 6 times itself three times. So it's 6 times 6 times 6. And then that's going to be
,"times-- the times here is in green, so I'll do it in green. Maybe I'll make both"
,of them in orange. That is going to be times
,"6 to the sixth power. Well, what's 6 to"
,the sixth power? That's 6 times itself
,"six times. So, it's 6 times 6 times"
,6 times 6 times 6. Then you get one
,"more, times 6. So what is this whole"
,"number going to be? Well, this whole thing-- we're"
,"multiplying 6 times itself-- how many times? One, two, three, four,"
,"five, six, seven, eight, nine times, right? Three times here and then"
,another six times here. So we're multiplying 6 times
,itself nine times. 3 plus 6. So this is equal to 6 to
,"the 3 plus 6 power or 6 to the ninth power. And just like that,"
,"we/ve stumbled on another exponent property. When we take exponents, in this"
,"case, 6 to the third, the number 6 is the base. We're taking the base to"
,"the exponent of 3. When you have the same base,"
,"and you're multiplying two exponents with the same base,"
,you can add the exponents. Let me do several more
,examples of this. Let's do it in magenta. Let's say I had 2 squared times
,"2 to the fourth times 2 to the sixth. Well, I have the same base"
,"in all of these, so I can add the exponents. This is going to be equal to 2"
,"to the 2 plus 4 plus 6, which is equal to 2 to"
,"the 12th power. And hopefully that makes sense,"
,"because this is going to be 2 times itself two times,"
,"2 times itself four times, 2 times itself"
,"six times. When you multiply them all out,"
,"it's going to be 2 times itself, 12 times or 2"
,to the 12th power. Let's do it in a little bit more
,"abstract way, using some variables, but it's the"
,same exact idea. What is x to the squared or x
,"squared times x to the fourth? Well, we could use the property"
,we just learned. We have the exact
,"same base, x. So it's going to be x to"
,the 2 plus 4 power. It's going to be x to
,the sixth power. And if you don't believe
,"me, what is x squared? x squared is equal"
,to x times x. And if you were going to
,"multiply that times x to the fourth, you're multiplying it by"
,x times itself four times. x times x times x times x. So how many times are you now
,"multiplying x by itself? Well, one, two, three, four,"
,"five, six times. x to the sixth power. Let's do another one of these. The more examples you see,"
,"I figure, the better. So let's do the other"
,"property, just to mix and match it. Let's say I have a to the third"
,to the fourth power. So I'll tell you the property
,"here, and I'll show you why it makes sense. When you add something to an"
,"exponent, and then you raise that to an exponent, you can"
,multiply the exponents. So this is going to be a to the
,3 times 4 power or a to the 12th power. And why does that make sense? Well this right here
,is a to the third times itself four times. So this is equal to a to the
,third times a to the third times a to the third times
,"a to the third. Well, we have the same base, so"
,we can add the exponents. So there's going to be a to
,"the 3 times 4, right? This is equal to a to the 3"
,"plus 3 plus 3 plus 3 power, which is the same thing"
,is a the 3 times 4 power or a to the 12th power. So just to review the properties
,"we've learned so far in this video, besides"
,"just a review of what an exponent is, if I have x to the"
,"a power times x to the b power, this is going"
,to be equal to x to the a plus b power. We saw that right here. x squared times x to the fourth
,"is equal to x to the sixth, 2 plus 4. We also saw that if I have x"
,"times y to the a power, this is the same thing is"
,x to the a power times y to the a power. We saw that early on
,in this video. We saw that over here. 3x to the third is the same
,thing as 3 to the third times x to the third. That's what this is
,saying right here. 3x to the third is the same
,"thing is 3 to the third times x to the third. And then the last property,"
,"which we just stumbled upon is, if you have x to the a and"
,"then you raise that to the bth power, that's equal to"
,x to the a times b. And we saw that right there. a
,to the third and then raise that to the fourth power is the
,same thing is a to the 3 times 4 or a to the
,12th power. So let's use these properties
,to do a handful of more complex problems. Let's say
,we have 2xy squared times negative x squared
,y squared times three x squared y squared. And we wanted to
,simplify this. This you can view as
,negative 1 times x squared times y squared. So if we take this whole thing
,"to the squared power, this is like raising each of these"
,to the second power. So this part right here could
,"be simplified as negative 1 squared times x squared squared,"
,times y squared. And then if we were to simplify
,"that, negative 1 squared is just 1, x squared"
,squared-- remember you can just multiply the exponents-- so
,that's going to be x to the fourth y squared. That's what this middle
,part simplifies to. And let's see if we can merge
,"it with the other parts. The other parts, just to"
,"remember, were 2 xy squared, and then 3x squared y squared. Well now we're just going ahead"
,and just straight up multiplying everything. And we learned in multiplication
,that it doesn't matter which order you
,multiply things in. So I can just rearrange. We're just going and multiplying
,2 times x times y squared times x to the fourth
,"times y squared times 3 times x squared times y squared. So I can rearrange this, and I"
,will rearrange it so that it's in a way that's easy
,"to simplify. So I can multiply 2 times 3, and"
,then I can worry about the x terms. Let me do it in this color. Then I have times x times x to
,the fourth times x squared. And then I have to worry about
,"the y terms, times y squared times another y squared times"
,another y squared. And now what are
,"these equal to? Well, 2 times 3. You knew how to do that. That's equal to 6. And what is x times x to the"
,"fourth times x squared. Well, one thing to remember is"
,x is the same thing as x to the first power. Anything to the first power
,"is just that number. So you know, 2 to the first"
,power is just 2. 3 to the first power
,is just 3. So what is this going
,to be equal to? This is going to be equal to--
,"we have the same base, x. We can add the exponents, x to"
,"the 1 plus 4 plus 2 power, and I'll add it in the next step. And then on the y's, this"
,is times y to the 2 plus 2 plus 2 power. And what does that give us? That gives us 6 x to the
,"seventh power, y to the sixth power. And I'll just leave you with"
,"some thing that you might already know, but it's"
,pretty interesting. And that's the question of what
,happens when you take something to the zeroth power? So if I say 7 to the zeroth
,"power, What does that equal? And I'll tell you right now--"
,and this might seem very counterintuitive-- this is equal
,"to 1, or 1 to the zeroth power is also equal to 1. Anything that the zeroth power,"
,any non-zero number to the zero power is going
,to be equal to 1. And just to give you
,a little bit of intuition on why that is. Think about it this way. 3 to the first power-- let me
,"write the powers-- 3 to the first, second, third. We'll just do it the"
,"with the number 3. So 3 to the first power is 3. I think that makes sense. 3 to the second power is 9. 3 to the third power is 27. And of course, we're trying to    "
,"figure out what should 3 to the zeroth power be? Well, think about it. Every time you decrement"
,the exponent. Every time you take the exponent
,"down by 1, you are dividing by 3. To go from 27 to 9,"
,"you divide by 3. To go from 9 to 3,"
,you divide by 3. So to go from this exponent to
,"that exponent, maybe we should divide by 3 again. And that's why, anything to"
,"the zeroth power, in this case, 3 to the zeroth"
,power is 1. See you in the next video.
,
JnpqlXN9Whw,We already know that
,2 to the fourth power can be viewed as
,starting with a 1 and then multiplying
,"it by 2 four times. So let me do that. So times 2, times"
,"2, times 2, times 2. And that will give us, let's"
,"see, 2 times 2 is 4, 8, 16. So that will give us 16. Now I will ask you a more"
,interesting question. What do you think 2 to
,the negative 4 power is? And I encourage you to pause
,"the video and think about that. Well, you might be"
,"tempted to say, oh maybe it's negative 16 or"
,"something like that, but remember what the exponent"
,operation is trying to do. One way of viewing it
,is this is telling us how many times are we going to
,multiply 2 times negative 1? But here we're going to
,"multiply negative 4 times. Well, what does negative"
,traditionally mean? Negative traditionally
,means the opposite. So here this is how many times
,you're going to multiply. Maybe when we make it
,"negative this says, how many times are"
,"we going to, starting with the 1, how many times"
,are we going to divide by 2? So let's think about
,that a little that. So this could be
,"viewed as 1 times, and we're going to"
,"divide by 2 four times. Well, dividing by 2 is the same"
,thing as multiplying by 1/2. So we could say that
,"this is 1 times 1/2, times-- let me just"
,"do it in one color. So 1 times 1/2, times"
,"1/2, times 1/2, times 1/2. Notice multiplying"
,by 1/2 four times is the exact same thing as
,dividing by 2 four times. And in this situation
,"this would get you, well 1/2, well 1 times 1/2 half"
,"is just 1/2, times 1/2 is 1/4, times 1/2 is 1/8,"
,times 1/2 is 1/16. And so you probably see
,the relationship here. If you're-- this is essentially
,you're starting with the 1 and you're dividing
,by 2 four times. You could also say that 2-- I'm
,going to do the same colors-- 2 to the negative 4 is
,the same thing as 1/2 to the fourth power. Let me color code
,it nicely so you realize what the
,negative is doing. So this negative
,right over here-- let me do that in
,"a better color, I'll do it in magenta,"
,something that jumps out. So this negative
,"right over here, this is what's causing"
,us to go one over. So 2 to the negative
,"4 is the same thing, based on the way we've"
,"defined it just up right here, as reciprocal of 2 to"
,"the fourth, or 1 over 2 to the fourth. And so you could view this as"
,"being 1/2 times 2 times 2 times 2, if you just view"
,2 to the fourth as taking four 2's
,and multiplying them. Or if you use this
,"idea right over here, you could view it"
,as starting with a 1 and multiplying it
,"by 2 four times. Either way, you are"
,going to get 1/16. So let's do a few
,more examples of this just so that we make sure
,things are clear to us. So let's try 3 to the
,"negative third power. So remember, whenever"
,"you see that negative, what my brain"
,always does is say I need to take the
,reciprocal here. So this is going
,"to be equal to, I'm going to highlight"
,"the negative again, this is going to be 1"
,over 3 to the third power. Which would be equal to 1/3
,"times 3 times 3, or 1 times 3 times 3 times 3,"
,"is going to be 27. So this is going to be 1/27. Let's try another example,"
,I'll do two or three more. So let's take a negative number
,"to a negative exponent, just to see if we can"
,confuse ourselves. So let's take the
,"number negative 4, and let's take it-- I don't want"
,my numbers to get too big too fast. So let's just take
,negative 2 and let's take it to the negative 3 power. I'll make my negatives in
,"magenta, negative 3 power. So at first this"
,"might be daunting, do the negatives cancel? And that will just be the"
,remnants in your brain that are trying to think
,"of multiplying negatives. Do not apply that here. Remember, you see a"
,"negative exponent, that just means the reciprocal"
,of the positive exponent. So 1 over negative 2
,"to the third power, to the positive third power. And this is equal to 1"
,over negative 2 times negative 2 times negative 2. Or you could view it as
,1 times negative 2 times negative 2 times
,"negative 2, which is going to give you 1 over"
,negative 8 or negative 1/8. Let me scroll over
,"a little bit, I don't want to have to"
,start squishing things. So this is equal
,"to negative 1/8. Let's do one more example,"
,just in an attempt to confuse ourselves. Let's take 5/8 and raise
,"this to the negative 2 power. So once again, this negative,"
,oh I got at a fraction is a negative here. Remember this just means 1
,over 5/8 to the second power. So this is just going
,"to be the same thing as 1 over 5/8 squared,"
,which is going to be the same thing-- so this
,"is going to be equal to-- I'm trying to color code it, 1 over"
,"5/8 times 5/8, which is 25/64. 1 over 25/64 is just"
,going to be 64/25. So another way to
,"think about it is, you're going to take"
,the reciprocal of this and raise it to the
,positive exponent. So another way you could
,have thought about this is 5/8 to the negative 2 power. Let me just take the
,"reciprocal of this, 8/5 and raise it to the"
,positive 2 power. So all of these
,statements are equivalent. And that would have
,applied even when you're dealing with
,"non-fractions as your base right over here. So 2, you could say well this"
,is going to be the same thing. 2 to the negative
,4 is going to be the same thing as
,taking my reciprocal. So this is going to
,be the same thing as taking the reciprocal
,"of 2, which is 1/2 and raising it to"
,the positive 4 power.

WwHyPoqUQec,assume you've been asked to write down 3 x 3 remember you haven't been asked to calculate it so you pick up your pen and write it as 3 times 3 here we are multiplying 3 by itself just once now let's say you've been asked to write down 3 x 3 x 3 you write it down as 3 times 3 times 3 in this example we are multiplying 3 by itself twice 3 multiplied by itself multiplied by itself now you've been asked to write down 3 x 3 x 3 and so on 7 times so now you're kind of bored but you don't have a choice so you write 3 times 3 times 3 times 3 and so on 7 times yes I know what you're thinking the more number of times you multiply a number by itself the more tedious it gets for you to write it down so that brings us to the question is there an easier way to denote these kind of operations what kind of operations am i talking about here the ones in which a number is multiplied by itself many number of times the answer to that question is yes we do which brings us to the topic of exponents 3 multiplied by 3 can be written as 3 with a 2 in the superscript this is read as 3 raised to 2 how do we get a 2 it depends on the number of threes you can see so we have 2 3 0 and hence we write it as 3 raised to 2 in the second case we can see three threes hence it can be written as 3 raised to 3 how do we get a 3 in the superscript that's because we have three threes and in the final example we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 7 threes so we write this long string of numbers of seven threes as 3 raised to 7 if we have any number say a multiplied by itself many times we write it as a multiplied by a multiplied by a multiplied by a and so on if there are n number of A's in this product then it can be written as a raised to n the number of a is called the base and the number n is called the exponent in the three examples we 
,saw all of them have a base equal to three it is just the exponent that varies in the first case the exponent was two in the second case the exponent was three and in the final example the exponent was seven in the coming videos we will look at the different properties of exponents
,
Zt2fdy3zrZU,in this video we're going to focus on simplifying exponents but let's go over some basic properties what is X to the fourth x x to the fifth what is that equal to whenever you multiply by a common base you need to add the exponents 4 plus 5 is 9 X to the fourth is basically multiplying 4 X variables together and X to the fifth is equivalent to multiplying five X variables together so in total you're multiplying 9 X variables together and so that's why it's equal to X to the ninth now what about division let's say if you divide by a common base what should you do with the exponents you need to subtract X it is 7 divided by X to the 3 it needs to subtract 7 by 3 and that's going to be exit for X to the 7 is equivalent to 7 X variables multiplied to each other and X cubed is simply x times X times X so we can cancel 
,3 X variables which we'll leave behind for X variables on top and so that's the answer there's another one what is X to the third raised to the fourth power what should we do whenever we raise one exponent to another in a situation like this you need to multiply it's going to be 3 times 4 which is 12 so X to the third raised to 
,the fourth power means that you're multiplying 4 x cubed values and each x cubed is basically three X variables multiplied to each other so if you count all the X variables what we have is a total of 12 and so that's why it's equal to X to the 12 now what about X raised to the 0 power what is that equal to anything raised to the 0 power is 1 so 4 to 0 is 1 now what about X raised to the negative 3 what should we do if we have negative exponents if you have a negative exponent all you could 
,do is take the variable move it to the bottom when you do that the negative 3 will become positive 3 and so it's 1 over X cubed likewise let's say if you have 1 divided by X raised to the negative 4 you can move the X variable to the top any exponent will change sign so it's going to be X to the positive 4 over 1 or simply X raised to the 4th power that is the question theme what is the value of negative 3 squared what do you think that's equal to now what about negative 3 squared within a 
,parenthesis negative 3 squared is basically negative 3 times negative 3 we have two of them so this is equal to positive 9 now what we have here is one negative and 
,two threes this 2 does not apply to the negative sign so we only have one negative sign so this is negative and then 3 times 3 is 9 so the whole answer is negative 9 so just keep in mind the difference between the two you can confirm this in a calculator if you type in negative 3 squared just the way you see it like this you should get negative 9 so tree typing like this in your calculator it should give you positive 9 go ahead and simplify these problems simplify the following expressions 
,so let's say this is the first one here's the next one X cubed raised to the negative 5 and also X to the seventh power divided by X to the 12 go ahead and work on these examples so when multiplying by when multiplying haben bases in to add the exponents 4 plus negative 9 is negative 5 and X raised to the negative 5 is equivalent to 1 over X to the 5th so if you get any negative exponents make it positive now here we have one exponent raised to another so we need to multiply 3 times negative 5 is negative 15 x to the negative 15 is 1 over X to the positive 15 so this is the final answer for that problem now for the last one we need to subtract we're going to take the top number and subtracted by the bottom number 7 minus 12 is negative 5 and this is the same as 1 over X to the 5 now let's talk about that example X is 7th means that we have 7x variables X to the 12 means that we have a total of 12 X variables multiplied to each other so we can cancel all 7 X variables on top and seven on the bottom and notice that we have five X variables left on the bottom and that's why it's run over X to the 5 what is the value of 3x squared raised to 
,the third power go ahead and simplify this expression so 3 is the same as 3 to the first whenever you raise one exponent to another you need to multiply but we have 
,2 X 1 is here so we need to distribute the 3 to the 1 and to the 2 so 3 times 1 is 3 and 2 times 3 is 6 so this is 3 to the 3rd times X to the 6 so let's drink to the 3rd 3 to the 3rd is 3 times 3 times 3 3 times 3 is 9 and 9 times 3 is 27 so the final answer is 27 times x-rays to six power try this one negative two okay that doesn't look like a - let's do that again negative two X cubed Y to the fourth raised to the second power feel free to pause the video and work on that example so this is raised to the first power and if we multiply by two we're going to have negative two to the second power and then three times two is six so we're going to have X - 6 + 4 times 2 is 8 so this is going to be Y to the negative 2 squared that's basically negative 2 times negative 2 that's equal to positive 4 so the answer is 4 X to the sixth Y raised to the 8th power what is the value of 5 X cubed x 4 X to the seventh power so what should be doing this example so first we need to multiply 5 times 4 5 times 4 is 20 and then we need to multiply X cubed times X - 7 in which case we need to add 3 plus 7 is 10 so this is simply 20 X to the 10th so try this 
,example 7 X to the 6 times 5 X to the 4th and also 4 X Q Y squared times 7 X to the negative fourth + y to the 3rd so in the first example we need to multiply 7 by 5 7 times 5 is 35 and then we got to multiply X - 6 times X to the 4th 6 plus 4 is 10 so it's 35 X at a 10 now the next example we're going to multiply 4 by 7 which is 28 and then X cubed times X and negative fourth so we're going to add 3 plus negative 4 which is a negative 1 and then finally we got to multiply y squared times y cube 2 plus 3 is 5 so it's Y to the fifth power now we need to get rid of the negative x one so let's move the X variable to the bottom so it's 28 y to the fifth divided by X and so that's the answer what is negative 2 X cubed Y raised to the 0 power what is that equal to anything raised to 0 power keep in mind is 1 now what about negative 4 X to the 0 power what is that equal to you need to realize that this is negative 4 times X raised to 0 power this 0 only applies to X so this portion 
,highlighted in red that's equal to 1 so it's negative 4 times 1 and that's negative 4 so anything that's affected by the 0 exponent will become a 1 anything outside 
,of that is unaffected try this problem what is 24x to the 7th Y to the 3rd divided by 8 X to the 4th Y to the negative 12 so in this case we'll need to divide 24 divided by 8 is 3 X to the 7th divided by X to the fourth is X cubed 7 minus 4 is 3 and for the Y variables we need to subtract 3 minus negative 12 is the same as 3 plus 12 so this becomes wife's insistence and so that's the answer what is 35 X cubed Y to the fifth divided by 60 3 X to the negative fourth Y to the seventh squared what is that equal to so we could distribute the two or we could simplify first we could divide first or distribute the exponent let's divide first 35 is basically 5 
,times 7 and 63 is 9 times 7 now X to the 3rd divided by X to the negative fourth that's going to be 3 minus negative 4 which is 3 plus 4 and at 7 so we're going to have X - 7 on top and then we have 5 minus 7 which is negative 2 it's a negative 2 on the top but if we bring to the bottom it's going to be positive 2 on the bottom 
,so let's go ahead and do that and this is still raised to the second power now the last thing we could do is cancel the sudden let's get rid of this stuff so we have 5 X to the 7th divided by 9 y squared raised to the 2nd power 5 squared is 25 and X to the 7th raised to the second power it's going to be X - 14 7 times 2 is 14 9 
,squared is 81 and 2 times 2 is 4 so this should be the final answer

mfMAbap5Rms,hi I'm Lucy and in this video we're going to look at indices see this small floating number here and here this is an indexed number or a power and the plural of index number is indices hence the title of this video it just tells us how many times a number or letter has been multiplied by itself so 3 squared means 3 multiplied by 3 twice X cubed means X multiplied by X multiplied by X so 3 x + 2 y ^ 4 means 2y x 2y 4 times you know how in algebra we have silent ones so we don't write one a we just write a something without a power so be for example really means B ^ 1 but the one is silence we don't write it can you answer these three questions pause the video work out the answer and click play when you're ready to check did you get them right so that's the admin part covered now we are ready to look at the laws of 
,indices these laws or rules make complex sums which involve powers much easier and they are also essential for understanding lots of algebraic processes watch our law of indices videos to discover more

GipavLCnke0,in this video we're going to talk about how to simplify fractional exponents so let's go ahead and begin let's say if we have 8 raised to the 2 over 3 power what is 
,that equal to how can we find the value of this expression if you know the answer or if you know how to do it feel free to pause the video and try now the best way to answer it is to separate the fraction into two parts so this is equivalent to 8 raised to the 1/3 power which is raised to the second power 1/3 times 2 is 2/3 so what is 8 raised to the 1/3 whenever you raise something to the 1/3 power you're basically looking for the cube root so what is the cube root of 8 what number times itself 3 times is 8 so what times what times what is the game it turns out that the cube root of 8 is 2 2 times 2 times 2 3 times is a and so now we got to figure out what 2 squared is 2 squared is basically taking two 2s and multiplying them together 2 squared is equal to 4 and so 8 raised to the 2/3 power is 4 so now that you know how to do that one go ahead and try this one calculate the value of 16 raised to the 5/4 so first let's find the fourth root of 16 and then let's raise it to the fifth power so what number times itself 4 times is equal to 16 the fourth root of 16 is 2 because 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 4 times is 16 now what is the value of 2 to the fifth power 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 5 times is equal to 32 and so that's the answer let's try another example calculate the value of nine raised to the three over two so once again we're going to find the square root of 9 which is 9 to 1/2 and then we're going to raise it to the third power the square root of 9 is 3 and 3 to the third power which is basically 3 times 3 times 3 3 times 3 times 3 is 9 9 times 3 is 27 so 9 to the three-halves is 27 what is the cube root of 64 squared what can we do if we have a radical and an exponent on the inside or you can change it into its exponential form you can write it as a fractional exponent this is equivalent to 64 raised to the 2/3 which is the cube root of 64 raised to the second power now what is the cube root of 64 what number times itself three times is 64 four times four times four that's 64 so we're going to have a 4 squared and 4 squared or 4 times 4 is 16 so the cube root of 64 squared is simply 16 try this one calculate the fourth root of 81 cubed so let's rewriting this is 81 raised to the 3/4 which we can find the 4th root first and then we'll raise it to the third 
,power the fourth root of 81 is 3 because 3 times 3 times 3 times 3 4 times is 81 and 3 to the third we've calculated so this value already is 27 here's another one that we could try what about the fifth root of 32 raised to the fourth power so just like before we can rewrite it like this so we need to find the fifth root first and then raise it to the fourth power the fifth root of 32 is five I mean not five but two and choose to the fourth power that's two times two times two times two two times two is four and those twos will also make a 4 4 times 4 is 16 so 16 is the final answer now what would you do if we have a negative exponent let's say 25 raised to the 3 over 2 what is that equal if you have a negative exponent you can make it positive by taking the 25 and putting it to the bottom now first we need to find the square root of 25 and then we need to raise this to the third power the square root of 25 is 5 and 5 raised to the third power 5 times 5 times 5 3 times that's 125 so the final answer is 1 divided by a hundred and 25 and so that's it now how would you simplify this expression what is the cube root of x to the fourth power 
,multiplied by the fourth root of x to the fifth power what would you do here we can't multiply X to the fourth times X to the five the reason being is the index numbers are not the same if they were the same we could do that but since they're not the same we can so how can we simplify this expression in order to do so we need to convert the radical expression to a fractional exponent so the cube root of x to the fourth is the same as X 2 raised to the 4/3 and the other one is going to be X 
,raised to the 5/4 now let's go over some basic rules of algebra whenever you multiply by a common base you may add the exponents so x squared times X cube is X to the fifth power 2 plus 3 is 5 so in this case we need to add the two fractions and to add them you need to get common denominators so let's find out what 4 over 3 plus 5 over 4 is equal to the least common multiple of 3 & 4 is 12 so let's multiply this fraction by 3 over 3 and the other one by 4 over 4 so this is going to equal 16 over 12 plus 15 over 12 16 plus 15 is 31 so this is 31 over 12 so thus we have X raised to the 31 over 12 which we can rewrite it as the 12th root of x to the 31 power now if we want to we can simplify that radical it's not fully simplified but let's go ahead and simplify now how many times this 12 go into 31 12 goes into 31 2 
,times 12 times 2 is 24 but first I'm going to split into two radicals 24 + 7 adds up to 31 now 24 divided by 12 is 2 so this is going to be x squared the 12th root of x to the 7 so if you want to simplify it that's the final answer let's try this one what is the 5th root of x cubed divided by let's say the fourth root of x to the 7 try this one go ahead and simplify so first let's convert it into a fractional exponent this is going to be X 2 raised to the 3 over 5 divided by X raised to the 7 over 4 now when you divide in by few common bases you need to subtract the exponents 7 minus 2 is 5 so in this case you've got to subtract the fractions so we have 3 over 5 minus 7 over 4 so let's go ahead and get common denominators let's multiply this fraction by 5 over 5 and the other one by 4 over 4 so this will give us a common denominator of 24 times 3 is 12 4 times 5 is 20 7 times 5 is 35 and 12 minus 35 is negative 23 over 20 so that's what we have that is 20 X raised to the negative 23 over 20 which is 1 over X to the 23rd over 20 which if we convert it back to radical form this is the 20th root of x to the 23rd 20 goes into 23 one time so 
,we can take out an X and 23 minus 20 is stream so that's 3 left over but the index number will remain 20 but we have a 3 left over on the inside now some teachers may require you to put an ASCII value if you have an even index number and if you get an unexpected knock or you need to enclose it in parentheses I mean uh parentheses but absolute value so that you should write it as an absolute value of x times xx root of x cubed so this is going to be the final answer to this problem and so that's it for this video if you want to find more videos on algebra exponents order of operations feel free to check out my channel look for my playlists and you can find topics on chemistry physics and you can check out my website video - to development you can also access all of my playlists there as well so thanks for watching

KzfWUEJjG18,"Hi I’m Rob, welcome to Math Antics! In this video we’re gonna learn about how to do math with things that only sometimes happen. They might be likely or unlikely. We’re gonna learn about Probability. Usually in math we deal with things that always happen the same way. They’re completely certain. Like if you add 1 and 1 you’re always gonna get 2. If you multiply 2 and 3 you’re always gonna get 6. There’s no uncertainty at all. But in the real world things aren’t always so predictable. Take a coin toss for example. We can’t predict whether it will be heads or tails. It’s unpredictable or random, and that’s why some people will flip a coin to help decide "
,"which of two things to do. That’s how I make every decision in life Why am I not surprised? Oh no! Good luck But even though we don’t know what each coin flip is going to be, we do know a few things about it. We know that with a fair coin toss that heads is just as likely to show up as tails. The Probability of an event (like getting heads or getting tails) is a value that tells us HOW LIKELY that event is to happen. With our coin toss, since each side is just as likely, and there’s only two sides to a coin, if we flipped a coin a lot of times, we should expect that about half the flips will be heads and about half the flips will be tails. And that means the probability of flipping heads is the fraction one-half and the probability of flipping tails is also one-half. Let’s look at this in a little more detail on something called a Probability Line. It’s a number line that goes from 0 to 1. A probability of zero means that an event cannot happen, it’s impossible. And a probability of 1 means that an event is definitely going to happen, it’s certain. That’s why the probability line only goes from 0 to 1. An event can’t be less likely than "
,impossible and it can’t be more likely than certain. A probability of one-half (like with our coin toss) means that an event is just as likely to happen as it is to 
,"NOT happen. A probability less than one-half means that an event is unlikely and a probability greater than one-half means that an event is likely. Oh, and in addition to fractions, it’s also common to write probabilities as decimals or percentages, since you can easily convert between those three. A probability of 0 is the same as a 0 percent chance of something happening, a probability of one-half is the same as a 50 percent chance of something happening, and a probability of 1 is the same as a 100 percent chance of something happening. Now that you know how a coin toss works, let’s see an example of an event that is unlikely using something a little more complicated than a coin. Let’s take a look at dice. A standard die has 6 sides numbered 1 through 6. When you roll it, any of those sides is just as likely to "
,"come up as the others. That sounds a lot like flipping a coin doesn’t it? Each side of a die is just as likely to come up as the others and each side of a coin was just as likely to come up as the other. So you might expect that the probability of rolling a 3 is 50%. But remember, with a coin toss there were only 2 possibilities: heads or tails. With dice there are 6 possibilities. And that’s going to make a difference in its probability. One way to think about it is that it’s certain that "
,"one of those six sides will land facing upwards, which is a probability of 1 (or 100%) But since ONLY one side can face upwards for a given roll, we have to divide up that value among all the possibilities. In the case of a coin toss, since there were only 2 possibilities, we had to divide the probability by 2. 1 divided by 2 is one-half, (which is the decimal 0.5 or 50%) But with the die, we need to divide the probability up evenly between 6 possibilities. 1 divided by 6 is one-sixth which is equivalent to 0.167 (or 16.7%) So that would be right here on our probability line. That means it isn’t likely that I would roll a 3 for instance, but it’s just "
,"as likely as rolling any other number. And since all 6 numbers have the same probability, each number should come up about as often as the others. To see if they do, I’m going to conduct some trials. That’s an excellent argument. Allow me to deliberate. Guilty! Actually, when dealing with probability, a trial (which can also be "
,"called an experiment) is a process that has a random outcome …like tossing a coin or rolling dice or spinning a spinner. And the outcome of a trial is what happens in that particular trial. Like flipping heads, or rolling a 3. So I’m gonna conduct several trials by rolling a die multiple times and keeping track of how many times I roll each number. Ah ha! You said that each number would come up just as often as the other numbers. But look! There’s more 2s here than there are 5s. How do you "
,"explain that?! Well remember, we’re dealing with things that are random. They’re unpredictable. We can’t know exactly what will happen, just what will happen on average. So now I have to calculate the average? Well, when we say “on average” we mean that the more trials you do the closer you get to the expected probabilities. Keep watching. There. Now that we’ve done a LOT of trials you can see that our totals are much closer to what you would expect them to be. I guess you’re probably right. That’s one of the really important things to keep in mind about probability. If you do just a few trials, the results might not end up very close to what you’d expect. In fact, they could be way off! But if you do more trials, you increase your chances of reaching the expected probabilities. There’s another thing I should point out. Remember, the probability of flipping heads is 1/2 and the probability of flipping tails is 1/2. The probability of rolling a 1 is 1/6, and the probability of rolling any other number on a die is 1/6. If you add up the probabilities for the coin flip, you get 2/2 or 1. And if you add up the probabilities for rolling a die, you get 6/6 which is also 1. And that’s not just a coincidence. If you add up the probabilities of all possible outcomes of a trial, the total is going to be 1 or "
,100% because it is certain that at least one of those possibilities will happen. Let’s look at some more examples. For these examples we’ll use a spinner. If we had 
,"a spinner with just six equally sized sectors, the probabilities would be exactly the same as with dice. So we want a few more sectors. There, that’s more like it. Now we have 16 equally sized sectors. So, what is the probability of spinning a 12? Well, just like with the dice where, we had to split up the 100% between all six possibilities, we’ll do the same thing now, but we’ll split it up between 16 possibilities. So the probability of spinning a 12 is 1/16 or about 6% which is right here on the probability line. We can see that the probability of spinning a 12 is less likely than the probability of rolling a 3. And that makes sense because there are more possible outcomes with our spinner. But what if we color some of the sectors a different color and we want to know the probability of spinning a certain color? Now we have 5 sectors colored blue and 11 sectors colored yellow. So what is the probability of spinning a blue? Remember how with a coin toss, we ended up with the fraction 1 over 2 and with a die roll we got the fraction 1 over 6. In both cases we had 1 as the numerator. And that’s because we were interested in only ONE of the possible outcomes, like the probability of flipping heads or the probability of the number 3 being rolled. But in this case the top number of our fraction will be 5 because any of these 5 sectors will give us the color we want. And the bottom number will still be the total number of possibilities, which is 16 because that’s how many total sectors we have. So the probability of spinning a blue is 5/16 or about 31%. That’s still considered unlikely, but it is more likely than spinning a specific number. And this method will work for figuring out the probability of any event. You just make a fraction with the numerator as the number of outcomes that satisfy your requirement, and the denominator as the total number of possible outcomes. Let’s try the same method to find the probability of spinning a yellow. Our top number should be 11 because there’s 11 yellow sectors. And our bottom number should still be 16. So the probability of spinning a yellow is 11/16 or about 69%. Now "
,"we finally have a probability that’s considered likely. And it makes sense, because you can see by looking at our spinner that it’s more likely to spin a yellow than a blue. And you’ll notice, if we add up 5/16 and 11/16 we get 16/16 or a probability of 1. So that’s a good sign that we did it right. Let’s look at another example. Suppose we have a bag of marbles. There are 3 green marbles, 7 yellow marbles and 1 white marble. If we mix them up and pull out a marble at random, what’s the probability of it being green? Well, the top number of our probability fraction will be 3 because there’s 3 green marbles so there’s 3 outcomes that get us what we want. And the bottom number will be 11 because there’s a total of 11 possible marbles that we could pull out. So the probability of pulling out a green marble is 3/11 or 0.27 or 27% It’s right here on the probability line. That means it’s unlikely. And that makes sense because you can see that it would be less likely to pull out a green marble than one of the other ones. Let’s try this again for calculating the probability of pulling out a yellow marble. This time the numerator of our fraction "
,"will be 7 because there’s 7 yellow marbles. The denominator will still be 11 because there are still 11 marbles total. So the probability of pulling out a yellow marble is 7/11 or 0.64 or 64%. …another example of an event that is likely. …how about pulling out the white marble? Well, the top number will be 1 since there’s only one white marble. And the bottom number is still 11. So the probability of pulling out a white marble is 1/11 or 0.09 or 9% …not very likely. And if we add up these probabilities we get 11/11, or 100%, just as we expected. Alright! So you should have a pretty good handle on basic probability now. You just have to remember to make a fraction with the numerator being the number of outcomes that give you what you want, and the denominator being the total number of possibilities. And we learned "
,"about the Probability Line, and that a probability can’t be less than 0 or greater that 1 (or 100%). We also learned that the more trials or experiments you conduct, the closer your results will get to the expected probabilities. Of course the way to get good at it is to practice. So be sure to do a lot of problems on your own. "

S_OX3ByvBSc,"Now, let's think"
,about expressions with more than one variable. So say I had the
,expression a plus-- I'll do a really
,"simple one, a plus b. And I want to evaluate this"
,expression when a is equal to 7 and b is equal to 2. And I encourage you to pause
,"this and try this on your own. Well, wherever we see"
,"the a, we would just replace it with the 7. And wherever we see the b,"
,we'd replace it with the 2. So when a equals
,"7 and b equals 2, this expression"
,"will be 7 plus 2, which, of course, is equal to 9. So this expression"
,would be equal to 9 in this circumstance. Let's do a slightly
,more complicated one. Let's say we have the expression
,"x times y minus y plus x. Actually, let's make it plus 3x. Or another way of saying"
,it plus 3 times x. So let's evaluate this when x is
,"equal to 3 and y is equal to 2. And once again, I encourage"
,"you to pause this video and try this on your own. Well, everywhere we see an"
,"x, let's replace it with a 3. Every place we see a y,"
,let's replace it with a 2. So this is going to
,be equal to 3 times y. And y is 2 in this case. 3 times 2 minus 2
,plus this 3 times x. But x is also now equal to 3. So what is this
,"going to be equal to? Well, this is going to be"
,equal to 3 times 2 is 6. This 3 times 3 is 9. So it simplifies
,"to 6 minus 2, which is 4, plus 9, which"
,"is equal to 13. So in this case,"
,it is equal to 13.
,
h8EYEJ32oQ8,We will now begin our journey
,"into the world of statistics, which is really a way"
,to understand or get our head around data. So statistics is all about data. And as we begin our journey
,"into the world of statistics, we will be doing"
,a lot of what we can call descriptive statistics. So if we have a bunch
,"of data, and if we want to tell something"
,about all of that data without giving them
,"all of the data, can we somehow describe it"
,with a smaller set of numbers? So that's what we're
,going to focus on. And then once we
,build our toolkit on the descriptive
,"statistics, then we can start to make"
,"inferences about that data, start to make conclusions,"
,start to make judgments. And we'll start to do a lot
,"of inferential statistics, make inferences. So with that out of"
,"the way, let's think about how we can describe data. So let's say we have"
,a set of numbers. We can consider this to be data. Maybe we're measuring
,the heights of our plants in our garden. And let's say we
,"have six plants. And the heights are 4 inches,"
,"3 inches, 1 inch, 6 inches, and another one's 1 inch,"
,and another one is 7 inches. And let's say someone just
,"said-- in another room, not looking at your"
,"plants, just said, well, you know, how"
,tall are your plants? And they only want
,to hear one number. They want to somehow
,have one number that represents all of these
,"different heights of plants. How would you do that? Well, you'd say, well,"
,how can I find something that-- maybe I want
,a typical number. Maybe I want some number that
,somehow represents the middle. Maybe I want the
,most frequent number. Maybe I want the number
,that somehow represents the center of all
,of these numbers. And if you said any
,"of those things, you would actually have"
,done the same things that the people who first came
,"up with descriptive statistics said. They said, well,"
,how can we do it? And we'll start by thinking
,of the idea of average. And in every day
,"terminology, average has a very particular"
,"meaning, as we'll see. When many people"
,"talk about average, they're talking"
,"about the arithmetic mean, which we'll see shortly. But in statistics, average"
,means something more general. It really means
,"give me a typical, or give me a middle number,"
,or-- and these are or's. And really it's
,"an attempt to find a measure of central tendency. So once again, you have"
,a bunch of numbers. You're somehow trying
,to represent these with one number we'll call
,"the average, that's somehow typical, or middle,"
,"or the center somehow of these numbers. And as we'll see, there's"
,many types of averages. The first is the one that you're
,probably most familiar with. It's the one-- and
,"people talk about hey, the average on this exam"
,"or the average height. And that's the arithmetic mean. Just let me write it in. I'll write in yellow,"
,"arithmetic mean. When arithmetic is a noun,"
,we call it arithmetic. When it's an adjective like
,"this, we call it arithmetic, arithmetic mean. And this is really just the"
,sum of all the numbers divided by-- this is a human-constructed
,definition that we've found useful-- the sum of
,all these numbers divided by the number of
,"numbers we have. So given that, what"
,"is the arithmetic mean of this data set? Well, let's just compute it. It's going to be 4 plus"
,3 plus 1 plus 6 plus 1 plus 7 over the number
,"of data points we have. So we have six data points. So we're going to divide by 6. And we get 4 plus 3 is 7,"
,"plus 1 is 8, plus 6 is 14, plus 1 is 15, plus 7. 15 plus 7 is 22. Let me do that one more time. You have 7, 8, 14, 15,"
,"22, all of that over 6. And we could write"
,this as a mixed number. 6 goes into 22 three times
,"with a remainder of 4. So it's 3 and 4/6, which is"
,the same thing as 3 and 2/3. We could write this as a
,decimal with 3.6 repeating. So this is also 3.6 repeating. We could write it any
,one of those ways. But this is kind of a
,representative number. This is trying to get
,"at a central tendency. Once again, these are"
,human-constructed. No one ever-- it's
,not like someone just found some religious
,"document that said, this is the way that"
,the arithmetic mean must be defined. It's not as pure
,"of a computation as, say, finding the"
,"circumference of the circle, which there really is--"
,that was kind of-- we studied the universe. And that just fell out of
,our study of the universe. It's a human-constructed
,definition that we found useful. Now there are other ways
,to measure the average or find a typical
,or middle value. The other very typical
,way is the median. And I will write median. I'm running out of colors. I will write median in pink. So there is the median. And the median is literally
,looking for the middle number. So if you were to order
,"all the numbers in your set and find the middle one,"
,"then that is your median. So given that, what's the"
,median of this set of numbers going to be? Let's try to figure it out. Let's try to order it. So we have 1. Then we have another 1. Then we have a 3. Then we have a 
,"4, a 6, and a 7. So all I did is"
,"I reordered this. And so what's the middle number? Well, you look here. Since we have an even number of"
,"numbers, we have six numbers, there's not one middle number. You actually have two"
,middle numbers here. You have two middle
,"numbers right over here. You have the 3 and the 4. And in this case, when you"
,"have two middle numbers, you actually go halfway"
,between these two numbers. You're essentially taking the
,arithmetic mean of these two numbers to find the median. So the median is going
,"to be halfway in-between 3 and 4, which is"
,going to be 3.5. So the median in
,this case is 3.5. So if you have an even
,"number of numbers, the median or the middle two, the--"
,"essentially the arithmetic mean of the middle two, or"
,halfway between the middle two. If you have an odd
,"number of numbers, it's a little bit"
,easier to compute. And just so that
,"we see that, let me give you another data set. Let's say our data"
,set-- and I'll order it for us--
,"let's say our data set was 0, 7, 50, I don't know,"
,"10,000, and 1 million. Let's say that is our data set. Kind of a crazy data set. But in this situation,"
,"what is our median? Well, here we have five numbers. We have an odd"
,number of numbers. So it's easier to
,pick out a middle. The middle is the number that is
,greater than two of the numbers and is less than
,"two of the numbers. It's exactly in the middle. So in this case,"
,"our median is 50. Now, the third measure"
,"of central tendency, and this is the"
,one that's probably used least often in
,"life, is the mode. And people often"
,forget about it. It sounds like
,something very complex. But what we'll see
,"is it's actually a very straightforward idea. And in some ways, it"
,is the most basic idea. So the mode is actually the most
,"common number in a data set, if there is a most"
,common number. If all of the numbers
,"are represented equally, if there's no one single"
,"most common number, then you have no mode. But given that"
,"definition of the mode, what is the single most common"
,"number in our original data set, in this data"
,"set right over here? Well, we only have one 4. We only have one 3. But we have two 1's. We have one 6 and one 7. So the number that shows up"
,"the most number of times here is our 1. So the mode, the most typical"
,"number, the most common number here is a 1. So, you see, these"
,"are all different ways of trying to get at a typical,"
,"or middle, or central tendency. But they do it in very,"
,very different ways. And as we study more
,"and more statistics, we'll see that they're"
,good for different things. This is used very frequently. The median is really good if you
,have some kind of crazy number out here that could
,have otherwise skewed the arithmetic mean. The mode could also be useful
,"in situations like that, especially if you do"
,have one number that's showing up a lot
,"more frequently. Anyway, I'll leave you there. And we'll-- the next few videos,"
,we will explore statistics even deeper.
,
mbc3_e5lWw0,If you're
,watching a movie and someone is attempting to do fancy
,"mathematics on a chalkboard, you'll almost always see a"
,symbol that looks like this. This radical symbol. And this is used to show the square root and we'll see other
,"types of roots as well, but your question is, well, what does this thing actually mean? And now that we know a"
,"little bit about exponents, we'll see that the square"
,root symbol or the root symbol or the radical is not
,"so hard to understand. So, let's start with an example. So, we know that three to"
,"the second power is what? Three squared is what? Well, that's the same"
,"thing as three times three and that's going to be equal to nine. But what if we went the other way around? What if we started with the nine, and we said, well, what "
,times
,"itself is equal to nine? We already know that answer is three, but how could we use a"
,"symbol that tells us that? So, as you can imagine,"
,"that symbol is going to be the radical here. So, we could write the"
,"square root of nine, and when you look at"
,"this way, you say, okay, what squared is equal to nine? And you would say, well,"
,"this is going to be equal to, this is going to be equal to, three. And I want you to really look at these two equations right over here, because this is the essence "
,"of the square root symbol. If you say the square root of nine, you're saying what times"
,"itself is equal to nine? And, well, that's going to be three. And three squared is equal"
,"to nine, I can do that again. I can do that many times. I can write four, four"
,"squared, is equal to 16. Well, what's the square"
,"root of 16 going to be? Well, it's going to be equal to four. Let me do it again. Actually, let me start"
,"with the square root. What is the square root of 25 going to be? Well, this is the number that"
,"times itself is going to be equal to 25 or the number,"
,"where if I were to square it, I'd get to 25. Well, what number is that, well, that's going to be equal to five. Why, because we know that"
,"five squared is equal to, five squared is equal to 25. Now, I know that there's a nagging feeling that some of you might be having, because if I were to take negative three, and square it, and square"
,"it I would also get positive nine, and the same"
,thing if I were to take negative four and I were
,"to square the whole thing, I would also get positive"
,"16, or negative five, and if I square that I"
,"would also get positive 25. So, why couldn't this thing"
,"right over here, why can't this square root be positive"
,"three or negative three? Well, depending on who you talk to, that's actually a reasonable"
,thing to think about. But when you see a
,"radical symbol like this, people usually call"
,"this the principal root. Principal root. Principal, principal square root. Square root. And another way to think"
,"about it, it's the positive, this is going to be the"
,positive square root. If someone wants the
,"negative square root of nine, they might say something like this. They might say the negative,"
,"let me scroll up a little bit, they might say something like the negative square root of nine. Well, that's going to be"
,equal to negative three. And what's interesting
,"about this is, well, if you square both sides"
,"of this, of this equation, if you were to square both"
,"sides of this equation, what do you get? Well negative, anything negative"
,squared becomes a positive. And then the square root
,"of nine squared, well, that's just going to be nine. And on the right-hand side,"
,"negative three squared, well, negative three times"
,"negative three is positive nine. So, it all works out. Nine is equal, nine is equal to nine. And so this is an"
,"interesting thing, actually. Let me write this a little"
,"bit more algebraically now. If we were to write, if we were to write the principal root of nine is equal to x. This is, there's only one"
,"possible x here that satisfies it, because the standard convention, what most mathematicians"
,"have agreed to view this radical symbol as, is that this is a principal square root, this"
,"is the positive square root, so there's only one x here. There's only one x that"
,"would satisfy this, and that is x is equal to three. Now, if I were to write x"
,"squared is equal to nine, now, this is slightly different. X equals three definitely satisfies this. This could be x equals"
,"three, but the other thing, the other x that satisfies this is x could also be"
,"equal to negative three, 'cause negative three squared"
,"is also equal to nine. So, these two things,"
,"these two statements, are almost equivalent,"
,"although when you're looking at this one, there's two"
,"x's that satisfy this one, while there's only one x"
,"that satisfies this one, because this is a positive square root. If people wanted to write"
,something equivalent where you would have two
,"x's that could satisfy it, you might see something like this. Plus or minus square root"
,"of nine is equal to x, and now x could take on positive"
,three or negative three.

bIKmw0aTmYc,Voiceover:We've got some apples here and we've got some oranges and what I want to think about
,"is, what is the ratio, what is the ratio of apples ... Of apples, to oranges? To oranges. To clarify what we're even talking about, a ratio is giving us the relationship between quantities of 2 different things. So there's a couple of ways that we can specify this. We can literally count"
,"the number of apples. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So we have 6 apples. And we can say the ratio is going to be 6 to, 6 to ... And then how many oranges do we have? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. It is 6 to 9. The ratio of apples to oranges is 6 to 9. And you could use a different notation. You could also write it this way. 6 to ... You would "
,still read the
,ratio as being 6 to 9. But we don't have to
,"just satisfy us with this because one way to think about ratios, especially if we're thinking about apples to oranges, is how many apples do we have for a certain number of oranges? When you think about it that way, we can actually reduce these"
,"numbers, as you might have already thought about. Both 6 and 9 are divisible by 3. So just like we can reduce fractions, we can also reduce ratios. So if you divide "
,"6 and 9 both by 3. 6 divided by 3 is 2. 6 divided by 3 is 2. And 9 divided by 3 is 3. So we could also say that the ratio of apples to oranges is 2 to 3. Or if we want to use this notation, 2 to 3. 2 to 3. Now, does that make sense? Well look. We divided each of these groups into 3. So one way to think about it ... If you divide this whole"
,"total into 3 groups. So 1 group, 1 group. 2 groups, 2 groups. And 3 equal groups. We see that in each of those groups, for every 2 apples, for every 2 apples, we have 3 oranges. For 2 apples we have 3 oranges. For 2 apples we have 3 oranges. So, once again, the ratio"
,of apples to oranges. For every 2 apples we have 3 oranges. But we could think about
,things the other way around as well. We could also think about
,what is the ratio ... We could also think about
,"what is the ratio ... Ratio, of oranges to apples? Oranges to apples. And here we would, essentially, switch the numbers. The ratio of oranges to apples. Notice, up "
,here we said apples to oranges which is 6 to 9 or 2
,"to 3 if we reduce them. And here we're going to say the ratio of oranges to apples, so"
,we've swapped these 2. So we're going to swap the numbers. Here we have 9 oranges for every 6 apples. So we could say the ratio
,is going to be 9 to 6. The ratio is 9 to 6. Or if we want to reduce
,"it, for every 3 oranges ... So we're going to divide this by 3. So for every 3 oranges we are going to have 2 apples. We are going to have 2 apples. So notice, this "
,is just
,"exactly what we had up here, but when we had apples to oranges it was 6 to 9. 6 apples for every 9 oranges. And now when it's"
,"oranges to apples, we say it's 9 to 6. 9 oranges for every 6 apples. Or we could say for"
,every 3 oranges we have exactly 2 apples.

AuX7nPBqDts,Welcome to the presentation
,"on basic addition. I know what you're thinking,"
,"Sal, addition doesn't seem so basic to me. Well, I apologize. Hopefully by the end of this"
,presentation or in a couple of weeks it will seem basic. So let's get started
,"with, I guess we could say, some problems. Well let's say I start"
,with an old classic. 1 plus 1. And I think you already know
,"how to do this, but I'll kind of show you a way of doing this"
,in case you don't have this memorized or you haven't
,"already mastered this. You say, well, if I have 1,"
,let's call that an avocado. If I have 1 avocado and
,"then you were to give me another avocado, how many"
,"avocados do I now have? Well, let's see. I have 1, 2 avocados. So 1 plus 1 is equal to 2. Now, I know what"
,"you're thinking. That was too easy, so let"
,"me give you something a little bit more difficult. I like the avocados. I might stick with that theme. What is 3 plus 4? This is, I think, a more"
,"difficult problem. Well, let's stick"
,with the avocados. And in case you don't know what
,"an avocado is, it's actually a very delicious fruit. It's actually the fattiest"
,of all the fruits. You probably didn't even
,"think it was a fruit, even if you ate one. Let's say I have 3"
,"avocados-- 1, 2, 3. And let's say you were to"
,give me 4 more avocados. So let me put this 4 in yellow
,"so you know that these are the ones you're giving me. 1, 2, 3, 4. So how many total"
,"avocados do I have now? That's 1, 2, 3, 4,"
,"5, 6, 7 avocados. So 3 plus 4 is equal to 7. And now I'm going to introduce"
,"you to another way of thinking about this. It's called the number line. And actually, I think this is"
,how I do it in my head when I forget-- if I don't
,"have it memorized. So number line, I just write"
,all the numbers in order. And I go high enough just
,so all the numbers I'm using are kind of in it. So you know the first number
,"is 0, which is nothing. Maybe you don't know,"
,"but now you know. And then you go to 1, 2,"
,"3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Keeps going-- 11. So we're saying 3 plus 4. So let's start at 3. So I have 3 here and we're"
,going to add 4 to that 3. So all we do is we go up the
,"number line, or we go to the right on the number"
,"line, 4 more. So we go 1, 2, 3, 4. Notice all we did is we just"
,"increased it by one, by two, by three, by four. And then we ended up at 7. And that was our answer. We can do a couple"
,of different ones. What if I asked you
,"what 8 plus 1 is? Well, you might"
,"already know it. You know, plus 1 is"
,just the next number. But if we look at the
,"number line you start at 8 and you add 1. 8 plus 1 is equal to 9. Let's do some harder problems. And just so you know, if you're"
,"a little daunted by this initially, you can always"
,draw the circles. You can always do
,"the number line. And eventually, over time, the"
,more practice you do-- you'll hopefully memorize these and
,you'll do these problems in like half a second. I promise you. You just got to
,keep practicing. I want to draw the number line
,"again, actually, I have a line tool, so I should give you"
,all those ugly looking lines that I've been giving you. Look at that. That's amazing. Let me see. Look at that. That's a nice looking line. I'm going to feel bad    
,"to erase it later on. So let me draw a number line. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,"
,"9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. So let's do a hard problem. I'm going to do it in"
,"different colors now. 5 plus 6. So if you want, you could"
,pause the video and try this. You might already
,know the answer. And the reason why I say this
,is a hard problem is because the answer has more numbers
,"than figures, so you can't necessarily do it"
,on your fingers. So let's get started
,"with this problem. Actually, my phone is ringing,"
,but I'm going to ignore the phone because you're
,"more important. OK, let's start at the 5. So we start at the 5 and"
,"we're going to add 6 to it. So we go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. And we're at 11. So 5 plus 6 is equal to 11. Now I'm going to ask you a"
,"question, what is 6 plus 5? Well, we're now"
,going to see that. Can you switch the two numbers
,"and get the same answer? Well, let's try that. And I'm going to try it in"
,a different color so we don't get all confused. So let's start at 6. Ignore the yellow for
,"now and add 5 to it. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. We get to the same place. And I think you might want"
,to try this on a bunch of problems and you'll see
,it always works out. That it doesn't matter what
,order-- 5 plus 6 is the same thing as 6 plus 5. And that makes sense. If I have 5 avocados
,"and you give me 6, I'm going to have 11. If I have 6 avocados and"
,"you gave me 5, I'm going to have 11 either way. Since this number line is so"
,"nice, I want to do a few more problems using it. Although as I use it I'm sure"
,I'll just continue to confuse you because I'll write
,"so much on top of it. But let's see. I'll use white now. What is 8 plus 7? Well, if you can still read"
,"this, 8 is right here. We're going to add 7 to it. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. We go to 15. 8 plus 7 is 15. So hopefully that gives"
,you a sense of how to do these types of problems. I guess this and you're going
,"to learn multiplication in a little bit, but these types of"
,problems are-- when you're getting started off in
,"mathematics, these kind of require the most practice and"
,"to some degree, you have to start memorizing them. But over time, when you look"
,"back, I want you to remember how you feel while you're"
,watching this video right now. And then I want you to watch
,this video in like 3 years and remember how you felt when
,you're watching it now. And you're going
,"to be, oh my God. This was so easy because you're"
,"going to learn it so fast. So anyway, I think"
,you have an idea. If you don't know the answer to
,any of the additional problems that we give in the exercises
,you can press the hints and it'll draw circles and you can
,just count up the circles. Or if you want to do it
,"on your own so you get the problem right, you"
,could draw the circles. Or you could draw a number
,line like we did in this presentation. I think you might be ready to
,tackle the addition problems. Have fun.

E4HAYd0QnRc,In the last video we talked
,about different ways to represent the central tendency
,or the average of a data set. What we're going to do in this
,video is to expand that a little bit to understand
,how spread apart the data is as well. So let's just think about
,this a little bit. Let's say I have negative
,"10, 0, 10, 20 and 30. Let's say that's one data"
,set right there. And let's say the other data
,"set is 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12. Now let's calculate the"
,arithmetic mean for both of these data sets. So let's calculate the mean. And when you go further on in
,"statistics, you're going to understand the difference"
,between a population and a sample. We're assuming that
,this is the entire population of our data. So we're going to be dealing
,with the population mean. We're going to be dealing
,"with, as you see, the population measures"
,of dispersion. I know these are all
,"fancy words. In the future, you're not going"
,to have all of the data. You're just going to have some
,"samples of it, and you're going to try to estimate"
,things for the entire population. So I don't want you to worry too
,much about that just now. But if you are going to go
,"further in statistics, I just want to make that"
,"clarification. Now, the population mean, or"
,"the arithmetic mean of this data set right here, it is"
,negative 10 plus 0 plus 10 plus 20 plus 30 over-- we have
,five data points-- over 5. And what is this equal to? That negative 10 cancels out
,"with that 10, 20 plus 30 is 50 divided by 5, it's"
,"equal to 10. Now, what's the mean"
,of this data set? 8 plus 9 plus 10 plus 11 plus
,"12, all of that over 5. And the way we could think about"
,"it, 8 plus 12 is 20, 9 plus 11 is another 20, so"
,"that's 40, and then we have a 50 there. Add another 10. So this, once again, is"
,going to be 50 over 5. So this has the exact same
,population means. Or if you don't want to worry
,"about the word population or sample and all of that, both"
,of these data sets have the exact same arithmetic mean. When you average all these
,numbers and divide by 5 or when you take the sum of these
,"numbers and divide by 5, you get 10, some of these numbers"
,"and divide by 5, you get 10 as well. But clearly, these sets of"
,"numbers are different. You know, if you just looked at"
,"this number, you'd say, oh, maybe these sets are very"
,similar to each other. But when you look at these two
,"data sets, one thing might pop out at you. All of these numbers are"
,"very close to 10. I mean, the furthest number"
,"here is two away from 10. 12 is only two away from 10. Here, these numbers are"
,further away from 10. Even the closer ones are still
,"10 away and these guys are 20 away from 10. So this right here, this data"
,"set right here is more disperse, right? These guys are further away from"
,our mean than these guys are from this mean. So let's think about different
,"ways we can measure dispersion, or how far"
,"away we are from the center, on average. Now one way, this is"
,"kind of the most simple way, is the range. And you won't see it used too"
,"often, but it's kind of a very simple way of understanding how"
,far is the spread between the largest and the
,smallest number. You literally take the largest
,"number, which is 30 in our example, and from that, you"
,"subtract the smallest number. So 30 minus negative 10, which"
,"is equal to 40, which tells us that the difference between the"
,"largest and the smallest number is 40, so we have a range"
,"of 40 for this data set. Here, the range is the largest"
,"number, 12, minus the smallest number, which is 8, which"
,is equal to 4. So here range is actually
,"a pretty good measure of dispersion. We say, OK, both of these"
,"guys have a mean of 10. But when I look at the range,"
,"this guy has a much larger range, so that tells me this"
,is a more disperse set. But range is always not going to
,tell you the whole picture. You might have two data sets
,"with the exact same range where still, based on how things"
,"are bunched up, it could still have very different"
,"distributions of where the numbers lie. Now, the one that you'll"
,"see used most often is called the variance. Actually, we're going"
,to see the standard deviation in this video. That's probably what's used most
,"often, but it has a very close relationship"
,to the variance. So the symbol for the variance--
,and we're going to deal with the population
,"variance. Once again, we're assuming that"
,"this is all of the data for our whole population, that"
,"we're not just sampling, taking a subset, of the data. So the variance, its symbol is"
,"literally this sigma, this Greek letter, squared. That is the symbol"
,for variance. And we'll see that the sigma
,"letter actually is the symbol for standard deviation. And that is for a reason. But anyway, the definition of"
,"a variance is you literally take each of these data points,"
,find the difference between those data points and
,"your mean, square them, and then take the average"
,of those squares. I know that sounds very
,"complicated, but when I actually calculate it, you're"
,"going to see it's not too bad. So remember, the mean"
,here is 10. So I take the first
,data point. Let me do it over here. Let me scroll down
,a little bit. So I take the first
,"data point. Negative 10. From that, I'm going to subtract"
,our mean and I'm going to square that. So I just found the difference
,from that first data point to the mean and squared it. And that's essentially
,"to make it positive. Plus the second data point, 0"
,"minus 10, minus the mean-- this is the mean; this is that"
,10 right there-- squared plus 10 minus 10 squared-- that's
,the middle 10 right there-- plus 20 minus 10-- that's
,the 20-- squared plus 30 minus 10 squared. So this is the squared
,differences between each number and the mean. This is the mean right there. I'm finding the difference
,"between every data point and the mean, squaring them, summing"
,"them up, and then dividing by that number"
,of data points. So I'm taking the average
,"of these numbers, of the squared distances. So when you say it kind of"
,"verbally, it sounds very complicated. But you're taking each number. What's the difference between"
,"that, the mean, square it, take the average of those. So I have 1, 2, 3, 4,"
,"5, divided by 5. So what is this going"
,to be equal to? Negative 10 minus 10
,is negative 20. Negative 20 squared is 400. 0 minus 10 is negative 10
,"squared is 100, so plus 100. 10 minus 10 squared, that's just"
,"0 squared, which is 0. Plus 20 minus 10 is 10"
,"squared, is 100. Plus 30 minus 10, which"
,"is 20, squared is 400. All of that over 5. And what do we have here? 400 plus 100 is 500, plus"
,"another 500 is 1000. It's equal to 1000/5, which"
,"is equal to 200. So in this situation, our"
,variance is going to be 200. That's our measure of
,dispersion there. And let's compare it to this
,data set over here. Let's compare it to the
,variance of this less-dispersed data set. So let me scroll over a little
,"bit so we have some real estate, although I'm"
,running out. Maybe I could scroll up here. There you go. Let me calculate the variance
,of this data set. So we already know its mean. So its variance of this data set
,is going to be equal to 8 minus 10 squared plus 9 minus
,10 squared plus 10 minus 10 squared plus 11 minus 10-- let
,me scroll up a little bit-- squared plus 12 minus
,"10 squared. Remember, that 10 is just the"
,mean that we calculated. You have to calculate the mean
,"first. Divided by-- we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 squared"
,differences. So this is going to be equal
,"to-- 8 minus 10 is negative 2 squared, is positive 4. 9 minus 10 is negative 1"
,"squared, is positive 1. 10 minus 10 is 0 squared. You still get 0. 11 minus 10 is 1. Square it, you get 1. 12 minus 10 is 2. Square it, you get 4. And what is this equal to? All of that over 5. This is 10/5. So this is going to be--all"
,"right, this is 10/5, which is equal to 2. So the variance here-- let me"
,"make sure I got that right. Yes, we have 10/5. So the variance of this"
,less-dispersed data set is a lot smaller. The variance of this data set
,"right here is only 2. So that gave you a sense. That tells you, look, this is"
,"definitely a less-dispersed data set then that there. Now, the problem with the"
,"variance is you're taking these numbers, you're taking"
,"the difference between them and the mean, then you're"
,squaring it. It kind of gives you a bit of
,"an arbitrary number, and if you're dealing with"
,"units, let's say if these are distances. So this is negative 10 meters, 0"
,"meters, 10 meters, this is 8 meters, so on and so forth, then"
,"when you square it, you get your variance in terms"
,of meters squared. It's kind of an odd
,set of units. So what people like to do is
,"talk in terms of standard deviation, which is just the"
,"square root of the variance, or the square root"
,of sigma squared. And the symbol for the standard deviation is just sigma. So now that we've figured out
,"the variance, it's very easy to figure out the standard"
,deviation of both of these characters. The standard deviation of this
,"first one up here, of this first data set, is going to"
,be the square root of 200. The square root of
,200 is what? The square root of
,2 times 100. This is equal to 10
,square roots of 2. That's that first data set. Now the standard deviation of
,the second data set is just going to be the square root of
,"its variance, which is just 2. So the second data set has 1/10"
,"the standard deviation as this first data set. This is 10 roots of 2, this"
,is just the root of 2. So this is 10 times the
,"standard deviation. And this, hopefully, will make"
,a little bit more sense. Let's think about it. This has 10 times more the
,standard deviation than this. And let's remember how
,"we calculated it. Variance, we just took each"
,"data point, how far it was away from the mean,"
,"squared that, took the average of those. Then we took the square root,"
,"really just to make the units look nice, but the end result"
,is we said that that first data set has 10 times the
,standard deviation as the second data set. So let's look at the
,two data sets. This has 10 times the standard
,"deviation, which makes sense intuitively, right? I mean, they both have a 10 in"
,"here, but each of these guys, 9 is only one away from"
,"the 10, 0 is 10 away from the 10, 10 less. 8 is only two away. This guy is 20 away. So it's 10 times, on average,"
,"further away. So the standard deviation, at"
,"least in my sense, is giving a much better sense of how far"
,"away, on average, we are from the mean. Anyway, hopefully, you"
,found that useful.
,
Wp2nVIzBsE8,Here's the second problem
,from CK12.org's AP statistics FlexBook. It's an open source
,"textbook, essentially. I'm using it essentially to"
,"get some practice on some statistics problems. So here, number 2. The grades on a statistics"
,midterm for a high school are normally distributed with a
,mean of 81 and a standard deviation of 6.3. All right. Calculate the z-scores for each
,of the following exam grades. Draw and label a sketch
,for each example. We can probably do it all
,on the same example. But the first thing we'd
,have to do is just remember what is a z-score. What is a z-score? A z-score is literally just
,measuring how many standard deviations away from the mean? Just like that. So we literally just have to
,calculate how many standard deviations each of these guys
,"are from the mean, and that's their z-scores. So let me do part a. So we have 65. So first we can just figure out"
,how far is 65 from the mean. Let me just draw one chart
,here that we can use the entire time. So it's just our distribution. Let's see. We have a mean of 81. That's our mean. And then a standard
,"deviation of 6.3. So our distribution, they're"
,telling us that it's normally distributed. So I can draw a nice
,bell curve here. They're saying it's normally
,"distributed, so that's as good of a bell curve as"
,I'm capable of drawing. This is the mean
,right there at 81. And the standard
,deviation is 6.3. So one standard deviation above
,and below is going to be 6.3 away from that mean. So if we go 6.3 in the positive
,"direction, that value right there is going to be 87.3. If we go 6.3 in the"
,"negative direction, where does that get us? What, 74.7? Right, if we add 6, it'll"
,"get us to 80.7, and then 0.3 will get us to 81. So that's one standard"
,"deviation below and above the mean, and then you'd add"
,"another 6.3 to go 2 standard deviations, so on and so forth. So that's a drawing of"
,the distribution itself. So let's figure out
,the z-scores for each of these grades. 65 is how far? 65 is maybe going to
,"be here someplace. So we first want to say,"
,"well how far is it just from our mean? So the distance is, you just"
,"want to positive number here. Well actually, you want"
,a negative number. Because you want your z-score
,to be positive or negative. Negative would mean to the left
,of the mean and positive would mean to the right of the mean. So we say 65 minus 81. So that's literally
,how far away we are. But we want that in terms
,of standard deviations. So we divide that by the length
,"or the magnitude of our standard deviation. So 65 minus 81. Let's see, 81 minus 65 is what? It is 5 plus 11. It's 16. So this is going to be"
,"minus 16 over 6.3. We'll take our calculator out. And let's see, if we have"
,"minus 16 divided by 6.3, you get minus 2 point--"
,"oh, it's like 54. Approximately equal"
,to minus 2.54. That's the z-score
,for a grade of 65. Pretty straightforward. Let's do a couple more. Let's do all of them. 83. So how is it away
,"from the mean? Well, it's 83 minus 81. It's two grades above the mean. But we want it in terms"
,of standard deviations. How many standard deviations. So this was part A. A was right here. We were 2.5 standard
,"deviations below the mean. So this is part A. 1, 2, and then 0.5. So this was A right there, 65. And then part B, 83, 83 is"
,"going to be right here. A little bit higher,"
,"but right here. And the z-score here, 83 minus"
,"81 divided by 6.3 will get us-- let's see, clear"
,the calculator. So we have 83 minus 81
,"is 2 divided by 6.3. It's 0.32, roughly. So here we get 0.32. So 83 is 0.32 standard"
,deviations above the mean. And so it would be roughly 1/3
,"third of the standard deviation along the way, right? Because this as one whole"
,standard deviation. So we're 0.3 of a standard
,"deviation above the mean. Choice number C. Or not choice, part C, I"
,"guess I should call it. 93. Well, we do the same exercise. 93 is how much above the mean? Well, it's 93 minus 81 is 12. But we want it in terms"
,of standard deviations. So 12 is how many standard
,"deviations above the mean? Well, it's going"
,to be almost 2. Let's take the calculator out. So we get 12 divided by 6.3. It's 1.9 standard deviations. Its z-score is 1.9. Which means it's 1.9 standard
,"deviations above the mean. So the mean is 81, we go one"
,"whole standard deviation, and then 0.9 standard deviations,"
,"and that's where a score of 93 would lie, right there. Its z-score is 1.9. And all that means is"
,"1.9 standard deviations above the mean. Let's do the last one. I'll do it in magenta. D, part D. A score of 100. We don't even need"
,"the problem anymore. A score of 100. Well, same thing. We figure out how far is 100"
,"above the mean-- remember, the mean was 81-- and we divide"
,that by the length or the size or the magnitude of our
,standard deviation. So 100 minus 81 is
,equal to 19 over 6.3. So it's going to be a little
,over 3 standard deviations. And in the next problem we'll
,see what does that imply in terms of the probability of
,that actually occurring. But if we just want to figure
,"out the z-score, 19 divided by 6.3 is equal to 3.01. So it's very close. 3.02, really, if"
,"I were to round. So it's very close to 3.02. Its z-score is 3.02, or a grade"
,"of 100 is 3.02 standard deviations above the mean. So remember, this was the"
,mean right here at 81. We go 1 standard deviation
,"above the mean, 2 standard deviations above the mean, the"
,third standard deviation above the mean is right there. So we're sitting right
,"there on our chart. A little bit above that, 3.02"
,"standard deviations above the mean, that's where"
,a score of 100 will be. And you can see the
,"probability, the height of this-- that's what the chart"
,"tells us-- it's actually a very low probability. Actually, not just a very"
,"low probability of getting something higher than that. Because as we learned before,"
,"in a probably density function, if this is a continuous, not a"
,"discreet, the probability of getting exactly that is 0,"
,if this wasn't discrete. But since this is scores
,"on a test, we know that it's actually a discrete"
,probability function. But the probability is low of
,"getting higher than that, because you can see where"
,"we sit on the bell curve. Well anyway, hopefully this at"
,"least clarified how to solve for z-scores, which is pretty"
,"straightforward mathematically. And in the next video,"
,we'll interpret z-scores and probabilities
,a little bit more.

25gGVMaynPk,hello children today i am here to teach you chapter 24 in your textbook that's indices so in this lesson we are recognizing what are index notations and power of another number and expand a power and write its value so this is an important lesson so you need to do this in grade 7 8 9 10 till you do all levels then after that this is important in a level as well look at this number 8 write 8 as a product of prime factors so how you find out the prime factors you can divide take 8 you can divide this by 2. you get 4 divide this by 2 again you get 2 divide this by 2 again you get 1 so you can write 8 as 2 into 2 into 2 2 three times so we can write instead of writing two times two times two we can write this as two to the power of three so when you take this number 2 to the power of 3 we call this 2 as the base and the power this we say that's the index sometimes we call exponents or power so you can read this number as 2 to the power of 3 2 to the power of 3 25 what are the prime factors of 25 take 25 you can divide by 5 that's 5 5 times 525 divide by 5 again you get 1 so 25 you can write 5 times 5 5 2 times 5 to the power 2. so this is 5 
,to the power of 2 and you can say 5 squared so when the power is 2 you can say squared now write this one 7 to the power of 2 7 to the power of 2 or 7 squared same thing 11 to the power of 2 or 11 squared take eight eight we can write two and two and two we did that before two times two times two or you can write 2 to the power 
,3. so 2 to the power 3 is there another name first you can say 2 to the power of 3 or 3 cube so 3 means q so power 3 you can say q 2 cube so cube we can use for the 
,power 3. now write down 5 to the power of 3 5 to the power of 3 cube of 5 simple cube of 5 7 to the power of 3 cube of 7 10 to the power of 3 and cube of 10. so power 2 is squared and power 3 is cube right how you read these numbers this one already done 9 to the power 3 9 to the power of 3 cube of 9. so likewise you can write 13 to the power of 13 to the power of 2 how can you write there 13 square square of 13 you can write square of 30 13 squared here 6 to the power of 3 i'll write all this 4 to the power of 4 to the power of 2 write the number 8 to the power of 3 twenty to the power of two fifteen to the power of three then you can write power 3 as cube of 6. this one 4 squared square of 4 this one 8 to the power three you can write eight cubed cube of eight twenty squared square of twenty and 15 to the power 
,of 3 that means cube of 15. fill in the blanks so you need to identify what's the base and index so 11 to the power of 7 base is 11 power is 7 that's index 9 to the 
,power of 4 base is 9 and index is 4. now try to do this 3 to the power 11 3 is the base and 11 is the index 5 to the power of 8 5 is the base and 8 is the index 10 to the power 5 10 is the base and 5 is the index 6 to the power 3 base is 6 power or index is 3. write these in index notation so that means you have to write in base and index form three how many threes are there one two three four five so you can write three to the power of five how many sevens are there one two three four seven to the power of how many eights are there one two three four five eight to the power of five how many elevens are there three eleven to the power of three how many tens one two three four five 10 to the power of 5. this one how many fives one two three four five six how many minus threes so make sure that you put brackets one 
,two three four three how many minus elevens are there two power two how many ones are there one two three 4 5 but here 1 to the power any number is 1 23 23 3 times 23 to the power of 3. expand and write as a product 7 to the power 3 7 3 times three to the power six three six times eight to the power four 8 4 times 9 to the power 5 9 5 times 10 to the power two ten two times minus five to the power four minus five four times minus 11 to the power 3 minus 11 three times write as a power of a 
,number so first one write 32 as a power of 2 so what you can do you can divide and see you can divide by 2 you get 16. you can divide this by 2 again 8 divide by 2 get 4 divide by 2 again 2 and divide by 2 again you get 1 till you get 1 you divide so how many twos are there one two three four five five twos are there so you can 
,write this one as two to the power of 5. so 32 as a power of 2 that's 2 to the power of 5. right 125 as a power of 5 then we divide by 5 and say 5 times 2 10 and for 25 that's 5. divide by 5 again you get 5. divide by 5 again you get 1. so 5 3 times you can write as 5 to the power of 3. look at this one right 121 as a power of 11. so take 121 and divide by 11 11 times 11 and 1. you get 11 twice so you can write this one as 11 squared write 81 as a power of 3 so divide by 3 3 times 2 6 and for 21 that's 27 divide by 3 again 9 divide by 3 again 3 divided by 3 again that's 1. so you can write 81 3 4 times that means 3 to the power of four write 36 as a power of six divide by six six times six thirty six six times one six twice that means you can write this is 6 squared write 343 as a power of 7 divide by 7 7 times 4 
,28 28 and you get 63 63 means nine seven times seven and seven times one seven three times that means 7 to the power of 3 and write 64 as a power of divided by eight eight times eight sixty-four eight times one eight into eight or you can write eight squared write 243 as a power of 3 divided by 3 3 times 8 24 and 1 3 times 27 3 
,times again 9 divide by 3 again 3 and divide by 3 again 1. so how many 3's are there 5 1 2 3 4 5 3 to the power of 5 right 64 as a power of 4 divide by 4 4 times 1 4 24 that's 6 4 times 4 16 and then again one four three times four times four times four four to the power of three right 625 as a power of five divided by 5 5 times 1 5 for 12 that's 2 for 25 that's 5. divide by 5 again 2 and 5. divide by 5 again 5 divided by 5 again that's 1. so you get only 5 4 times 5 into 5 into 5 into 5. so 5 to the power of 4. write 729 as a power of 9 divide by 9 9 times eight one nine times nine again divide by nine you get one so nine three times nine to the power of three write these in index notation how many twos are there three how many threes you get two here how many threes two how many fives one two three how many 3 is here 1 2 3 how many 7s 2 how many 11's that's two and how many thirteens that's two here how many twos two and how many fives that's three here again eighths and ninths eights twice and nines one two three how many fives are there three and how many elevens that's two how many fours one two three how many sevens one two three how many elevens here three how many thirteens one two three how many sixes here three and how many sevens 1 2 3 write the following numbers as a product of 2 3 5 so 
,you have to divide either by 2 3 or 5. so take 12 you can divide by 2 first that's 6. again you can divide by 2 that's 3. now you have to divide by 3 and you get 1. 
,so you can write 12 as 2 times 2 times 3 so 2 to the power of 2 and 1 3. 20 you can divide by 2 first you get 10. divide by 2 again you get 5. now you can divide by 
,5. you get 1 there 2 times 2 times 5 2 to the power of 2 and 5 54 divide by 2 2 times 2 4 for 14 that's 7. divide by 3 now get 9 divide by 3 again that's 3 divided by 3 again you get 1. so it's 1 2 and 3 3 times so you can write 2 into 3 to the power of 3 or 3 cube 50 you can divide by 2 25 now you can divide by 5 5 times 1. so 
,50 you can write 2 times 5 into 5 or you can simplify and write 5 squared now look at this one 18 divide by 2 9. now you can divide by 3 divide by 3 again you get 1. this is 2 times 3 times 3 or you can write 2 and 3 to the power of 2. 36 you can divide by 2 that's 18. divide by 2 again 9 divide by 3 again 3 3 and divide by 3 again that's 1. 2 twice and 3 twice so 2 to the power of 2 and 3 to the power of 2 both twice 242 divide by 2 you get 1 2 1 divide by what 11 11 times 11 121 divided by 11 you get 1 so 2 and 2 11 so 2 into 11 squared 75 you can divide by 3 3 times 2 6 and for 15 that's 5. divide by 5 again 5 divide by 5 again you get 1. so 3 times 5 times 5 you can write as 3 into 5 squared 24. how can we divide you can start with 2 12 again you can divide by 2 again by 2 and now you can divide by 3 2 into 2 
,into 2 into 3 2 3 times and 3 once 98 now divide by 2 49 then you get you can divide by 7 and again 7. 2 times 7 times 7 2 into 7 squared instead of 7 times 7 that's 7 squared find the value and use symbols greater less or equal signs so you are comparing two index notations 2 squared and 3 squared so what is 2 squared 2 into 2 
,that's 4. 3 squared 3 into 3 9. now which one is bigger 3 squared is bigger so you can write 2 squared is less than 3 squared 3 to the power 3 or 5 squared 3 to the 
,power 3 is 3 times 3 times 3 you get 27 5 squared 5 times 5 25 so you can write 3 to the power 3 is greater than 5 squared because 27 is more than 25 2 to the power 
,4 2 into 2 into 2 into 2 you get 2 times 2 4 4 times 2 8 8 times 2 16. 4 squared means 4 times 4 that's also 16. so what can you say about this one 2 to the power 4 
,is equal to 4 squared 3 to the power 4 and 9 squared 3 times 3 times 3 times 3 9 here and 9 here 9 times 9 81. 9 squared means 9 times 9 81 so both are the same 3 to the power 4 is same as 9 squared squared and 6 squared 7 times 7 49 6 times 6 36 so 49 is bigger 7 squared is greater than 6 squared 10 squared and 5 to the power 3 10 times 10 you get 100 5 into 5 into 5 3 times 25 times 5 125 so that's bigger so you can write 10 squared is smaller than 5 to the power of 3. 4 to the power 4 or 8 to the power 3 4 into 4 into 4 into 4 you get 64 times 4 256 8 to the power 3 8 times 8 64 64 times 8 now 500 12. so which one is bigger 8 to the power 3. so 4 to the power 4 is smaller than less than 8 to the power of 3 7 cube or 8 q 7 times 7 times 7 49 times 7. 343 8 times 3 8 times 8 times 8 we did that before 512 which one is bigger this is bigger so 7 to the power 3 is less than 8 to the power of 3 or 8 cubed write 64 as power of 2 power of 4 and power of 8 so you can divide separately so we'll do first power of 2 divide by 2 okay 32 16 8 four two and one one two three four five six two six times so you can write 2 to the power of 6 and as a power of 4 you have to divide by 4 4 times 1 4 6 4 times again 4 4 times 1 4 into 4 into 4 or 4 to the power of 3. now as a power of 8 you have to divide by 8 8 times 8 64 and 1 so 8 times 8 means 8 square so here 64 we can write as power of 2 power of 4 as well as power of 8 write 81 as power of 3 so divide by 3 and say and it's 27 divided by 3 9 divided by 3 3 divided by 3 1 3 4 times you can write 3 to the power of 4 now as a power of 9 you divide by 9 get 9 into 9 9 squared find the value so when you are asked to find the value you have to do separately and multiply 2 to the power of 4. now without expanding can you tell me what's 2 to the power of 
,4 that's 16. 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 that's 60. you can write 16 there 3 squared 3 into 3. that's 9 3 times 3 9 now you can multiply these two 9 times 6 54 9 times 1 9 9 plus 5 14. so 145 3 to the power 3 3 3 times that's 27 4 squared means 4 times 4 that's 16. now multiply 27 and 16 10 and 6 you get here multiplied by 1 6 times 7 42 and 6 times 2 12 12 plus 4 16 so you get when you add it 432 next one 2 to the power 2 that means 2 times 2 4. 5 to the power 3 5 times 5 times 5 so you get 
,125 so what's the value of four times five twenty four times two eight plus two ten four times one four four plus one five so answer is five hundred three squared three times three that's nine seven squared seven times seven forty-nine now multiply nine times forty-nine nine times nine eighty one eight remaining nine times four 
,thirty six and eight forty four four hundred and forty one 6 squared 6 into 6 36 2 to the power 3 2 times 2 times 2 that's 8. now 36 times 8. 8 times 6 48 4 remaining 8 times 3 24 plus 4 28 this one 4 squared 4 times 4 that's 16. three squared three times three that's nine sixteen times nine hundred forty-four 5 squared 5 into 5 that's 25 6 into 6 6 squared that's 36 36 into 25 twenty and five five times six thirty five times three fifteen plus three eighty so when you add it you get nine 900 9 squared 9 times 9 2 squared 2 times 2. so 81 here 2 times 2 4 4 times 1 4 4 times 8 32 so 324 11 squared 11 times 11 you get 121 two times two that's four so multiply by four four times one four eight four four hundred eighty four ten squared is hundred ten times ten 3 squared 3 times 3 that's 9. so you get 900 as the answer now three numbers so same thing 2 times 2 you get 4. 3 times 3 you get 9 5 only once so you get 4 times 5 20 20 times nine hundred eighty this one three squared three times three that's nine five squared five times five twenty five and 1 7 so 9 times 7 63 63 times 25 20 and 5 and five times three fifteen five times six thirty 
,plus one thirty one so when you add it thousand five hundred and seventy five fill in the blanks 49 so the base is 7 so we know 7 times 7 power is 2 121 is 11 times 
,11 so 11 square 3 to the power 4 3 times 3 9 3 times 3 9 9 times 9 81 100 125 as something to the power of 3 we know that 5 times 5 times 5 5 to the power of 3 81 it's a square number 9 times 9 9 squared 81 as power of 4 something power of 4 we know that 3 times 3 9 9 times 9. so 3 to the power 4 is 81 121 is 11 times 11 11 squared so 169 is 13 times 13 that's 13 square find the value of 4 squared what's 4 squared 4 times 4 16. find the value of 2 to the power 4 2 4 times you get 4 4 into 4 16 again so what can you say about these two write down the relationship between the two numbers both are the same so 4 squared is same as 2 to the power of 4. fill in the blanks so you have to give the base index index notation and the value three four times so three is the base power is four and this is three to the power four what's the number eighty one five three times five is the base three times they are so index is three five times five twenty five twenty five times five hundred and twenty five seven twice seven is the base power is two seven squared forty nine ten three times ten is the base three is the index ten times ten times 10 to the power 3 is 1000 11 twice 11 is the base 2 is the index 11 squared is 121 2 is the base here how many times 4 times 2 to the power of 4 16. now we look at the exercise 
,and examples in your textbook example number one write three four times using index notation so three one two three four four times find the value so how do you find out the value so we can expand it and find the value one two three four five six two times two times two eight two times 2 times 2 8 8 times 8 64. write down using 
,indices so here 2 3 times 1 2 3 and 5 twice 5 squared find the value of 5 squared and 7 to the power 3 you can do separately 5 squared means 5 times 5 25 7 to the power 3 7 times 7 49 49 times 7 343 now you have to multiply these two 343 times 25 twenty and five six eight six and five times five times three fifteen and five times four twenty plus one twenty one and two there are five times three fifteen plus two seventy now add it you get 8575 this one find the value of 2 to the power 4 and 3 squared so 2 to the power 4 means 2 4 times and 3 twice so here you get 16. 3 to the power 3 is 9. now multiply these two 9 times 6 54 5 remaining 9 times 1 9 plus 5 you get 14 144 24.1 fill in the blanks in the following table so you need to fill index form 4 to the power 3 base is 4 and index is 3 here 5 4 times so 5 is the base index is 4. you get 625 here 2 to the power 3 given that means 2 times 2 times 2 base is 2 power is 3. so what's the value you get 8. base is 2 power is 2 2 times 2 that's 4 here 5 to the power 3 means base is 5 index is 3 so 5 times 5 times 5 and what's the value of 5 to the power 3 5 times 5 25 25 times 5 125 write down 
,using index notation each of the following numbers which has been expressed as a product find also the value of each product so index notation 5 to the power of 2. so 5 times 5 you get 25 10 into 10 into 10 10 to the power 3 that's thousand three three times three to the power of three that's twenty seven one one to the power of three that's 1 1 to the power any number is 1 1 to the power 1 2 3 4 5. that's that's 1 7 4 times 7 to the power 4 so here 49 and 49 49 times 49 we need to find out 40 and 9 4 times 9 36 and 4 times 4 16 plus 3 90. 9 times 9 81 8 remaining 9 times 4 36 plus 8 44. now add it so you get 2 401 here 5 squared 3 squared so 3 squared 5 squared and one seven three squared three times three you get nine five squared five times five twenty-five times seven what you get 9 times 7 63 63 times 25 20 and 5. five times three fifteen five times six thirty plus one thirty one thousand five hundred and seventy five this one you get 3 3 times 4 squared and 6. what's the value there 3 to the power 3 is 3 times 3 times 3 27 4 squared that's 4 times 4 16 times 6. so what's the value so first we can find out 16 times 6 that's 96 and multiply by 27 20 and seven two times nine eighteen plus one ninety seven times six forty two four remaining nine seven times nine sixty three sixty three plus four you get sixty seven edit two thousand five hundred and ninety two two thousand five hundred and ninety two write each of the following numbers which has been expressed in words in index form and as a product and then write down its value right so what's the first one 2 to the power 2. so you have to write in index form and as a product and then write down its value as well 2 to the power of 2 that means 2 times 2 you get 4 4 cubed 4 to the power of 3 4 times 4 times 4 that means 16 times 4 64. 6 squared 6 squared is so 6 into 6 36 3 to the power of 4 3 to the power of 4 3 4 times you get eighty-one two to the power of six to the power of six two six times you get sixty four three cubed three to the power three three times three times three you get 9 times 3 27 evaluate evaluate means find the value 2 to the power of 2 means 2 times 2 and 1 3 2 times 2 4 4 times 3 12 2 to the power of 3 2 3 times and 1 3. so this is 8 eight times three twenty-four two squared two into two three squared three into three two squared is four three squared is nine nine times four 36 3 to the power of 4 3 times 3 times 3 times 3 so you get 9 and 9 nine times nine eighty-one two to the power of two two squared means two times two three squared means three and three four squared means four and four four three times three nine four times four sixteen so 36 times 16 36 and 16 will multiply 6 times 6 36 3 remaining 6 times 3 18 18 plus 3 21 576 example 1 x plus 81 as a power of 3 that means we are dividing by 3. you get 27 divided by 3 9 divided by 3 3 and you get 1. how many threes are there 3 4 times you can write 3 to the power of 4 125 has a power of 5 so you divide by 5 5 times 25 and again five times five pi times one five times five times five you can write as five to the power of three exercise 24.2 what 
,is 2 times 5 equal to 2 times 5 equal to 10 what is 5 to the power of 5 to the power 2 equal to that's 5 into 5 25 what is 3 times 4 3 times 4 means multiplication that's 12. what is 4 to the power of 3 4 to the power of 3 four times four times four sixteen times four sixty-four write 32 as a power of two divide by two you get 16 8 4 and 2 so till you get 1 divide how many 2's are there 1 2 3 4 5 you can write 2 to the power of 5 right 144 has a power of 12. so divide by 12. 12 times 12 144 that's twice 12 times 12 12 to the power of 2. write down 64. as a power of 2 divide by 2 and c divide by 2 you get 16 again 2 again 2 and 2. how many twos one two 
,three four five six six twos are there so two to the power of six as a power of four you divide by 4 64 divide by 4 now 16 and another 4 you get 1 4 times 4 times 4 
,that means 4 to the power of three as a power of eight you divide by eight eight times eight eight squared 81 as a power of 3 81 divided by 3 divide by 3 again 3 again till you get 1 3 times 3 times 3 times 3 3 to the power of 4 as a power of 9 that means divide by 9 9 times 9 81 you get 1. so 9 times 9 9 squared indicate the truth of falsehood of the following statements 2 to the power of 3 is 8. we'll check it 2 times 2 times 2 that's 8. 8 is equal to 8. so that's true three squared three into three nine nine is not equal to six false 3 squared 3 times 3 9. 9 is equal to 8. wrong that's false 5 squared 5 times 5 that's 25 25 is not equal to 10. that's also false two to the power of five two times two times two times two times two you get to the power five is thirty two that's true 3 squared 3 times 3 that's 9. so that's equal to 9 that's true 2 to the power 4 2 into 2 into 2 into 2 that's 16. 4 squared 4 into 4 that's also 16 so 16 is equal to 16. that's true 2 to the power of 4 we found that 16 not 8. 16 is not equal to 8 so that's false 7 to the power of 3 7 times 7 times 7 49 plus 7 340 so that's not equal to 27 so this is false 5 to the power 3 5 times 5 times 5 you get 125 is not equal to 15 that's false 3 to the power 5 3 times 3 times three times three times three so you get 243 that's equal to 243 that's true now we look at miscellaneous exercises what are the base and the index of 7 squared basis 7 and index is 2 write down the following products using index notation 5 how many times 1 2 3 4. four how many times two and seven one two three here three how many times one two three four five eight once two three times three twice and five once four three times five ones and seven four times here here and there but you can count how many twos one two three how many threes one two three and how many fives one two find the value of each of the following expressions 2 to the power of 4 that means 2 4 times and 5 twice 5 times 5 25 2 to the power of 4 is 16 16 times 25 25 and five times six thirty five times one five plus three eight so 400 this one 3 squared 3 times 3 that's 9. 7 squared 7 times 7 49 now multiply by 9 9 times 9 81 8 remaining 9 times 4 36 plus 8 400. so 44 so 441 11 squared that means 11 times 11 10 squared is 10 times ten so this is hundred eleven 
,times eleven hundred and twenty one so hundred and twenty one and put two zeros because you are multiplying by hundred two to the power three two three times that's 
,eight five squared means five two times that's 25 and one seven is there 25 times 8 25 times 4 100 another 100 200 200 into seven thousand four hundred two times 2 4. 3 times 3 times 3 what's that 27 so 4 27 and 5 times 5 25 25 times 400 100 times 27 is 2 thousand 27 and two zeros so 2 700. fill in the blanks 36 base is 6 6 times 6 36 so twice 8 2 into 2 into 2 2 to the power of 3. 125 5 into 5 into 5 3 times 10 squared 10 into 10 hundreds 3 to the power 4 3 times 3 9 3 times 3 9 9 times 9 
,81 write down 256 as a power of 2 we divide by 2 you get 128 divided by 2 64 divided by 2 32 16 8 4 2 y how many twos are there one two three four five six seven eight two to the power of eight as a power of four you divide by four now times 6 24 and 4 4 times again you get 6 24 4 times 4 and 4 times 1 so how many times 4 4 times so 4 to the power of 4 16. so divide by 16 and say 1 and 25 minus 16 you get 9 for 96 that's 96 times 6 another 61 16 squared write down 729 as a power of 3 divided by 3 3 times 2 3 times 4 3 times 3 again by 3 81 again by 3 27 3 9 3 3 and 1. did you get 1 you divide 1 2 3 4 5 6 3 to the power of 6 as a power of 9 means you have to divide by 9 9 times 8 1 9 times 9 81 so 9 to the power of 3 as a power of 27 divide by 27 and 6 27 times 2 54 so subtract that's 189 so 7 again 189 so 27 times 1 so 27 squared fill in the blanks appropriately with either the symbol less or greater 2 to the power of 3 we already know that's 8 3 squared is 9 so this side is 
,bigger so you can put greater than sign 3 to the power of 4 81 4 to the power of 3 4 times 4 times 4 64. so this one is bigger 2 to the power of 4 is 16 4 squared is 16. so you can put equal sign 8 to the power of 1 8 1 to the power of 8 1 so 8 is bigger 2 to the power of 4 is 16 4 squared is 16 equal 3 squared is 9 6 this one is bigger greater so we covered all theory related to indices to represent a number using index notation is to write a repeated product of a number in a concise way so 2 to the power of 5. in the expression 2 to the power of 5 the base is 2 and the index is 5. the number can be written as a power of a given number division is used to find the index when expressing a number as a power of another number so practice all the exercises and examples and thorough with indices you

dSJEEOFaDz0,hello viewers welcome to pebbles ah today we are going to learn new topic that is abacus okay it's a simple counting mission and counting device and it's very useful for children by simple learning counting numbers uh with bright color beads okay i will show you the abacus instrument and how to move the beads and count the numbers okay let me enjoy children and today we are uh that is we are going to learn uh in a joyful manner how to move the beats by using abacus okay i will show you the 
,first i will show the instrument and uh do you know the basic what is abacus and the rod type okay first you have to understand what is abacus i will show the uh simple uh that is uh this is this video is for pre-school children from the age level up to four five and six okay four to seven age level children or enjoy for this uh using this device by using how to use this device i will show you the device okay this is a mathematical simple abacus device okay and each row that is it has 10 rods okay how to move this to know that is 10 rods and by counting numbers okay you have to start from the bottom to up okay this is a device okay for 10 rods this is 
,count by this one two three four five six seven eight nine and ten this is a a backer skate and it has ten rods and each rod has ten beads okay this is a 10 beets abacus and this is a 100 bees abacus this is called 100 b's because each row contains 10 beats okay that is 10 drops okay children and each row contains 10 beads okay 
,so 10 into 10 that is 100 so this is called 100 beads abacus and which has bright colored beads okay do you love children because by simply you have to sliding the beads from right to left and you are knowing two counting how to count the numbers and place the numbers okay and this is called the zero level okay do you understand this this is a zero level abacus that is no moment of beats here okay do you understand this ah for reference because this is one okay you are moving in the ones place you move just like one number this is called one okay and next one is a tens place and hundred place and it grows above the up to ah next level units okay first 
,you have to counting simple counting by using this from the ones place okay do you start okay from this basic rod okay okay i will show uh in the board for how to move and do you understand what is basic bead movement of on abacus okay let me see that is what is abacus it is a simple mathematical device okay i'll show for single that is only one's place okay so i have to draw two beats okay one and two so how do you say the number how do you say the number this is the answer that is you say 2 because once play is wrought it has two beats okay do you understand and next one here listen here this also once plays raw okay this is one's place rod for o o represent once okay listen here one two three four and five how do you say now count the beats so one two three four five the answer is five okay do you understand okay i will show you next example this is also a once please rod okay i have to draw beads listen here four five six and seven so simply you have to count the beats and say the answer the answer is seven okay one two three four five six seven so answer is seven okay do you understand and next one this also one's place rod okay listen here one two three and four by counting this number you have to say the answer what is the answer 4 because 1 2 3 and 4 so answer is 4 okay and next that is simple once place rod okay here i listen here there is no beads at all here okay i didn't write any bead i didn't draw any bead what is the answer there is no beat you have to say 0 ok this is answer 0 because there is no beads on the rod in ones place so simply by doing moving a backus that is moving beats on abacus you have to count the numbers four two five seven and here is zero okay next i have to show next up that is next place that is one's place okay we have discussed ones place and simply doing okay next we are going to learn that is two place that is one's place and the tens place okay listen here i have to draw that is one's place and tens place okay draw two rods okay by simply drawing here three beads and here one bead so what is the answer now first count the beads in ones place first you count the beads on first ones place rod say the answer three and the tens place rod it has only one bead okay children do you understand now this is one's place and this is tens place first you should write the beads number of beads in one's place only okay so count the beads and write down the answer is three and next we have to count the beads on tens place that is one so answer is 13 do you understand okay let me move on next example simply that is one's place and tens place it has two rods okay i have to draw okay let me start to count first count the ones place number okay once play is wrong it has one two so answer is two and next you have to count the beats on tens place so 1 2 3 4 and 5 you have to write the number what do you say now this is 52 okay so so this is a simple counting method and let me know how to uh form a pattern in a backers that is counting by twos counting by fives and counting by tens let me enjoy with abacus okay you

VvmH6v1nCSQ,in teasers in this chapter we are going to learn about integers what are integers integers or the collection of all the positive numbers all the positive numbers plus negative numbers plus zero so the collection of positive numbers negative numbers and zero all together called as integers it is denoted by a letter I or Z equal to so it is denoted like this now let us learn what of negative numbers we know positive numbers generally the numbers that we use after zero one two three four all these are positive numbers and we know that zero but what are these negative numbers the numbers that have a negative value or quantity two numbers in our daily life 
,in various situations we use negative numbers when we talk about profit and loss to denote the loss we use a negative number and when we talk about temperatures high temperatures and low temperatures to mention that very low temperatures we use a minus number in the same way talking about past and future that is the past when we go back we use minus numbers in this way we use negative numbers in our daily right let us see some examples the loss in a business is minus two lakhs so this is a 
,loss so we are writing it as a negative number as it is a loss we are writing it as the negative number if it is a profit we don't write this minus symbol so as it is the loss we are writing it as minus 2 lakhs in the same way the temperature is -5 degrees when we write minus 5 degrees it is very cold below zero less than zero so we use minus sign to tell that low temperature minus 5 degrees Celsius now we will see some more examples let us see some more examples here a bird is flying on surface of a sea so the height of the bird is 25 meters it's going up so this is a positive number now in the water there is a fish at a depth of 5 meters so it's going down below the water level so minus 5 meters we can use and look at another example this is the ground level above the ground level 500 meter high on the peak of this mountain there is a flag so 500 meter above the ground level whereas 25 meters below the ground level there is a small heart and a flag so this is below the ground level we can use minus 25 we can use a minus negative number so in this way in our daily life we use positive numbers and negative numbers representation of integers on a number line now let us observe this number line at the center of this number line we have a zero here right side to zero all these numbers are positive numbers so the numbers which lie on the right side of zero or positive numbers and if you see the left side of zero here we find negative numbers so what about the numbers that are on the left side of zero or called negative numbers and the numbers on the right side of zero or called two numbers so from this number line we get answers to many questions see here the question which integer on this number line is neither positive nor negative zero zero is neither negative nor positive which positive number is the closest to 0 so which positive number these are all positive numbers but the closest number is 1 1 is the closest positive number to 0 so now here minus 3 minus 2 which one is greater number minus 3 is bigger or minus 2 is bigger minus 2 is bigger minus 3 is less than minus 2 that is on a number line if we go from right to left the value of the number decreases if you move from left to right the value of the number increases so minus 4 is always less than minus 3 minus 3 is bigger so if you compare minus 3 and minus 2 minus 2 is bigger when compared to minus 3 if you compare minus 1 minus 1 is bigger than minus 2 now let us see minus 3 & 2 which one is bigger - 3 & 2 which is a bigger number 2 is a bigger number because the 2 is a positive number which is on the right side of 0 whereas minus 3 which is on the left side so there are five places difference between minus 3 & 2 so 2 is the bigger number so in this way we can look at integers both positive and negative numbers on a number line now let us see how to add and subtract on a number line first we will see the addition on a number line now we are going to add some integers on a number line so we know the integers they are positive numbers negative numbers 0 so here we are going to add and subtract some integers that is positive and negative numbers now he in the first example two plus three here both are positive numbers two and three are positive numbers so how do we do this on a number line two plus three so on the number line from zero we move to positions two right side this is addition so we have to move right side two positions plus 3 again from two three positions we have to move we've reached two plus three equal to five so let us see the next example the second one minus 4 and minus three so here is the 
,addition of two negative numbers minus 4 and minus 3 so on the number line from 0 we have to move to left side minus 4 first we have the move to minus 4 from 0 to minus 4 and minus 3 three positions first four positions three positions we reach minus 7 so minus 4 plus minus 3 equal to minus 7 so on a number line if we add minus 
,4 & 3 we reach - Shannon now see the third example in the third example minus 3 plus 5 so 0 2 minus 3 again plus 5 so we have to go five positions to the right set because it is a positive number five positions to right side one two three four five so we are going till 2 so minus three plus five is equal to plus two plus two so 
,in this way we can do addition on a number line now let us see subtraction 6 minus minus 5 that means we have to subtract minus five from six so here starting at zero we have to move to six at first now from six we have to move five here we are moving five positions - right not to the left because if it is simply minus five we would have moved from right to left but here it is minus five minus 5 so minus minus it becomes plus five so from 6 we have to move to five positions we reach 11 so 6 minus minus 5 is equal to 11
,
41eVMYPCWTQ,today let us learn prime and composite numbers before we begin let us understand what do we mean by natural numbers the set of numbers 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and so on are 
,called natural numbers natural numbers can be divided into prime numbers and composite numbers before we proceed ahead remember that any given number will always have one and itself as its factors now let us start with prime numbers look at the examples the factors of 3 are 1 and 3 the factors of 11 are 1 and 11 the factors of 17 are 1 and 17 all these numbers have only two factors one and the number itself such numbers are called prime numbers thus prime numbers are natural numbers that have only two factors one and the number itself composite numbers look at the examples the factors of 6 are 1 2 3 & 6 the factors of 14 are 1 2 7 and 14 the factors of 20 are 1 2 5 10 and 20 all the above numbers have more than two factors these numbers are called composite numbers thus composite numbers are natural numbers that have more than two factors remember these points one is neither prime nor composite as it has only one factor two is the smallest and the only even prime number three is the smallest odd prime number now why don't you list all the prime and composite numbers from 1 to 100

tN9lN0hTLsY,whole numbers in our day-to-day life to count things we use numbers like 1 2 3 4 the collection of these kind of numbers like 1 2 3 4 and so on we call this collection of numbers as natural numbers and we represent the set of natural numbers with the letter n so n is natural numbers 1 2 3 4 and so on so every natural number has 
,a successor see for example 3 has got a successor for if you see 2 it has got a successor 3 and in the same way the natural numbers except one are the natural numbers they have a predecessor 3 is having 2 as a predecessor and 4 is having 3 but whereas 1 is having a successor but it is not having the predecessor number now if we 
,add 0 to the collection of natural numbers this is a collection of natural numbers if we add 0 to the collection we call this set the natural numbers at 0 with 0 we 
,call it as whole numbers and we denote it with the letter W so this is a set of whole numbers 0 1 2 3 4 so on so whole numbers or the set of natural numbers with 0 including 0 we call it as whole numbers so in this chapter we are going to learn about these whole numbers representation of whole numbers or number line so first let us see how to draw a number line now first draw a line and mark a point as 0 on the line now mark some points with equal distances on to the right side of the line 
,keep on marking till the end of the so we mark as one two three four five six seven eight nine ten and so on till aunt number so this is the number line we have made so now we observe a number line here every number on this number line has got a successor towards its right side so six is having its successor on right side that is seventh in the same way every number is having its predecessor on its left side so this is a number line drawn with whole numbers now we will see that addition of 
,numbers on number line so here we are going to add some whole numbers using a number line here the addition given is 2 plus 3 so how to do this using a number line the first digit is 2 so let us start at to go to the number line and begin from 2 plus 3 so that is you have to move three positions now on which direction we have to move whether to right or left here we have to move towards right because we are doing addition 2 plus 3 so we have to move to right side from two how many positions we have to move to plus 3 so we have to move three positions towards right side from 2 starting at two three positions to right side so now we reach in a file that 
,means 2 plus 3 equal to 5 so this way using a number line we can do additions let us see the subtraction on number line let us subtract some whole numbers using a number line 6 minus 2 subtraction of whole numbers on a number line so 6 minus 2 the first digit is 6 now go to 6 on the number line here we are - - we have to move two positions on which direction - right ha - left as this is subtraction we have to move to the left side if it is addition right side subtraction left side how many 
,positions 2 because it is 6 minus 2 from 6 towards left 2 positions so we reached 4 so 6 minus 2 4 in this way we can subtract whole numbers on a number line multiplication on number like say for example 2 into 4 so how to do this multiplication of whole numbers on a number line 2 into 4 that means two positions four times these two positions to the right side how many times four times 1 2 3 4 so we reach 8 so we are moving right side every time to 2 positions how many times 4 times because it is 2 into 4 so we got 8 this is the multiplication of whole numbers on number line properties of whole numbers let us see 5 plus 7 equal to 12 so here 5 is a whole number 7 is a whole number and even 12 is a whole numbers 3 plus 4 equal to 7 this is the whole number and 4 is of whole numbers and even 7 is a whole number so here what do we understand from these examples we get that the sum of two whole numbers Gill's available so here the sum of any two whole numbers will be a four-level so this is the one of the property of the whole numbers now let us see another number 2 into 3 c2 is a whole number 3 is a whole number and 6 is a whole number 4 into 5 4 5 20 so here also all the 3 are whole numbers so here the product of the multiplication of any 2 whole numbers user is the whole number so here in the previous one we have seen that the sum of any two whole numbers gives rise to a whole number even here the multiplication of any 2 whole numbers gives rise to a whole number so what we can say from these two examples we can say that the collection of whole numbers is closed under addition and multiplication but this is not possible in 
,subtraction and in division let us see let us verify let us see here a subtraction 5 minus 7 if you remove 5 minus 7 so from 5 if you remove 7 you will get minus 2 so these - numbers are not the whole numbers whole numbers are the collection of natural numbers and 0 so this is not a whole number so a whole number minus a whole number may not become a whole number look at the division 5 divided by 2 it becomes Phi by 2 so this Phi by 2 is not a whole number this is a fraction Phi by 2 it is 
,not a whole number so here it doesn't apply to division and subtraction whereas in addition and in multiplication we find that the sum of two whole numbers become a 
,whole number and the multiplication the product of two whole numbers always becomes the whole number now let us look at the commutative property of whole numbers say for example 3 plus 5 equal to 8 in the same way 5 plus 3 equal to 8 so here we have two examples 3 plus 5 equal to 8 and 5 plus 3 equal to 8 so what is the difference here the order of this whole number P is changed the rest is same because the numbers are same but the order is changed here 3 + 5 here 5 + 3 but the result is same so the sum of the whole numbers even though the ordering pain is changed the sum the value will be the same this property is known as commutative property so the 
,whole numbers are commutative in case of an addition now let us see multiplication 2 into 3 equal to 6 3 into 2 equal to 6 here we have 2 whole numbers multiplied we got a result here product and here the same numbers but the order of the pair is changed even though the order of the pain is change the result is same so the whole numbers are commutative in case of multiplication also commutative property of whole numbers let us see the addition of two whole numbers 3 plus 5 equal to 8 5 plus 3 equal to 8 so here we have an addition of two whole numbers 3 plus 5 in both the cases the whole numbers are same but the payer order is changed here the same pair pre-filed even 5 3 the order is changed even though the order is changed in the addition of whole numbers the result will be the same so we say that this property 
,is known as commutative property here we say that the addition is commutative in whole numbers so in whole numbers the addition is commutative now let us look at the multiplication 2 into 3 6 3 into 2 6 so here same value the product is same but here the numbers are changed so the pail are distinct in case of a multiplication even though the order of the peel is changed the result is same it is equal so in whole numbers the multiplication is also commutative multiplication of whole numbers 
,is commit we do multiplication is commutative commutative so we can say that the addition and multiplication are commutative for whole numbers associativity of whole numbers now let us see 3 plus 4 plus 5 is equal to 3 plus 4 7 plus 5 is equal to 12 now the same thing by changing the arrangement 3 plus 4 plus 5 we have written like this so now 3 plus 4 plus 5 9 is equal to 12 so here in this addition the arrangement is different in this case in the first example we added 3 & 4 first then we added to 5 in the second case first 4 & 5 we added first and added it to 3 so we got 12 in both the cases that is 30 same even though here the arrangement and the order of addition is different so here we call this property as associative property so in addition the whole numbers are associative now let us see the associativity in multiplication now let us see the associativity of multiplication in whole numbers so here we have three dots in six cells so 3 into 2 columns and even the pattern is here like that so we have in every box we have 6 coins 3 in a column so 2 columns 3 coins into 2 columns three coins into 2 3 into 2 so this is the pattern so 
,3 2 6 3 2 6 3 2 6 6 + 6 12 + 6 18 here if you look the same but in a different pattern 3 columns each 4 so we write 4 into 3 & 4 into 3 4 3 is 12 4 3 is 12 so 24th let us see the associativity of multiplication for whole numbers here we have some dots arranged in a box so this box is having 2 columns and the 3 dots in each column 3 into 2 3 into 2 3 into 2 3 into 2 and in the same here is the different arrangement 4 dots in each column 3 columns 4 into 3 so here total 4 boxes are there each one is having 3 into 2 into 4 in the same way here 2 boxes 4 into 3 into 2 3 2 6 into 4 24 + 4 3 is 12 into 2 24 so here in both the cases the answer is same the value is same but here the numbers that we are multiplying at the beginning are different so this property is called as associative property of multiplication for whole numbers so we find that addition and multiplication are associative over members now let us find this example find the product of 5 into 9 into 2 into 2 into 3 into 5 my applying commutative property we change the order of these numbers 5 into 2 into 9 into 2 into 5 into 3 so now this is that commutative property we applied the commutative property here so now we use the associative property 5 into 2 into 9 into 2 into 5 into 3 so this is associative property so this is the associative property Vitus 10 into 9 2 5 10 into 3 so 10 9 90 into 10 threes 30 so 90 into 30 is equal to 2700 so in this way by applying this commutative property and associative property we could do this multiplication even simple and easily to directly find out the answer

E-ou94u1FBE,lesson two division devii she what is division division is nothing but sharing a specified number of items between specific number of people equally this can also be explained with the help of repeated subtraction let me explain this with some better examples Rahm has six apples he wants to share them equally to two children how can this be done first give one Apple to each for apples will remain next give one more to each two apples will remain finally give one more to each now no apples will remain each child got three apples equal sharing is known as division sera shared six apples equally between the two children with the help of his sister Vidya and finally each child got three apples number of apples is equal to six number of persons is equal to two number of apples got by each is equal to three we write this as 6 divided by 2 is equal to 3 six divided by two equal to three is called a division fact this symbol represents division let us see how Vidya shared 6 apples equally into the groups of two each she said six apples equally into three groups so that each group got two apples in this case what is the division fact simple 6 divided by 2 is equal to 3 completes the table by sharing the given idols equally total number of items number of items in a group total number of groups eight fences for pencils two groups nine erasers three erasers three groups fifteen pebbles five pebbles three groups 20 seeds 5 seeds four groups what is the division fact of 8/4 eight divided by four is two let us do some exercises four divided by two is equal to two nine divided by three is equal to three division is repeated subtraction division is not only sharing it is also repeated subtraction of the same number there are six toys let us divide them equally the first time keep one toy on each table subtract two from six six minus two is equal to four now the second time keep one toy again on each table subtract two from four four minus two is equal to two the third time keep one toy again on each table subtract two from two two minus two is equal to zero we have repeatedly subtracted two from six four three times so six 
,divided by two is equal to three so division is nothing but repeated subtraction you example for division through repeated subtraction 15/3 let us subtract 3 from 15 repeatedly first time 15 minus 3 is equal to 12 second time 12 minus 3 is equal to 9 third time nine minus three is equal to six fourth time six minus three is equal to three fifth time three minus three equal to zero thus three is subtracted from 15 five times therefore 15 divided by three is equal to five relation between multiplication and division twelve balls are arranged in this way multiplication 4 into 3 is equal to 12 Division one 12/3 is equal to four Division two twelve divided 
,by four is equal to three from the above table we see that the multiplication fact has two division facts for each multiplication fact there are two division facts but at the same numbers are multiplied there will be just one division fact for example 3 into 3 is equal to 9 is a multiplication fact the corresponding division fact for this will be nine divided by three is equal to three if a number is multiplied with zero it has only one division fact for example five into zero is equal to zero is a multiplication fact the division fact for this will be zero divided by five is equal to zero zero divided by any nonzero number is equal to zero multiplication fact 3 into 2 is equal to 6 division facts 6 divided by 3 is equal to 2 6 divided by 2 is equal to 3 multiplication fact 4 into 3 is equal to 12 division facts twelve divided by four is equal to three twelve divided by three is equal to four multiplication fact 7 into 2 is equal to 14 division facts 14/7 is equal to two and 
,14/2 is equal to seven multiplication fact 6 into 5 is equal to 30 division facts 30 divided by 6 is equal to 5 30 divided by 5 is equal to 6 multiplication fact 3 into 3 is equal to 9 division fact 9 divided by 3 is equal to 3 multiplication fact 5 into 4 is equal to 20 division facts 20 divided by 5 is equal to 4 20 divided by 4 is equal to 5 multiplication fact two into zero is equal to zero division facts zero divided by two is equal to zero zero divided by zero is equal to zero multiplication fact 4 into 4 is equal to 16 division fact Eckstein divided by four is equal to four nine into zero is equal to zero division facts zero divided by nine is equal to zero zero divided by zero is equal to zero 8 into 5 is equal to 40 division facts 40 divided by 8 is equal to 5 40 divided by 5 is equal to 8 Division table 
,using the multiplication tables we can get a lot of division facts construct the division facts from the multiplication table to 1 into 2 is equal to 2 division facts 2 divided by 2 is equal to 1 two divided by 1 is equal to 2 2 into 2 is equal to 4 division facts 4 divided by 2 is equal to 2 3 into 2 is equal to 6 division facts 6 divided by 2 is equal to 3 six divided by three is equal to two four into two is equal to eight 8 divided by 2 is equal to 4 8 divided by 4 is equal to 2 five into 2 is equal to 10 10 divided by 2 is equal to 5 10 divided by 5 is equal to 2 6 into 2 is equal to 12 twelve divided by two is equal to six 12 divided by 6 is equal to 2 seven into two is equal to 14 14 divided by two is equal to seven fourteen divided by seven is equal to two eight into two is equal to sixteen sixteen divided by 2 is equal to eight 16 divided by 8 is equal to 2 9 into 2 is equal to 18 18 divided by two is equal to nine 18 divided by nine is equal to two 10 into 2 is equal to 20 20 divided by 2 is equal to 10 20 divided by 10 is equal to 2 simple division problems division with grouping example divide 24 stars into groups of 4 stars 
,each make groups of four star each 24 stars were divided into six groups of four stars each so the division fact is 24 divided by 4 is equal to 6 divide 12 books into groups of three books each twelve divided by three is equal to four divide 15 candles into groups of five candles each so 15 divided by 5 is equal to 3 divide 16 flowers into groups of two flowers each so 16 divided by 2 is equal to 8 divide 12 dice into four equal groups twelve divided by four is equal to three divide 20 keys into two equal groups 20 divided by 2 is equal to 10 division using multiplication tables example one divide 15 by 3 say the multiplication table 3 till you get the product 15 1 into 3 3 2 into 3 6 3 into 3 9 4 into 3 12 5 into 3 15 so 15 divided by 3 is equal to 5 divide 30 by 5 say the multiplication table five till you get the product 30 1 into 5 5 2 into 5 10 3 into 5 15 4 into 5 25 into 5 25 6 into 5 30 30 divided by 5 is equal to 6 divide fifteen divided by three is equal to five eighteen divided by two is equal to nine 20 divided by 10 is equal to 2 28 divided by 4 is equal to 7 10 divided by 5 is equal to 2 16 divided by four is equal to four

25gGVMaynPk,hello children today i am here to teach you chapter 24 in your textbook that's indices so in this lesson we are recognizing what are index notations and power of another number and expand a power and write its value so this is an important lesson so you need to do this in grade 7 8 9 10 till you do all levels then after that this is important in a level as well look at this number 8 write 8 as a product of prime factors so how you find out the prime factors you can divide take 8 you can divide this by 2. you get 4 divide this by 2 again you get 2 divide this by 2 again you get 1 so you can write 8 as 2 into 2 into 2 2 three times so we can write instead of writing two times two times two we can write this as two to the power of three so when you take this number 2 to the power of 3 we call this 2 as the base and the power this we say that's the index sometimes we call exponents or power so you can read this number as 2 to the power of 3 2 to the power of 3 25 what are the prime factors of 25 take 25 you can divide by 5 that's 5 5 times 525 divide by 5 again you get 1 so 25 you can write 5 times 5 5 2 times 5 to the power 2. so this is 5 
,to the power of 2 and you can say 5 squared so when the power is 2 you can say squared now write this one 7 to the power of 2 7 to the power of 2 or 7 squared same thing 11 to the power of 2 or 11 squared take eight eight we can write two and two and two we did that before two times two times two or you can write 2 to the power 
,3. so 2 to the power 3 is there another name first you can say 2 to the power of 3 or 3 cube so 3 means q so power 3 you can say q 2 cube so cube we can use for the 
,power 3. now write down 5 to the power of 3 5 to the power of 3 cube of 5 simple cube of 5 7 to the power of 3 cube of 7 10 to the power of 3 and cube of 10. so power 2 is squared and power 3 is cube right how you read these numbers this one already done 9 to the power 3 9 to the power of 3 cube of 9. so likewise you can write 13 to the power of 13 to the power of 2 how can you write there 13 square square of 13 you can write square of 30 13 squared here 6 to the power of 3 i'll write all this 4 to the power of 4 to the power of 2 write the number 8 to the power of 3 twenty to the power of two fifteen to the power of three then you can write power 3 as cube of 6. this one 4 squared square of 4 this one 8 to the power three you can write eight cubed cube of eight twenty squared square of twenty and 15 to the power 
,of 3 that means cube of 15. fill in the blanks so you need to identify what's the base and index so 11 to the power of 7 base is 11 power is 7 that's index 9 to the 
,power of 4 base is 9 and index is 4. now try to do this 3 to the power 11 3 is the base and 11 is the index 5 to the power of 8 5 is the base and 8 is the index 10 to the power 5 10 is the base and 5 is the index 6 to the power 3 base is 6 power or index is 3. write these in index notation so that means you have to write in base and index form three how many threes are there one two three four five so you can write three to the power of five how many sevens are there one two three four seven to the power of how many eights are there one two three four five eight to the power of five how many elevens are there three eleven to the power of three how many tens one two three four five 10 to the power of 5. this one how many fives one two three four five six how many minus threes so make sure that you put brackets one 
,two three four three how many minus elevens are there two power two how many ones are there one two three 4 5 but here 1 to the power any number is 1 23 23 3 times 23 to the power of 3. expand and write as a product 7 to the power 3 7 3 times three to the power six three six times eight to the power four 8 4 times 9 to the power 5 9 5 times 10 to the power two ten two times minus five to the power four minus five four times minus 11 to the power 3 minus 11 three times write as a power of a 
,number so first one write 32 as a power of 2 so what you can do you can divide and see you can divide by 2 you get 16. you can divide this by 2 again 8 divide by 2 get 4 divide by 2 again 2 and divide by 2 again you get 1 till you get 1 you divide so how many twos are there one two three four five five twos are there so you can 
,write this one as two to the power of 5. so 32 as a power of 2 that's 2 to the power of 5. right 125 as a power of 5 then we divide by 5 and say 5 times 2 10 and for 25 that's 5. divide by 5 again you get 5. divide by 5 again you get 1. so 5 3 times you can write as 5 to the power of 3. look at this one right 121 as a power of 11. so take 121 and divide by 11 11 times 11 and 1. you get 11 twice so you can write this one as 11 squared write 81 as a power of 3 so divide by 3 3 times 2 6 and for 21 that's 27 divide by 3 again 9 divide by 3 again 3 divided by 3 again that's 1. so you can write 81 3 4 times that means 3 to the power of four write 36 as a power of six divide by six six times six thirty six six times one six twice that means you can write this is 6 squared write 343 as a power of 7 divide by 7 7 times 4 
,28 28 and you get 63 63 means nine seven times seven and seven times one seven three times that means 7 to the power of 3 and write 64 as a power of divided by eight eight times eight sixty-four eight times one eight into eight or you can write eight squared write 243 as a power of 3 divided by 3 3 times 8 24 and 1 3 times 27 3 
,times again 9 divide by 3 again 3 and divide by 3 again 1. so how many 3's are there 5 1 2 3 4 5 3 to the power of 5 right 64 as a power of 4 divide by 4 4 times 1 4 24 that's 6 4 times 4 16 and then again one four three times four times four times four four to the power of three right 625 as a power of five divided by 5 5 times 1 5 for 12 that's 2 for 25 that's 5. divide by 5 again 2 and 5. divide by 5 again 5 divided by 5 again that's 1. so you get only 5 4 times 5 into 5 into 5 into 5. so 5 to the power of 4. write 729 as a power of 9 divide by 9 9 times eight one nine times nine again divide by nine you get one so nine three times nine to the power of three write these in index notation how many twos are there three how many threes you get two here how many threes two how many fives one two three how many 3 is here 1 2 3 how many 7s 2 how many 11's that's two and how many thirteens that's two here how many twos two and how many fives that's three here again eighths and ninths eights twice and nines one two three how many fives are there three and how many elevens that's two how many fours one two three how many sevens one two three how many elevens here three how many thirteens one two three how many sixes here three and how many sevens 1 2 3 write the following numbers as a product of 2 3 5 so 
,you have to divide either by 2 3 or 5. so take 12 you can divide by 2 first that's 6. again you can divide by 2 that's 3. now you have to divide by 3 and you get 1. 
,so you can write 12 as 2 times 2 times 3 so 2 to the power of 2 and 1 3. 20 you can divide by 2 first you get 10. divide by 2 again you get 5. now you can divide by 
,5. you get 1 there 2 times 2 times 5 2 to the power of 2 and 5 54 divide by 2 2 times 2 4 for 14 that's 7. divide by 3 now get 9 divide by 3 again that's 3 divided by 3 again you get 1. so it's 1 2 and 3 3 times so you can write 2 into 3 to the power of 3 or 3 cube 50 you can divide by 2 25 now you can divide by 5 5 times 1. so 
,50 you can write 2 times 5 into 5 or you can simplify and write 5 squared now look at this one 18 divide by 2 9. now you can divide by 3 divide by 3 again you get 1. this is 2 times 3 times 3 or you can write 2 and 3 to the power of 2. 36 you can divide by 2 that's 18. divide by 2 again 9 divide by 3 again 3 3 and divide by 3 again that's 1. 2 twice and 3 twice so 2 to the power of 2 and 3 to the power of 2 both twice 242 divide by 2 you get 1 2 1 divide by what 11 11 times 11 121 divided by 11 you get 1 so 2 and 2 11 so 2 into 11 squared 75 you can divide by 3 3 times 2 6 and for 15 that's 5. divide by 5 again 5 divide by 5 again you get 1. so 3 times 5 times 5 you can write as 3 into 5 squared 24. how can we divide you can start with 2 12 again you can divide by 2 again by 2 and now you can divide by 3 2 into 2 
,into 2 into 3 2 3 times and 3 once 98 now divide by 2 49 then you get you can divide by 7 and again 7. 2 times 7 times 7 2 into 7 squared instead of 7 times 7 that's 7 squared find the value and use symbols greater less or equal signs so you are comparing two index notations 2 squared and 3 squared so what is 2 squared 2 into 2 
,that's 4. 3 squared 3 into 3 9. now which one is bigger 3 squared is bigger so you can write 2 squared is less than 3 squared 3 to the power 3 or 5 squared 3 to the 
,power 3 is 3 times 3 times 3 you get 27 5 squared 5 times 5 25 so you can write 3 to the power 3 is greater than 5 squared because 27 is more than 25 2 to the power 
,4 2 into 2 into 2 into 2 you get 2 times 2 4 4 times 2 8 8 times 2 16. 4 squared means 4 times 4 that's also 16. so what can you say about this one 2 to the power 4 
,is equal to 4 squared 3 to the power 4 and 9 squared 3 times 3 times 3 times 3 9 here and 9 here 9 times 9 81. 9 squared means 9 times 9 81 so both are the same 3 to the power 4 is same as 9 squared squared and 6 squared 7 times 7 49 6 times 6 36 so 49 is bigger 7 squared is greater than 6 squared 10 squared and 5 to the power 3 10 times 10 you get 100 5 into 5 into 5 3 times 25 times 5 125 so that's bigger so you can write 10 squared is smaller than 5 to the power of 3. 4 to the power 4 or 8 to the power 3 4 into 4 into 4 into 4 you get 64 times 4 256 8 to the power 3 8 times 8 64 64 times 8 now 500 12. so which one is bigger 8 to the power 3. so 4 to the power 4 is smaller than less than 8 to the power of 3 7 cube or 8 q 7 times 7 times 7 49 times 7. 343 8 times 3 8 times 8 times 8 we did that before 512 which one is bigger this is bigger so 7 to the power 3 is less than 8 to the power of 3 or 8 cubed write 64 as power of 2 power of 4 and power of 8 so you can divide separately so we'll do first power of 2 divide by 2 okay 32 16 8 four two and one one two three four five six two six times so you can write 2 to the power of 6 and as a power of 4 you have to divide by 4 4 times 1 4 6 4 times again 4 4 times 1 4 into 4 into 4 or 4 to the power of 3. now as a power of 8 you have to divide by 8 8 times 8 64 and 1 so 8 times 8 means 8 square so here 64 we can write as power of 2 power of 4 as well as power of 8 write 81 as power of 3 so divide by 3 and say and it's 27 divided by 3 9 divided by 3 3 divided by 3 1 3 4 times you can write 3 to the power of 4 now as a power of 9 you divide by 9 get 9 into 9 9 squared find the value so when you are asked to find the value you have to do separately and multiply 2 to the power of 4. now without expanding can you tell me what's 2 to the power of 
,4 that's 16. 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 that's 60. you can write 16 there 3 squared 3 into 3. that's 9 3 times 3 9 now you can multiply these two 9 times 6 54 9 times 1 9 9 plus 5 14. so 145 3 to the power 3 3 3 times that's 27 4 squared means 4 times 4 that's 16. now multiply 27 and 16 10 and 6 you get here multiplied by 1 6 times 7 42 and 6 times 2 12 12 plus 4 16 so you get when you add it 432 next one 2 to the power 2 that means 2 times 2 4. 5 to the power 3 5 times 5 times 5 so you get 
,125 so what's the value of four times five twenty four times two eight plus two ten four times one four four plus one five so answer is five hundred three squared three times three that's nine seven squared seven times seven forty-nine now multiply nine times forty-nine nine times nine eighty one eight remaining nine times four 
,thirty six and eight forty four four hundred and forty one 6 squared 6 into 6 36 2 to the power 3 2 times 2 times 2 that's 8. now 36 times 8. 8 times 6 48 4 remaining 8 times 3 24 plus 4 28 this one 4 squared 4 times 4 that's 16. three squared three times three that's nine sixteen times nine hundred forty-four 5 squared 5 into 5 that's 25 6 into 6 6 squared that's 36 36 into 25 twenty and five five times six thirty five times three fifteen plus three eighty so when you add it you get nine 900 9 squared 9 times 9 2 squared 2 times 2. so 81 here 2 times 2 4 4 times 1 4 4 times 8 32 so 324 11 squared 11 times 11 you get 121 two times two that's four so multiply by four four times one four eight four four hundred eighty four ten squared is hundred ten times ten 3 squared 3 times 3 that's 9. so you get 900 as the answer now three numbers so same thing 2 times 2 you get 4. 3 times 3 you get 9 5 only once so you get 4 times 5 20 20 times nine hundred eighty this one three squared three times three that's nine five squared five times five twenty five and 1 7 so 9 times 7 63 63 times 25 20 and 5 and five times three fifteen five times six thirty 
,plus one thirty one so when you add it thousand five hundred and seventy five fill in the blanks 49 so the base is 7 so we know 7 times 7 power is 2 121 is 11 times 
,11 so 11 square 3 to the power 4 3 times 3 9 3 times 3 9 9 times 9 81 100 125 as something to the power of 3 we know that 5 times 5 times 5 5 to the power of 3 81 it's a square number 9 times 9 9 squared 81 as power of 4 something power of 4 we know that 3 times 3 9 9 times 9. so 3 to the power 4 is 81 121 is 11 times 11 11 squared so 169 is 13 times 13 that's 13 square find the value of 4 squared what's 4 squared 4 times 4 16. find the value of 2 to the power 4 2 4 times you get 4 4 into 4 16 again so what can you say about these two write down the relationship between the two numbers both are the same so 4 squared is same as 2 to the power of 4. fill in the blanks so you have to give the base index index notation and the value three four times so three is the base power is four and this is three to the power four what's the number eighty one five three times five is the base three times they are so index is three five times five twenty five twenty five times five hundred and twenty five seven twice seven is the base power is two seven squared forty nine ten three times ten is the base three is the index ten times ten times 10 to the power 3 is 1000 11 twice 11 is the base 2 is the index 11 squared is 121 2 is the base here how many times 4 times 2 to the power of 4 16. now we look at the exercise 
,and examples in your textbook example number one write three four times using index notation so three one two three four four times find the value so how do you find out the value so we can expand it and find the value one two three four five six two times two times two eight two times 2 times 2 8 8 times 8 64. write down using 
,indices so here 2 3 times 1 2 3 and 5 twice 5 squared find the value of 5 squared and 7 to the power 3 you can do separately 5 squared means 5 times 5 25 7 to the power 3 7 times 7 49 49 times 7 343 now you have to multiply these two 343 times 25 twenty and five six eight six and five times five times three fifteen and five times four twenty plus one twenty one and two there are five times three fifteen plus two seventy now add it you get 8575 this one find the value of 2 to the power 4 and 3 squared so 2 to the power 4 means 2 4 times and 3 twice so here you get 16. 3 to the power 3 is 9. now multiply these two 9 times 6 54 5 remaining 9 times 1 9 plus 5 you get 14 144 24.1 fill in the blanks in the following table so you need to fill index form 4 to the power 3 base is 4 and index is 3 here 5 4 times so 5 is the base index is 4. you get 625 here 2 to the power 3 given that means 2 times 2 times 2 base is 2 power is 3. so what's the value you get 8. base is 2 power is 2 2 times 2 that's 4 here 5 to the power 3 means base is 5 index is 3 so 5 times 5 times 5 and what's the value of 5 to the power 3 5 times 5 25 25 times 5 125 write down 
,using index notation each of the following numbers which has been expressed as a product find also the value of each product so index notation 5 to the power of 2. so 5 times 5 you get 25 10 into 10 into 10 10 to the power 3 that's thousand three three times three to the power of three that's twenty seven one one to the power of three that's 1 1 to the power any number is 1 1 to the power 1 2 3 4 5. that's that's 1 7 4 times 7 to the power 4 so here 49 and 49 49 times 49 we need to find out 40 and 9 4 times 9 36 and 4 times 4 16 plus 3 90. 9 times 9 81 8 remaining 9 times 4 36 plus 8 44. now add it so you get 2 401 here 5 squared 3 squared so 3 squared 5 squared and one seven three squared three times three you get nine five squared five times five twenty-five times seven what you get 9 times 7 63 63 times 25 20 and 5. five times three fifteen five times six thirty plus one thirty one thousand five hundred and seventy five this one you get 3 3 times 4 squared and 6. what's the value there 3 to the power 3 is 3 times 3 times 3 27 4 squared that's 4 times 4 16 times 6. so what's the value so first we can find out 16 times 6 that's 96 and multiply by 27 20 and seven two times nine eighteen plus one ninety seven times six forty two four remaining nine seven times nine sixty three sixty three plus four you get sixty seven edit two thousand five hundred and ninety two two thousand five hundred and ninety two write each of the following numbers which has been expressed in words in index form and as a product and then write down its value right so what's the first one 2 to the power 2. so you have to write in index form and as a product and then write down its value as well 2 to the power of 2 that means 2 times 2 you get 4 4 cubed 4 to the power of 3 4 times 4 times 4 that means 16 times 4 64. 6 squared 6 squared is so 6 into 6 36 3 to the power of 4 3 to the power of 4 3 4 times you get eighty-one two to the power of six to the power of six two six times you get sixty four three cubed three to the power three three times three times three you get 9 times 3 27 evaluate evaluate means find the value 2 to the power of 2 means 2 times 2 and 1 3 2 times 2 4 4 times 3 12 2 to the power of 3 2 3 times and 1 3. so this is 8 eight times three twenty-four two squared two into two three squared three into three two squared is four three squared is nine nine times four 36 3 to the power of 4 3 times 3 times 3 times 3 so you get 9 and 9 nine times nine eighty-one two to the power of two two squared means two times two three squared means three and three four squared means four and four four three times three nine four times four sixteen so 36 times 16 36 and 16 will multiply 6 times 6 36 3 remaining 6 times 3 18 18 plus 3 21 576 example 1 x plus 81 as a power of 3 that means we are dividing by 3. you get 27 divided by 3 9 divided by 3 3 and you get 1. how many threes are there 3 4 times you can write 3 to the power of 4 125 has a power of 5 so you divide by 5 5 times 25 and again five times five pi times one five times five times five you can write as five to the power of three exercise 24.2 what 
,is 2 times 5 equal to 2 times 5 equal to 10 what is 5 to the power of 5 to the power 2 equal to that's 5 into 5 25 what is 3 times 4 3 times 4 means multiplication that's 12. what is 4 to the power of 3 4 to the power of 3 four times four times four sixteen times four sixty-four write 32 as a power of two divide by two you get 16 8 4 and 2 so till you get 1 divide how many 2's are there 1 2 3 4 5 you can write 2 to the power of 5 right 144 has a power of 12. so divide by 12. 12 times 12 144 that's twice 12 times 12 12 to the power of 2. write down 64. as a power of 2 divide by 2 and c divide by 2 you get 16 again 2 again 2 and 2. how many twos one two 
,three four five six six twos are there so two to the power of six as a power of four you divide by 4 64 divide by 4 now 16 and another 4 you get 1 4 times 4 times 4 
,that means 4 to the power of three as a power of eight you divide by eight eight times eight eight squared 81 as a power of 3 81 divided by 3 divide by 3 again 3 again till you get 1 3 times 3 times 3 times 3 3 to the power of 4 as a power of 9 that means divide by 9 9 times 9 81 you get 1. so 9 times 9 9 squared indicate the truth of falsehood of the following statements 2 to the power of 3 is 8. we'll check it 2 times 2 times 2 that's 8. 8 is equal to 8. so that's true three squared three into three nine nine is not equal to six false 3 squared 3 times 3 9. 9 is equal to 8. wrong that's false 5 squared 5 times 5 that's 25 25 is not equal to 10. that's also false two to the power of five two times two times two times two times two you get to the power five is thirty two that's true 3 squared 3 times 3 that's 9. so that's equal to 9 that's true 2 to the power 4 2 into 2 into 2 into 2 that's 16. 4 squared 4 into 4 that's also 16 so 16 is equal to 16. that's true 2 to the power of 4 we found that 16 not 8. 16 is not equal to 8 so that's false 7 to the power of 3 7 times 7 times 7 49 plus 7 340 so that's not equal to 27 so this is false 5 to the power 3 5 times 5 times 5 you get 125 is not equal to 15 that's false 3 to the power 5 3 times 3 times three times three times three so you get 243 that's equal to 243 that's true now we look at miscellaneous exercises what are the base and the index of 7 squared basis 7 and index is 2 write down the following products using index notation 5 how many times 1 2 3 4. four how many times two and seven one two three here three how many times one two three four five eight once two three times three twice and five once four three times five ones and seven four times here here and there but you can count how many twos one two three how many threes one two three and how many fives one two find the value of each of the following expressions 2 to the power of 4 that means 2 4 times and 5 twice 5 times 5 25 2 to the power of 4 is 16 16 times 25 25 and five times six thirty five times one five plus three eight so 400 this one 3 squared 3 times 3 that's 9. 7 squared 7 times 7 49 now multiply by 9 9 times 9 81 8 remaining 9 times 4 36 plus 8 400. so 44 so 441 11 squared that means 11 times 11 10 squared is 10 times ten so this is hundred eleven 
,times eleven hundred and twenty one so hundred and twenty one and put two zeros because you are multiplying by hundred two to the power three two three times that's 
,eight five squared means five two times that's 25 and one seven is there 25 times 8 25 times 4 100 another 100 200 200 into seven thousand four hundred two times 2 4. 3 times 3 times 3 what's that 27 so 4 27 and 5 times 5 25 25 times 400 100 times 27 is 2 thousand 27 and two zeros so 2 700. fill in the blanks 36 base is 6 6 times 6 36 so twice 8 2 into 2 into 2 2 to the power of 3. 125 5 into 5 into 5 3 times 10 squared 10 into 10 hundreds 3 to the power 4 3 times 3 9 3 times 3 9 9 times 9 
,81 write down 256 as a power of 2 we divide by 2 you get 128 divided by 2 64 divided by 2 32 16 8 4 2 y how many twos are there one two three four five six seven eight two to the power of eight as a power of four you divide by four now times 6 24 and 4 4 times again you get 6 24 4 times 4 and 4 times 1 so how many times 4 4 times so 4 to the power of 4 16. so divide by 16 and say 1 and 25 minus 16 you get 9 for 96 that's 96 times 6 another 61 16 squared write down 729 as a power of 3 divided by 3 3 times 2 3 times 4 3 times 3 again by 3 81 again by 3 27 3 9 3 3 and 1. did you get 1 you divide 1 2 3 4 5 6 3 to the power of 6 as a power of 9 means you have to divide by 9 9 times 8 1 9 times 9 81 so 9 to the power of 3 as a power of 27 divide by 27 and 6 27 times 2 54 so subtract that's 189 so 7 again 189 so 27 times 1 so 27 squared fill in the blanks appropriately with either the symbol less or greater 2 to the power of 3 we already know that's 8 3 squared is 9 so this side is 
,bigger so you can put greater than sign 3 to the power of 4 81 4 to the power of 3 4 times 4 times 4 64. so this one is bigger 2 to the power of 4 is 16 4 squared is 16. so you can put equal sign 8 to the power of 1 8 1 to the power of 8 1 so 8 is bigger 2 to the power of 4 is 16 4 squared is 16 equal 3 squared is 9 6 this one is bigger greater so we covered all theory related to indices to represent a number using index notation is to write a repeated product of a number in a concise way so 2 to the power of 5. in the expression 2 to the power of 5 the base is 2 and the index is 5. the number can be written as a power of a given number division is used to find the index when expressing a number as a power of another number so practice all the exercises and examples and thorough with indices you

QKvJELYdRRA,hello grade 8 children today I'm here to teach you chapter 10 in your textbook that's called indices you started indices in grade 7 so we'll look at more properties 
,so what I indices powers Oh another name for a popper we can say exponents now we'll take this number 3 3 3 several times so how many trees are there 1 2 3 4 5 6 so 
,we can write this number as 3 to the power 6 so when you take this number so here 6 is the superscript so what is that that's the index index is the singular and indices is the pro-reform and what is this number 3 is the base so we know the base and the power and we call this whole thing as the index notation write down how you 
,read the following how you do that 3 to the power rock 6 what is this 1 7 ^ 7 ^ 3 10 to the power of 2 - why you can write the number so here I can write number 2 what's this one 8 to the power of 4 a to the power of 4 this one 9 to the power of 3 and now a letter so can you read this a to the power of 4 so now you know how to read these index notations write the following indicating the index notation tow to the power of 3 2 to the power of 3 3 to the power of 4 5 to the power of 8 8 to the power of X to the power of Y to the power of now you have given the index notation and you are asked to write down the base and the index so what's the base means 
,it's three here what's the index when you take this one this is seven indexes for here base is 10 index is 3 base is 8 index is 5 and here base is 9 index is 3 here 
,base is a index is 4 and here what's the best why is the base and the index is 3 write the following in index notation so what's the base 7 how many sevens are there 1 2 3 4 7 ^ 4 8 is the base how many eighths are there 1 2 3 4 8 to the power of 4 minus 10 is the base now how many 1 2 3 11 is the base now how many levels 1 2 3 
,4 11 to the power of 4 here how many years are there 1 2 3 4 5 into the power of 5 how many Y's are there 1 2 3 4 5 y to the power 5 write the following expanded as 
,product of numbers now Phi to the power of 3 how can you expand that 5 3 times 7 to the power of 4 7 4 times minus 3 to the power of 4 minus 3 four times then a to the power 5 8 you have to write 5 times X to the power 4 means X 4 times so don't get confused with this multiplication sign an X Y to the power Phi means why five times write the following expanded form so 2 a square that means twice and be three x squared that means 2 X's and why how you write this 1 5 & 3 is this one 7 how many X's are there - and how many ways are there to the other one 11 is there - piece P squared means P into P and then one Q value this one you write - 3 is out there 
,so you write three years and one be here 3 twice and a thrice and one being here 5 2 x 1 x 3 why's this one 2/7 and 3 is here 2 & 4 XS and one what write the following index notation to is there how many XS one two so two there and one right here how many threes two threes so 3 to the power 2 and how many is 2 is + 1 be here you don't need to put one there how many fives three fives and two x's x squared - 7 s and three piece P to the power 3 here 3 xi + 2 m z-- m squared this one - 9 - 9 squared one to choose Xers and - wise now try to write down this - wait two M's and one in here 13 is there to piece and three cubes here for 2 is + 3 piece this 1 1 
,3 here 2 is + 1 B and - sis write the following numbers as a product of prime numbers and write them in index notation so we need to find out what are the prime factors take 8 divided by 2 you get 4 divided by 2 again you get 2 divided by 2 again you get 1 so 8 you can write 2 times 2 times 2 now you can write this in in the expectation how many tools are there 1 2 3 so 2 to the power 3 9 how can you write take 9 and you can divide by 3 you get 1 so 3 times 3 2 threes are there you can write as 3 squared 12 find the factors / - 6 divide by 2 again 3 divided by 3 again 1 so you can write 2 times 2 times 3 this is same as 2 to the power 2 and 3 to the power 1 this one 30 divided by 2 you get 15 divided by 3 you get 5 divided by 5 you get 1 so 2 times 3 times 5 so you can't do anything you can't simplify because all 
,these prime factors only once 20 divided by 2 you get 10 divided by 2 5 you get 1 so you can write 2 times 2 times 5 simplify this you get to choose and 1 5 no need 
,to put one there 36 divided by 2 you get 18 divided by 2 9 divided by 3 get 3 divided by 3 again you get 1 2 times 2 times 3 times 3 2 tours and two threes so you can write like that 100 divided by to get 50 divided by 2 again you get 25 now you can divide by five that's five divided by five again you get one so I can try two times two times five times five simplify and I can write 2 to the power 2 and Phi to the power 2 72 divided and get the prime factors divide by 2 you get 36 divided by 2 18 divided by 2 9 divided by 3 3 you get 1 so 2 times 2 times 2 times 3 and another 3 so how can you write 2 to the power 3 and 3 to the power 2 162 divided by 2 
,you get 81 divided by 3 you get 27 divided by 3 again 9 3 again 3 divided by 3 you get 1 so 2 times 3 threes not three threes three four threes so how can you write 
,2 into 3 to the power 4 225 divided by 3 you get seven and five 75 divided by five you can divide by 3 again divided by three again two and five now you can divide by five that's 1 3 into 3 & 5 into 5 I can write 3 squared + 5 squared as index notation expand the following and write down the value two squared that means 2 into 2 3 squared means 3 into 3 now what's the value 2 times 2 for 4 times 3 12 12 times 3 36 this one 3 squared that means 3 times 3 and then 1 5 3 times 3 9 9 times 5 45 here 7 times 7 times 11 49 times xi multiplied this by 11 10 and 1 you get 9 3 & 5 539 so you know how you get this one at once when you are multiplying by 11 you first write down the last digit and then 9 plus 4 13 one remaining and you are adding that one to that so 539 so you can use that 539 this one 3 to the power 3 is 27 
,3 times 3 times 3 5 squared 5 & 5 so 3 times 3 9 9 times 3 27 27 times 25 20 and 5 you get 675 so check it again you can multiply by 20 and 5 and when you add you are getting 675 3 squared means 3 times seven squared means 7 times 7 now multiply 3 times 3 9 9 times seven sixty three sixty three times seven 441 or you can check with 21 into 21 21 squared 2 to the power 4 to 4 times 1 2 3 4 and 1 3 2 times 2 4 4 times 2 8 8 times 2 16 16 times 3 what's the volume 48 this one 11 times 11 times 13 11 times 11 we know that it's hard red 21 121 times 13 10 and 3 you get 3 6 3 when you add it thousand five hundred and seventy three this one five to the power 
,3 5 times 5 times 5 into 7 5 times 5 25 25 times 525 125 multiplied by 7 35 14 + 3 17 7 plus 1/8 so 875 this one - 4 x + 5 twice 2 times 2 4 4 times 2 8 8 times 2 16 16 times 5 80 and eighty times five 400 this one 3 to the power 4 3 into 3 into 3 into 3 & 2 5 3 times 3 9 9 times 3 27 27 times 3 81 81 times 5 405 again multiplied by 5 you get 2025 power of a product as a product of powers 3 into 5 squared here is the product of 3 & 5 written as a power of 2 so this is power of 2 so that means you can write this one as this multiplied by this twice of that then we can separate it how many threes are there 1 2 how many fives are there two then what's the value we can write as 3 squared + 5 squared now this is power of a product power of a product we can write as separate powers write down as product of powers 2 into 5 to the power 3 means 2 into 5 3 times then how many tools are there 1 2 3 how many fives 1 2 3 then you can count separately 2 to the power 3 and 5 to the power three so what's the answer you can write two into five power three as 2 to the power 3 and 5 to the power 3 now look at this one X Y to the power 3 so that means XY XY XY 3 times how many X's are there 1 2 3 how many Y's 1 2 3 now you can write separately how many X's 3 how many Y's that's 3 here you don't need to write multiplication sign you can write as X to the power 3 y to the power 3 now look at carefully can you see we are considering power 3 at once so we can use that no need to expand it and get the answer when you see a power this power you have to consider for all numbers or letters as there this power so when this is power 3 X to the power 3 and Y to the power 3 write down as product of powers so we need to look at 8 when you take 8 you can divide by 2 and write 4 divided by 2 again that's 2 divided by 
,2 again you get 1 so 8 I can write 2 times 2 times 2 times a 3 and B 2 now how many tools are there 2 to the power 3 a to the power 3 and B Square now we can see all our powers 2 to the power 3 into a to the power 3 and V to the power to write down as product of powers of P you are so now you can see this one is P Q R P Q R and 
,another P Q R how many peas are there three how many cute another three how many are you so you can write P to the power three Q to the power 3 and R to the power 3 
,so look at carefully when there's a power outside consider the power for all inside numbers or letters so P to the power 3 Q to the power 3 n R to the power 3 so you can write at once write down as product of powers what's the answer if you are doing at once you need to get 3 to the power 3 and X to the power 3 we'll just check 
,that so 3 X 3 x then how many threes are there three threes and three X's you can write this one as 1 2 3 and X to the power 3 so you get the same answer write down 
,as product of powers now how you do that if you are writing at once we know you are getting 5 to the power 3 X to the power 3 and Y to the power 3 so we'll check it 
,5x y 5x y 5x y 3 x now how many fives are there 1 2 3 how many XS 1 2 3 how many ways are there 1 2 3 you can write as follows 5 to the power 3 X to the power 3 and 
,Y to the power 3 write down as productive powers so what's the answer 7 squared a squared B squared + C squared so you have to consider this outside father for all inside letters and numbers so this should be the answer we'll check it 7 ABC twice 2 servers to is 2 B's and twosies so how can you write as a power so 1 to the power 2 into the power 2 B to the power 2 and C to the power 2 so without the multiplication sign you can write like this write down as product of powers at once now you 
,know the pattern so what you do you take the powers fall inside numbers 2 to the power 2 7 to the power 2 this part 3 to the power 2 and Phi to the power 2 7 to the 
,power 3 11 to the power 3 here 2 to the power 4 and 3 to the power 4 this one a to the power 3 and B to the power 3 this one you get three numbers so same thing 2 to the power 2 3 to the power 2 and 5 to the power 2 this one 3 to the power 3 5 to the power 3 n 7 to the power 3 here you don't need to write down multiplication when there's letters a to the power 5 V to the power 5 C to the power 5 this one X to the power 3 y to the power 3 Z to the power 3 this one v to the power 3 e to the power 3 and B to the power right down power of product as product of Palace so this is something power 1 expression with the power you have to write down separate powers you can write 3 to the power 3 and a to the power 3 or you can write without multiplication sign but it says product of power so you show like this 5 to the power 2 and X to the power 2 6 to the power 3 and M to the power 3 here 10 to the power 2 with X to the power 2 3 to the power 4 and Y to the power 4 here 5 to the power 3 and P to the power 3 this one a to the power 4 B to the power 4 M to the power 3 and n to the power 3 here 2 to the power 3 P to the power 3 and Q to the power 3 
,here 3 squared x squared + y squared Y to the power 3 P to the power 3 and Q to the power 3 what about the last one 11 to the power 3 X to the power 3 n y to the power 3 write down product of power there's power of product so you have to come by so look at this one same power so I can write power is 3 and 5 and 7 inside this one save power our two instead of this I can write four times same power you can take like this not with different powers three times X or three X to the power 4 so you can write P and Q with power 2 here and be the power 3 this one three terms are there two five and X the power this one 3 and P same pollen same power you can write like this power 3 so 7 times y with poetry here amen in with power 4 11 and Y with power for this one two and one with power 7 5 and P with power for power of a negative integer so now inside there's a negative number so negative 2 to the power 1 is negative 2 negative 2 to the power 2 means you multiply twice so what's the answer 2 times 2 4 and minus into minus becomes plus power 3 you have to multiply 3 times so you get 8 2 times 2 times 2 minus into minus plus plus into minus you get minus 8 when it comes to 2 to the power 4 minus 2 to the power 4 you are multiplying this answer by another minus 2 you are getting 16 with positive this 116 times another to get 32 but this is minus so what can you observe 2 to the power 1 minus 2 to the power 1 minus 2 to the power 3 minus 2 to the power 5 for odd powers always get negative values and odd power of negative integer is always a negative value so you need to remember when there is a negative sign when you take any odd power the answer is negative look at the other one when it comes to even powers what's the answer you get positive values so even power of negative integer is always positive power of a positive integer now look at this 1 2 to the power 1 is 2 2 to the power 2 get 2 to the power 3 4 times 2 8 2 to the power 4 8 times 2 16 again you have to multiply by 2 you get 32 so we can see all these numbers are positive so power of a positive integer is always positive now look at this 1 1 is 1 1 squared 1 times 1 1 1 to the power 3 you get 1 there 1 to the power 4 also why look at this 1 minus 1 to the power 1 minus 1 minus 1 to the power 2 you get positive 1 because - 
,- positive here are three numbers so you get negative 1 here negative 1 times negative 1 you get positive 1 as well now observe that any power of 1 is always 1 or power of negative 1 this one this one you always getting minus 1 even power of negative 1 you're always getting positive life so remember that 1 to the power 101 is 1 
,negative 1 to the power 99 what is the answer negative 1 because odd powers always you get negative answers right down the onset once this is positive power always 1 positive powers always you get one positive even powers even power is always positive 1 what about odd powers odd powers you are getting negative 1 for any power with negative at 1 an odd power always negative answer find the value so even power so always even powers positive answers so what's the answer you get minus 3 times minus 3 positive 9 minus 4 times minus 4 you get positive 16 minus 5 times minus 5 positive 25 minus 7 times minus 7 positive 49 minus 10 times minus 10 positive 100 
,so you get all positive answers write down the following product of powers as a power of a product so 2 a and B both same power so you can write 2 a B whole thing square now like that can you write this 1 power 3 is there and what are the terms here inside 3x here power 3 comes what are the literals inside P Q this one over for 
,what are the numbers X 5 a when you are writing in order normally numbers first 5 a X you can write like that this one power 3 is there for all numbers so - ABC so you can write to ABC to the power of 3 show that 2 X to the power 3 and 3 y to the power 3 is 216 X to the power 3 and Y to the power 3 so what you do you can take the left-hand side and simplify and you show the right-hand side so 2 X to the power 3 and this one I can write as power 3 2 X + 3 1 then again I can write 2 times 3 6 X y to the power 3 multiplication of 2 and 3 now I can write 6 to the power 3 X to the power 3 and y to the power 3 what is 6 to the power 3 6 times 6 36 36 times 6 is 216 X to the power 3 y to the power 3 so this is same as right hand side so this is left hand side so we can see left hand side is equal to right hand side so that means this is true so that this one so same thing you take the left hand side and you have to show this is equal to the right hand side so how can you write these two same power that's - 5 X + 7 Y you can write like this and 5 times 7 35 X 1 square that means 35 squared x squared + y square so what's 35 squared 35 times 35 do you know any easy method this is what you do so always you get 25 as the last digit when you multiply by 5 times 5 and how you get the the previous number you have 
,to multiply by the next number so 3 is there multiply by 4 4 times 3 12 so you are getting thousand 225 we'll check that 35 times 35 30 + 5 + 5 times 5 25 15 plus 270 so you are getting thousand two hundred twenty-five so use that easy method to find out a square term only when it's five as the last digit so you get thousand 225 X square Y square so that's right hand side so that means this is true sure that this one is the same as the other side so take the left hand side and we can see square term is common inside you get 11 X + 2 y 11 times - 22 X Y to the power 2 so here 22 squared x squared + y squared now what is 22 square 22 times 22 20 and 2 you get 484 so that's correct 484 x squared by squared that's equal to right hand side so we can say this is true find the value of algebraic expressions with indices 
,now you have given a value for x and asked you to find out the value so just substitute the value instead of X so we can write 2 instead of X I can write 3 then 2 times 3 times 3 3 twice there so 2 times 3 6 6 times 3 18 so the value is 18 now substitute here 2 times 3 squared 2 times 3 6 squared 6 times 6 means 36 here 3x is 3 
,3 to the power 3 all together how many 3 is now here 1 and this is 3 how many threes are there four threes are there 3 to the power 4 what's the value 3 to the power 4 81 3 times 3 9 9 times 3 27 27 times 3 81 this one 5 3 square so 5 into 3 times 3 9 9 times 5 45 4 times 3 square now 4 times 3 12 12 squared means 12 times 12 on bran 44 7 x squared 7 into X is 3 so 3 squared what is 3 squared that's 9 9 times 7 what's the answer 63 find the value when a equals 2 and B equals 3 so we'll substitute a is 2 so 2 to the power 2 and B is 3 3 to the power 2 2 to the power 2 means 2 times 2 4 3 to the power 2 means 3 times 3 9 9 times 4 36 that's fine 2 a is 2 B is 3 to the power 2 now we can simplify inside 2 times 2 4 4 times 3 12 12 squared what is 12 squared 12 times 12 144 a to the power 3 that means 2 to the power 3 n 3 to the power 1 2 to the power 3 2 times 2 times 2 8 8 times 3 24 this one 5 is there a means 2 and B is 3 so 5 into 2 to the power 2 is 4 into 3 5 times for 20 
,20 times 360 substitute here a is 2 B is 3 so what's 2 to the power 2 that's 4 when you multiply 3 times 4 12 12 times 3 36 7 a squared a squared means 2 to the power 2 and 3 so 7 times 4 times 3 7 times for 28 28 x 380 now we'll look at the review exercise complete the following table you have given numbers and you ask to write in index notation and base and the index so the first one done for you 8 is 2 to the power 3 so 2 is the base and 3 is the index now we'll donate so 9 means 3 and 3 you can write 3 squared 3 squared what's the base 3 index to 16 you have given 2 is the base so what is 16 we know that 2 to the power 4 2 to the power 4 is 16 so base is 2 power is 4 and here base is forgiven and power is 2 so what's the number 4 times 4 16 now thousand is given with base 10 so 10 to the power 3 here we just count number of zeros so 10 is the base power is 3 expand and write each of the following expressions as a product so what is 3x squared means 3 times X times X what's 2 P squared Q means 2 times 2 peas and 1q this one 4 squared means 4 times 4 X cubed means X 3 times 5 squared means 5 into 5 and x squared means x into x + y squared means y + y so this is the expanded form question number three write down each of the following numbers as a product of powers of which the base is our prime number so you have to find out the prime numbers take 20 divided by 2 divide by 2 again and you can't divide by 5 so how can you write 22 times 2 times 5 and we can write as power 2 to the power 2 & 1 5:48 you have to divide and C divided by 2 divided by 2 again again divided by 2 so you get here again 3 & 3 with 1 so 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 3 you can finally write how many tools are there how many tools for tools and 1 350 when you divide again 25 divided by 5 you get 1 so 2 toes and 
,two fives you can write 2 to the power 2 and Phi to the power 245 divided by 2 you get 72 again / - 36 18 9 when you divide this by 3 you get 1 so how can you write 
,how many tools 1 2 3 4 and how many threes one to write 64 in index notation with base 2 with base for and with base 8 so first we'll find with base to divide and see you get 2 again 2 so how many tools are there 1 2 3 4 5 6 2 to the power 6 now how can you find with base 4 so you can check how many fours are there we know 2 times 2 4 yeah we can check how many folds are there how many force you can get 3/4 now the base is for 3/4 how many eighths are there 2 times 2 times 2 that's 1 8 2 times 2 times 2 another 8 so how many eighths are there 8 to the power so you can write the same number in base 2 for 8 here example number 1 express each of the following powers of products as a product of powers of the factors of the given product so you can write this 1 as 2 to the power 3 X to the power 3 or you can without multiplication also you can write 2 to the power 3 X to the power 3 this one you have to consider power for all numbers and letters 3 squared a squared + B squared Express 36 x squared as a power of a product so what is 36 36 V no 6 times 6 so we can write 36 x squared - 6 squared x squared now same our to is there so you can take inside 6x so 6x whole thing's squared is 36 X square express a 3 B 3 as a power of a product same power 3 you can put a and B inside exercise 10.1 Express each of the following powers of products as a product of powers of the factors of the given product so power is true you can write 2 to the power 2 and 5 to the power 2 here 
,you can write 3 to the power 3 and Phi to the power trip this one you have to consider all numbers inside with the power 3 11 to the power 3 3 to the power 3 and 2 to the power 3 this one a squared + B Square here consider power 5 this one power 3 4 to the power 3 X to the power 3 and Y to the power 3 so without multiplication also you can write 5 a whole thing's square this means 5 squared and a square 6 P whole thing squared means 6 square I dance p-square 4 y to the power 3 means 4 to the power 3 and Y to the power 3 3 year to the power 3 3 to the power 3 and a to the power 3 2 y to the power 4 2 to the power 4 and Y to the power 4 there to where B 
,whole thing squared means 2 to the power 2 a to the power 2 and me too the power to question number to find the value of each of the following powers of products right each power of a product as a product of powers of the factors of the given product and obtain the value again by simplifying the answer how can you write this one you can write as 2 to the power 3 and 5 to the power 3 consider power for all numbers what is true with the power 3 that's 8 5 to the power 3 5 times 5 25 25 times 
,"5 125 so what is 125 times 8,000 this is thousand yeah you can do this one in another way so if you simplify inside 2 times 5 10 10 to the power 3 you can straight away get that thousand three zeroes there this one 2 into 3 to the power 3 that means 2 to the power 3 and 3 to the power 3 what's to the power 3 8 3 times 3 9 9 times 3 27 so what's 8 times 27 260 what's the other way you can do inside 2 times 3 6 6 to the power 3 you get 216 this one 11 to the power 3 and 2 to the power 3 11 to the power 3 11 times 11 hundred and twenty-one times 11 so what's the easiest way to do I told you you can get it straight away so here 1 and 1 there 2 + 1 3 2 + 1 "
,3 so 11 times 11 or 121 times 11 when you multiply by 11 you can use the short method so thousand three hundred thirty one times eight so multiply 8 times 1 8 8 times 3 24 - remaining 8 times 3 24 + - 26 - remaining 8 times 1/8 + 2 10 so ten thousand six hundred forty-eight what's the other method twenty two to the power 3 this 
,one three squared + 7 squared 3 squared means 9 7 squared 49 so 49 times 9 9 times 9 81 9 times 4 36 + 8 44 so 441 so what's the other way 7 times 3 21 21 squared is 441 this one 5 to the power 3 + 7 to the power 3 part of the power 3 is 125 7 to the power 3 7 times 7 49 49 times 7 7 times 4 28 and six you get 34 so that's 343 so 343 times hundred twenty-five hundred 20 + 5 so 3 4 3 2 times 3 6 2 times 4 8 2 times 3 6 5 times 3 15 1 remaining 5 times 4 xx + 1 21 5 times 3 15 + 2 17 so when 
,"you add it you get 440 2875 this one so what's the 13 squared 2 squared and 3 squared so you have to do separately and multiply 13 square 169 13 times 32 times 2 4 3 times 3 9 9 times for 30 669 x 36 3 times 9 27 3 times 6 18 plus 2 23 times 1 3 plus 2 5 6 times 9 4 54 6 times 6 36 36 plus 541 and 6 times 1 6 plus 4 10 so when you add it together you get 6080 for the answer is 6,000 84 you can do other way around as well 3 times 2 6 13 times 6 78 78 square 78 times 78 how you do that 17 and 8 7 times 7 49 plus 5 51 and here again 8 here eight times eight sixty four and eight times seven 56 plus 6 you get 62 so when you add it 6080 for express each of the following products of powers as a power of a product so same power I can write this is 5 and 2 inside what is 5 and 2 this is 10 squared but this is the final answer so you can write as a product this word five and eleven you can write five an element inside and the power to outside same power 3 so you can write the other numbers inside this one power 2 is there x and y inside same power 3 P and Q inside power 5 a B X insult 100 100 is 110 square so this one you can write 10 times em inside and the power to outside 225 is what's the power 15 times 15 so 15 squared you can write 15 and T inside and other is 2 8 how can you write 8 we know 2 times 2 times 2 2 to the power 3 and now you can write 2 and y inside the outside power is 3 show that thousand X cube is 10 X whole thing cube so you will take left hand side mm excuse what is thousand 10 to the power 3 and X to the power 3 now we know same power you can take that out and 10 into X inside so no need to write 10 times X "
,I can ride technics so this is the same as the right hand side so this is example number one find the value of negative two the powerful we know that any negative number with an even power always positive so you get a positive answer so minus 2 times minus 2 times minus 2 times minus 2 so 2 times 2 4 4 times 2 8 8 times 2 16 is 
,the answer you get a positive answer this one odd power so what is the answer you get a negative answer minus 5 minus 5 3 times 5 times 5 25 times 5 and ran 25 so the answer is negative because the odd power of a negative number is negative exercise 10.2 find the value we know want to the power any number is what depend on the power you get negative or positive odd powers you get negative even powers you get positive so odd power so you get minus 1 even power you get positive but here odd power 3 negative 1 even power positive 1 here positive numbers 1 to the power any number is 1 1 to the power thousand 3 1 1 to the power 2018 1 1 to the power 0 is also 1 1 to the power any number is 1 now this one negative number to the power even you are getting positive so minus 4 times minus 4 that means positive sixty this is odd power you are getting a negative answer what is four times four sixteen sixteen times four 64 so you get negative 64 even power enough you get a positive answer so minus 4 times minus 4 minus 4 and minus 4 that means 64 times for what 64 times 4 6 times 6 times 4 for 24 plus 125 so 256 this is positive minus Phi to the power 1 odd power with a negative number always negative here even power even power always positive 5 times 5 25 odd power you get a negative answer so we got 25 25 times 5 what's the balance 125 but this is negative negative number to the power or power all these negative even power you get a positive answer 10 times 10 that's 100 show that this side is greater than its what's left hand side minus 1 to the power 8 this is even power with a negative number that's positive month right hand side negative 1 to the power 9 odd power with negative you'll get negative 1 so which one is bigger so left hand side is bigger than right hand side so this statement true so minus 1 to the power 8 is greater than minus 1 to the power 9 miscellaneous exercise question number one express each of the following products of powers as a 
,power of a product look at this one same power - is there so you can write to outside what are the numbers inside to excel why so without writing multiplication I can write to X Y to the power two for this one this one power 2 is the outside value because same power 3 a and B is there so you can write 3 B to the power 2 this one same power of 3 what's inside P and 2 Q so when you write in order to P Q to the power 3 same power 3 2 xn 3 by so 2 times 3 I can write 6x y to the power 3 power 3 is the same so you can write power 3 there 5a + 2 B by x - 10 10 a B to the power 3 this one power 3 is common what's inside en 2 B and C so rearranged in order numbers first ABC - ABC to the power 3 sure that this one is equal to the 36 a squared X square so we will take left hand side three years card and 2x squared what is 3a squared and 2x squared I can take as power - because power - is common inside I can write 3 and 2x they what's the next step 3 x - 6 6 a x squared this means 6 squared a squared + x squared so what is 6 squared 6 times 6 36 a squared + x squared so this is same as the right hand side so this is true Khushi number 3 arranged in ascending order of the values 2 to the power 3 what's the answer 2 times 2 times 2 8 - 10 to the power 1 means odd power you get negative 10 negative 1 to the power 10 even power with a negative number that's 1 so you get positive 1 3 squared 3 squared is 9 now arrange this in ascending order means smaller to bigger what's the 
,smallest value minus 10 so we can write negative 10 to the power 1 then the next one that's the smallest value and the next one 1 negative 1 to the power 10 8 is the next number 2 to the power 3 and 3 squared is the largest no so that's how we can write in ascending order take cushion um 2 - 2 to the power 4 this is t1 power you get a positive answer 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 that's positive 16 minus 2 to the power 5 this is odd power you get a negative answer 16 times 2 32 that's negative 
,minus 1 to the power 4 even power you get a positive answer that's positive 1 and on power you get negative 1 so what's the smallest one negative 32 so negative 2 to the power of 5 is the smallest one what's the next one - 1 - 1 to the power 5 third one is 1 minus 1 to the power 4 and the largest one is 16 that's minus 2 to the 
,power if a is a negative integer show that a squared is greater than a to the power 3 okay so here left hand side is a square so a is negative and power is even even power of any negative value is a positive value right hand side e to the power 3 odd power negative value odd power is always negative so which one is smaller negative value is smaller so a cube is smaller than a squared or a squared is bigger than a Q so here we can show that this is so we covered all three related to indices 
,so this is an important lesson for great 10l 11 as well and also great 9 so here as a summary what we discussed here we discuss if ABC and n are positive integers then a B to the power n you can write as separate powers if you take a B C to the power n you have to take separate powers the value of any power of a positive integer is always positive the value of an odd power of a negative integer is always negative and the value of an even power of a negative integer is always positive and also we looked at 1 to the power any number is 1 when you take negative 1 to odd power you get negative 1 negative 1 to even power you get positive 1 so this is the last unit in your first term work so practice this one and try to do the review exercise after this

BUJKEDqGp1U,hi I'm Lucy and in this video we're going to look at the laws of indices you should already know what indices are maybe forgotten watched this video first the laws of indices make solving complex problems involving powers much easier and they are also essential for understanding a lot of algebra processors so there are six laws 
,that we need to know multiplying and dividing with indices raising a power to a power what a power of zero means and then fractional and negative indices we're going to look at the first four in this video and then the last two in part two I promise you they really are quite logical right so multiplying indices look at how these are simplified what do you notice hopefully you can see that when we multiply indices we just add the powers together so 3 plus 4 is 7 because really it is 2 3 times x - 4 times giving us 7 twos and three plus two plus one is six looking at the final example see how we treat the numbers and the indices differently so we do 4 multiplied by 5 first and add the indices second a really important thing to know is that the base has to be the same so here because they are both base two we can add the 3 and the 4 but on this one we can't do anything because one is base 2 and one is base 3 so what happens when we divide with indices have a look and see if you 
,can work it out when we divide entities we subtract the powers but again the base must be the same so for this one we do the numbers first and subtract the indices second this is because if I wrote the equation out filly it would be the same as writing this just as you do any simplify fractions we can cancel down our numbers and our letters say we cancel the 20 and the 5 to become before and we start by cancelling out the B's so to divide indices we divide the numbers and we subtract the powers so what do you notice about these 3 when powers are raised to a power we multiply the powers together on this one be a little careful don't forget because the 3 is also inside the brackets it needs squaring 2 hence 9 but then 6 multiplied by 2 is 12 if we write this out it would be 3 B 6 x 3 e 6 and we know that when we multiply indices we add the powers so 3 x 3 is 9 and 6 plus 6 is 12 so just remember when we raise a power to a power we just multiply the two powers together so what'd you notice about the power of zero anything to the power of zero is one but why is this let's use our knowledge of fractions and also dividing indices to see why do you agree that anything divided by itself is one so a to the power of three goes into a to the power of three once that's our first equation and then using our indices knowledge when we divide we subtract the powers to 3 minus 3 is 0 and that's our second equation we've done the same calculation in two different ways therefore 
,the two answers must equal one another so combining these two things and nothing to the power of zero equals one here are some questions for you to give a go yourself pause the video work out the answers and click play when you're ready to check did you get them right so here are the four laws that we've seen so far make sure you understand why they work and then you don't need to stress about learning them watch part two to discover how fractional and negative indices work if you liked the video give it a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe comment below if you have any questions why not check out our few school app as well until next time

-zUmvpkhvW8,"Hi!  Welcome to Math Antics. In this lesson, we’re going to learn about an important math operation called exponents. …sounds kinda weird, huh? Indeed it does my good man. And I’m afraid it’s because you’re pronouncing “exponents” incorrectly. The proper pronunciation is “Indices”.  “In…di…ces”. Oh yeah, that’s right.  In a lot "
,"of countries, exponents are called Indices. But the good news is that the concept is the same no matter what term is used. And, since I’m usually an American, I’ll usually use the term “exponents” in this video, but I’ll occasionally point out the other terminology too. Sound good to you? Jolly good sir!  Toodle pip! Alright then… but what are exponents (or indices)? Well, just like the four main arithmetic operations that we use in math, exponents are a type of math operation. They tell us what to DO with numbers. Ok, but what do they tell us to do? Exponents tell us to take a number and multiply it by itself a certain number of times. In other words, exponents are basically repeated multiplication. To help you understand what I mean, let’s review multiplication for just a second. Do you remember how multiplication is basically repeated addition? For example, 2 × 4 is a shorthand way of writing 2 + 2 + 2 + 2. It’s the same as four ‘2’s being added together which equals a total of 8. Now, let’s compare that to a similar exponent. Yep, that’s an exponent, and in a minute we’ll talk about why it looks like that and why the numbers are different sizes. But for now, you just need to know that this exponent tells us to take the number 2 and multiply it 4 times. In other words, you’d take four ‘2’s and multiply them together. 2 × 2 × 2 × 2  which would equal 16. So, multiplication shows repeated addition and exponents show repeated multiplication. And we’ll see more "
,"examples of how exponents work in a minute. But first, let’s talk a little bit about why exponents look the way they do. Exponents involve two numbers. The first number is the one that gets multiplied repeatedly a certain number of times. And it’s written full size and it’s called the “base”. The second number tells us how many "
,"copies of the base to multiply together. It’s written much smaller and up at the top of the line like this. And it’s called the exponent (or the Index) And when reading exponents, some interesting terminology is used… This exponent would usually be read, “two to the fourth power”, or just “two to the fourth” for short. And this "
,"exponent would be read, “three to the fifth power”, or just “three to the fifth”. And this exponent would be read, ”ten to the sixth power”, or just “ten to the sixth”. …get the idea? Oh, and you’ll often hear people say that a number is “raised” to a certain power, …ya know… cuz it sounds kinda cool. But it’s just another way of saying the same thing. Unfortunately, that terminology has created a little confusion… Traditionally, you’d say you have a base raised to a number called an exponent, and the answer you get by doing that is called a “power” of that base. But when people started saying things like “2 to the 4th power” or “2 to the power of 4”, "
,"it made it sound like the exponent was also called the power. The result is that nowadays, you may hear people use the words “exponent” and “power” to mean the same "
,"thing. It’s unfortunate that the terms have become so “mixed up” or “wonky”, but as long as you understand that the base is the number that gets multiplied repeatedly and the exponent tells you how many of them to multiply, you’ll be in good shape. But, I know what some of you are thinking. “Where’s the operator symbol?” If exponents are math operations, don’t we need a symbol that goes between them, like there is with multiplication and the other arithmetic operations? Well, yes and no. Most of the time, we don’t need a special operation symbol because of the way the numbers are written. Since the exponent is written smaller and up at the top of the line, it looks much different from a normal digit, so we don’t need to use a symbol. In math, whenever you see a regular sized number with a smaller number up and to "
,"the right, you know it’s an exponent. And once you get used to seeing exponents like this, it’s easy to recognize them. The only real concern is when writing exponents down on paper when you’re trying to solve problems. If you’re not careful, or have really messy handwriting, you might accidentally confuse an exponent (like two "
,"to the fifth) with a two-digit number (like 25) and obviously that would be a problem. But even if you’re careful when writing exponents, there are some times when you really do need a special symbol, like when you type an exponent into a computer. In that case, it’s very common to use the “carrot” symbol as the exponent operator. The carrot symbols looks like this. So, 2 to the 5th power would be written as “2 carrot 5”, and 3 to the 4th power would be written as “3 carrot 4”. And that notation is used all the time in computer programing. Oh, and one more thing you should know before we move on… is that exponent operations do NOT have the commutative "
,"property. In other words, you can’t switch the order of the numbers, without getting a different answer. For example, 2 to the 5th power is 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 which equals 32. But if we switch the numbers: 5 to the 2nd power is 5 × 5 which equals 25. So exponents do NOT have the commutative property. Okay, now that you know what "
,"exponents are (or indices if you prefer) and you know how they’re written, it’s time to talk about how they’re used in math. As I mentioned earlier, exponents are a "
,way of doing repeated multiplication. 3 to the 2nd power is the same as 3 × 3 3 to the 3rd power is the same as 3 × 3 × 3 3 to the 4th power is the same as 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 3 to the 5th power is the same as 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 …see the pattern? So exponents can save you a lot of writing when you need to show repeated multiplication. 
,"But, what about when you actually need to DO repeated multiplication. Do exponents help then? Well… yes and no. If you have to actually figure out what 3 to the 5th "
,"power is, you still need to multiply '3' together 5 times. And you could do that by hand, or you could use a calculator to help you. In fact, if you have a multi-function or ‘scientific’ calculator, it might have a button on it that looks like this:  ‘x’ to the power of ‘y’, which makes calculating exponents really easy. Let’s try using that calculator function to figure out what this exponent would be: 6 to the 4th power (which is the same as four ‘6’s multiplied together). On most calculators, this is how the exponent button works… First, you type in the number that’s the base of your exponent. So in this problem, we’d type in 6. And then you’d hit the exponent button, which might not do anything besides let the calculator know that the next number you give it will be an exponent. So next, you enter the exponent which is 4 in this case. Now all you have to do is hit the equals sign to get the answer which is 1,296. Wow!  As you can see, knowing how to do that with a calculator saved us a lot of work. And now we know that four ‘6’s multiplied together will be 1,296. In the examples we’ve seen so far, we’ve only had simple one-digit exponents like 2, 3, or 4. But exponents can be any number.  You could have 2 to the 84th power, or 12 to the 516th power. In fact, as crazy as it sounds, you can even have exponents that are decimals or negative numbers! But we’ll save advanced exponents like that for future videos. In the last part of this video, I want to focus on the two most common exponents you’ll encounter, which are 2 and 3. That is, you’ll very often see a number raised to the second power or to the third power. In fact, those exponents are SO common that they even have special names. When a number is raised to the second power, we say it’s being “squared”. So 5 to the second power is also referred to as “5 squared” and 12 to the 2nd power would be “12 squared”. Now if you’re new to exponents, that might sound kinda funny, but can you think of a reason why the term “squared” is used? Yep!  That’s how you’d calculate the area of a square shape. Since squares have sides that are all the same length, if you multiply that length together twice (like 4 × 4 or 5 × 5 or 6 × 6) it gives you the area of that square. And it’s a similar story for numbers that are raised to the third power. In that case, you’d say that the number is being “cubed”. So, 5 to the third power is also “5 cubed”, and 8 to the 3rd power would be “8 cubed”. Since "
,"cubes are 3-dimensional objects with sides that are all the same length, if you multiply that length together 3 times, you’d get the volume of the cube. So squaring "
,"a number gets its name from squares and cubing a number gets its name from cubes. And that helps explain why the exponents 2 and 3 are really common in math. Because we interact with 2 and 3 dimensional objects all the time in the real world, there are lots of practical applications. Okay, so now you know that exponents are a way of showing repeated multiplication, and you also know what the two numbers in an exponent mean. The base is the number that will get repeatedly multiplied together, and the exponent (or index) tells us how many times to repeat it. In the next video, we’ll learn more about exponents and their inverse operations called roots. Learning math takes a lot of practice, so be sure to practice what you’ve learned in this video.

XIsJmSTjTdg,hello children today i'm here to teach you chapter 5 in your textbook that's indices so we'll look at what are indices take this 1 3 into 3 so you need the number how many times you multiply 3 1 2 3 4 5 6. instead of this we can write 3 6 times like this 3 to the power 6. so this one 3 to the power of 6 or 6 power of 3 so we call this is index notation so this is index notation so the number above this three we call the index index is the singular term indices is the plural index and the number here we call that's the base so base 3 and the index 6 3 to the power of 6 write as index notation so base is 9 now 1 2 3 4 5 6 9 to the power 6 base is 10 1 2 
,3 4 5 10 to the power 5 1 2 3 4 base is minus 3 to the power of 1 2 3 so negative 7 to the power of 3 and 0.3 is the base so 0.3 to the power 1 2 3 that's to the power 3. so that's how we write down these terms expanded version to index notation so some more examples 2.7 is the base so you can write 2.7 to the power of 3. one two three four five half to the power of five three fifths is the base now three fifths to the power of 1 2 3 so power of 3 minus 11 is the pace now to the power of 1 
,2 3 4 to the power of 4 here and minus 2.5 yeah i'll put all minus 2.5 that's the base to the power of 1 2 3 to the power of write these in expanded form the other way round eight to the power of three that means eight three times eleven to the power of four eleven four times nine to the power of five nine five times minus 11 to the power of 4 so you get minus 11 minus 11 11 and minus 11 1 2 3 4 and 5 8 to the power of 3 so you can write 5 over 8 5 over 8 and five over eight so three times 
,some more questions minus two point eight three times minus two 2.8 minus 2.8 and another minus 2.8 13 to the power 5 13 5 times 3 four five minus two sevens three times minus two over seven minus two over seven and another minus two over seven three times minus 37 to the power of four that means four times you have to write minus 37 twice three times and four times and three to the power five three five times so that's how we write index notation to expanded form powers that the base is an algebraic symbol so consider a a is an unknown term not equal to zero so what can you write this one one two three four five a to the power five so five is the index and a is the base so why this is cannot be 0 it's not defined now the term a if it's 0 what happens 0 to the power 5 0 0 5 times 0 so a is not equal to 0 any number you can write here so this is a general notation expand this one a to the power 3 a 3 times x to the power 4 x 4 times y to the power 5 by 5 times minus 8 to the power minus a to the power 4 and minus b to the power 3 so you get minus b minus v minus b so three times you have to multiply write in index notation now the other way around so 2 is there but it's not 2 is there but it's just once a how many times 1 2 3 so you get a to the power 3. now when you are multiplying this with a constant coefficient there so you don't write down the multiplication so you can just write 2a to the power 3 2 once and a 3 times this one 3 twice there 3 to the power 2 and how many x's are there 1 2 3 3 x's so how do you simplify this 3 squared 3 times 3 or you can write so no need to expand index notation so 3 square r and x cubed this one five how many times one two three five three times and b only once and a 1 2 a twice so 5 3 times a twice and 1 b so you can write this one as 5 to the power 3 a squared and b you can change the terms all is not important 5 to the power 3 a squared and b write as indices similar to the above 1 2 3 7 to the power 3 x is 1 2 x square this one three squared three twice are there and a twice b twice a squared b squared this one nine twice then p twice and q twice so power two so when you are writing down expressions make sure that the number you write first then the letters 11 3 times and m twice and in twice this one excess how many x's are there one two two x's how many y's one two three three y's and how many z's are there one two two z's write the followings in expanded form now we'll expand all these x to the power 3 x x x 3 x 2 to the power 3 1 2 3 and x squared means x and x two x's seven to the power four means you need to write four sevenths and then y squared y and what 2 squared a to the power 3 b squared 2 twice a 3 times and b twice 11 squared y cubed and z squared 11 twice y three times and z twice some more questions a squared b squared c squared a twice b twice and c twice c three times not twice c three times x cube y and z squared x three times y once and z twice seven p squared q to the power three are seven ones p twice and then q three times and then r once a squared bc a twice b ones and c ones x y squared z x once y twice and z what's finding the value of a power through substitution now we see how we can find the answer by substituting values so you need to find out the value of 2a squared when a equals 3. so what we do you write down this and then you can substitute a equals 3 that means 3 squared now find the answer 2 is there 3 squared means 3 times 3 that's 9. so 9 times 2 you get 18 as the answer find the value of 5 a squared b when a equals 3 and b equals to 5 a squared b now substitute 5 a is 3 i can write 3 
,squared and b equals 2. now find out separately 5 3 squared means 3 times 3 that's 9 times 2. so 5 times 2 10 10 times 9 90. this one 7xy square x equals 4 y equals 
,3. first substitute 7 instead of x i can write 4. instead of y i can write 3. now 7 times 4 3 times 3 9. so what's the answer 7 times 4 28 28 times 9 72 here 9 times 2 18 18 and 7 you get 25 the answer is 252 find the value of 11 p squared q squared when p equals 2 and q equals 1. now we'll substitute p is 2. so 2 squared q is 1 1 squared so 11 2 squared means 2 times 2 that's 4 1 square 1 to the power any number is 1 1 to the power 100 is also 1. so 11 times 4 you get 44. look at the other one a squared b c square so substitute the values a square that means 3 squared b is 2. c squared c squared means 5 square now 3 squared is 9 2 and 5 squared is 25 
,now what's the easiest way to multiply you can't yeah 2 times 25 50. 50 times 9. 450 this one x cube y square x equals half y equals 4 x is half so half to the power 3 y means 4 to the power 2. now when you are taking the fraction power 3 consider for both numerator and the denominator so you get 1 to the power 3 is 1 and below 
,2 to the power 3 what's 2 to the power 3 2 times 2 times 2 that's 8. and here you get 4 square now simplify 4 squared 4 times 4 16 and below 2 times 2 times 2 that's 8. 16 divided by 8 you get 2. find the value of this 36 a b squared when a equals one third equals half 36 a b squared so 36 times a is one third p is half half squared so i get 36 one third is there so this one 1 squared is 1 2 squared is 4 4 in the denominator 2 squared now simplify 4 times 9 36 3 times 1 and 3 times 3. so what's the answer you get 3 as the answer find the value of x cube y over 9 when x is 3 y equals 11. x is three so three to the power three eleven is there divide by nine what's three to the power three three times three times three that's twenty now simplify 9 times 1 9 times 3 3 times 11 you get 33 find the value of this one 7 a squared b c cube it's given a is 3 b is 2 and c is 1. so any power of 1 is 1 first we'll do 3 squared 3 times 3 you get 9 and this is 1. so you get 7 times 2 fourteen fourteen times nine nine times four thirty-six nine times one nine plus three twelve so hundreds twenty-six find the value of this one 16 m squared over n cube when m is 3 and n is 2. now we'll simplify 16 3 squared 3 times 3 9. 2 to the power 3 2 times 2 times 2 that's 8. now simplify you get 8 times 1 8 times 2 9 times 2 get 18. find the value of a squared b squared c squared here we'll change this to b squared here because it's given b square now substitute 4 squared let's be 3 and c 
,2 squared 4 squared means 16. 4 times 4. 3 times 3 you get 9. and below 2 times 2 means 4 so 4 times 1 4 times 4 9 times 4 36 now this is different write the number 
,81 as an index of three so we can divide and see how many threes are there when you take 81 divide by 3 3 times 2 6 and 21 that's 7 again divide by 3 you get 9 divided by 3 again you get 3 and again you get 1 till you get 1 you divide how many threes are there one two three four three four times so how can you write in index notation 3 to the power 4 is 81. right 5 to the power 3 into 5 to the power 2 expanded and as an index of 5 so what is 5 to the power 3 means 3 times 5 squared means 5 
,twice now all together how many fives are there 1 2 3 4 5. so you can write instead of 5 to the power 3 and 5 to the power 2 you can write 5 to the power 5. write a 
,3 and a 4 expanded and as an index notation a to the power 3 means 3 times you have to multiply a to the power 4 means 4 times now count all together how many a's are there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 to the power 7 write the value of x squared minus y squared if x equals 5 and y equals 3. first expand it and now we'll multiply 5 times 5 minus 3 times 3. 5 times 5 25 3 times 3 9 now subtract you get 16 as the answer write the value of a square plus b squared plus c squared if a equals 3. so we write down and b equals 2 and so we need to substitute b b equals 2. so 2 squared and c squared that means 5 square you have to do separately and add it 3 squared 3 times 3 
,nice 2 squared 2 times 2 5 squared means 5 times 5 25 now add all together 9 plus 4 13 25 and 13. just add it 38 is the answer write the value of x squared plus y squared over z if x equals 5 y equals 3 z equals 2 so substitute x equals 5 5 squared y is 3 3 squared over z is 2. now expand 5 squared means 5 times 5 that's 25 3 squared 3 times 3 that's 9. now when you do division first you have to simplify the numerator 25 plus 9 what's the answer 9 plus 5 is 14 and you get 3. so 25 and 9 when you add it 34 and divide by 2 now what's the answer 2 times 1 and for 14 that's 7. so 17 is the answer complete the following table power is given so what's the base they are 3 is the base index is 2 and the value is 3 squared means 3 times 3 9. now we'll do this one base is 5. power is 2 index is 2 so that means 5 times 5 you get 25 2 to the power 4 base is 2 index is 4 so 2 4 times what's the answer 2 times 2 4 4 times 2 8 8 times 2 16 7 square base is 7 index is 2 7 times 7 you get 49 
,6 to the power 3 base is 6 index is 3 6 into 6 into 6 6 into 6 36 36 into 6 260. 11 square basis 11 and index is 2 11 times 11 that's the answer 1 21 10 squared base is 10 index is 2 10 times 10 that's hundreds 4 to the power 3 this is 4 index is 3 4 3 times 4 times 4 16 16 times 4 that's 64. we'll check it at 64. write the value of 3 squared over a4 when a equals to 3 squared 3 times 3 a to the power 4 means 2 to the power 4. now what is 2 to the power 4 we know that you can do it at once 
,2 times 2 4 4 times 2 8 8 times 2 16. 3 times 3 9 and then 16. so what's the answer you can't simplify further you get a fraction 9 over 16. find a if 80 equals 2a now this is aldevera so how can we find out this one we'll take the number and see how many twos are there when you divide by 2 you get 4 here again when you divide by 2 you get what 2 3 times so 8 i can write 3 times this is 2 to the power now we can write in index notation this is 1 2 3 2 to the power 3. now look at this one this is an equation both sides should be equal and same base so you can compare the power so we can write a should be equal to 3 if this is an equation so straight away you can find a equals 3 now another one 9 equals 3 to the power b so what is 9 how many 3's are there divide and see that's twice so i can write 3 times 3 is 3 to 
,the power b 3 squared now can you see same base you can equate the powers so b equals 2. write the number 4 into 8 as a power of 2. so we'll do the separate ones 4. 
,divide by 2 you get 2 into 2 8 when you divide by 2 you get 2 into 2 into 2 3 times now how many twos are there one two three four five so we can write this is same 
,as 2 to the power 5. write the number 9 into 27 as a power of 3 what's 9 3 times 3 27 you get three three times three times three times three now when you multiply these two i can write first you've got two threes and the second you got three threes all together one two three four five five threes are there you can write as three to the power five find the value of 2 squared into 3 squared 2 squared and 3 squared what is 2 squared 2 into 2 that's 4. 3 into 3 that's 9. 9 times 4 36 find the 
,value of 5 squared and 2 to the power 3. you can do 5 squared that means five times five two to the power three means two three times five times five is twenty-five 
,two times two times two that's eight 25 times 8 what's the answer you know 25 times 4 is 100 so you get 200 so 8 times 5 40 8 times 2 16 plus 4 20. so 200 now we'll 
,look at the review exercise in your textbook expand each of the following as a product and find the value of the given expression so what's 3 squared 3 into 3 3 times 3 you get 9. 5 to the power 4 that means 5 4 times 5 times 5 25 again 5 times 5 25 25 times 25 625 this one 2 square that means 2 twice and 3 once 2 times 2 4 4 times 3 twelve six squared six times six five squared five times five so you can do yeah easy way is six times five thirty six times five thirty thirty times thirty so three times three nine and put two zeros so nine hundred question number two write down each of the following products using index notation base is four how many fours are there one two three we can write four to the power of 3 7 is the base how many sevens 1 2 3 4 7 to the power of 4. how many 2 is there twice and how many 3's are there twice so you can write 2 to the power of 2 and 3 to the power of 2. how many 3's are there 1 2 3 how many 5's 1 2 so you can write this one as index notation like that fill in the blanks in the following table 25 means 5 square base is 5 index is 2 5 to the power 2 so this one 343 base is 7 given so we'll check it out divide by 7 7 times 4 28. so 28 and you get 63 so you get 9 here 7 times 9 63 7 times 7 again 7 times 1 so you get base 7 what's the index 3 so 7 to the power 3. so how can you write this one 7 to the power 3 now next one 6 to the power 3 so 6 to the power 3 is this one so what's the base 6 index is 3 now we need to find out what's 6 times 6 times 6 6 times 6 36 36 times 6 6 times 6 36 3 remaining 6 times 3 18 plus 3 21 so yeah number is 260. write the number 16 using index notation with base 2. so we'll take 16 and how many twos are there you get 8 2 times 4 2 times 2 and 2 times 1 1 2 3 4. i can write 2 to the power 4 using index notation with base 
,4 so base 4 means i can find out how many 4s are there how many fours two times two four two times two four so four twice i can write the same thing as if it's base 
,four the power is two example number 1 write down the number 36 as a product of powers with prime numbers as bases so here 36 we can divide by 2 you get 18. divide by 2 again 9. now we can divide by 3. you get 3 and 1. so how can we write down 36 2 into 2 and 3 into 3. i can write 2 to the power 2 and 3 to the power 2. write down the 100 as a product of powers with prime numbers so take hundred and see how many twos are there you get 50. again you can divide by 2 you get 25 now divide by five you get five here again five you get one so hundred i can write as two times two and five times five so what's 2 times 2 2 to the power 2 5 into 5 means 5 to the 
,power 2 exercise 5.1 write 25 in index notation with 5 as the base so what's 25 when you divide by 5 you get 2 5's are there so 5 squared write 64 in index notation 
,with base 2 64. divide by 2 you get 36 divided by 2 again 18 divided by 2 9 and you can divide by 3. how many 2's are there 2 1 2 3 2 to the power 3 how many 3's are there that's 1 2. so you can write 2 to the power 3 into 3 to the power 2. write 81 in index notation with 3 as the base so we'll see how many 3's are there divide 
,by 3 you get 27 divide by 3 again 9 3 again you get 3 and finally one so how many threes are there one two three four so 81 i can write as 3 to the power 4. write 49 in index notation with 7 as the base so take 49 and divide by 7 7 times 7 so how many 7's are there so i can write 49 as 7 squared two sevens are there write each of the following numbers as a product of powers with prime numbers as bases take 18 you can divide by 2 that's 9 divide by 3 you get 3 here and 1. so how can i write 
,18 2 once and 3 twice that's 3 square 24 divide by 2 get 12 divide by 2 again you get 6 divide by 2 that's 3 divide by 3 you get 1. so 24 i can write how many twos that's three and how many threes that's one you don't need to write one two to the power three and three forty-five forty-five you can divide by three you get fifteen divide by three again you get 5 and divide by 5 you get 1 so 45 i can write 3 squared and 1 5 70 first we'll do 63 you can divide by 3 you get 21 divide by 3 again 
,you get 7 and divide by 7 that's 1. so 63 i can write 3 squared and 1 7 72 divide and see first you can divide by 2 that's 36 divide by 2 against 80 divided by 2 that's 9 now you can divide by 3 get 1 so how many 2s 2 to the power 3 and how many threes two threes three square example number one write down each of the following expressions using index notation p is a base how many p's are there one two three so p to the power three space is x and space is y how many x's you get two how many 
,y's you get 3 this one base 2 how many 2's that's 2. how many is 1 2 3 you can write 8 to the power 3 this one how many 3's 1 2 3 and how many m's you get 2 example 
,number 2 expand and write each of the following expressions as a product so m to the power 3 m 3 times p squared q to the power 3 means p twice and q three times five squared and x to the power three five twice and x three times exercise 5.2 write down each of the following expressions using index notation x how many times are there one two three four six to the power four a three times a you can write three times one two three this one you get two letters m to i m how many times not twice 
,one two three m three times in one two three three times this one seven how many times one two three and p twice this question first we'll write down the number one 
,two three seven 3 times and y 1 2 3 4 4 times you can write this without multiplication sign here i can simplify this one m to the power 3 n to the power 3 so this is also possible you don't need a multiplication sign there expand and write each of the following expressions as a product a square a times a two times you need to multiply two p squared two ones and p twice two to the power three and m square that means 2 3 times and m twice 3 squared x cubed 3 twice and x three times x cube y 
,cubed x three times and y three times so you can write like this that's the expanded form example number one find the value of each of the following expressions when x equals 5 so we'll substitute 5 to the power 3 x is 5 and you need to find the value 5 to the power 3 means 5 3 times so what's the value 5 times 5 25 25 times 5 125 3x that means 3 times 5. you get 15. example number 2 find the value of each of the following expressions when a equals 3 and b equals 5 a squared that means 3 squared and 5. what's 3 squared 3 times 3 9. 9 times 5 is 45 this one 2 a a means 3 to the power 3 and b means 5 to the power 2. now we'll do it separately 2 is there 
,3 times 3 times 3 3 times 3 9 9 times 3 27 and 5 squared means 5 times 5 you get 25 so this is easy 25 times 2 50 50 times 27 that means you put a 0 and multiply by 
,5 5 times thirty five three remain five times two ten plus three thirty so the answer is thousand three hundred and fifty exercise five point three find the value of each of the following expressions by substituting x equals 3 3 to the power 4. now do it at once 3 times 3 9 9 times 3 27 27 times 3 that's 81 this one 3 and x squared means 3 squared so this is same as 3 to the power 2 and 3 3 to the power 3 3 times you are multiplying so same thing 3 times 3 9 9 times 3 27 5 and 3 to the power 3. so what's 3 to the power 3 we found 27 so 5 times 27 now 5 times 7 35 3 remaining 5 times 2 10 plus 3 30 so 135 find the value of each of the following expressions by substituting a equals 3. so 2 is 3. so 3 squared so what's 3 squared 9. 2 times 9 you get 18. 2 squared and a is 3 3 squared 2 squared is 4 3 squared is 9 9 times 4 36 7 a squared 7 into a is 3 3 square 7 into 9 you get 63 find the value of each of the following expressions by substituting x equals 1 and y equals 7 so you get 2 letters x is 1 1 squared y is 7 1 to the power any number is 1 7 to the power 3 7 x 7 49 49 times 7 so 28 plus 6 323 this one 2 x is 1 1 to the power 3 and y 
,equals 7 this is 1 2 times 7 you get 14. this one 3 x is 1 y squared means 7 squared so 7 squared means 7 times 7 49 49 times 3 so 3 times 9 27 3 times 4 12 plus 2 14. so 147 question number four find the value of each of the following expressions by substituting a equals 2 and b equals 7 equals 2. so 2 to the power 2 and 7. 2 to the power 2 is 4 4 times 7 you get 28. a b squared a equals 2 b equals 7 so 7 squared 2 times 7 times 7 49 what's 2 times 49 2 times 9 18 1 remaining 2 times 4 8 plus 1 9 so the answer is 98 so a to the power 3 b to the power 2 so a equals 2 b equals 7 2 to the power 3 7 to the power 2. 2 times 2 times 2 that's 8. 7 times 7 49. so what's 49 times 8 72 and 8 times 4 32 32 and 7 39 so 392. this one three a square a means 2 2 to the power 2 b means 7 7 square so 3 2 times 2 4 7 times 7 49 so what's the answer 3 times 4 12 12 times 49 so we will do the multiplication 49 times 12 that means 10 and 2. you multiply by 1 multiply by 2 get 98. so add it together you get 500. so we covered all theory related to indices so you need to remember what's index notation and what is the base and what is the index and when the two powers are connected with the multiplication sign it is the basis of both the powers are not numerical values then it is not necessary to include the multiplication sign so that means something like this so here 2 a to the power 3 so no need to put the multiplication sign a value can be obtained for an expression in index notation with an unknown base by substituting a number for the unknown term so this is an important lesson you are getting questions related to this in your o level exam

LkhPRz7Hocg,do you know why i pulled you over today uh some law that's right allah this law to be exact laws of exponents i've never even heard of these how was i supposed to know well you must have never heard of math antics they're this really cool math video series they have all sorts of basic math videos and the host is really funny is 
,this some sort of ad can i skip this no i think you'll really like it check it out hi this is rob welcome to math antics in this video we're going to learn about the laws of exponents if you look up the laws of exponents online or in a math book you'll probably see a long list of equations that look something like this wow that's kind of overwhelming when you see them all at once but don't worry we'll take them one step at a time and you'll see that they're not that complicated after all but before we get going if you're not confident with the basics of exponents i highly recommend watching our previous videos about them before moving on in this video 
,okay let's start with just the first two laws on our list which should look familiar if you watched our video called exponents in algebra they're just the two rules 
,we learned in that video you know rules laws same difference so you probably already know them they simply tell us that anything raised to the first power is itself 
,and anything raised to the zeroth power is just one and because we already know about exponents that are higher integer values like x to the second x to the third that means we've pretty much got things covered right ah not so fast don't forget that integers can have negative values too for example what if we add the expression 
,x to the power of negative one or negative two or negative three we know that exponents are a way of doing repeated multiplication but how in the world could you multiply something together a negative number of times well you can't fortunately the next law on our list tells us how to interpret a negative exponent that law says x to the negative nth power equals 1 divided by x to the nth power and if you think about it that kind of makes sense a negative number is the inverse of its positive counterpart and division is the inverse operation of multiplication right so a negative exponent is basically repeated division x to the negative 1 would be 1 divided by x x to the negative 2 would be 1 divided by x divided by x x to the negative 3 would be 1 divided by x divided by x divided by x and so on seeing it like this 
,makes the pattern clear but mathematicians prefer to express negative exponents in fraction form where one is divided by the same number of x's multiplied together but since those multiplied x's are all on the bottom of the fraction you're actually dividing by all of them here's an example that will help you see that that's true 2 to the negative third power let's first try that as a repeated division problem like our pattern shows us we always start with a 1 so we would have 1 divided by 2 divided by 2 divided by 2. if we do those operations from left to right using a calculator we get 0.125 as the answer now let's write it in fraction form like our law of exponents tells us we can 2 to the negative 3rd power would be the same as one divided by two to the third power and that's the same as one over two times two 
,times two which simplifies to one over eight and one over eight simplifies to 0.125 see whether you write it as a pattern of repeated division or in fraction form like our inverse law shows you get the same answer and now you know how to handle any expression with a negative exponent it's just 1 over the same expression with a positive exponent x to the negative one is one over x to the positive one or just one over x x to the negative two is one over x to the positive two x to the negative three is one over x to the positive three and so on all right three laws down five more to go and these next five show us how we can do various math operations involving exponents in fact the next law tells us how we can take a number raised to a power and then raise that to a power as you can see it shows an expression x to the power of m grouped inside parentheses and then that whole group is being raised to the nth power it's a nesting situation kind of like those russian nesting dolls 
,so what if someone asks you to simplify the expression x squared cubed which means the entire x squared term is raised to the third power well our law tells us that 
,we can simplify that by multiplying the exponents together see how it equals x to the power of m n which means m times n that means x squared raised to the third power would be the same as x to the power of two times three which is six wanna see why that's true well think about what it would mean to raise x squared to the third 
,power it would mean multiplying three x squared terms together like this and each one of those x squared terms simplifies to x times x right so we end up with six x's being multiplied together which is just x to the sixth power see our law works great if you have a number raised to a power and that's all raised to another power 
,you can just multiply the two exponents together to simplify it and it works for negative exponents too like what if we had x squared raised to the negative third power well our law tells us that that's the same as x to the power of two times negative three which is x to the negative sixth to see if that's true we'll need to use the law we just learned about negative exponents and rewrite this as one over x squared to the positive third power that simplifies to one over x squared times x squared times x squared which in turn simplifies to one over six x's being multiplied together and that all checks out because one over x to the sixth would be the same as x to the negative sixth power pretty cool huh okay we're halfway through our list of laws and we're gonna look at the next two as a set because they tell us how we can multiply and divide expressions that have the same base and that's important because we couldn't simplify them to have a single exponent if the bases were different the first law says that if we have the base x with exponent m being multiplied by the same base x with exponent n we can combine them simply by adding the exponents together and the second law says if we have the base x with exponent m being divided by the same base x with exponent n we can combine them simply by subtracting the exponents let's see some examples of each like this one two to the third times two to the fourth does that fit the pattern of our first law yep the base of 
,both expressions is the same but they happen to have different exponents the law would still work if the exponents were the same but they don't have to be just the bases have to be the same our law tells us that this would equal 2 to the power of three plus four or two to the seventh power but does it well let's break it down and see two to the third is two times two times two and that's being multiplied by two to the fourth which is two times two times two times two that's a lot of twos being multiplied together seven two's to be exact aha so that is what you'd get by just adding the exponents together since three plus four equals seven and this law makes total sense if you think about what an exponent really means the exponent is telling you to do repeated multiplication of the base right so this first part is telling you to multiply three twos together and the second part is telling you to multiply four twos together so that's why you can add the exponents together if the 
,base is the same or think about it like this if we had 10 x's all being multiplied together we could form different groups of them and combine them using exponents like we could combine the first four x's into x to the fourth and combine the remaining six x's into x to the sixth and of course those expressions would be multiplied together since all of the x's were being multiplied but you'd probably never want to do that would you i mean why not just combine all 10 x's into the expression x to the tenth ah but there you see that our law holds true x to the fourth times x to the sixth would equal x to the power of four plus six or x to the tenth okay now let's move on and see some examples of the second law in this set which tells us how to divide expressions with the same base suppose we have the expression 5 to the third power divided by 5 to the second power our law says that we can simplify this by subtracting the exponents specifically we take the exponent on the top and 
,subtract the exponent on the bottom from it if we do that the simplified version would be 5 to the power of 3 minus 2 or 5 to the first power but is that right to see let's write the expression out in expanded form on the top of our division problem we have five to the third which is five times five times five and on the bottom 
,we have five to the second which is five times five does this look like something you've seen while simplifying fractions yep since all the bases are the same they form pairs of common factors on the top and bottom that can be canceled out this 5 over 5 cancels and this 5 over 5 cancels if you don't know why that works be sure to watch our video about simplifying fractions and what do we end up with well all the factors on the bottom cancelled out which leaves 1 since there's always a factor of 1 and there's only one 5 left on the top so our expression simplified to 5 over one or just five following our law we got a simplified version of five to the first power which is also just five so it really did work but to make sure you've really got it let's try using this law again with the expression x to the fourth power over x to the sixth power this one's interesting our law says that we can simplify it by subtracting the bottom exponent from the top right but in this case that will give us a negative exponent because the bottom exponent is bigger than the top four minus six would be negative two so according to our law this expression should be equal to x to the negative two let's try writing it out in expanded form to see if that's true on the top x to the fourth would be the same as four x's multiplied together and on the bottom x to the sixth would be the same as six x's multiplied together once again we see that there are pairs of common factors that we can cancel four pairs to be precise and when we cancel them all we're left with a one on the top because there's always a factor of one and only two x's multiplied together on the bottom if we recombine these two x's we get one over x squared and if you remember the law we learned earlier about negative exponents you'll see that one over x squared is exactly the same as x to the power of negative two so these laws really do work okay it's finally time to look at the last two laws on our list and 
,fortunately they're pretty easy ones so we're not going to spend too much time on them these laws look kind of similar to the last pair just like before the first one involves multiplication and the second one involves division but notice that in these laws the bases are different but the exponents are the same that's the exact 
,opposite of the situation with the last pair of laws it turns out that these laws aren't about simplifying exponents they're about how you can distribute or undistribute a common exponent to different bases the first law shows this group x times y that's being raised to the power of m and it says that you can rewrite it as x to 
,the m times y to the m in other words you can distribute the exponent to each factor in the group and the second law shows the group x divided by y that's being raised to the power of n and it says that you can rewrite it as x to the n divided by y to the n in other words you can distribute the exponent to each part of the fraction of course these laws would work in reverse too and you could undistribute the exponents if they're the same for example if you're given the expression x squared 
,times y squared you could rewrite that as the quantity x times y squared and if you have the expression x squared divided by y squared you could rewrite that as the 
,quantity x over y squared here are two expressions that will help you see why you can distribute or undistribute exponents like our laws show in the first expression we have the quantity x times y squared and that's the same as x times y times x times y and the commutative property says that we can rearrange those factors like this x times x times y times y but look we can simplify that into x squared times y squared so that checks out in the second expression we have the quantity x over y 
,squared that's the same as x over y times x over y to multiply these fractions we just multiply the tops and multiply the bottoms which gives us x times x over y times y and that simplifies to x squared over y squared so that one checks out too all right so now you know about the so called laws of exponents and there's a good chance that you'll see them explained in slightly different forms or different orders or even using different terminology in other math videos or books but the basic ideas will be the same some people like to try to memorize this list of laws and you can do that if you want to but it's an even better idea to focus on knowing how exponents really work because if you truly understand that you can actually figure out a lot of these laws for yourself and what's the best way to understand how exponents really work yep you gotta practice so be sure to do some problems with exponents on your own as always thanks for watching math antics and i'll see you next time learn more at mathantics.com so what'd you think i thought you said the guy was going to be funny

mfMAbap5Rms,hi I'm Lucy and in this video we're going to look at indices see this small floating number here and here this is an indexed number or a power and the plural of index number is indices hence the title of this video it just tells us how many times a number or letter has been multiplied by itself so 3 squared means 3 multiplied by 3 twice X cubed means X multiplied by X multiplied by X so 3 x + 2 y ^ 4 means 2y x 2y 4 times you know how in algebra we have silent ones so we don't write one a we just write a something without a power so be for example really means B ^ 1 but the one is silence we don't write it can you answer these three questions pause the video work out the answer and click play when you're ready to check did you get them right so that's the admin part covered now we are ready to look at the laws of 
,indices these laws or rules make complex sums which involve powers much easier and they are also essential for understanding lots of algebraic processes watch our law of indices videos to discover more
,
4OB9YpIcAO8,so let's talk about indices now let's go right down here so indices what are indices and how we trade them what are the biggest ones we're all about let's talk about this so an index is really just a basket of stocks from a specific country okay not necessarily a specific country but in these examples it will be so we have a group of stocks now they're weighted according to depending on the index some indexes or indices should I say have a weighting by market cap so the bigger valuation of 
,the company they have more waiting on the index so they will move that index more through a hundred stocks and index one of them may well have ten percent waiting so it causes much more remove than something that's right just about any index and if that moves ten percent it's not going to do anything to the index you've got others that are weighted by price it just depends on what your trading and my recommendation is once you've chosen one just spend a few hours researching the constituents with sectors that are in there the type of market the type of companies that are in there the volatility of the companies perhaps a little bit about the news flow 
,and then forget about it you don't need to do that every day before your trading but let's say you're trading the data it's the fact is this let's let's put some some markets up there so he's got the Dow we've got the dax just an example where guys with the CAC and we've got the footsie now the Dow is 30 stocks the dax is 30 stocks the CAC is 40 stocks the footsies 100ms is put another one in for luck the SP is 500 stocks so these are just some of the big indices or indexes we've got out there whatever you want to call them but thou is 30 stocks of the biggest kind of longest lasting stocks we have in the US some people say is a bit of an outdated index however from retraining perspective it's quite a good benchmark use it's quite a good trading vehicle it can be quite volatile at times um but you know if you want to trade the spreads of type for us in the UK and of course trading of our cfb or for training virus spread bet it's fine because the spreads are tight and it's very liquid so it's really cheap for us to trade a good one to trade then we have the S&P 500 by the way this is the US if I didn't mention that hopefully I think you guys probably know that but it's the US market and it's telling you ultimately it's a bit of a barometer of the u.s. you know corporate environment commercial environment if you like if these markets are at all-time highs business is doing well earnings are coming in good expecting to grow they're making money everyone is kind of happy and it's working well shareholders are making money all that kind of stuff so packs 30 is a 30 stocks in the German market CAC is in the French market 40 stocks in the Frenchman in the French in France and a fortune 100 offices UK so what are the differences between all these and how they operate now going back to the original point if you're going to trade these and my advice is really to you know understand a little bit about what is in them you don't have to overanalyze they're not saying analyze 500 companies if you're trading us be 500 however you know if you're trading something it makes sense to see what is the overall weighting of that hasn't got a lot of tech in it has got a lot of Finance in it has it got a lot of utility telecoms what is the overall mix you know what is of the biggest weighted stocks are they banks are they you know energy companies what are they and then kind of just understanding what your trading really you don't have to go in to add too 
,much depth about it but I think it's important to know because when you are trading perhaps you know one of these and you see that in the news finance stocks are getting hit and you know a specific index has very high waiting on Finance then you are going to know that perhaps the index is going to be here and then you could trade a accordingly not let's talk about setups so much here but it's about these from a training perspective Dow is a very very tight spread great one to trade great well to get involved in good ones to start off with S&P 500 the spread is again quite tight however because it doesn't move so much the spread relatives the daily range is normally a little bit higher so from a day-trading perspective I'm being very broad here you know depends on the environment you're in terms of what you're praying the stress you're trading but generally speaking because it trades in quarter appoint increments in the futures market and then the CFD in January price similarly the actual tick value a tick per range value for trading intraday you get better bang for your buck if you like if you're trading that doubt just my opinion on it 
,if your swing trading it it doesn't matter obviously you're trading two different things is you've got to understand the volatility is going to be different in different environments but that's generally how I will look at it and look at the backs that ax is an absolute beast to trade in cents a monster at times this thing will 
,just swing wildly I don't know why specifically that is I've got a feeling it's to do with the high tech value in the futures market you're looking at $25 per point 
,move for one year one contract a 25 euro sorry not dollars for one contract so you know even if you're a small trader that is going to sting if you've got a hundred 
,point daily range you're looking at two and a half thousand dollar euro daily range which royalty CFDs is so useful because you could have to do 25 of your small account or if you're learning you can go right down to a small amount and you don't have to stomach that full massive to a half thousand euro swing if you're just starting out because if you're just starting out no matter what you've got in your account you don't want to be having that kind of swing understandably so that's a really good one it's very volatile it's one of my favourite markets to trade I love the dax because it just swings about it kind of moves in the way that I prefer to trade intraday it gives you those no regular runs as well if you're a swing trader so you can grab hold with those big move as well it's just a nice market Ettore one of my favorites I'm a little bit biased I talk about these cactus really I've never traded this one arm very much at all I've placed a couple of trades on their relative generally would have been pair trading the dax against the CAC many years ago this now on but ultimately it kind of follows the dax a lot more it's a little bit more of a shadow with the DAX that the companies are a little bit less on though okay some big boys in there of course French you've got a farcical some very big companies not saying that happen but from a training perspective and the DAX is a kind of better trading vehicle in my opinion you may prefer the cat because a little bit slower a little bit more of a chugging thing are the spreads are a little bit wider relatively speaking backs again really good bang for your buck use that term I 
,get a phrase again because you get so much volatility so much moving the spreads are so tight if you're day trading equals swing trading it you're getting great value because you're not really paying much to Trey you're pay paying a tick whenever it may be and the whole other thing would be moving 100 200 a day so really really 
,really good value from a traits perspective puts the 100 we're not that is UK come you might be more familiar and you might want to trade that because you understand the market a little bit better you feel that you have a bit of a Finity with some of the constituents if you're living in the UK and watching this or if you're living in other countries you might want to create the country that you're in of course that makes perfect sense but I think that could be a trap that you can fall into 
,if you're not careful you might think you know about Marks and Spencers or about JD sports whatever it may be and you think that you've got a bit more of a handle on it but ultimately you know if the market decides the chart decides the other participants decide so this is a good one to trade against the spreads are very very tight it's not as volatile in my experience that the backs and this will go from this discussion failures guys sometimes it will be volatile at a phase years ago remember if you were 20 years ago when the mining companies were in the foot seat and the miners are just going absolutely ballistic it was an amazing index to crate then and it comes down a bit it just goes and swings and roundabouts having this kind of go to ways you can go and say this and America is getting a little bit fruity at the moment if we traded down between the now is that text going crazy or texts crashing and they go to the Nasdaq and get involved in that get some shorts on that let me go to the DAX because the fax is very very sensitive at the moment to Euro or France I've got the elections that move to the cat or Italy have a big crisis coming out let me trace sure you can move to whichever one you want so important thing to remember when you're trading indices your trading basket of stocks generally trading the commercial environment of that currency a little bit different from your from of that country sorry a little bit different from your currencies because you're trading a little bit more of a real economic environment as opposed to a basket of stocks then the date if these 30 stocks in here we're doing absolutely brilliantly and perhaps they were doing a lot of international trade they would be a lot more insulated from the you know internal problems or the internal issues of the countries that they were not of international trade so symptom to bear in mind without going too in-depth and complicate about this unnecessarily in the day we do keep as simple as new points over analyzing stuff as we've talked about before so indices a great one to trade really good same with the currencies these to cut your teeth on them if you're new to trading these are a great place to start Beck's has been very very good to me over the years one of my favorite favorite favorite markets to trade just because it suits me we'll talk about suiting and how you pick a market a little bit later suit your personality the time you've got arm you're beginning your bankroll all those kind of things later but for now those are some of the big indices worth looking at good ones to trade you

Vm9eMbkRteo,hi I'm Lucy and in this video we're going to look at the laws of indices you should already know what indices are if you've forgotten what this video spats the laws 
,of indices make solving complex problems involving powers much easier and they are also essential for understanding a lot of algebraic processes so there are six laws that we need to know multiplying and dividing with indices raising a power to a power what a power of zero means and then fractional and negative indices we're going to look at the first four in this video and then the last you in part two I promise you they really are quite logical right so multiplying indices look at house deed are simplified what do you notice hopefully you can see that when we multiply indices we just add the powers together so 3 plus 4 is 7 because really it is 2/3 times x - 4 times giving us 7 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 is 6 looking at the final example see how we treat the numbers and the indices differently so we do 4 x 5 first and add the indices seconds a really important thing to know is that the base has to be the same so here because they had very space - we can add the 3 and the 4 but on this one we can't do anything because 1 is base 2 and 1 is base 3 where do you want to go next so what happens when we divide with indices have a look and see if you can work it out when we divide entities we subtract the powers but again the base must be the same say for this one we do the numbers pass and subtract the indices second this is because if I wrote the equation out Finley it would be the same as writing this just as you do any simplify fractions we can cancel down our numbers and our letters then we cancel the 20 and the 5 to become full and we start by countering out the Beame so to divide indices we divide the numbers and we subtract the powers wedge once go next you so what do you notice about these three ran powers are raised to a power we multiply the powers together on this one being little castle don't forget because the three is also inside the bracket it needs squaring too hence nine but then six multiplied by Q is twelve if we rate this out it would be three 
,d 6 multiplied by 3 D 6 and we know that when we multiply indices we add the powers this 3 multiplied by 3 is 9 and 6 plus 6 is 12 so just remember when we raise a power to a power we just multiply the two powers together why do you want to go next so what do you notice about the power of zero anything to the power of zero is one but why is this let's use our knowledge of fractions and also dividing indices to see why do you agree that anything divided by itself is one that a to the power of three goes into a to the power of three one that's our first equation and then using our indices knowledge when we divide we subtract the powers to 3 minus 3 is 0 
,and that our second equation we've done the same calculation in two different ways therefore the two answers must equal one another so combining these two things ending to the power of zero equals one so where do you want to go next you here are some questions for you to give a go yourself pause the video work out the answers and click play when you're ready to check did you get them right so here are the four laws that we've seen so far make sure you understand why they work and then you don't need to stress about learning them watch part two to discover how fractional and negative indices work

H-aaFaL93kw,okay today I'm going to teach about some basic law of in in dice or Jesus okay all right for this in dice actually few more very important the first law is called what is called a power of M multiple any power of n here equal to a and the power when the multiple here the power is plus M plus M okay so for example two power of seven multiples to power of e so you'll get 2 power of 7 plus e so we can get to power of 15 okay so when there's multiple in the power word you have 2 plus ok ok 70 when divided let's see a power M divided by a power of n you'll get a M minus n okay so when divided this one will be my god so let's say you see this car example like to power of 8 divided by 2 power of 3 so you will get 2 power of e minus 3 pixie the power you have to use - when this device okay so therefore you will get so you get 2 power of 2 power of 5 okay same thing happens to some other law okay for example I decide I put here first okay this is multiply and divide okay now we have a look on fraction means the power section let's say M power of let's say 3 or 2 okay what is the meaning by M power of 3 or 2 alright this one you have to remember on the top here the tree here means power the bottom the two here will be roof those who argue that square roof cute roof this is roof this power like square cube so 
,top will be power bottom of a roof when you see faction in the power you have to know how to define okay so this one actually we can write like this I say 3 is a power so M power of 3 and 2 is the roof so to me OB square root or you can write this bottom first me you write the square root of us here becomes square root of M okay power of 3 so power tree okay both also you will get the same value okay you can write the square root first or on the power first so I give one more example let's 
,say a 7 over 3 okay top will be power bottom of a roof so actually this one you can write to you can you can change to like I need to get change to a power of 7 and 
,then Q roof see the tree here will be Q of 70 or miss a power of 7 or you can write q Rufus a and then a holding power of seven and they said yeah okay so same things sometime in exam maybe you see discount question like square root 2x plus 1 so actually this one when you see square root 2x plus 1 actually this one you can change to 2x plus 1 power of 1 over 2 3 1 over 2 equal to square root same thing when you see Q root of 4x minus 7 so you can change to 4x minus 7 and then the whole thing will be power of 1 over 3 see because here power would be 1 nothing here means power is 1 so you see the Tripitaka me q roof if you never anything means square so 
,square is square root is equal to 1 over 2 q roof is so equal to 1 over 3 okay so unless okay maybe a silica example like you roof off for 4 X minus 7 and then square the whole thing okay so you got square your q roof remember - we write at the top got 2 is the power the TV right when the bottom bigotry is the roof therefore this 1 will equal to 4x minus 7 power of 2 over 3 okay this is a power okay okay and then what happened is when you see active in your power okay this I put here okay what happened if you see negative place let's say a negative seven okay remember here when you see negative negative means one over when you see negative directly you miss one over so a necklace that one will be this one over any power of seven okay if a negative three over two we see negative so when B is one for a power of three or two okay seventy if you give you 1/4 1/3 square when you see one over three squared will equal to one over means negative Krannert one over means negative so you see the power for 3 will be 2 so it's three power negative 2 1 over mid- so let's say you see 1 over 2x minus 1 square we will see 1 over means actually the power 
,here will add a negative so we say well no this is 2x minus 1 power of negative 2 because we see 1 over 1 over will be negative okay so let's say you s you see something like 3x plus 1 okay and then power negative 3 so you see negative means what negative of me empower a negative empower b14 okay so we write continued 3x plus 1 
,power of 3 ok this is the meeting for negative okay and then what happened is power multiple by power okay for example okay so I put here okay for example you'll get something like this okay a power M and then this power the power again is n so this 1 will equal to a power and multiple n means m and so for example you got 3 power of 3 and then the whole thing power again is 2 this 1 will equal to 3 multiple to not 3 power of 2 if you write 3 power of 9 then you are wrong this one is 3 power of 6 ok let's say you got like a power of 2 or 3 okay and the whole thing power of 3 so this 1 will equal to a 2 or 3 multiple tree in the power so you'll get 3 and choose simplify so we'll get a power of 2 ok this with you see the power you crank it and power again this actually the power you have to multiply ok means you have to multiply okay so for example for example let's say you see for power of two or three and then the whole thing power of nine so actually three and nine you can simplify here you get one here you get three so this 1 will equal to 2 multiplied three you get four power of six okay then you press calculator for power of six okay 
,when you press calculator you have to press for power you will see your CD symbol power is just beside the x squared for power of six so you will get two power of six you will get 4 0 96 okay this is the meaning for this one is for multiple okay I repeat when you see negative means one over okay so you do see 1 over 3 of 2 is equal to 3 power of negative 2 okay so this one is okay when you see fraction the top here means power the bottom here a mini roof okay and then for the most easy one 
,also is the most important one when multiple in the power will be plus when divided in the power rule will mean - okay if you can understand this one okay let's have a look some example ok let's have a look on this example okay okay you see is in exam you see this kind of question all right the first thing is you have to show you relate actually a on the number eight and number four are related to two because in order to get the power to power over me you have to get a value for x you have 
,to make sure both of them have the same base then only you can solve their power okay this is actually a here I know a actually is two power of three four actually is two power of two okay so let's try to solve this one here okay let's say this one it is 2 power of 3 so I just write 2 power of 3 ok prank it and then 2x minus 3 okay you later when I put blanket later the tree can multiple for both okay I say when you see prank it be the power have to multiple okay here is a classic classics 
,one okay when you see one over this one window will be negative okay and you see square root mu means power 1 over 2 okay I do step by step so these are equal to 1 over 4 X 4 8 power X plus 2 and then the holding power of 1 over 2 because square root in the power is called 1 over 2 okay to the roof 1 1 means power so square root remember you can change to power of 1 over 2 later the one or two I can multiple 4 X + 2 we have both of their power okay okay at the same time - 1 / - you have to 
,multiple with the number 4 so it means this is to power of two x zero to this actually you will get you get to Oh Sola okay so therefore okay I multiply this one I get to power of 6x okay three my multiple negative three negative nine to equal to okay this one I change to two power of two power of two okay so here equal to 2 power of 2x plus 4 because this one is changed to two power of two he has to multiple for both knew the power of two and two multiple X and 2 so I get 2x plus 4 and holding power with negative 1 over 2 you see the negative here because of the one over okay then we can show you where multiple negative and do it okay then we will get to 6x minus 9 is still the same okay this one when multiple 2x multiple negative one over two will give us negative x plus 2 and 2 is simplify already and negative 
,one multiple X is negative x for multiple negative one or two after simplify we'll get minus 2 okay this is what I say just now when the bit you have the same base then only you can soft software power so now the both both of this equation both in this equation the base is 2 so now we can ignore the base we straight away go to the power bill actually 6x minus 9 will give you negative X minus 2 okay this is the power so we just solve this equation we can get the value for x so negative x both here we will get positive x so 6x plus X you'll get a negative 9 move there you'll get positive 9 so minus negative 2 plus 9 so you'll get 7 X will equal to negative 2 plus 9 will get 7 so X is equal to okay this one is seven multiple X or booster is called 7 divided by 7 so this one will move to button device ever so X after 
,simplify X will equal to 1 okay I take it discussion only one part very difficult is the one over because most of the student they cannot change 1 over 2 negative 1 
,over just mean negative and then you have to know that the square root actually means power of 1 over 2 okay okay after this discussion when let's have a look some simple questions okay okay exam maybe as you solve the equation okay so you have to very sensitive with a 16 and E okay 16 and 8 all of this dumbull I know mr. to power of something I can get 60 16 and to power something I can get it obviously 16 values 2 power 4 it is 2 power of 3 okay so straight away I change that base become 
,the same because believe and the base becomes the same I can solve their power okay so here I change to 2 power of 4 okay and then I put a pen cap and the outside deal write 2x minus 3 and a is 2 power of 3 for the pen cap for X because the percolator I have to multiple okay now a multiple okay so this will be equal to power of 
,for multiple 2x we get X for multiple negative 3 we get negative 12 okay and then 2 and 2 power of 3 and 3 have to multiple for X we will get 2 power of 12x okay now they have the same base orally both is too easy so we ignore the base we soft software power so therefore X minus 12 we'll give us 12x okay therefore okay I moved on 12 X 2 this side positive tail as we move here will become minus 2x and negative tails moved there will become positive 12 okay then X minus 12x will get negative 
,4x equal to 12 okay and then X will equal to the negative 4 multiple X so move here negative 4 here is multiple move to this side we become divided so equal to 12 divided by negative 4 okay here you have to very careful because some all students where negative 4 move to this side the routine negative 4 will become positive 4 no 
,because this is negative 4 multiple X so move to this side will become divide negative 4 the negative is still here okay so therefore 12 divided by negative 4 you will get X will equal to negative 3 okay this one calls it a very simple okay then we'll come and have a look some hard fashions okay for this one first before we do the base is to the base is to but then this one base is one we actually dis one base is one sometimes very hard for us to solve okay so how do solve this question is 
,you have to change to this one become 2 power of zero because everything power of zero will get you one so the first step actually I I change and before I change I also have to know activity 2x plus 4 I can I can change to 2 X 2 power X multiple 2 power 4 because multiple of these plus in the power ok so I just do step ok 2 power X multiple to power of 4 ok still remember when this one is X multiple follow becomes X plus 4 so actually so we can change the like this minus 2x plus 3 equal to 
,multiple to power of 3 ok and then equal to ok rewrite 1 1 here not a matter ok and then ok your some students will feel very difficult when you see 2x multiple this one how are we going to solve this also I'm very simple I let I let to power of X equal to M okay because like this will be easy for some students to digest okay so here will become M so M multiple to power 4 to power 4 is called 16 multiple 60 - ok to power X will become F M multiple to power 3 will get it will give us 1 so this one actually is called 16 M okay so 16 M minus 8 M will give of one there for sexting m- am will left at am here we go to one so actually m will equal to 108 here 8 multiple m so move there become divided a okay so okay after we get this one we changed by m equal to 2 power of 8 2 power of x okay so 108 here 108 here actually with a change to 1 over 2 power of 3 still remember okay it you can change to 2 power of 3 so when you see 1 over 2 power of three will equal to 2 power of negative 3 when you see one will always be negative so therefore you will get next to it ok like this you will get you both also is the base 2 here so we can ignore a base so X will equal to negative 3 ok hope you can learn something in this video this is invite for additional mathematics thank you

B4zejSI8zho,"Hi!  Welcome to Math Antics. In our last video called “Intro to Exponents”, we learned that exponents (also called Indices) are a special type of math operation. In "
,"this video, we’re going to expand on what we know about exponents by learning about their inverse operations, which are called “roots”. That’s kind of a strange name for a math operation, but it will make more sense in just a minute. First, let’s review what we mean by inverse operations. In the video called “What Is Arithmetic”, we learned that inverse operations are pairs of math operations that UNDO each other. For example, you can undo addition by doing subtraction, so addition and subtraction are inverse operations. Likewise, you can undo multiplication by doing division, so multiplication and division are inverse operations. As I mentioned, exponents have inverse operations also. There are operations that can undo them, and those operations are called roots. To see how roots and exponents work together to undo each other, let’s look at the simple exponent 4 to the 2nd power (or four squared). Previously, we learned that this is the same as 4 × 4 which equals 16. Doing this exponent meant going from 4 squared to 16. So now if we want to undo that with a root operation, that involves starting out with 16 and then somehow getting back to the 4 which is being raised to the 2nd power. And do you remember what that part of the original exponent is called? Yep, it’s called the “base”. So doing a root operation is going to give us the base as our answer, and that helps us understand its name a little better. The words “base” and “root” have a similar meaning, especially if you think of a tree. The root is at the base of a tree, and that can help you remember how root operations work. With a root operations, you start with the answer of an exponents and try to figure out what the base of that original exponent is. Okay, but how do we actually do that? How do we use a root operation to go backwards and figure out the base of the original exponent? Well for starters, we need to know about a special math symbol that looks like this. And you guessed it… it’s called the root sign. Whoa Dude! That math symbol looks totally radical dude! It’s… it’s like that division thingy, only way cooler!! Ah yes, that reminds me… "
,"the root sign is often referred to as the “radical” sign (and mathematicians used that term even before surfers did) And yes, it does look similar to the division sign so it’s really important not to get them confused. The root (or radical) sign is different from the division sign because, instead of having a curved front, its front shape is like a check mark. The number that you want to take the root of goes under the sign like this. So when you see a number under a root (or radical) sign "
,"like this, you know you need to figure out the base of the original exponent. In this case, you need to figure out what number you could multiply together a certain "
,number of times to get 16. Ah - but there’s the catch!  How many times? The answer we get from taking the root will depend on how many times that number would be multiplied together. But that would depend on the original exponent.  So how do we know what that number is? Simple… the root symbol tells us. The root symbol actually 
,"includes the original exponent in it. What?  You don’t see it? Oh… That’s because I didn’t draw it yet.  And later in this video, you’ll understand why. So let’s put a little 2 right here above the check mark part of the root symbol. And that 2 tells us that we need to figure out what number (or base) could be multiplied together 2 times in order to get 16. And, if you remember your multiplication table (or if you just look at our original example here) you’ll know that the answer to that is 4. Now do you see how the root operation is the inverse of the exponent operation? When doing the exponent, we asked, “What do we get if we multiply 4 together 2 times?”, and the answer was 16. But when we did the root operation, we asked, “What number could we multiply together 2 times to get 16?” and the answer was 4. Great!  Now that you understand how exponents and roots are related, we’re going to look closer at how root operations work. To do that, we’re gonna change our root problem slightly.  Let’s change the little 2 into a little 4. The first root was asking us to figure out what number we could multiply together 2 times to get 16. But this new root is asking us to figure out what number we could multiply together 4 times to get 16. That’s a bit trickier, huh?  Can you think of a number like that? Yep, the answer is 2, because if you multiplied four ‘2’s together (2 × 2 × 2 × 2) you get 16. So the 2nd root of 16 is 4, but the 4th root of 16 is 2. Both those roots "
,"were pretty easy to figure out, right? But unfortunately, figuring out roots in math can be much harder. For example, what if we had this problem instead, “root 3 of 16” That means we need to figure out what number we could multiply together 3 times to get 16. Can you think of a number like that? [No]  I can’t either! And unfortunately, it’s not easy to calculate what that number would be. Remember, even hough this look a little but like the division symbol, this is NOT just division! You can’t just divide 16 by 3 to get the answer.  Roots are NOT the same as long division. So how DO we calculate a root like this? Well, there are special algorithms that you can use to calculate just about any root, but they’re kinda complicated, so we’ll save those for a future video. Instead, I’m gonna use a special root function on my calculator to get the answer. And on my calculator the button for that root function looks like this. To use it, I first enter the number that I want to take "
,"the root of, which is 16. Next, I hit the root function button, and then I enter 3 so it knows that I want the 3rd root of 16. Last, I hit the equals sign and voila… the answer is 2.519842… and the decimal digits just keep on going forever. Wow!  See what I mean about roots being hard to figure out? That is a really complicated "
,"decimal number and you may even wonder if it’s the right answer.  Well, let’s check… Based on what we know about exponents and roots, if we multiply this decimal number together 3 times, we should get 16, right? But to make it easier to check, let’s just round the number off to 2 decimal places. Let’s make it 2.52. If we multiply 2.52 together 3 times, (in other words if we take 2.52 to the 3rd power) we’ll get: 16.003. Well… that’s almost right.  It’s really close to 16, isn’t it? The reason it’s not exactly 16 is that we rounded the number off which made it less accurate. But the more decimal digits we use, the closer we’ll get to 16. In math, the vast majority of roots are complicated number like this. And they’re hard to figure out unless you use a calculator or a special algorithm. That’s the bad news. But the good news is that most of the time, the roots you’ll be asked to do in your homework or on tests are the easy ones; ...the ones that have nice whole number answers. And usually, you’ll only be asked to find 2nd or 3rd roots of numbers. Do you remember in the last video, we learned that 2 and 3 are the most common exponents. …so common in fact, that they even had special names. Raising a number to the 2nd power was called “squaring” it, and raising a number to the 3rd power was called “cubing” it. Well, it’s the same with roots.  Since the roots 2 and 3 are the most common, they get special names also. The 2nd root is called the “square root” and the "
,"3rd root is called the “cube root”. In fact, the “square root” is SO common that it’s basically the default root and its symbol even gets special treatment. Do you remember that when I first showed you the root symbol, I left out the index number that tells you what root to find? Well, whenever that number is left out, you can just assume that it’s 2. In other words, the root symbol, with no index number, is always the square root. So if you want someone to find a different root (like cubed or 4th or 5th) then you need to include that number so they know which root to find. And even though square roots are the most common, they’re not always easy to find. Most are still going to be big long decimal numbers, except for the “perfect squares”. It’s easier to find the square roots of the perfect squares because their "
,"answers can be found using the multiplication table. On the multiplication table, have you ever noticed that all the answers to problems where the same number is being multiplied together are on the diagonal of the table. In other words, 2x2=4, 3 × 3 = 9, 4 × 4 = 16, 5 × 5 = 25, 6 × 6 = 36, and so on. Well, those numbers are called the perfect squares because they’re the answers you get when you square a whole number. And that means if you take the square root of a number along that diagonal, you get a nice whole number as your answer. The square root of 4 is 2. The square root of 9 is 3. The square root of 16 is 4. The square root of 25 is 5, and so on. See what I mean? Those roots are really common and they’re also easy to figure out if you know your multiplication facts. So if you’re new to exponents and roots, learning the perfect squares is the place to start. Once you understand how those exponents and roots work, you’ll be ready to figure our tougher problems. Alright… so now you know how exponents are related to roots.  They’re inverse operations and they undo one another. And you also know that, just like 2 and 3 are the most common exponents, the square root and the cube root are the most common roots. You also know that finding roots is usually not very easy. That’s important to know so you don’t get discouraged if you feel like it’s hard to figure out what a certain root is. You’re not alone!  We think it’s hard too and would normally just use a calculator to find them. The good news is that some roots are easy to find, like the perfect squares, so be sure to focus on learning them first. And remember, to get good at math you need to actually practice what you learn from watching videos, so be sure to do some exercise problem.

ULWn1dOySYk,welcome to my channel of mass videos my name is Karen daily and I'm a mathematics lecture at DK ITA third level college in Ireland this suite of videos was produced 
,to help students were beginning their third level career brush up on their basic mathematical skills this video is on indices our powers enjoy the words index power 
,and exponent are three words used in mathematics to describe the same thing what is this in mathematics if we write two and have a little for positioned up here to the top right hand corner of the two and in English we call this 2 to the power of to the power of 4 so I've identified that this number up here the four is what's called a power and another name for it is index our exponent this number here is called the base base so what does 2 to the power of 4 mean well in simple terms it just means to the base number multiplied by itself four times so 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 so here's the four it's 2 multiplied by itself four times now you can work out the value 
,of that 2 x 2 is four x 2 is h x 2 is 16 so 2 to the power 4 has the value 16 one thing to note is that the plural of the word index is indices so we talk about one 
,index or two or more indices let's look at a few more powers let's say we have 3 to the power of 2 now we have especially of saying this in mathematics and we can say this as 3 squared so 3 to the power of 2 and 3 squared are the same thing armed with our knowledge of what that is it's 3 multiplied by itself twice so 3 by 3 and 
,it just has the value 9 let's look at a 4 to the power of three well 4 to the power of three again we can write it in Satan English in a special way is 4 cubed knowing what that is it's 4 x 4 3 times so 4 x 4 is 16 x 4 as the value 64 let's look at a value let's say 5 to the power of one now normally when we have a power of 1 we don't normally write it down because 5 the power of one is just the value 5 what if we had let's say a number to the power of 0 so let's say we had 6 to the power of 0 how would you work that out or what value does this have but by definition any number doesn't matter which to the power of 0 has a value 1 so this is a kind of a special case any number to the power of 0 is equal to 1 so let me write that down for you so any number to the power of 0 is equal to 1 we can write this as x to stand for any number to the power of 0 is equal to the value 1 in mathematics we sometimes use letters and instead of writing down the particular number so if X is a number number then X to the power of 3 or X cubed is x x divided by x x x that's a little bit confused with these multiplication signs along with the exes so normally they're not written in and normally you'll see it just written as X sometimes people put in a dodge by X by X or normally is just X X X and it's understood that the three X values are multiplied by each other so in general we say that X to the power of n is equal to x x x x x all the way over x x and here this is done n times all right so it's multiplied by itself n times let me attempt here to clear up a few confusions let's say I have a negative 3 and I want to square it or raise it to the power of 2 now knowing what I know that's just minus three x minus 3 now remember if i multiply minus and minus i get a plus three threes are nine so what's a positive 9 is the answer now if I was asked to work out minus 3 to the power of to note the difference between the two of these this is just a minus and the tree is just the thing that is squared so it's minus x 3 x 3 9 23 this is 3 squared okay three 3s or nine so the answer to this is going to be minus nine in mathematics if I write down to X right what I mean by that is that too is multiplied multiplied by the number X now I don't know what the value for x is so I can't do the multiplication but X is a number which I don't know and 2 is x ish now if I was asked to work out to X to the power of three right so it's 2x all to be cubed that would be 2x x 2x x 2 x okay here i have three twos that are multiplied by each other so 2 x 2 x 2 is the value h by 2 2 so 4 by 2 or 8 and I have three X's multiplied by each other and in our language that's X cubed now if I was to look at 2x and the cubed was just here right what that means is that too is x x by x by x okay so note the difference between these two things now let's look at a negative index power or exponent so let's say i had 2 to the power of and negative 2 okay what that is in mathematics is just 1/2 to the power of the positive 2 all right now remember 2 to the power of two is two x itself twice so it's two by two so that's equal to 1 over 4 that's as a fraction and as a decimal 1 over 4 is not point 25 let's look at another one and let's say 10 to the power of minus 1 well 10 to the power of minus 1 is just 
,1 divided by 10 to the power of 1 and 10 to power of one is just 10 and 1/10 is not point one let's just look at one more 5 to the power of minus 35 the power of minus 3 is 1 over 5 to the power of 3 and 5 the power of 3 is 1 over 5 by 5 5 and 1 over 5 5 to 25 x 5 is a hundred and twenty-five and that's as a fraction and as a decimal and you can work it out in the calculator 1/125 is not point 0 0 8 another way of writing r 1 / 125 if it ratchet as one and you can put a Division sign and then 125 and as I said the answer is no point 0 0 8 likewise is if X is any particular number which we don't know the value of x the power of let's say minus 4 and can also be written as 1 over X to the power of the positive 4 so in general any number x to the power of a negative n value is equal to one divided by X the power of n let me just push a box around that and to highlight that X the power of minus n is equal to one divided by X the power of n if you can understanding what I have been doing up to now the laws of indices will follow very easily and the first law I'm going to going to look at is X the power of a multiplied by X the power of B is actually equal to X to the power of a plus B now X is just a number a is a number and B is a number right so the simplest way to see this law in action is this takes 
,two simple values for a let's take a as being 3 and let's take be as being too okay now if you have X the power of three and you multiply it by X the power of two knowing what I know about my powers x the power of three is x by x by x x to the power of 2 is x by x and if i was to count them i end up with one two three four five 
,so i end up having X the power of five and as you can see 5 is equal to a 3 plus the two value note that to apply the law and the base values here and here have to be the same so let's do a few examples and the question says simplify using the laws of indices now we only have the one law at this stage but let's do one and so the first one is let's say 2 to the power 4 x to the power of 7 okay now using the law above here it says that X the power of a my x value is 2 a is for and my x value 
,here is too and my B value is seven that's simplified I just add the two powers so the two values are going to add our four and seven so what I get is that it's equal to 2 to the power of 4 plus 7 and 4 plus 7 is 2 to the power of 11 hey let's try another one at two now I can have more than one value here here and had one value 
,the two as a base value let's say i had to X at the power of three and I had it x 2x the power of 4 okay now i can only use the law up here if the base value is the 
,same alright so i have a base value here of two and i have a base value here of two and the power on the two here is not written down but it's understood to be a one and the power on the heat to hear is not written down but it's understood to be a one also so if i simplify and the powers of 2 1st using the law of into say it's 2 to the power of 1 plus 1 then if i go ahead and simplify the powers of X here i have x to the power of three here rmx the power 4 so I just add the powers so I'm going to get at three plus four so doing that 101 is too so it's 2 squared and X the power of 3 plus 4 is X to the power of 7 now I can work that out if I want to and 
,just write it down as 4x the power of 7 now let's do just one more and so let's say I had a 3 squared x x the power 4 x y to the power 5 x 32 the pot 3 XY ok now again remember that you can only simplify those that have the same base using this law so I've got a 3 squared here and I've got a tree to the power of one here so if i simplify that first I'll get that it's 3 to the power of 2 plus 1 okay then if I continue on and look at the ex's ex is the power 4 and this X here is to the power 
,of one again so here i've got x is the power of 4 plus 1 and likewise with why is this why here is the par-5 this one here is the power of one so if I was to simplify that and it's going to be y to the power of 5 plus 1 now I can do no more I can add obviously and my values together and write down the answer and the answer is going to be 3 to the power of 3 x x the power of 5 x y to the power of 6 all right and I can't bring any of these values together because I don't know the value for x 
,I don't know the value for y I could work out 3 to the power of 3 330 9 + x 3 is 27 if I wanted to but that's as far as i could go so it's 27 x the power of 5 y to the power of 6 because the powers here are all whole numbers and you could just bypass the law of indices and write the whole thing out as individual power what I mean is is this and you could redo this question okay in this way and just rewrite it at three squared is 3 x 3 x the power 4 is x by x by x by x 4 x's why the power 5 
,is y x y 5 times there's five of them then we've got 3 x and y so if you count all the trees you've got one two three threes so it's just three to the power of three if you count all the exes one two three four five so it's just x to the power of five and and if you count all the wise one two three four five and this one here is six you just end up with y to power of six so again you get exactly the same answer 27 x to power 5 y to the power of 6 obviously if these numbers were only fractional part it were only decimals or fractions and you wouldn't be able to do it like this let's look at the next law i'm going to write down and it's going to be that 
,x the power of a divided by x to the power of b is equal to x the power of a minus B now again a and B are just numbers and X is just a number as well but if you wanted to check out how this works you can just write it out as let's say if X is the power of three and you want to divide it by X the power of two if I didn't know the law all I'd have to do is go x by x by x divided by x by x and there's an X above and below the line and if something is above and below the line they just cancel 
,each other out so these two cancel each other out and you just love George X or what's understood is X the power of one nice so this one here was gotten by taking three right and subtracting 2 from us okay so let's try a few examples are using this law ok here it says simplify using the laws of says so let's look at the first one so let's do the first one so let's say you had 2 to the power of 9 / to the power of 6 ok so the larger says that that's equal to 2 to the power of 9-6 and 9-6 is 
,to the power of three ok the value can be positive or negative and you can have 2 to the power of let's say 6 divided by 2 to the power of 9 and I will turn out to be to the power of 6-9 so it would equal to the power of minus 3 or if you want to write it as 1 over 2 to the power of three they're the same thing ok and likewise just like before we can have multiple values so let me move down a little bit and look at one that has multiple values so something like if I had to the power of 2 times X cubed Y squared divided by 2 XY that's a okay now again remember that you can only simplify when the base is the same ok so the base is the same for three sets of values in here and so I'm going to have the answer is going to be and so when i simplify the two it's to the power remember 2-1 remember it's understood that there's a power of 1 on that to there ok and then the x value is going to be 3 minus 1 again and then lastly the Y value is 2-1 so if I work them out to minus 1 is 2x the power of 2 wife the power of two minus 1 is just 1 ok so let's look at another law and this law says that if you have X to the power of a all to the power of B and that's equal to X the power of a x be okay again you can check this out and if you had a and B are just numbers if you had to the power of three all to the power of two right remember what you know about powers it's to the power of 3 x 2 to the power of three that's the squared part all right and to the power of three is two by two by two and it's x 2 x 2 x 2 right so if you count all the threes I'm sorry you get one two three four five six so you end up with two to the power of 6 and this 6 is gosh by multiplying a three by two so again just let's try a couple of these simplify using those of indices let's try one and let's say you had X the power of three all to the power of four right well then that would be X to the power of 3 x 4 so it would be X to the power of 12 okay as I said to you before the numbers don't have to be a whole numbers and it can be positive or negative as well so if I had X the power of let's say 5 x minus 6 and that would be X the power of 5 x minus 6 and 5 x minus 6 is X the power of minus 30 I remember X the power of minus 30 is the same as 1 over X the power of the positive 30 you do just one more and number three and they don't have to be whole numbers if I had two to the power of a let's say not point to and all to the power of let's say to that would be to the power of North Point 2 x 2 so it's equal 2 to the power of not point for okay let's look at another log in to say it says that if you have X Y are any number of variables it can be more than two and you have it all to the power of a that's equal to X the power of a y to the power of a now we looked at that area around and in a simple example if you had let's say a 2x right x is is 2y is is the x value and you had at the power of two remember i we we saw that that was 2x x two x so it turned out 
,to be 2 to the power of 2 and X the power of 2 so the power of 2 is on both the two and the X ok so let's try a few examples with this law simplify using gods of indices let's try the first one so let's say I had a 4 x y all to the power of 5 so all it says is you put the power of 5 on everything inside the bracket so it's forced to power 5 y to the power of 5 let's try another one if I had you can have as many values in here as you like to X Y all to the power of 2 well the power goes on everything in there so it's to the power of 2x the power of 2 and y to the power of two in the last saw that I want to draw your attention to is this if you have and 
,the nth root right now this may be a bit more technical the nth root of x write that as a power is written as 1 to the power of 1 divided by n go to something that hopefully you have seen before and it's called as square root right the square root is just wrote written like this right but it's understood understood is that there is actually a little too in here but it's not written down now what is the square root let's have a look where that comes from if you have x squared right some number when squared and you're told that that is equal to 4 you could hopefully solve that in your head remember 2 squared u square to you get four also don't forget that if you square minus two you get four also what we write as an answer is that x is equal to whether it can be plus or minus the 2 value right so if you square positive to you get for if you square negative 2 you get for and also what we write down is sometimes you've seen its equal to positive or negative times the square root 
,of 4 and the square root of four if you do it on your calculator is positive or negative times the value to so square root reverses the square function right if I go back to that equation again x squared is equal to 4 right to get rid of that squared and just be left with a power of 1 as I need here on this answer right what I could do is I could raise both sides of this equation to the power of a half right so here will be 4 to the power of a half if I do to one side I have to do the other because knowing your last law a number to a power multiplied out all to a power you multiply these two powers so X the power of 1 is equal to the positive or negative 4 to the power of a half right so here for to the power of a half and square root of four are the same thing same thing ok so there swear by law comes from hopefully that's not too complicated so again if I just try a few questions with this law simplify using laws of indices so let's say the square root of x now remember i said to you and the square root of x it's understood that there's a little too in that the square sends for 2 of X so if i simplify it using my Lords of indices its X to the power of 1 over 2 ok if I go ahead and look at let's say the fourth root of two right that would be add 2 to the power of 1 over 40 let me finish off by just going through all the rules again and trying this question question says find the value of P in the following all right if we look at the first one it's 3 to the power of 2 x 3 to the power 5 and you want the p value well the law says a number to a power multiplied by a number of power what to do is you add the powers so p is going to be at 2 plus 5 so it's equal to 7 for the next one it's a number to a power all to a power right and when you have that and the p value is going to turn out 
,to be 7 x 4 so this value is going to be equal to 28 for the next one is five to a power / 5 to a power and the law says that you take the top value and you subtract the bottom value and you subtract the bottom value you get a minus 2 for the next one this is a square root it's understood but not written that there's a little too in here so the power on the P here is that p is equal to 1/2 or a half or point 5 this is a 6 here and it's the sixth root of two so p is equal to 1 / 6 and then the last one is 1 over 10 to the power of minus five again if you bring it above the line of division you change the sign on the power so the p-value is going to be a positive 5 so let me finish by doing these last three questions it says simplify using laws of indices these three and expressions okay so let's try the first one so the first one and is all to the power of 2 to begin with so remember the power of 2 goes on everything inside the bracket so it's 2 to the power of 2 it's x squared to the power of 2 and it's y to the power of 2 a number to a power to a power you multiply the powers so the end answer when you can work out 2 squared if you want 2 squared is just for and then it's X the powerful and y to the power of two so that would be the simplified version of this expression here if I move on to the next one right and there's a three above the liner three below the line and I could go using my laws of indices is 3 to the power of 1 minus 1 or you could just say well that cancels with that because the one is above the line is a division 3 / 3 goes into a 3 3 divides by 3 equals 1 for the exes it's X to the power of 3 subtract two and for the wise it's white the power of and two there's no y below the line so 3 minus 2m is 1 1-1 this is a zero and any number to the power of 0 is equal to 1 
,so this whole thing just reads as X the power of so that this is just a multiplication by one will have no effect on the things you don't write it down so X the power of three minus two is one and why is the power of two you don't normally write that so you would write it as X Y squared so again this is a simplified version of this here just doing the last one and again 4 divides into ace you can just do that as simple arithmetic 4 divides into H twice okay so you can just write that down as a 2 and if you want to this is here f the power of to subtract one so it's going to be 2 times f & 2 minus 1 is 1 you normally don't write the 1 and it's understood so you just write it as 2 F so that's the simplified version of sorry that one up here okay

RZ640Q1o_eI,we shall add its applications in this module you will learn about ratio equivalent ratios and some applications of ratio mom I'm thirsty please make a glass of orange drink for me okay fini wait mom I want to see how to make it so that I'll be able to make it for my friends when they come in the evening maaan how didn't know what to add and how much it is written on the bottle to make a glass of drink take one cup of orange squash pour it into a glass add three cups of water to it and then 
,mix them well your drink will be ready to serve mummy please make one drink for me too now how will you add the squash and water to make the drinks for both of us see to make it for one person we have to take one cup of squash and three cups of water for two persons we have to double the quantities of both the squash and water that means we need to take two cups of squash and six cups of water think if I have to make it for three then we have to take three cups of squash and nine cups of water here the quantity of water we have added is 3 times the quantity of squash how did you find it out if we divide the number of cups of water by the number of cups of squash we get three each time mummy it is denoting three times one correct you know here you are comparing using ratios what is a ratio the comparison of two quantities in terms of how many times is called the ratio here the ratio of squash to water is 1 is to 3 and it is read as 1 is to 3 using ratio it is easy to calculate how the ratio of squash to water for one person is one is to three if we have to make it for two persons then multiply the ratio by two then it becomes 2 is 2 6 4 3 persons multiply 8 by 3 that is 3 is 2 9 can you find how much squash and water is to be added for 10 persons for 10 persons I have to take 10 cups of squash and 30 cups of water and I come to know by multiplying the ratio by 10 here for all the ratios we have found we have added water three times of squash that means the ratio is constant here such ratios which are obtained by multiplying or dividing by any counting number are equivalent ratios when s 2/3 is its lowest form as it can be further divided correct now you get it we have used this quotient water in the ratio of 1 is to 3 for this can you write the ratio of water to one class of drink mate I think it is 3 is 2 1 no Vinay we can't calculate ratio in different units here the unit for water is 3 cups then we have to use the same unit for the drink also 1 glass of drink contains 1 cup of squash and 3 cups of water that is four cups are poured into one class to make one drink yes that is why the ratio of quantity of water to drinkers 3 is to 4 and for quantity of squash to drink it becomes 1 is to 4 so while writing ratios first we have to convert different quantities in the same unit let's recap ratio the comparison of quantities in terms of how many times a quantity is of another quantity is called a ratio equivalent ratio ratios which are obtained by multiplying or dividing by any counting number are equivalent ratios a ratio is a comparison between quantities in same measures or units

25gGVMaynPk,hello children today i am here to teach you chapter 24 in your textbook that's indices so in this lesson we are recognizing what are index notations and power of another number and expand a power and write its value so this is an important lesson so you need to do this in grade 7 8 9 10 till you do all levels then after that this is important in a level as well look at this number 8 write 8 as a product of prime factors so how you find out the prime factors you can divide take 8 you can divide this by 2. you get 4 divide this by 2 again you get 2 divide this by 2 again you get 1 so you can write 8 as 2 into 2 into 2 2 three times so we can write instead of writing two times two times two we can write this as two to the power of three so when you take this number 2 to the power of 3 we call this 2 as the base and the power this we say that's the index sometimes we call exponents or power so you can read this number as 2 to the power of 3 2 to the power of 3 25 what are the prime factors of 25 take 25 you can divide by 5 that's 5 5 times 525 divide by 5 again you get 1 so 25 you can write 5 times 5 5 2 times 5 to the power 2. so this is 5 
,to the power of 2 and you can say 5 squared so when the power is 2 you can say squared now write this one 7 to the power of 2 7 to the power of 2 or 7 squared same thing 11 to the power of 2 or 11 squared take eight eight we can write two and two and two we did that before two times two times two or you can write 2 to the power 
,3. so 2 to the power 3 is there another name first you can say 2 to the power of 3 or 3 cube so 3 means q so power 3 you can say q 2 cube so cube we can use for the 
,power 3. now write down 5 to the power of 3 5 to the power of 3 cube of 5 simple cube of 5 7 to the power of 3 cube of 7 10 to the power of 3 and cube of 10. so power 2 is squared and power 3 is cube right how you read these numbers this one already done 9 to the power 3 9 to the power of 3 cube of 9. so likewise you can write 13 to the power of 13 to the power of 2 how can you write there 13 square square of 13 you can write square of 30 13 squared here 6 to the power of 3 i'll write all this 4 to the power of 4 to the power of 2 write the number 8 to the power of 3 twenty to the power of two fifteen to the power of three then you can write power 3 as cube of 6. this one 4 squared square of 4 this one 8 to the power three you can write eight cubed cube of eight twenty squared square of twenty and 15 to the power 
,of 3 that means cube of 15. fill in the blanks so you need to identify what's the base and index so 11 to the power of 7 base is 11 power is 7 that's index 9 to the 
,power of 4 base is 9 and index is 4. now try to do this 3 to the power 11 3 is the base and 11 is the index 5 to the power of 8 5 is the base and 8 is the index 10 to the power 5 10 is the base and 5 is the index 6 to the power 3 base is 6 power or index is 3. write these in index notation so that means you have to write in base and index form three how many threes are there one two three four five so you can write three to the power of five how many sevens are there one two three four seven to the power of how many eights are there one two three four five eight to the power of five how many elevens are there three eleven to the power of three how many tens one two three four five 10 to the power of 5. this one how many fives one two three four five six how many minus threes so make sure that you put brackets one 
,two three four three how many minus elevens are there two power two how many ones are there one two three 4 5 but here 1 to the power any number is 1 23 23 3 times 23 to the power of 3. expand and write as a product 7 to the power 3 7 3 times three to the power six three six times eight to the power four 8 4 times 9 to the power 5 9 5 times 10 to the power two ten two times minus five to the power four minus five four times minus 11 to the power 3 minus 11 three times write as a power of a 
,number so first one write 32 as a power of 2 so what you can do you can divide and see you can divide by 2 you get 16. you can divide this by 2 again 8 divide by 2 get 4 divide by 2 again 2 and divide by 2 again you get 1 till you get 1 you divide so how many twos are there one two three four five five twos are there so you can 
,write this one as two to the power of 5. so 32 as a power of 2 that's 2 to the power of 5. right 125 as a power of 5 then we divide by 5 and say 5 times 2 10 and for 25 that's 5. divide by 5 again you get 5. divide by 5 again you get 1. so 5 3 times you can write as 5 to the power of 3. look at this one right 121 as a power of 11. so take 121 and divide by 11 11 times 11 and 1. you get 11 twice so you can write this one as 11 squared write 81 as a power of 3 so divide by 3 3 times 2 6 and for 21 that's 27 divide by 3 again 9 divide by 3 again 3 divided by 3 again that's 1. so you can write 81 3 4 times that means 3 to the power of four write 36 as a power of six divide by six six times six thirty six six times one six twice that means you can write this is 6 squared write 343 as a power of 7 divide by 7 7 times 4 
,28 28 and you get 63 63 means nine seven times seven and seven times one seven three times that means 7 to the power of 3 and write 64 as a power of divided by eight eight times eight sixty-four eight times one eight into eight or you can write eight squared write 243 as a power of 3 divided by 3 3 times 8 24 and 1 3 times 27 3 
,times again 9 divide by 3 again 3 and divide by 3 again 1. so how many 3's are there 5 1 2 3 4 5 3 to the power of 5 right 64 as a power of 4 divide by 4 4 times 1 4 24 that's 6 4 times 4 16 and then again one four three times four times four times four four to the power of three right 625 as a power of five divided by 5 5 times 1 5 for 12 that's 2 for 25 that's 5. divide by 5 again 2 and 5. divide by 5 again 5 divided by 5 again that's 1. so you get only 5 4 times 5 into 5 into 5 into 5. so 5 to the power of 4. write 729 as a power of 9 divide by 9 9 times eight one nine times nine again divide by nine you get one so nine three times nine to the power of three write these in index notation how many twos are there three how many threes you get two here how many threes two how many fives one two three how many 3 is here 1 2 3 how many 7s 2 how many 11's that's two and how many thirteens that's two here how many twos two and how many fives that's three here again eighths and ninths eights twice and nines one two three how many fives are there three and how many elevens that's two how many fours one two three how many sevens one two three how many elevens here three how many thirteens one two three how many sixes here three and how many sevens 1 2 3 write the following numbers as a product of 2 3 5 so 
,you have to divide either by 2 3 or 5. so take 12 you can divide by 2 first that's 6. again you can divide by 2 that's 3. now you have to divide by 3 and you get 1. 
,so you can write 12 as 2 times 2 times 3 so 2 to the power of 2 and 1 3. 20 you can divide by 2 first you get 10. divide by 2 again you get 5. now you can divide by 
,5. you get 1 there 2 times 2 times 5 2 to the power of 2 and 5 54 divide by 2 2 times 2 4 for 14 that's 7. divide by 3 now get 9 divide by 3 again that's 3 divided by 3 again you get 1. so it's 1 2 and 3 3 times so you can write 2 into 3 to the power of 3 or 3 cube 50 you can divide by 2 25 now you can divide by 5 5 times 1. so 
,50 you can write 2 times 5 into 5 or you can simplify and write 5 squared now look at this one 18 divide by 2 9. now you can divide by 3 divide by 3 again you get 1. this is 2 times 3 times 3 or you can write 2 and 3 to the power of 2. 36 you can divide by 2 that's 18. divide by 2 again 9 divide by 3 again 3 3 and divide by 3 again that's 1. 2 twice and 3 twice so 2 to the power of 2 and 3 to the power of 2 both twice 242 divide by 2 you get 1 2 1 divide by what 11 11 times 11 121 divided by 11 you get 1 so 2 and 2 11 so 2 into 11 squared 75 you can divide by 3 3 times 2 6 and for 15 that's 5. divide by 5 again 5 divide by 5 again you get 1. so 3 times 5 times 5 you can write as 3 into 5 squared 24. how can we divide you can start with 2 12 again you can divide by 2 again by 2 and now you can divide by 3 2 into 2 
,into 2 into 3 2 3 times and 3 once 98 now divide by 2 49 then you get you can divide by 7 and again 7. 2 times 7 times 7 2 into 7 squared instead of 7 times 7 that's 7 squared find the value and use symbols greater less or equal signs so you are comparing two index notations 2 squared and 3 squared so what is 2 squared 2 into 2 
,that's 4. 3 squared 3 into 3 9. now which one is bigger 3 squared is bigger so you can write 2 squared is less than 3 squared 3 to the power 3 or 5 squared 3 to the 
,power 3 is 3 times 3 times 3 you get 27 5 squared 5 times 5 25 so you can write 3 to the power 3 is greater than 5 squared because 27 is more than 25 2 to the power 
,4 2 into 2 into 2 into 2 you get 2 times 2 4 4 times 2 8 8 times 2 16. 4 squared means 4 times 4 that's also 16. so what can you say about this one 2 to the power 4 
,is equal to 4 squared 3 to the power 4 and 9 squared 3 times 3 times 3 times 3 9 here and 9 here 9 times 9 81. 9 squared means 9 times 9 81 so both are the same 3 to the power 4 is same as 9 squared squared and 6 squared 7 times 7 49 6 times 6 36 so 49 is bigger 7 squared is greater than 6 squared 10 squared and 5 to the power 3 10 times 10 you get 100 5 into 5 into 5 3 times 25 times 5 125 so that's bigger so you can write 10 squared is smaller than 5 to the power of 3. 4 to the power 4 or 8 to the power 3 4 into 4 into 4 into 4 you get 64 times 4 256 8 to the power 3 8 times 8 64 64 times 8 now 500 12. so which one is bigger 8 to the power 3. so 4 to the power 4 is smaller than less than 8 to the power of 3 7 cube or 8 q 7 times 7 times 7 49 times 7. 343 8 times 3 8 times 8 times 8 we did that before 512 which one is bigger this is bigger so 7 to the power 3 is less than 8 to the power of 3 or 8 cubed write 64 as power of 2 power of 4 and power of 8 so you can divide separately so we'll do first power of 2 divide by 2 okay 32 16 8 four two and one one two three four five six two six times so you can write 2 to the power of 6 and as a power of 4 you have to divide by 4 4 times 1 4 6 4 times again 4 4 times 1 4 into 4 into 4 or 4 to the power of 3. now as a power of 8 you have to divide by 8 8 times 8 64 and 1 so 8 times 8 means 8 square so here 64 we can write as power of 2 power of 4 as well as power of 8 write 81 as power of 3 so divide by 3 and say and it's 27 divided by 3 9 divided by 3 3 divided by 3 1 3 4 times you can write 3 to the power of 4 now as a power of 9 you divide by 9 get 9 into 9 9 squared find the value so when you are asked to find the value you have to do separately and multiply 2 to the power of 4. now without expanding can you tell me what's 2 to the power of 
,4 that's 16. 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 that's 60. you can write 16 there 3 squared 3 into 3. that's 9 3 times 3 9 now you can multiply these two 9 times 6 54 9 times 1 9 9 plus 5 14. so 145 3 to the power 3 3 3 times that's 27 4 squared means 4 times 4 that's 16. now multiply 27 and 16 10 and 6 you get here multiplied by 1 6 times 7 42 and 6 times 2 12 12 plus 4 16 so you get when you add it 432 next one 2 to the power 2 that means 2 times 2 4. 5 to the power 3 5 times 5 times 5 so you get 
,125 so what's the value of four times five twenty four times two eight plus two ten four times one four four plus one five so answer is five hundred three squared three times three that's nine seven squared seven times seven forty-nine now multiply nine times forty-nine nine times nine eighty one eight remaining nine times four 
,thirty six and eight forty four four hundred and forty one 6 squared 6 into 6 36 2 to the power 3 2 times 2 times 2 that's 8. now 36 times 8. 8 times 6 48 4 remaining 8 times 3 24 plus 4 28 this one 4 squared 4 times 4 that's 16. three squared three times three that's nine sixteen times nine hundred forty-four 5 squared 5 into 5 that's 25 6 into 6 6 squared that's 36 36 into 25 twenty and five five times six thirty five times three fifteen plus three eighty so when you add it you get nine 900 9 squared 9 times 9 2 squared 2 times 2. so 81 here 2 times 2 4 4 times 1 4 4 times 8 32 so 324 11 squared 11 times 11 you get 121 two times two that's four so multiply by four four times one four eight four four hundred eighty four ten squared is hundred ten times ten 3 squared 3 times 3 that's 9. so you get 900 as the answer now three numbers so same thing 2 times 2 you get 4. 3 times 3 you get 9 5 only once so you get 4 times 5 20 20 times nine hundred eighty this one three squared three times three that's nine five squared five times five twenty five and 1 7 so 9 times 7 63 63 times 25 20 and 5 and five times three fifteen five times six thirty 
,plus one thirty one so when you add it thousand five hundred and seventy five fill in the blanks 49 so the base is 7 so we know 7 times 7 power is 2 121 is 11 times 
,11 so 11 square 3 to the power 4 3 times 3 9 3 times 3 9 9 times 9 81 100 125 as something to the power of 3 we know that 5 times 5 times 5 5 to the power of 3 81 it's a square number 9 times 9 9 squared 81 as power of 4 something power of 4 we know that 3 times 3 9 9 times 9. so 3 to the power 4 is 81 121 is 11 times 11 11 squared so 169 is 13 times 13 that's 13 square find the value of 4 squared what's 4 squared 4 times 4 16. find the value of 2 to the power 4 2 4 times you get 4 4 into 4 16 again so what can you say about these two write down the relationship between the two numbers both are the same so 4 squared is same as 2 to the power of 4. fill in the blanks so you have to give the base index index notation and the value three four times so three is the base power is four and this is three to the power four what's the number eighty one five three times five is the base three times they are so index is three five times five twenty five twenty five times five hundred and twenty five seven twice seven is the base power is two seven squared forty nine ten three times ten is the base three is the index ten times ten times 10 to the power 3 is 1000 11 twice 11 is the base 2 is the index 11 squared is 121 2 is the base here how many times 4 times 2 to the power of 4 16. now we look at the exercise 
,and examples in your textbook example number one write three four times using index notation so three one two three four four times find the value so how do you find out the value so we can expand it and find the value one two three four five six two times two times two eight two times 2 times 2 8 8 times 8 64. write down using 
,indices so here 2 3 times 1 2 3 and 5 twice 5 squared find the value of 5 squared and 7 to the power 3 you can do separately 5 squared means 5 times 5 25 7 to the power 3 7 times 7 49 49 times 7 343 now you have to multiply these two 343 times 25 twenty and five six eight six and five times five times three fifteen and five times four twenty plus one twenty one and two there are five times three fifteen plus two seventy now add it you get 8575 this one find the value of 2 to the power 4 and 3 squared so 2 to the power 4 means 2 4 times and 3 twice so here you get 16. 3 to the power 3 is 9. now multiply these two 9 times 6 54 5 remaining 9 times 1 9 plus 5 you get 14 144 24.1 fill in the blanks in the following table so you need to fill index form 4 to the power 3 base is 4 and index is 3 here 5 4 times so 5 is the base index is 4. you get 625 here 2 to the power 3 given that means 2 times 2 times 2 base is 2 power is 3. so what's the value you get 8. base is 2 power is 2 2 times 2 that's 4 here 5 to the power 3 means base is 5 index is 3 so 5 times 5 times 5 and what's the value of 5 to the power 3 5 times 5 25 25 times 5 125 write down

LkhPRz7Hocg,o you know why i pulled you over today uh some law that's right allah this law to be exact laws of exponents i've never even heard of these how was i supposed to know well you must have never heard of math antics they're this really cool math video series they have all sorts of basic math videos and the host is really funny is 
,this some sort of ad can i skip this no i think you'll really like it check it out hi this is rob welcome to math antics in this video we're going to learn about the laws of exponents if you look up the laws of exponents online or in a math book you'll probably see a long list of equations that look something like this wow that's kind of overwhelming when you see them all at once but don't worry we'll take them one step at a time and you'll see that they're not that complicated after all but before we get going if you're not confident with the basics of exponents i highly recommend watching our previous videos about them before moving on in this video 
,okay let's start with just the first two laws on our list which should look familiar if you watched our video called exponents in algebra they're just the two rules 
,we learned in that video you know rules laws same difference so you probably already know them they simply tell us that anything raised to the first power is itself 
,and anything raised to the zeroth power is just one and because we already know about exponents that are higher integer values like x to the second x to the third that means we've pretty much got things covered right ah not so fast don't forget that integers can have negative values too for example what if we add the expression 
,x to the power of negative one or negative two or negative three we know that exponents are a way of doing repeated multiplication but how in the world could you multiply something together a negative number of times well you can't fortunately the next law on our list tells us how to interpret a negative exponent that law says x to the negative nth power equals 1 divided by x to the nth power and if you think about it that kind of makes sense a negative number is the inverse of its positive counterpart and division is the inverse operation of multiplication right so a negative exponent is basically repeated division x to the negative 1 would be 1 divided by x x to the negative 2 would be 1 divided by x divided by x x to the negative 3 would be 1 divided by x divided by x divided by x and so on seeing it like this 
,makes the pattern clear but mathematicians prefer to express negative exponents in fraction form where one is divided by the same number of x's multiplied together but since those multiplied x's are all on the bottom of the fraction you're actually dividing by all of them here's an example that will help you see that that's true 2 to the negative third power let's first try that as a repeated division problem like our pattern shows us we always start with a 1 so we would have 1 divided by 2 divided by 2 divided by 2. if we do those operations from left to right using a calculator we get 0.125 as the answer now let's write it in fraction form like our law of exponents tells us we can 2 to the negative 3rd power would be the same as one divided by two to the third power and that's the same as one over two times two 
,times two which simplifies to one over eight and one over eight simplifies to 0.125 see whether you write it as a pattern of repeated division or in fraction form like our inverse law shows you get the same answer and now you know how to handle any expression with a negative exponent it's just 1 over the same expression with a positive exponent x to the negative one is one over x to the positive one or just one over x x to the negative two is one over x to the positive two x to the negative three is one over x to the positive three and so on all right three laws down five more to go and these next five show us how we can do various math operations involving exponents in fact the next law tells us how we can take a number raised to a power and then raise that to a power as you can see it shows an expression x to the power of m grouped inside parentheses and then that whole group is being raised to the nth power it's a nesting situation kind of like those russian nesting dolls 
,so what if someone asks you to simplify the expression x squared cubed which means the entire x squared term is raised to the third power well our law tells us that 
,we can simplify that by multiplying the exponents together see how it equals x to the power of m n which means m times n that means x squared raised to the third power would be the same as x to the power of two times three which is six wanna see why that's true well think about what it would mean to raise x squared to the third 
,power it would mean multiplying three x squared terms together like this and each one of those x squared terms simplifies to x times x right so we end up with six x's being multiplied together which is just x to the sixth power see our law works great if you have a number raised to a power and that's all raised to another power 
,you can just multiply the two exponents together to simplify it and it works for negative exponents too like what if we had x squared raised to the negative third power well our law tells us that that's the same as x to the power of two times negative three which is x to the negative sixth to see if that's true we'll need to use the law we just learned about negative exponents and rewrite this as one over x squared to the positive third power that simplifies to one over x squared times x squared times x squared which in turn simplifies to one over six x's being multiplied together and that all checks out because one over x to the sixth would be the same as x to the negative sixth power pretty cool huh okay we're halfway through our list of laws and we're gonna look at the next two as a set because they tell us how we can multiply and divide expressions that have the same base and that's important because we couldn't simplify them to have a single exponent if the bases were different the first law says that if we have the base x with exponent m being multiplied by the same base x with exponent n we can combine them simply by adding the exponents together and the second law says if we have the base x with exponent m being divided by the same base x with exponent n we can combine them simply by subtracting the exponents let's see some examples of each like this one two to the third times two to the fourth does that fit the pattern of our first law yep the base of 
,both expressions is the same but they happen to have different exponents the law would still work if the exponents were the same but they don't have to be just the bases have to be the same our law tells us that this would equal 2 to the power of three plus four or two to the seventh power but does it well let's break it down and see two to the third is two times two times two and that's being multiplied by two to the fourth which is two times two times two times two that's a lot of twos being multiplied together seven two's to be exact aha so that is what you'd get by just adding the exponents together since three plus four equals seven and this law makes total sense if you think about what an exponent really means the exponent is telling you to do repeated multiplication of the base right so this first part is telling you to multiply three twos together and the second part is telling you to multiply four twos together so that's why you can add the exponents together if the 
,base is the same or think about it like this if we had 10 x's all being multiplied together we could form different groups of them and combine them using exponents like we could combine the first four x's into x to the fourth and combine the remaining six x's into x to the sixth and of course those expressions would be multiplied together since all of the x's were being multiplied but you'd probably never want to do that would you i mean why not just combine all 10 x's into the expression x to the tenth ah but there you see that our law holds true x to the fourth times x to the sixth would equal x to the power of four plus six or x to the tenth okay now let's move on and see some examples of the second law in this set which tells us how to divide expressions with the same base suppose we have the expression 5 to the third power divided by 5 to the second power our law says that we can simplify this by subtracting the exponents specifically we take the exponent on the top and 
,subtract the exponent on the bottom from it if we do that the simplified version would be 5 to the power of 3 minus 2 or 5 to the first power but is that right to see let's write the expression out in expanded form on the top of our division problem we have five to the third which is five times five times five and on the bottom 
,we have five to the second which is five times five does this look like something you've seen while simplifying fractions yep since all the bases are the same they form pairs of common factors on the top and bottom that can be canceled out this 5 over 5 cancels and this 5 over 5 cancels if you don't know why that works be sure to watch our video about simplifying fractions and what do we end up with well all the factors on the bottom cancelled out which leaves 1 since there's always a factor of 1 and there's only one 5 left on the top so our expression simplified to 5 over one or just five following our law we got a simplified version of five to the first power which is also just five so it really did work but to make sure you've really got it let's try using this law again with the expression x to the fourth power over x to the sixth power this one's interesting our law says that we can simplify it by subtracting the bottom exponent from the top right but in this case that will give us a negative exponent because the bottom exponent is bigger than the top four minus six would be negative two so according to our law this expression should be equal to x to the negative two let's try writing it out in expanded form to see if that's true on the top x to the fourth would be the same as four x's multiplied together and on the bottom x to the sixth would be the same as six x's multiplied together once again we see that there are pairs of common factors that we can cancel four pairs to be precise and when we cancel them all we're left with a one on the top because there's always a factor of one and only two x's multiplied together on the bottom if we recombine these two x's we get one over x squared and if you remember the law we learned earlier about negative exponents you'll see that one over x squared is exactly the same as x to the power of negative two so these laws really do work okay it's finally time to look at the last two laws on our list and 
,fortunately they're pretty easy ones so we're not going to spend too much time on them these laws look kind of similar to the last pair just like before the first one involves multiplication and the second one involves division but notice that in these laws the bases are different but the exponents are the same that's the exact 
,opposite of the situation with the last pair of laws it turns out that these laws aren't about simplifying exponents they're about how you can distribute or undistribute a common exponent to different bases the first law shows this group x times y that's being raised to the power of m and it says that you can rewrite it as x to 
,the m times y to the m in other words you can distribute the exponent to each factor in the group and the second law shows the group x divided by y that's being raised to the power of n and it says that you can rewrite it as x to the n divided by y to the n in other words you can distribute the exponent to each part of the fraction of course these laws would work in reverse too and you could undistribute the exponents if they're the same for example if you're given the expression x squared 
,times y squared you could rewrite that as the quantity x times y squared and if you have the expression x squared divided by y squared you could rewrite that as the 
,quantity x over y squared here are two expressions that will help you see why you can distribute or undistribute exponents like our laws show in the first expression we have the quantity x times y squared and that's the same as x times y times x times y and the commutative property says that we can rearrange those factors like this x times x times y times y but look we can simplify that into x squared times y squared so that checks out in the second expression we have the quantity x over y 
,squared that's the same as x over y times x over y to multiply these fractions we just multiply the tops and multiply the bottoms which gives us x times x over y times y and that simplifies to x squared over y squared so that one checks out too all right so now you know about the so called laws of exponents and there's a good chance that you'll see them explained in slightly different forms or different orders or even using different terminology in other math videos or books but the basic ideas will be the same some people like to try to memorize this list of laws and you can do that if you want to but it's an even better idea to focus on knowing how exponents really work because if you truly understand that you can actually figure out a lot of these laws for yourself and what's the best way to understand how exponents really work yep you gotta practice so be sure to do some problems with exponents on your own as always thanks for watching math antics and i'll see you next time learn more at mathantics.com so what'd you think i thought you said the guy was going to be funny
,
LkhPRz7Hocg,do you know why i pulled you over today uh some law that's right allah this law to be exact laws of exponents i've never even heard of these how was i supposed to know well you must have never heard of math antics they're this really cool math video series they have all sorts of basic math videos and the host is really funny is 
,this some sort of ad can i skip this no i think you'll really like it check it out hi this is rob welcome to math antics in this video we're going to learn about the laws of exponents if you look up the laws of exponents online or in a math book you'll probably see a long list of equations that look something like this wow that's kind of overwhelming when you see them all at once but don't worry we'll take them one step at a time and you'll see that they're not that complicated after all but before we get going if you're not confident with the basics of exponents i highly recommend watching our previous videos about them before moving on in this video 
,okay let's start with just the first two laws on our list which should look familiar if you watched our video called exponents in algebra they're just the two rules 
,we learned in that video you know rules laws same difference so you probably already know them they simply tell us that anything raised to the first power is itself 
,and anything raised to the zeroth power is just one and because we already know about exponents that are higher integer values like x to the second x to the third that means we've pretty much got things covered right ah not so fast don't forget that integers can have negative values too for example what if we add the expression 
,x to the power of negative one or negative two or negative three we know that exponents are a way of doing repeated multiplication but how in the world could you multiply something together a negative number of times well you can't fortunately the next law on our list tells us how to interpret a negative exponent that law says x to the negative nth power equals 1 divided by x to the nth power and if you think about it that kind of makes sense a negative number is the inverse of its positive counterpart and division is the inverse operation of multiplication right so a negative exponent is basically repeated division x to the negative 1 would be 1 divided by x x to the negative 2 would be 1 divided by x divided by x x to the negative 3 would be 1 divided by x divided by x divided by x and so on seeing it like this 
,makes the pattern clear but mathematicians prefer to express negative exponents in fraction form where one is divided by the same number of x's multiplied together but since those multiplied x's are all on the bottom of the fraction you're actually dividing by all of them here's an example that will help you see that that's true 2 to the negative third power let's first try that as a repeated division problem like our pattern shows us we always start with a 1 so we would have 1 divided by 2 divided by 2 divided by 2. if we do those operations from left to right using a calculator we get 0.125 as the answer now let's write it in fraction form like our law of exponents tells us we can 2 to the negative 3rd power would be the same as one divided by two to the third power and that's the same as one over two times two 
,times two which simplifies to one over eight and one over eight simplifies to 0.125 see whether you write it as a pattern of repeated division or in fraction form like our inverse law shows you get the same answer and now you know how to handle any expression with a negative exponent it's just 1 over the same expression with a positive exponent x to the negative one is one over x to the positive one or just one over x x to the negative two is one over x to the positive two x to the negative three is one over x to the positive three and so on all right three laws down five more to go and these next five show us how we can do various math operations involving exponents in fact the next law tells us how we can take a number raised to a power and then raise that to a power as you can see it shows an expression x to the power of m grouped inside parentheses and then that whole group is being raised to the nth power it's a nesting situation kind of like those russian nesting dolls 
,so what if someone asks you to simplify the expression x squared cubed which means the entire x squared term is raised to the third power well our law tells us that 
,we can simplify that by multiplying the exponents together see how it equals x to the power of m n which means m times n that means x squared raised to the third power would be the same as x to the power of two times three which is six wanna see why that's true well think about what it would mean to raise x squared to the third 
,power it would mean multiplying three x squared terms together like this and each one of those x squared terms simplifies to x times x right so we end up with six x's being multiplied together which is just x to the sixth power see our law works great if you have a number raised to a power and that's all raised to another power 
,you can just multiply the two exponents together to simplify it and it works for negative exponents too like what if we had x squared raised to the negative third power well our law tells us that that's the same as x to the power of two times negative three which is x to the negative sixth to see if that's true we'll need to use the law we just learned about negative exponents and rewrite this as one over x squared to the positive third power that simplifies to one over x squared times x squared times x squared which in turn simplifies to one over six x's being multiplied together and that all checks out because one over x to the sixth would be the same as x to the negative sixth power pretty cool huh okay we're halfway through our list of laws and we're gonna look at the next two as a set because they tell us how we can multiply and divide expressions that have the same base and that's important because we couldn't simplify them to have a single exponent if the bases were different the first law says that if we have the base x with exponent m being multiplied by the same base x with exponent n we can combine them simply by adding the exponents together and the second law says if we have the base x with exponent m being divided by the same base x with exponent n we can combine them simply by subtracting the exponents let's see some examples of each like this one two to the third times two to the fourth does that fit the pattern of our first law yep the base of 
,both expressions is the same but they happen to have different exponents the law would still work if the exponents were the same but they don't have to be just the bases have to be the same our law tells us that this would equal 2 to the power of three plus four or two to the seventh power but does it well let's break it down and see two to the third is two times two times two and that's being multiplied by two to the fourth which is two times two times two times two that's a lot of twos being multiplied together seven two's to be exact aha so that is what you'd get by just adding the exponents together since three plus four equals seven and this law makes total sense if you think about what an exponent really means the exponent is telling you to do repeated multiplication of the base right so this first part is telling you to multiply three twos together and the second part is telling you to multiply four twos together so that's why you can add the exponents together if the 
,base is the same or think about it like this if we had 10 x's all being multiplied together we could form different groups of them and combine them using exponents like we could combine the first four x's into x to the fourth and combine the remaining six x's into x to the sixth and of course those expressions would be multiplied together since all of the x's were being multiplied but you'd probably never want to do that would you i mean why not just combine all 10 x's into the expression x to the tenth ah but there you see that our law holds true x to the fourth times x to the sixth would equal x to the power of four plus six or x to the tenth okay now let's move on and see some examples of the second law in this set which tells us how to divide expressions with the same base suppose we have the expression 5 to the third power divided by 5 to the second power our law says that we can simplify this by subtracting the exponents specifically we take the exponent on the top and 
,subtract the exponent on the bottom from it if we do that the simplified version would be 5 to the power of 3 minus 2 or 5 to the first power but is that right to see let's write the expression out in expanded form on the top of our division problem we have five to the third which is five times five times five and on the bottom 
,we have five to the second which is five times five does this look like something you've seen while simplifying fractions yep since all the bases are the same they form pairs of common factors on the top and bottom that can be canceled out this 5 over 5 cancels and this 5 over 5 cancels if you don't know why that works be sure to watch our video about simplifying fractions and what do we end up with well all the factors on the bottom cancelled out which leaves 1 since there's always a factor of 1 and there's only one 5 left on the top so our expression simplified to 5 over one or just five following our law we got a simplified version of five to the first power which is also just five so it really did work but to make sure you've really got it let's try using this law again with the expression x to the fourth power over x to the sixth power this one's interesting our law says that we can simplify it by subtracting the bottom exponent from the top right but in this case that will give us a negative exponent because the bottom exponent is bigger than the top four minus six would be negative two so according to our law this expression should be equal to x to the negative two let's try writing it out in expanded form to see if that's true on the top x to the fourth would be the same as four x's multiplied together and on the bottom x to the sixth would be the same as six x's multiplied together once again we see that there are pairs of common factors that we can cancel four pairs to be precise and when we cancel them all we're left with a one on the top because there's always a factor of one and only two x's multiplied together on the bottom if we recombine these two x's we get one over x squared and if you remember the law we learned earlier about negative exponents you'll see that one over x squared is exactly the same as x to the power of negative two so these laws really do work okay it's finally time to look at the last two laws on our list and 
,fortunately they're pretty easy ones so we're not going to spend too much time on them these laws look kind of similar to the last pair just like before the first one involves multiplication and the second one involves division but notice that in these laws the bases are different but the exponents are the same that's the exact 
,opposite of the situation with the last pair of laws it turns out that these laws aren't about simplifying exponents they're about how you can distribute or undistribute a common exponent to different bases the first law shows this group x times y that's being raised to the power of m and it says that you can rewrite it as x to 
,the m times y to the m in other words you can distribute the exponent to each factor in the group and the second law shows the group x divided by y that's being raised to the power of n and it says that you can rewrite it as x to the n divided by y to the n in other words you can distribute the exponent to each part of the fraction of course these laws would work in reverse too and you could undistribute the exponents if they're the same for example if you're given the expression x squared 
,times y squared you could rewrite that as the quantity x times y squared and if you have the expression x squared divided by y squared you could rewrite that as the 
,quantity x over y squared here are two expressions that will help you see why you can distribute or undistribute exponents like our laws show in the first expression we have the quantity x times y squared and that's the same as x times y times x times y and the commutative property says that we can rearrange those factors like this x times x times y times y but look we can simplify that into x squared times y squared so that checks out in the second expression we have the quantity x over y 
,squared that's the same as x over y times x over y to multiply these fractions we just multiply the tops and multiply the bottoms which gives us x times x over y times y and that simplifies to x squared over y squared so that one checks out too all right so now you know about the so called laws of exponents and there's a good chance that you'll see them explained in slightly different forms or different orders or even using different terminology in other math videos or books but the basic ideas will be the same some people like to try to memorize this list of laws and you can do that if you want to but it's an even better idea to focus on knowing how exponents really work because if you truly understand that you can actually figure out a lot of these laws for yourself and what's the best way to understand how exponents really work yep you gotta practice so be sure to do some problems with exponents on your own as always thanks for watching math antics and i'll see you next time learn more at mathantics.com so what'd you think i thought you said the guy was going to be funny

dAgfnK528RA,"Hi and welcome to Math Antics. Today we’re gonna talk about an important math concept called Order of Operations. Order of Operations is just a set of math rules that tell you which math operations (like addition or multiplication) to do first. Now you might be wondering (especially if you’re a teenager), “Why do I need RULES to tell me which operations to do first?  Can’t I just do them in any order I want?” Well, that’s a really good questions! And to answer it, we’re going to give two TOTALLY different people the SAME math problem to solve. The problem is: 2 + 5 × 4 Hmmm… I like addition better than multiplication, so I’m gonna do that first! Let’s "
,"see… 2 + 5 gives us 7.  And then I just multiply that 7 by the 4 and I get 28. That was easy!  But you’d better not copy my answer! Uh, don’t worry… I’m not gonna copy your answer, cuz I want the RIGHT answer! And I prefer multiplying, so I’m going to do THAT first. Let’s see… 4 × 5 = 20, and THEN I’ll add the 2 which gives me 22 for a final answer. What makes you think THAT’S the right answer?  All my calculations were correct. I even checked it with a calculator! Pfffff - the only calculator I need is right up here! And the correct answer is… boop, boop, boop boop, boop…. 22! Okay, so which one of these guys do you think is right?  Neither one made any mistakes with the calculations. They just did the operations in a different order and got DIFFERENT answers! Well… since there were no mistakes, in a way, they were BOTH right! But math would be a VERY confusing subject if there were different answers to the same problem. And that’s where Order of Operations can help us out. "
,"The Order of Operations Rules are a way for us all to agree on the order that you should do math operations in. And if we always do operations in the same order, then we’ll always get the same answer. So now that you know WHY we need Order of Operations rules, let’s find out what those rules are. There’re basically four of them "
,"and they go something like this: FIRST: do operation in parentheses and brackets NEXT: do exponents THEN: do multiplication and division LAST: do addition and subtraction Let’s take a closer look at each one of these rules, and see some examples where they will help us. First on the list was:  do operations in parentheses and brackets. Now in case you haven’t seen parentheses or brackets used in math before, let me briefly explain how they work. Parentheses are just these symbols that curve forwards and backwards, and they’re used in pairs like this. And when we put numbers and operators in between them, it forms a group. It’s almost like the parentheses form a package to hold whatever math stuff we put inside them. And brackets work exactly the same way as parentheses. They just have a different shape that looks "
,"a little more boxy, but they mean exactly the same thing. So parentheses and brackets are used to group things together, and our rules tell us to do any operations inside these groups FIRST. For example, have a look at this problem: 10 × (4 + 5) It has 3 numbers and 2 operations: multiplication and addition. But 2 of the numbers and the addition symbol are inside parentheses. That means that they form a group and we need to do that part of the problem first. 4 + 5 = 9, so the part inside the parentheses can just be replaced with the simplified value 9. Oh… and once you do the math that’s inside parentheses and get a single number like this, you usually don’t need to show the parentheses anymore. Now that the parentheses are gone, we just have one operation left to do. We multiply 10 × 9 and that gives us 90 as our final answer. So parentheses can really help you know what part of a problem you’re supposed to do first. But what if you get a problem that has more than one set of parentheses, like this:   (5 ? 3) + (6 × 2) Fortunately, it doesn’t matter which set of parentheses you do first. You just need to do everything that’s inside the "
,"parentheses BEFORE you do anything that's NOT inside parentheses. In other words, we need to simplify BOTH of our parentheses groups before we can do this addition IN-BETWEEN them. The first group (5 ? 3) simplifies to 2, and the second group (6 × 2) simplifies to 12. Now we can do the last operation and add the values that we got from simplifying: 2 + 12 = 14 Okay, now that we know we always do operation in parentheses or brackets FIRST, let’s take a closer look at the second rule that says the next thing we do is exponents. Now if you haven’t seen exponents before, they’re just a way of writing repeated multiplication. For example, the repeated multiplication 4 × 4 can be written in a shorter form as 4 multiplied twice. And 4 × 4 × 4 can be written as 4 multiplied 3 times, and 4 × 4 × 4 × 4 can be written as 4 multiplied 4 times.  …get the idea? This small number is called an exponent (or power). It just tells you how many times to multiply the bigger number together. So after we take care of any parentheses, simplifying any exponents becomes the next highest priority. For example in this problem, we have to simplify the exponent BEFORE we can do the other multiplication. The exponent is telling us to multiply 5 together twice.  So 5 times 5 is 25. And after we do that, THEN we multiply the result by 3.  So 25 times 3 is 75. Oh, and one thing I should point out… sometimes you’ll get a problem that has exponents inside of parentheses, like this problem. And you may wonder, “How can I get rid of the parentheses BEFORE I do the exponent?” You might think that if you simplify the exponent first, you’re breaking the rules. But the truth is that by doing whatever operations are inside the parentheses, you ARE doing the parentheses first. The parentheses really just tell you where to start. So in this problem, first we do 3 to the power of 2, which means 3 × 3 which is 9. Then the part inside the parentheses is 9 × 4, which equals 36. And once the parentheses are gone, we add 36 + 6 and get 42 as our final answer. Alright, now we’re gonna look at the last two rules together. These two rules are really important because they deal with the most common math operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication & division. And the rules tell us that we need to do multiplication and "
,"division BEFORE we do addition and subtraction. To see how these rules work, lets look at a few quick examples that use those basic operations. First let’t try this "
,"one:  2 + 5 + 4  Ah Ha!… Does this look familiar? Yep, it’s the one we gave to my two friends earlier. And now that we have our rules, we see that we have to do the "
,"multiplication before the addition. 5 × 4 = 20 and THEN we add the 2, which gives us 22… so the second guy WAS right! [Sarcastically] What a surprise! Now let’s try "
,"this one:  3 × 5 ? 1 Our rules tell us that multiplication is higher on the list than subtraction, so we do 3 × 5 first. That gives us 15, and THEN we subtract the ‘1’ which leaves 14 as our final answer. Here’s one with division and subtraction: 20 ? 10 ÷ 5 And since division has a higher priority, we do the 10 divided by 5 first, which equals 2. And then we subtract 2 from 20 and get 18 as our final answer. And here’s another problem: 12 ÷ 6 + 5 Again, our rules say to do the division before addition, so 12 divided by 6 equals 2 and then we add the 5 to get 7. And here’s one last problem: 40 ÷ 4 × 5 Which do we do first?… the multiplication or the division?  Our rules don’t tell us. Well, that’s because multiplication and division are TIED for priority or importance.  So are addition and subtraction. And THAT’S "
,"the reason we need an extra part at the end of each of these rule that says “from left to right” If you have a problem that has BOTH multiplication AND division, then you’re supposed to work it from left to right. That’s because in some cases, you can get a different answers if you go from right to left. For example, in this problem, if you work from right to left (the wrong way) you would do the 4 × 5 first and get 20. And then 40 divided by 20 equals 2. But if you go from left to right, you would do 40 divided by 4 first, which is 10, and then 10 times 5 equals 50. Wow! The direction we went made a BIG difference. So whenever you have a problem that "
,"has a mixture of multiplication and division OR a mixture of addition and subtraction, you know to do the operations in order from left to right. Alright, we’re just about done, but let’s have one more look at all four of our rules before you start practicing with the exercises. The Order of Operations rules say: FIRST: do operation in parentheses and brackets NEXT: do exponents THEN: do multiplication and division (from left to right) LAST: do addition and subtraction (from left to right) "

BUJKEDqGp1U,hi I'm Lucy and in this video we're going to look at the laws of indices you should already know what indices are maybe forgotten watched this video first the laws of indices make solving complex problems involving powers much easier and they are also essential for understanding a lot of algebra processors so there are six laws 
,that we need to know multiplying and dividing with indices raising a power to a power what a power of zero means and then fractional and negative indices we're going to look at the first four in this video and then the last two in part two I promise you they really are quite logical right so multiplying indices look at how these are simplified what do you notice hopefully you can see that when we multiply indices we just add the powers together so 3 plus 4 is 7 because really it is 2 3 times x - 4 times giving us 7 twos and three plus two plus one is six looking at the final example see how we treat the numbers and the indices differently so we do 4 multiplied by 5 first and add the indices second a really important thing to know is that the base has to be the same so here because they are both base two we can add the 3 and the 4 but on this one we can't do anything because one is base 2 and one is base 3 so what happens when we divide with indices have a look and see if you 
,can work it out when we divide entities we subtract the powers but again the base must be the same so for this one we do the numbers first and subtract the indices second this is because if I wrote the equation out filly it would be the same as writing this just as you do any simplify fractions we can cancel down our numbers and our letters say we cancel the 20 and the 5 to become before and we start by cancelling out the B's so to divide indices we divide the numbers and we subtract the powers so what do you notice about these 3 when powers are raised to a power we multiply the powers together on this one be a little careful don't forget because the 3 is also inside the brackets it needs squaring 2 hence 9 but then 6 multiplied by 2 is 12 if we write this out it would be 3 B 6 x 3 e 6 and we know that when we multiply indices we add the powers so 3 x 3 is 9 and 6 plus 6 is 12 so just remember when we raise a power to a power we just multiply the two powers together so what'd you notice about the power of zero anything to the power of zero is one but why is this let's use our knowledge of fractions and also dividing indices to see why do you agree that anything divided by itself is one so a to the power of three goes into a to the power of three once that's our first equation and then using our indices knowledge when we divide we subtract the powers to 3 minus 3 is 0 and that's our second equation we've done the same calculation in two different ways therefore 
,the two answers must equal one another so combining these two things and nothing to the power of zero equals one here are some questions for you to give a go yourself pause the video work out the answers and click play when you're ready to check did you get them right so here are the four laws that we've seen so far make sure you understand why they work and then you don't need to stress about learning them watch part two to discover how fractional and negative indices work if you liked the video give it a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe comment below if you have any questions why not check out our few school app as well until next time

QKvJELYdRRA,hello grade 8 children today I'm here to teach you chapter 10 in your textbook that's called indices you started indices in grade 7 so we'll look at more properties 
,so what I indices powers Oh another name for a popper we can say exponents now we'll take this number 3 3 3 several times so how many trees are there 1 2 3 4 5 6 so 
,we can write this number as 3 to the power 6 so when you take this number so here 6 is the superscript so what is that that's the index index is the singular and indices is the pro-reform and what is this number 3 is the base so we know the base and the power and we call this whole thing as the index notation write down how you 
,read the following how you do that 3 to the power rock 6 what is this 1 7 ^ 7 ^ 3 10 to the power of 2 - why you can write the number so here I can write number 2 what's this one 8 to the power of 4 a to the power of 4 this one 9 to the power of 3 and now a letter so can you read this a to the power of 4 so now you know how to read these index notations write the following indicating the index notation tow to the power of 3 2 to the power of 3 3 to the power of 4 5 to the power of 8 8 to the power of X to the power of Y to the power of now you have given the index notation and you are asked to write down the base and the index so what's the base means 
,it's three here what's the index when you take this one this is seven indexes for here base is 10 index is 3 base is 8 index is 5 and here base is 9 index is 3 here 
,base is a index is 4 and here what's the best why is the base and the index is 3 write the following in index notation so what's the base 7 how many sevens are there 1 2 3 4 7 ^ 4 8 is the base how many eighths are there 1 2 3 4 8 to the power of 4 minus 10 is the base now how many 1 2 3 11 is the base now how many levels 1 2 3 
,4 11 to the power of 4 here how many years are there 1 2 3 4 5 into the power of 5 how many Y's are there 1 2 3 4 5 y to the power 5 write the following expanded as 
,product of numbers now Phi to the power of 3 how can you expand that 5 3 times 7 to the power of 4 7 4 times minus 3 to the power of 4 minus 3 four times then a to the power 5 8 you have to write 5 times X to the power 4 means X 4 times so don't get confused with this multiplication sign an X Y to the power Phi means why five times write the following expanded form so 2 a square that means twice and be three x squared that means 2 X's and why how you write this 1 5 & 3 is this one 7 how many X's are there - and how many ways are there to the other one 11 is there - piece P squared means P into P and then one Q value this one you write - 3 is out there 
,so you write three years and one be here 3 twice and a thrice and one being here 5 2 x 1 x 3 why's this one 2/7 and 3 is here 2 & 4 XS and one what write the following index notation to is there how many XS one two so two there and one right here how many threes two threes so 3 to the power 2 and how many is 2 is + 1 be here you don't need to put one there how many fives three fives and two x's x squared - 7 s and three piece P to the power 3 here 3 xi + 2 m z-- m squared this one - 9 - 9 squared one to choose Xers and - wise now try to write down this - wait two M's and one in here 13 is there to piece and three cubes here for 2 is + 3 piece this 1 1 
,3 here 2 is + 1 B and - sis write the following numbers as a product of prime numbers and write them in index notation so we need to find out what are the prime factors take 8 divided by 2 you get 4 divided by 2 again you get 2 divided by 2 again you get 1 so 8 you can write 2 times 2 times 2 now you can write this in in the expectation how many tools are there 1 2 3 so 2 to the power 3 9 how can you write take 9 and you can divide by 3 you get 1 so 3 times 3 2 threes are there you can write as 3 squared 12 find the factors / - 6 divide by 2 again 3 divided by 3 again 1 so you can write 2 times 2 times 3 this is same as 2 to the power 2 and 3 to the power 1 this one 30 divided by 2 you get 15 divided by 3 you get 5 divided by 5 you get 1 so 2 times 3 times 5 so you can't do anything you can't simplify because all 
,these prime factors only once 20 divided by 2 you get 10 divided by 2 5 you get 1 so you can write 2 times 2 times 5 simplify this you get to choose and 1 5 no need 
,to put one there 36 divided by 2 you get 18 divided by 2 9 divided by 3 get 3 divided by 3 again you get 1 2 times 2 times 3 times 3 2 tours and two threes so you can write like that 100 divided by to get 50 divided by 2 again you get 25 now you can divide by five that's five divided by five again you get one so I can try two times two times five times five simplify and I can write 2 to the power 2 and Phi to the power 2 72 divided and get the prime factors divide by 2 you get 36 divided by 2 18 divided by 2 9 divided by 3 3 you get 1 so 2 times 2 times 2 times 3 and another 3 so how can you write 2 to the power 3 and 3 to the power 2 162 divided by 2 
,you get 81 divided by 3 you get 27 divided by 3 again 9 3 again 3 divided by 3 you get 1 so 2 times 3 threes not three threes three four threes so how can you write 
,2 into 3 to the power 4 225 divided by 3 you get seven and five 75 divided by five you can divide by 3 again divided by three again two and five now you can divide by five that's 1 3 into 3 & 5 into 5 I can write 3 squared + 5 squared as index notation expand the following and write down the value two squared that means 2 into 2 3 squared means 3 into 3 now what's the value 2 times 2 for 4 times 3 12 12 times 3 36 this one 3 squared that means 3 times 3 and then 1 5 3 times 3 9 9 times 5 45 here 7 times 7 times 11 49 times xi multiplied this by 11 10 and 1 you get 9 3 & 5 539 so you know how you get this one at once when you are multiplying by 11 you first write down the last digit and then 9 plus 4 13 one remaining and you are adding that one to that so 539 so you can use that 539 this one 3 to the power 3 is 27 
,3 times 3 times 3 5 squared 5 & 5 so 3 times 3 9 9 times 3 27 27 times 25 20 and 5 you get 675 so check it again you can multiply by 20 and 5 and when you add you are getting 675 3 squared means 3 times seven squared means 7 times 7 now multiply 3 times 3 9 9 times seven sixty three sixty three times seven 441 or you can check with 21 into 21 21 squared 2 to the power 4 to 4 times 1 2 3 4 and 1 3 2 times 2 4 4 times 2 8 8 times 2 16 16 times 3 what's the volume 48 this one 11 times 11 times 13 11 times 11 we know that it's hard red 21 121 times 13 10 and 3 you get 3 6 3 when you add it thousand five hundred and seventy three this one five to the power 
,3 5 times 5 times 5 into 7 5 times 5 25 25 times 525 125 multiplied by 7 35 14 + 3 17 7 plus 1/8 so 875 this one - 4 x + 5 twice 2 times 2 4 4 times 2 8 8 times 2 16 16 times 5 80 and eighty times five 400 this one 3 to the power 4 3 into 3 into 3 into 3 & 2 5 3 times 3 9 9 times 3 27 27 times 3 81 81 times 5 405 again multiplied by 5 you get 2025 power of a product as a product of powers 3 into 5 squared here is the product of 3 & 5 written as a power of 2 so this is power of 2 so that means you can write this one as this multiplied by this twice of that then we can separate it how many threes are there 1 2 how many fives are there two then what's the value we can write as 3 squared + 5 squared now this is power of a product power of a product we can write as separate powers write down as product of powers 2 into 5 to the power 3 means 2 into 5 3 times then how many tools are there 1 2 3 how many fives 1 2 3 then you can count separately 2 to the power 3 and 5 to the power three so what's the answer you can write two into five power three as 2 to the power 3 and 5 to the power 3 now look at this one X Y to the power 3 so that means XY XY XY 3 times how many X's are there 1 2 3 how many Y's 1 2 3 now you can write separately how many X's 3 how many Y's that's 3 here you don't need to write multiplication sign you can write as X to the power 3 y to the power 3 now look at carefully can you see we are considering power 3 at once so we can use that no need to expand it and get the answer when you see a power this power you have to consider for all numbers or letters as there this power so when this is power 3 X to the power 3 and Y to the power 3 write down as product of powers so we need to look at 8 when you take 8 you can divide by 2 and write 4 divided by 2 again that's 2 divided by 
,2 again you get 1 so 8 I can write 2 times 2 times 2 times a 3 and B 2 now how many tools are there 2 to the power 3 a to the power 3 and B Square now we can see all our powers 2 to the power 3 into a to the power 3 and V to the power to write down as product of powers of P you are so now you can see this one is P Q R P Q R and 
,another P Q R how many peas are there three how many cute another three how many are you so you can write P to the power three Q to the power 3 and R to the power 3 
,so look at carefully when there's a power outside consider the power for all inside numbers or letters so P to the power 3 Q to the power 3 n R to the power 3 so you can write at once write down as product of powers what's the answer if you are doing at once you need to get 3 to the power 3 and X to the power 3 we'll just check 
,that so 3 X 3 x then how many threes are there three threes and three X's you can write this one as 1 2 3 and X to the power 3 so you get the same answer write down 
,as product of powers now how you do that if you are writing at once we know you are getting 5 to the power 3 X to the power 3 and Y to the power 3 so we'll check it 
,5x y 5x y 5x y 3 x now how many fives are there 1 2 3 how many XS 1 2 3 how many ways are there 1 2 3 you can write as follows 5 to the power 3 X to the power 3 and 
,Y to the power 3 write down as productive powers so what's the answer 7 squared a squared B squared + C squared so you have to consider this outside father for all inside letters and numbers so this should be the answer we'll check it 7 ABC twice 2 servers to is 2 B's and twosies so how can you write as a power so 1 to the power 2 into the power 2 B to the power 2 and C to the power 2 so without the multiplication sign you can write like this write down as product of powers at once now you 
,know the pattern so what you do you take the powers fall inside numbers 2 to the power 2 7 to the power 2 this part 3 to the power 2 and Phi to the power 2 7 to the 
,power 3 11 to the power 3 here 2 to the power 4 and 3 to the power 4 this one a to the power 3 and B to the power 3 this one you get three numbers so same thing 2 to the power 2 3 to the power 2 and 5 to the power 2 this one 3 to the power 3 5 to the power 3 n 7 to the power 3 here you don't need to write down multiplication when there's letters a to the power 5 V to the power 5 C to the power 5 this one X to the power 3 y to the power 3 Z to the power 3 this one v to the power 3 e to the power 3 and B to the power right down power of product as product of Palace so this is something power 1 expression with the power you have to write down separate powers you can write 3 to the power 3 and a to the power 3 or you can write without multiplication sign but it says product of power so you show like this 5 to the power 2 and X to the power 2 6 to the power 3 and M to the power 3 here 10 to the power 2 with X to the power 2 3 to the power 4 and Y to the power 4 here 5 to the power 3 and P to the power 3 this one a to the power 4 B to the power 4 M to the power 3 and n to the power 3 here 2 to the power 3 P to the power 3 and Q to the power 3 
,here 3 squared x squared + y squared Y to the power 3 P to the power 3 and Q to the power 3 what about the last one 11 to the power 3 X to the power 3 n y to the power 3 write down product of power there's power of product so you have to come by so look at this one same power so I can write power is 3 and 5 and 7 inside this one save power our two instead of this I can write four times same power you can take like this not with different powers three times X or three X to the power 4 so you can write P and Q with power 2 here and be the power 3 this one three terms are there two five and X the power this one 3 and P same pollen same power you can write like this power 3 so 7 times y with poetry here amen in with power 4 11 and Y with power for this one two and one with power 7 5 and P with power for power of a negative integer so now inside there's a negative number so negative 2 to the power 1 is negative 2 negative 2 to the power 2 means you multiply twice so what's the answer 2 times 2 4 and minus into minus becomes plus power 3 you have to multiply 3 times so you get 8 2 times 2 times 2 minus into minus plus plus into minus you get minus 8 when it comes to 2 to the power 4 minus 2 to the power 4 you are multiplying this answer by another minus 2 you are getting 16 with positive this 116 times another to get 32 but this is minus so what can you observe 2 to the power 1 minus 2 to the power 1 minus 2 to the power 3 minus 2 to the power 5 for odd powers always get negative values and odd power of negative integer is always a negative value so you need to remember when there is a negative sign when you take any odd power the answer is negative look at the other one when it comes to even powers what's the answer you get positive values so even power of negative integer is always positive power of a positive integer now look at this 1 2 to the power 1 is 2 2 to the power 2 get 2 to the power 3 4 times 2 8 2 to the power 4 8 times 2 16 again you have to multiply by 2 you get 32 so we can see all these numbers are positive so power of a positive integer is always positive now look at this 1 1 is 1 1 squared 1 times 1 1 1 to the power 3 you get 1 there 1 to the power 4 also why look at this 1 minus 1 to the power 1 minus 1 minus 1 to the power 2 you get positive 1 because - 
,- positive here are three numbers so you get negative 1 here negative 1 times negative 1 you get positive 1 as well now observe that any power of 1 is always 1 or power of negative 1 this one this one you always getting minus 1 even power of negative 1 you're always getting positive life so remember that 1 to the power 101 is 1 
,negative 1 to the power 99 what is the answer negative 1 because odd powers always you get negative answers right down the onset once this is positive power always 1 positive powers always you get one positive even powers even power is always positive 1 what about odd powers odd powers you are getting negative 1 for any power with negative at 1 an odd power always negative answer find the value so even power so always even powers positive answers so what's the answer you get minus 3 times minus 3 positive 9 minus 4 times minus 4 you get positive 16 minus 5 times minus 5 positive 25 minus 7 times minus 7 positive 49 minus 10 times minus 10 positive 100 
,so you get all positive answers write down the following product of powers as a power of a product so 2 a and B both same power so you can write 2 a B whole thing square now like that can you write this 1 power 3 is there and what are the terms here inside 3x here power 3 comes what are the literals inside P Q this one over for 
,what are the numbers X 5 a when you are writing in order normally numbers first 5 a X you can write like that this one power 3 is there for all numbers so - ABC so you can write to ABC to the power of 3 show that 2 X to the power 3 and 3 y to the power 3 is 216 X to the power 3 and Y to the power 3 so what you do you can take the left-hand side and simplify and you show the right-hand side so 2 X to the power 3 and this one I can write as power 3 2 X + 3 1 then again I can write 2 times 3 6 X y to the power 3 multiplication of 2 and 3 now I can write 6 to the power 3 X to the power 3 and y to the power 3 what is 6 to the power 3 6 times 6 36 36 times 6 is 216 X to the power 3 y to the power 3 so this is same as right hand side so this is left hand side so we can see left hand side is equal to right hand side so that means this is true so that this one so same thing you take the left hand side and you have to show this is equal to the right hand side so how can you write these two same power that's - 5 X + 7 Y you can write like this and 5 times 7 35 X 1 square that means 35 squared x squared + y square so what's 35 squared 35 times 35 do you know any easy method this is what you do so always you get 25 as the last digit when you multiply by 5 times 5 and how you get the the previous number you have 
,to multiply by the next number so 3 is there multiply by 4 4 times 3 12 so you are getting thousand 225 we'll check that 35 times 35 30 + 5 + 5 times 5 25 15 plus 270 so you are getting thousand two hundred twenty-five so use that easy method to find out a square term only when it's five as the last digit so you get thousand 225 X square Y square so that's right hand side so that means this is true sure that this one is the same as the other side so take the left hand side and we can see square term is common inside you get 11 X + 2 y 11 times - 22 X Y to the power 2 so here 22 squared x squared + y squared now what is 22 square 22 times 22 20 and 2 you get 484 so that's correct 484 x squared by squared that's equal to right hand side so we can say this is true find the value of algebraic expressions with indices 
,now you have given a value for x and asked you to find out the value so just substitute the value instead of X so we can write 2 instead of X I can write 3 then 2 times 3 times 3 3 twice there so 2 times 3 6 6 times 3 18 so the value is 18 now substitute here 2 times 3 squared 2 times 3 6 squared 6 times 6 means 36 here 3x is 3 
,3 to the power 3 all together how many 3 is now here 1 and this is 3 how many threes are there four threes are there 3 to the power 4 what's the value 3 to the power 4 81 3 times 3 9 9 times 3 27 27 times 3 81 this one 5 3 square so 5 into 3 times 3 9 9 times 5 45 4 times 3 square now 4 times 3 12 12 squared means 12 times 12 on bran 44 7 x squared 7 into X is 3 so 3 squared what is 3 squared that's 9 9 times 7 what's the answer 63 find the value when a equals 2 and B equals 3 so we'll substitute a is 2 so 2 to the power 2 and B is 3 3 to the power 2 2 to the power 2 means 2 times 2 4 3 to the power 2 means 3 times 3 9 9 times 4 36 that's fine 2 a is 2 B is 3 to the power 2 now we can simplify inside 2 times 2 4 4 times 3 12 12 squared what is 12 squared 12 times 12 144 a to the power 3 that means 2 to the power 3 n 3 to the power 1 2 to the power 3 2 times 2 times 2 8 8 times 3 24 this one 5 is there a means 2 and B is 3 so 5 into 2 to the power 2 is 4 into 3 5 times for 20 
,20 times 360 substitute here a is 2 B is 3 so what's 2 to the power 2 that's 4 when you multiply 3 times 4 12 12 times 3 36 7 a squared a squared means 2 to the power 2 and 3 so 7 times 4 times 3 7 times for 28 28 x 380 now we'll look at the review exercise complete the following table you have given numbers and you ask to write in index notation and base and the index so the first one done for you 8 is 2 to the power 3 so 2 is the base and 3 is the index now we'll donate so 9 means 3 and 3 you can write 3 squared 3 squared what's the base 3 index to 16 you have given 2 is the base so what is 16 we know that 2 to the power 4 2 to the power 4 is 16 so base is 2 power is 4 and here base is forgiven and power is 2 so what's the number 4 times 4 16 now thousand is given with base 10 so 10 to the power 3 here we just count number of zeros so 10 is the base power is 3 expand and write each of the following expressions as a product so what is 3x squared means 3 times X times X what's 2 P squared Q means 2 times 2 peas and 1q this one 4 squared means 4 times 4 X cubed means X 3 times 5 squared means 5 into 5 and x squared means x into x + y squared means y + y so this is the expanded form question number three write down each of the following numbers as a product of powers of which the base is our prime number so you have to find out the prime numbers take 20 divided by 2 divide by 2 again and you can't divide by 5 so how can you write 22 times 2 times 5 and we can write as power 2 to the power 2 & 1 5:48 you have to divide and C divided by 2 divided by 2 again again divided by 2 so you get here again 3 & 3 with 1 so 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 3 you can finally write how many tools are there how many tools for tools and 1 350 when you divide again 25 divided by 5 you get 1 so 2 toes and 
,two fives you can write 2 to the power 2 and Phi to the power 245 divided by 2 you get 72 again / - 36 18 9 when you divide this by 3 you get 1 so how can you write 
,how many tools 1 2 3 4 and how many threes one to write 64 in index notation with base 2 with base for and with base 8 so first we'll find with base to divide and see you get 2 again 2 so how many tools are there 1 2 3 4 5 6 2 to the power 6 now how can you find with base 4 so you can check how many fours are there we know 2 times 2 4 yeah we can check how many folds are there how many force you can get 3/4 now the base is for 3/4 how many eighths are there 2 times 2 times 2 that's 1 8 2 times 2 times 2 another 8 so how many eighths are there 8 to the power so you can write the same number in base 2 for 8 here example number 1 express each of the following powers of products as a product of powers of the factors of the given product so you can write this 1 as 2 to the power 3 X to the power 3 or you can without multiplication also you can write 2 to the power 3 X to the power 3 this one you have to consider power for all numbers and letters 3 squared a squared + B squared Express 36 x squared as a power of a product so what is 36 36 V no 6 times 6 so we can write 36 x squared - 6 squared x squared now same our to is there so you can take inside 6x so 6x whole thing's squared is 36 X square express a 3 B 3 as a power of a product same power 3 you can put a and B inside exercise 10.1 Express each of the following powers of products as a product of powers of the factors of the given product so power is true you can write 2 to the power 2 and 5 to the power 2 here 
,you can write 3 to the power 3 and Phi to the power trip this one you have to consider all numbers inside with the power 3 11 to the power 3 3 to the power 3 and 2 to the power 3 this one a squared + B Square here consider power 5 this one power 3 4 to the power 3 X to the power 3 and Y to the power 3 so without multiplication also you can write 5 a whole thing's square this means 5 squared and a square 6 P whole thing squared means 6 square I dance p-square 4 y to the power 3 means 4 to the power 3 and Y to the power 3 3 year to the power 3 3 to the power 3 and a to the power 3 2 y to the power 4 2 to the power 4 and Y to the power 4 there to where B 
,whole thing squared means 2 to the power 2 a to the power 2 and me too the power to question number to find the value of each of the following powers of products right each power of a product as a product of powers of the factors of the given product and obtain the value again by simplifying the answer how can you write this one you can write as 2 to the power 3 and 5 to the power 3 consider power for all numbers what is true with the power 3 that's 8 5 to the power 3 5 times 5 25 25 times 
,"5 125 so what is 125 times 8,000 this is thousand yeah you can do this one in another way so if you simplify inside 2 times 5 10 10 to the power 3 you can straight away get that thousand three zeroes there this one 2 into 3 to the power 3 that means 2 to the power 3 and 3 to the power 3 what's to the power 3 8 3 times 3 9 9 times 3 27 so what's 8 times 27 260 what's the other way you can do inside 2 times 3 6 6 to the power 3 you get 216 this one 11 to the power 3 and 2 to the power 3 11 to the power 3 11 times 11 hundred and twenty-one times 11 so what's the easiest way to do I told you you can get it straight away so here 1 and 1 there 2 + 1 3 2 + 1 "
,3 so 11 times 11 or 121 times 11 when you multiply by 11 you can use the short method so thousand three hundred thirty one times eight so multiply 8 times 1 8 8 times 3 24 - remaining 8 times 3 24 + - 26 - remaining 8 times 1/8 + 2 10 so ten thousand six hundred forty-eight what's the other method twenty two to the power 3 this 
,one three squared + 7 squared 3 squared means 9 7 squared 49 so 49 times 9 9 times 9 81 9 times 4 36 + 8 44 so 441 so what's the other way 7 times 3 21 21 squared is 441 this one 5 to the power 3 + 7 to the power 3 part of the power 3 is 125 7 to the power 3 7 times 7 49 49 times 7 7 times 4 28 and six you get 34 so that's 343 so 343 times hundred twenty-five hundred 20 + 5 so 3 4 3 2 times 3 6 2 times 4 8 2 times 3 6 5 times 3 15 1 remaining 5 times 4 xx + 1 21 5 times 3 15 + 2 17 so when 
,"you add it you get 440 2875 this one so what's the 13 squared 2 squared and 3 squared so you have to do separately and multiply 13 square 169 13 times 32 times 2 4 3 times 3 9 9 times for 30 669 x 36 3 times 9 27 3 times 6 18 plus 2 23 times 1 3 plus 2 5 6 times 9 4 54 6 times 6 36 36 plus 541 and 6 times 1 6 plus 4 10 so when you add it together you get 6080 for the answer is 6,000 84 you can do other way around as well 3 times 2 6 13 times 6 78 78 square 78 times 78 how you do that 17 and 8 7 times 7 49 plus 5 51 and here again 8 here eight times eight sixty four and eight times seven 56 plus 6 you get 62 so when you add it 6080 for express each of the following products of powers as a power of a product so same power I can write this is 5 and 2 inside what is 5 and 2 this is 10 squared but this is the final answer so you can write as a product this word five and eleven you can write five an element inside and the power to outside same power 3 so you can write the other numbers inside this one power 2 is there x and y inside same power 3 P and Q inside power 5 a B X insult 100 100 is 110 square so this one you can write 10 times em inside and the power to outside 225 is what's the power 15 times 15 so 15 squared you can write 15 and T inside and other is 2 8 how can you write 8 we know 2 times 2 times 2 2 to the power 3 and now you can write 2 and y inside the outside power is 3 show that thousand X cube is 10 X whole thing cube so you will take left hand side mm excuse what is thousand 10 to the power 3 and X to the power 3 now we know same power you can take that out and 10 into X inside so no need to write 10 times X "
,I can ride technics so this is the same as the right hand side so this is example number one find the value of negative two the powerful we know that any negative number with an even power always positive so you get a positive answer so minus 2 times minus 2 times minus 2 times minus 2 so 2 times 2 4 4 times 2 8 8 times 2 16 is 
,the answer you get a positive answer this one odd power so what is the answer you get a negative answer minus 5 minus 5 3 times 5 times 5 25 times 5 and ran 25 so the answer is negative because the odd power of a negative number is negative exercise 10.2 find the value we know want to the power any number is what depend on the power you get negative or positive odd powers you get negative even powers you get positive so odd power so you get minus 1 even power you get positive but here odd power 3 negative 1 even power positive 1 here positive numbers 1 to the power any number is 1 1 to the power thousand 3 1 1 to the power 2018 1 1 to the power 0 is also 1 1 to the power any number is 1 now this one negative number to the power even you are getting positive so minus 4 times minus 4 that means positive sixty this is odd power you are getting a negative answer what is four times four sixteen sixteen times four 64 so you get negative 64 even power enough you get a positive answer so minus 4 times minus 4 minus 4 and minus 4 that means 64 times for what 64 times 4 6 times 6 times 4 for 24 plus 125 so 256 this is positive minus Phi to the power 1 odd power with a negative number always negative here even power even power always positive 5 times 5 25 odd power you get a negative answer so we got 25 25 times 5 what's the balance 125 but this is negative negative number to the power or power all these negative even power you get a positive answer 10 times 10 that's 100 show that this side is greater than its what's left hand side minus 1 to the power 8 this is even power with a negative number that's positive month right hand side negative 1 to the power 9 odd power with negative you'll get negative 1 so which one is bigger so left hand side is bigger than right hand side so this statement true so minus 1 to the power 8 is greater than minus 1 to the power 9 miscellaneous exercise question number one express each of the following products of powers as a 
,power of a product look at this one same power - is there so you can write to outside what are the numbers inside to excel why so without writing multiplication I can write to X Y to the power two for this one this one power 2 is the outside value because same power 3 a and B is there so you can write 3 B to the power 2 this one same power of 3 what's inside P and 2 Q so when you write in order to P Q to the power 3 same power 3 2 xn 3 by so 2 times 3 I can write 6x y to the power 3 power 3 is the same so you can write power 3 there 5a + 2 B by x - 10 10 a B to the power 3 this one power 3 is common what's inside en 2 B and C so rearranged in order numbers first ABC - ABC to the power 3 sure that this one is equal to the 36 a squared X square so we will take left hand side three years card and 2x squared what is 3a squared and 2x squared I can take as power - because power - is common inside I can write 3 and 2x they what's the next step 3 x - 6 6 a x squared this means 6 squared a squared + x squared so what is 6 squared 6 times 6 36 a squared + x squared so this is same as the right hand side so this is true Khushi number 3 arranged in ascending order of the values 2 to the power 3 what's the answer 2 times 2 times 2 8 - 10 to the power 1 means odd power you get negative 10 negative 1 to the power 10 even power with a negative number that's 1 so you get positive 1 3 squared 3 squared is 9 now arrange this in ascending order means smaller to bigger what's the 
,smallest value minus 10 so we can write negative 10 to the power 1 then the next one that's the smallest value and the next one 1 negative 1 to the power 10 8 is the next number 2 to the power 3 and 3 squared is the largest no so that's how we can write in ascending order take cushion um 2 - 2 to the power 4 this is t1 power you get a positive answer 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 that's positive 16 minus 2 to the power 5 this is odd power you get a negative answer 16 times 2 32 that's negative 
,minus 1 to the power 4 even power you get a positive answer that's positive 1 and on power you get negative 1 so what's the smallest one negative 32 so negative 2 to the power of 5 is the smallest one what's the next one - 1 - 1 to the power 5 third one is 1 minus 1 to the power 4 and the largest one is 16 that's minus 2 to the 
,power if a is a negative integer show that a squared is greater than a to the power 3 okay so here left hand side is a square so a is negative and power is even even power of any negative value is a positive value right hand side e to the power 3 odd power negative value odd power is always negative so which one is smaller negative value is smaller so a cube is smaller than a squared or a squared is bigger than a Q so here we can show that this is so we covered all three related to indices 
,so this is an important lesson for great 10l 11 as well and also great 9 so here as a summary what we discussed here we discuss if ABC and n are positive integers then a B to the power n you can write as separate powers if you take a B C to the power n you have to take separate powers the value of any power of a positive integer is always positive the value of an odd power of a negative integer is always negative and the value of an even power of a negative integer is always positive and also we looked at 1 to the power any number is 1 when you take negative 1 to odd power you get negative 1 negative 1 to even power you get positive 1 so this is the last unit in your first term work so practice this one and try to do the review exercise after this

XAgvD52qgQQ,I'm Stern and welcome to the maths paradise YouTube video channel we present this video to improve your mathematical knowledge because of the present situation of the world we have to stay at home but we can't forget our lessons so stay with us and continue our lessons My dear sir learn today start the lesson in d'azyr's in the 
,previous credits you learn how to write in yourself is numerical values for examples let's see 2 to the power 1 equal to then 3 to the power 2 equal 3 into 3 or we can say 3 east repeatedly multiply 2 times and 4 to the power 3 equals 4 into 4 into 4 and also you learned how to write powers with algebraic symbols also for example X to the power 2 equal X into X Y to the power 3 equal Y into y into y and also know how to write this type of 1 for example 1 2 to the power 2 n to the power 3 B 
,you can expand it 2 into 2 into a into a into a into B ok for the second one I can expand this for the power 3 X Y to the power 2 you can expand it 5 into 5 into 5 into X into y into ah okay can you remember this yes already you know what is this father of product and product of what is power Barak here yes ABC to the power two 
,this is power of product you can convert it into product of powers like this you okay let's do some exercise first one you have to evaluate three to the powerful one can write you the powerful three repeatedly multiply four times that means 3 into 3 into 3 into 3 is equal 81 second one negative 5 repeatedly multiply 3 times that is negative 5 to the power 3 so you can write it negative 5 into negative 5 into negative 5 what's the value when negative 5 x negative 1 accuse the value positive 
,25 but when positive 25 x negative 5 it gives the value negative 125 in that 1 3 over 5 to the power 2 then you have repeated you multiply 3 over 5 2 times 3 over 5 
,into 3 over 5 then you can get the answer by multiplying numerator first then you the answer 3 into 3 news 9 when denominator file into fine give 25 then the second 
,question you had write as product of powers right hands product of powers first one to XY to the power you know these power of product you can write it as product of powers 2 to the power 2 X to the power 2 y to the power 2 then second one a B to the power 3 but there's a bracket and power 3 then all terms within the bracket about 3 so now you can write intercept product of powers like in to the power three P to the power three and the third question you're right does power of product first 125 P to the power 25 you can run it 25 as both - what's that value yes that's five to the power two then you can write it as 5 to the power 2 P to the power 2 then the answer is 5 P to the power 2 then the next one 8m to the power 3 n to the power 3 in and 3 have both of them have power 3 then can you write 8 as power of 3 yes 80 is 2 to the power 3 then you can write 2 to the power 3 m to the power 3 n to the power 3 then you can get the answer to em n to the power okay stir dad now we start the important part of this lesser product of ours with the single base let's see an example to the power n to the power both of them have same base 2 to the power 2 and 2 to the power 3 we have to take the product of these 2 numbers 2 to the power 2 multiplied by 2 to the power 3 okay we have to get yards of this one when we expand 2 to the power 2 we can get 2 into 2 2 into 2 means 2 is pretty tightly multiply 2 times 2 to the power 3 means 2 into 2 into 2 here 2 is repeatedly multiply 3 times solving and we get the product of 2 to the power 2 and 2 to the power 3 we have right to the power 2 as 2 into 2 multiply 2 to the power 3 is 2 into 2 into 2 now they are wrong 1 2 3 4 5 5 2 are there that means 2 is repeatedly multiply 5 times so the answer is 2 to the power 5 now you can see that the value here's our two and three then two is repeatedly multiply five times it gives the answer 2 to the power 5 it can obtain by two last three what is this 2 plus 3 2 plus 3 is their index of 2 and index of this other 2 to the power 2 this index is 2 2 to the power 3 this index is 3 so when we add these two we can get the answer fine so 2 to the power 2 into 2 to the power 3 equal young to the power of 5 the rule we obtain here is we can add these two in remember that we can use this if only two numbers have the same base like this example to the power 5 into 3 to the power 2 as these two powers have the same base we can use Islam 3 to the power 5 plus 2 so now C's 3 
,e to the power now we can get eternal oh we think that the bases fail the power is in how to manipulate this a the index in okay maybe answer e to the power M laughs what other sample its to the power 5 into X to the power 2 say miss so we can add two imbeciles we cannot do index we can beat the answer it's to the power now I think already you have done your exercise let's check you all the power 2 to 5 to the power cell 2 laughs them according to law doesn't point to the former no Josie is fired to power none okay the same BS y then we can write PI to the power 3 plus 5 then the answer y to the power 8 they they are a numerical value it's also 4 & 5 it's not difficult so we can write 4 into 5 to the power 3 into 5 into P to the power 5 now we can multiply these two numerical values for n 5 when we multiply 4 & 5 
,we can obtain 20/20 into P to the power 3 you do e to the power 5 then you can write 20 P to the power 3 plus 5 and Beyonce is to NP P to the power 8 maybe next one 
,there are three numbers 2 3 & 5 2 into X to the power 2/3 into y to the power 2 X into X to the power 3 file into y to the power 5 then we can first we can get these numerical values 2 into 3 into 5 then we can obtain save basis what are the powers have each shall save missiles what are the same bases here X X Y by then X to the power 2 into X to the power 3 let me can write Y to the power 2 into y to the power 5 now you can get the answer to a into 3 6 6 into 5 30 into X 2 X to the power 2 n X to the power 3 to +3 then by 2 + 5 then the answer 30 X to the power 5 y to the power 2 plus 5 self okay now we are going to the next part of our lesson questions of powers with the same base okay X to the power 4 u divided by X to the convert so we can write this X to the power 4 over X to the power T let me expand X to the power 4 you get Q's it's into its into X into X as you know you can cut the same values of the numerator numerator so you can cut X to its next week's then you co 
,mr. X to the power 3 so how you can get the value 3 now already you know as you learned in the product of powers how you can get the value 3 we can subtract 2 from 5 they need use X to the power 3 what is this 5 and what is this - fine comes as the index of the dividend - comes as the index of the divisor when we subtract his - 
,we can read the answer X to the power 3 when the product we add these two index and their support we can subtract these two index so we can obtain the law a to the power M divided by a to the power M so we can get the answer a to the power M - okay no let's go to some example okay now chae-kyung says let's try into the power 5 divided by e to the power 3 5 subtract 3 from 5 that's I can write Y to the power same base Y and we can write the recipe on C is why it's multiplication it's a product so we have to add these two index 5 last to division division means subtraction eons equal Y to the power 5 + 2 7 7 minus 3 4 right by this 8 X to the power 5 divided by here you know we can cut 4 8 2 comes X to the power 5 divided by X to the power 2 n answer X to the power 5 subtract 2 from 5 you see how sir it's 2 2 X to the power a to the power 2 plus three at three to three to two went by a to the power part so you can write a two plus three e minus 1 K to the power five subtract one - into X all these summer vacations so you can add these Phoenix 5 plus 3 plus X to the power 1 and 2 to extruder over 5 X 3 X - 5 3 - you see answer X to the power 3 2 X to the power 10 - subtract P to the my glitch error now I have finish it deserves with the product of powers at the same place and the portion of powers in the same base from my next video you can watch 0 index negative indices and power powers if you like these videos subscribe it and hit the bell button bye for now

B4zejSI8zho,"Hi!  Welcome to Math Antics. In our last video called “Intro to Exponents”, we learned that exponents (also called Indices) are a special type of math operation. In "
,"this video, we’re going to expand on what we know about exponents by learning about their inverse operations, which are called “roots”. That’s kind of a strange name for a math operation, but it will make more sense in just a minute. First, let’s review what we mean by inverse operations. In the video called “What Is Arithmetic”, we learned that inverse operations are pairs of math operations that UNDO each other. For example, you can undo addition by doing subtraction, so addition and subtraction are inverse operations. Likewise, you can undo multiplication by doing division, so multiplication and division are inverse operations. As I mentioned, exponents have inverse operations also. There are operations that can undo them, and those operations are called roots. To see how roots and exponents work together to undo each other, let’s look at the simple exponent 4 to the 2nd power (or four squared). Previously, we learned that this is the same as 4 × 4 which equals 16. Doing this exponent meant going from 4 squared to 16. So now if we want to undo that with a root operation, that involves starting out with 16 and then somehow getting back to the 4 which is being raised to the 2nd power. And do you remember what that part of the original exponent is called? Yep, it’s called the “base”. So doing a root operation is going to give us the base as our answer, and that helps us understand its name a little better. The words “base” and “root” have a similar meaning, especially if you think of a tree. The root is at the base of a tree, and that can help you remember how root operations work. With a root operations, you start with the answer of an exponents and try to figure out what the base of that original exponent is. Okay, but how do we actually do that? How do we use a root operation to go backwards and figure out the base of the original exponent? Well for starters, we need to know about a special math symbol that looks like this. And you guessed it… it’s called the root sign. Whoa Dude! That math symbol looks totally radical dude! It’s… it’s like that division thingy, only way cooler!! Ah yes, that reminds me… "
,"the root sign is often referred to as the “radical” sign (and mathematicians used that term even before surfers did) And yes, it does look similar to the division sign so it’s really important not to get them confused. The root (or radical) sign is different from the division sign because, instead of having a curved front, its front shape is like a check mark. The number that you want to take the root of goes under the sign like this. So when you see a number under a root (or radical) sign "
,"like this, you know you need to figure out the base of the original exponent. In this case, you need to figure out what number you could multiply together a certain "
,number of times to get 16. Ah - but there’s the catch!  How many times? The answer we get from taking the root will depend on how many times that number would be multiplied together. But that would depend on the original exponent.  So how do we know what that number is? Simple… the root symbol tells us. The root symbol actually 
,"includes the original exponent in it. What?  You don’t see it? Oh… That’s because I didn’t draw it yet.  And later in this video, you’ll understand why. So let’s put a little 2 right here above the check mark part of the root symbol. And that 2 tells us that we need to figure out what number (or base) could be multiplied together 2 times in order to get 16. And, if you remember your multiplication table (or if you just look at our original example here) you’ll know that the answer to that is 4. Now do you see how the root operation is the inverse of the exponent operation? When doing the exponent, we asked, “What do we get if we multiply 4 together 2 times?”, and the answer was 16. But when we did the root operation, we asked, “What number could we multiply together 2 times to get 16?” and the answer was 4. Great!  Now that you understand how exponents and roots are related, we’re going to look closer at how root operations work. To do that, we’re gonna change our root problem slightly.  Let’s change the little 2 into a little 4. The first root was asking us to figure out what number we could multiply together 2 times to get 16. But this new root is asking us to figure out what number we could multiply together 4 times to get 16. That’s a bit trickier, huh?  Can you think of a number like that? Yep, the answer is 2, because if you multiplied four ‘2’s together (2 × 2 × 2 × 2) you get 16. So the 2nd root of 16 is 4, but the 4th root of 16 is 2. Both those roots "
,"were pretty easy to figure out, right? But unfortunately, figuring out roots in math can be much harder. For example, what if we had this problem instead, “root 3 of 16” That means we need to figure out what number we could multiply together 3 times to get 16. Can you think of a number like that? [No]  I can’t either! And unfortunately, it’s not easy to calculate what that number would be. Remember, even hough this look a little but like the division symbol, this is NOT just division! You can’t just divide 16 by 3 to get the answer.  Roots are NOT the same as long division. So how DO we calculate a root like this? Well, there are special algorithms that you can use to calculate just about any root, but they’re kinda complicated, so we’ll save those for a future video. Instead, I’m gonna use a special root function on my calculator to get the answer. And on my calculator the button for that root function looks like this. To use it, I first enter the number that I want to take "
,"the root of, which is 16. Next, I hit the root function button, and then I enter 3 so it knows that I want the 3rd root of 16. Last, I hit the equals sign and voila… the answer is 2.519842… and the decimal digits just keep on going forever. Wow!  See what I mean about roots being hard to figure out? That is a really complicated "
,"decimal number and you may even wonder if it’s the right answer.  Well, let’s check… Based on what we know about exponents and roots, if we multiply this decimal number together 3 times, we should get 16, right? But to make it easier to check, let’s just round the number off to 2 decimal places. Let’s make it 2.52. If we multiply 2.52 together 3 times, (in other words if we take 2.52 to the 3rd power) we’ll get: 16.003. Well… that’s almost right.  It’s really close to 16, isn’t it? The reason it’s not exactly 16 is that we rounded the number off which made it less accurate. But the more decimal digits we use, the closer we’ll get to 16. In math, the vast majority of roots are complicated number like this. And they’re hard to figure out unless you use a calculator or a special algorithm. That’s the bad news. But the good news is that most of the time, the roots you’ll be asked to do in your homework or on tests are the easy ones; ...the ones that have nice whole number answers. And usually, you’ll only be asked to find 2nd or 3rd roots of numbers. Do you remember in the last video, we learned that 2 and 3 are the most common exponents. …so common in fact, that they even had special names. Raising a number to the 2nd power was called “squaring” it, and raising a number to the 3rd power was called “cubing” it. Well, it’s the same with roots.  Since the roots 2 and 3 are the most common, they get special names also. The 2nd root is called the “square root” and the "
,"3rd root is called the “cube root”. In fact, the “square root” is SO common that it’s basically the default root and its symbol even gets special treatment. Do you remember that when I first showed you the root symbol, I left out the index number that tells you what root to find? Well, whenever that number is left out, you can just assume that it’s 2. In other words, the root symbol, with no index number, is always the square root. So if you want someone to find a different root (like cubed or 4th or 5th) then you need to include that number so they know which root to find. And even though square roots are the most common, they’re not always easy to find. Most are still going to be big long decimal numbers, except for the “perfect squares”. It’s easier to find the square roots of the perfect squares because their "
,"answers can be found using the multiplication table. On the multiplication table, have you ever noticed that all the answers to problems where the same number is being multiplied together are on the diagonal of the table. In other words, 2x2=4, 3 × 3 = 9, 4 × 4 = 16, 5 × 5 = 25, 6 × 6 = 36, and so on. Well, those numbers are called the perfect squares because they’re the answers you get when you square a whole number. And that means if you take the square root of a number along that diagonal, you get a nice whole number as your answer. The square root of 4 is 2. The square root of 9 is 3. The square root of 16 is 4. The square root of 25 is 5, and so on. See what I mean? Those roots are really common and they’re also easy to figure out if you know your multiplication facts. So if you’re new to exponents and roots, learning the perfect squares is the place to start. Once you understand how those exponents and roots work, you’ll be ready to figure our tougher problems. Alright… so now you know how exponents are related to roots.  They’re inverse operations and they undo one another. And you also know that, just like 2 and 3 are the most common exponents, the square root and the cube root are the most common roots. You also know that finding roots is usually not very easy. That’s important to know so you don’t get discouraged if you feel like it’s hard to figure out what a certain root is. You’re not alone!  We think it’s hard too and would normally just use a calculator to find them. The good news is that some roots are easy to find, like the perfect squares, so be sure to focus on learning them first. And remember, to get good at math you need to actually practice what you learn from watching videos, so be sure to do some exercise problem.

lwdYDwZVo5I,hello children today our next lesson is indies's lesson right what are these indices really you may know what are fractions how to write fractions the decimals the whole numbers likewise you have an idea to write those things so now we are going to write indices index notation right so here i have given you one example this is the way we write the indices when we write a fraction we draw a line in the middle when we write the decimals we keep the decimal point in the middle of the number so in the same way when we write an index in index notation when we write a number this is the way we write one number should be written down as usual and this number 
,in smaller we have written right side of the number in top at the top right side i have written that number so this small number is called the index okay and this down number is called the base remember these two names down number is called the base and this top number is called the index okay so in which situations do we need to use these indices right you may have seen some numbers are multiplied by itself many times for an example here 2 is multiplied by itself many times so we can write this as a as a product no i have written this okay we can write this in concise way that means in short form we can write this okay this is that short form okay that short form is called index notation so mainly for an index number there is a base and also an index right okay how do we read this really we read this 2 to the power 3 or 2 to the power of 3 here i have written how to read it 2 to the power 3 firstly you should read the down number they are after this top number okay 2 to the 
,power of 3 next i told you know as a product when we write a number it can be written in concise form and that concise form is called the index notation right now we will see how to write this as a product by expanding how to write this see this 2 should be repeated 3 times 2 should be multiplied by itself how many times 3 times so here i can write to multiply 2 multiply 2 ah whenever you see a product like this you can write it in index notation in this format okay actually when we multiply these three values what we what we what do we get see 2 times 2 is 4 4 times 2 is 8 the whole value is 8 here so this this is just a whole number it can be written in index notation right okay then here i have given few examples in this table in left side as a product i have shown you some values and in right side in index notation we need to show them okay 2 is multiplied by itself 5 times so what is the number which is repeated here 2 how many times is it repeated 5 times we will write 
,that 5 up 2 is the base 5 is the index how do we read this 2 to the power 5 next 5 is multiplied by itself 2 times so 5 is the number which is multiplied and how many times it is 2 it should be mentioned up how do we read this 5 to the power 2 okay base is 5 the index is 2. next example 7 is the number which is repeated so we will write 7 down and how many times is it repeated 4 times we will write it up so this below number is the base is 7 and the index is 4. how do we read it 7 to the power 4 now you are given two numbers in index notation we will write it as a product by expanding we will write 3 to the power of 2 that means what is the number we should repeat here 3 should be repeated 3 should be multiplied and how many times 2 times next 4 to the power 3 4 is the base 3 is the index 4 should be repeated 3 times by itself this lesson is easy and here you have learnt that this 5 to the power 2 can be can be read like 5 square dou so this can be written in 2 ways 5 to the 
,power 2 5 to the power of 2 or else 5 squared you have learned this okay so when the power is 2 when the index is 2 you can read it in any way that you want in either ways you can read 5 to the power 2 or 5 squared 7 to the power 2 7 squared 2 to the power 2 2 squared both the methods are correct so in the same way when the index is 3 we can read it as 5 to the power 3 or 5 cubed remember that okay 5 cubed we say then this can be written as 7 to the power 3 or 7 cubed next 2 to the power 3 
,or 2 cubed likewise in both the ways we can read so specially remember squared for the index 2 and cube for index 3 there is a special point you need to remember now children as an activity 2 you are provided a table ok we will try to complete that table as an example the first row is completed and given to you but i didn't write here how to read it okay anyhow this is the number given to you i told you that numbers can be written few numbers can be written in index notation okay then this 
,is the number which is written in index notation here this is just a whole number 25 but it is written in index notation that is 5 to the power 2 so how do we read it 5 to the power 2 5 squared both the methods are correct okay so what is the base this down number 5 is the base 2 is the index index must be 2 next 81 this 81 is written in index notation 3 to the power 4 so how do we read it 3 to the power 4 so what is the base 3 4 is the index in this example 64 is written in index for notation like this 2 to the power 6 2 is the base 6 is the index next thousand equals to 10 to the power 3 this is in index notation this is just as a number so the base 
,is 10 and the index is 3 here now you are not given an index notation you are provided the number 243 should be written in index notation okay but you are given these two clues the base is 3 index is 5 so easily you can write the below number as 3 and the top small number is 5. so how do we read this 3 to the power 5 3 to the power of 5 next index notation base index nothing is given but this how to read it 5 to the power 4 and then we know that 5 to the power 4 is written like this so the 
,base is 5 the index is 4. now children we will go to some example questions see the first one uh you are given few examples uh as a product okay by expanding you are given this and we need to write it index notation okay see this a single number can be seen only 3 so we can write this as 3 to the power 3 is the number which is repeated and how many times 1 2 3 4 5 three to the power five next we can see two numbers are repeated two is repeated three times five is repeated two times so we will write these two separately such indices can be there there can be more numbers which are repeated okay 2 is repeated 3 times and 5 is repeated 2 times so what is 
,the relationship between these two this product multiplication only this much then 1 is repeated by itself so 1 to the power 3 it is repeated 3 times that's why i wrote here three next ten is the number which is repeated how many times four times next here also we can see two different numbers are repeated okay three is repeated how many times but you can see three is located in two different places five files are also located in different locations not like this not together they are located it doesn't matter we will take them separately three is repeated two times and five is repeated three times so as a product we will write it index notation next three is repeated two times seven is repeated one two three four 4 times and we will put multiplication mark here next 2 is repeated 2 times 3 is repeated only once so you can write 3 to the power 1 also okay rs without writing an index just even you can write once you write this it represents once that number is there then 5 to 
,the power 1 2 3 next find the value first before finding the value you see these questions are given in words so firstly we will write them in index notation okay they are after we will write them as a product finally by multiplying we will find the value okay see the first one 2 to the power 5 2 is the base power is the index 5 now we will write this index notation as a product 2 should be repeated 5 times by itself 1 2 3 4 5 now we will multiply this and get the answer 2 times 2 is 4 4 times 2 is 8 8 times 2 is 16 16 times 2 is 16 times 2 is 36 32 so as the answer we can write here 32 right next 3 cubed okay whenever you see cubed you should know the power the index must be 3 the base also the base is also 3 here 3 cubed now as a product we will write 3 should be multiplied by itself 3 times right here when we multiply this what will come 3 times 3 9 9 times 3 27 this is the whole number next 5 cubed 5 is the base what is the index cube means 3 okay 5 multiply 5 multiply 5 
,we will multiply this 5 times 5 25 25 times 5 125 right you may not know the multiplication of 5 times 25 times 5 so at that time in the side you multiply 25 by 5 then get this answer okay next 10 squared 10 is the base squared means index is 2 okay then how do we repeat this 10 should be multiplied by itself two times now children by using our usual multiplication no need to multiply with these type of numbers that means when you multiply your number by ten hundred thousand two hundred five hundred like that simply you can count the zeros and get the answer you think like this firstly count the number of zeros there are two zeros place them at the end of the number now what are remaining once i remain in 1 times 1 is 1 why did i teach like that just thank you not only tens and hundreds and thousands are coming you just think 200 is multiplied by 350 okay at this time you better count the number of zeros there are three zeros place them at the end of the number now what are remaining 2 and 35 now you can simply multiply 2 by 35 and place it front 2 times 35 is 70 okay like that next 10 to the power 4 10 to the power 4 10 is the base 4 is the index now we will write it as a product 10 should be multiplied by itself four times here also it's simple how many zeros are there four zeros are there place the four zeros at the end of the number then what are remaining only one's row when we multiply one by itself the answer is every time one only now children see this 
,question evaluate right that means we will find the value of this right you are given few examples in index notation so firstly we will write this as a product they 
,are after by multiplying we will get the answer we will find the value that is the evaluation okay right see the first example 3 multiply by 2 squared 3 is written only once so we will also write it only once then after putting multiplication mark 2 to the power 2 means 2 multiply 2 2 should be written 2 times now we can multiply this 3 times 2 6 6 times 2 12. else you wish you can multiply to the other side also you can multiply 2 times 2 4 4 times 3 is 12 any method is correct next this example right 1 to the power 5 that means 1 should be repeated 5 times 1 is finished now 2 squared 2 multiply 2 3 squared 3 multiply 3 right now children here you should remember when we multiply 1 by itself we get the result as 1 only okay so it doesn't matter how many times you multiplied one by itself the result is what one only so from this we get only one okay so forget about this one for a moment now here in the order you can multiply that means 2 times 2 is 4 4 times 3 is 12 then 12 times 3 36 you can follow this method or else i will teach you another method what is that say children you see two separately three separately so i'm multiplying those two separately okay 2 times 2 is 4. so i joined the line because i multiplied those two then 3 times 3 is 9 then i we forgot about this part no because when we multiply any number by 1 that same number is coming so forget about this now what is remaining here to be multiplied these two results should be multiplied okay so 4 times 9 36 any method is correct okay next say 3 to the power 4 3 should be repeated 4 times now children as usual if we multiply 3 times 3 9 9 times 3 27 27 times 3 
,81 like that we can get or else another method 3 times 3 9 these two i finished they are after these two again 9 that we have finished these two but remain in this 9 times 9 81 so there is another method right as you wish you can multiply next 2 squared 3 cubed 3 times 5 squared 5 should be repeated twice right now as usual when we multiply how do we multiply 2 times 2 4 4 times 3 12 12 times 3 36 then 36 times 3 if you don't know you have to multiply then again that answer should be multiplied by 5 likewise you need to do okay so i'm not going to follow that method as i told you earlier you can multiply 2 separately these three separately all these three then five separately likewise also but here i'm following another method i can see 2 and 5 you know when we multiply 2 and 5 we get what 10 okay in addition also not in this lesson in addition no so we tend to we tend to form tense by adding then it becomes easy forever easy to get the answer right so here also by multiplying we will form tens for the easiest i am taking the first and the last two times five ten so these two are finished now okay next these two two times five another ten these two also finish now now these three are remaining three times three nine nine times three 27 okay then what are remaining has the numbers now all these three original numbers are finished now remaining 27 multiplied by 10 multiply 10 we know that when we multiply by tens we need to place them at the end right so two zeros are there no i'm placing them at the end of the number then here what is the 27 this is easy right if you want if you really want you can multiply from the beginning to the end okay otherwise in this way also you can multiply okay now children i hope that you have an idea about the index notation okay so here we are going to represent a number as a power of a given number right that means now you are given just a whole number okay now you are going to write this number in index notation right so you may remember that we wrote as sum as 2 to the power 3 5 to the power 2 7 to the power 3 likewise we wrote in index notation so how are we writing a given number as a power of another number right that means in this format how do we write it okay simply what you have to do here is they have given us a number here the 
,main number is 16 16 is the number we are going to write in index notation in this format but here they have taken us to get the power as 2 as a power of 2 that means in this way as a power of 2 this is the number given to us 2 ah the base must be 2 here base is given so what should be fine to write in index notation the index should be found the top smaller number should be found how do we write it simply by dividing now children we will divide this 16 by 2 but how in using our usual division long division no downwards only we are dividing i'm writing 16 here and drawing two line segments like this because downwards i'm going to divide dividing by 1 by this number 2 okay 16 divided by 2 what is the answer 8 i'm writing it down ok then again i need to divide this answer by 2 see now the line was drawn little bit right side okay see the same line segments i give like this again we are dividing by the same number given to us 8 divided by 2 answer is 4 again draw two line segments and again we will divide by the same number 4 divided by 2 2 is the answer again we will divide but until what there should be an end up a dividing dividing dividing now without stopping so remember until you get one as the answer you should divide repeatedly okay so here again we will divide answer is 1 right now you may have a problem that if if you got an answer like 7 how can we divide it by 2 it's not divisible by 2 like that you may have a problem but children here when we are given the value here can be given the whole number to write as a power of this one this number has a power of 2 when we write there won't be any answer which is not divisible by 2 so no need to worry about that no need to bother about that if you are given to write this 16 as a power of 4 we need to divide by 4 so any answer when we in the division there won't be any answer which is not divisible by 4 remember that okay then you have provided the value like this right now we got one when we got the answers one stop from there i hope that you understood this now children see this 16 16 is the number we are going to write in this format no before that ah now we can write all these values in left side as a product okay so here 2 can be multiplied by itself 4 times now children the whole number is written as the product after dividing like this now children simply you can write this in the index notation 2 to the power 4 in index notation we wrote as a power of 2 we wrote this whole 
,number okay now the next example is 16. now we need to write 16 as a power of 4 now this number 16 should be divided by what by 4 ah by that to downwards we need to 
,divide 16 divide by 4 answer is 4 then again divide by 4 because the provided number is 4 4 divided by 4 ans is 1 until you get the answer as 1 we need to divide and then stop now children in left side we can see 4 is repeated twice so here the number given to us is 16 here 16 is the number we are going to write in index notation so 4 is repeated the provided number is repeated 2 times then we can write 4 squared 4 to the power 2 in index notation we wrote it next 125 as the power of 5 right then 125 should be divided downwards by what by this provided number 5 right now if you don't know this you can divide you can use long division method and divide 
,125 can be divided by 5 that is your usual division okay or else this is another method okay see one by one look at the numbers and we will divide see number one is 
,one divisible by five no then uh we will go to 12 with two we will see now earlier we so we check whether one is divisible by five it is not so now we will divide 12 by five inside twelve how many fives will be there there will be two fives we will write it down two times five is ten no now from twelve when we subtract ten two are remaining now that remain in one we will keep opposite 5 in front of 5 now what is the number which is from newly 25 divide 25 by 5 5 again now again divide this 
,answer by 5 25 divided by 5 5 again divide by 5 1 is the answer now in left side all these values can be multiplied by itself 5 multiply 5 multiply 5 right then 5 to the power 3 in index notation we wrote this okay now children in common we will see uh some questions okay before that look at these two statements 5 times 2 5 to the power 2 are these two same that means both these statements give us the same idea or these two are different as you think okay most of the time we get confused with these two 5 times 2 means as a multiplication we should write this 5 times 2 just a multiplication okay first number by the second number okay then here 5 to the 
,power 2 it gives us another meaning 5 to the power 2 see answers can be same answers can be same but they give us different two different ideas this is just as a multiplication we need to write this should be written as in index notation okay right here when we multiply 5 by 2 5 by 2 10 is coming here uh 5 multiplied by itself 25 okay right then see i have given three questions in this slide so here we need to check whether these statements are correct or not okay we don't know exactly whether these statements are correct or not how do we check them okay so if you want eight can be written in index notation the problem is we are not given any number to be divided okay so you better get this index notation one and as a product write it and find the answer check whether that answer is equal to this or not okay so in left side i'm taking 2 to the power 3 so i'm multiplying 2 by itself 3 times so we will see 2 times 2 4 4 times 2 is 8 same answer came so the statement is true next here also we will take 3 squared that means 3 multiply by itself only once 3 times 3 is 9 ah here the statement is wrong next left side we will take 2 should be multiplied by itself 4 times 2 times 2 4 4 times 2 8 8 times 2 16 not equal so that is also false okay then children uh in this side another questions another more questions are given what are we going to do there you know the greater than and less than symbols we are going to put those symbols to the spaces given here right that 
,means we need to compare the indices okay see two indices are given still we don't know which one is greater which one is smaller so what do we need to do as a product we will write and we will find the value after finding the value only we can take a decision okay so here 2 to the power 3 to multiply to multiply 2 that means 2 
,times 2 4 4 times 2 8 in this side 3 x 3 answer is 9 which is bigger this side is bigger so here we will put less than mark next firstly we will multiply 2 by itself 4 times 2 times 2 4 4 times 2 8 8 times 2 16 here 4 multiply 4 is 16 same both are equal so we will put equal symbol okay next 3 multiply by 3 3 should be repeated 
,by itself 2 times ansi is 9 but here the value given to us is 6 so this is bigger 3 squared is greater than 6 last one 8 to the power 1 if you can remember while we 
,were doing sums i told you this power one if you want you uh you can remove that power one because this can be written just also when the power is one that value that base can be written as it is also okay not only for this number 2 to the power 1 can be written as 2 5 to the power 1 can be written as 5 okay that means only once 8 is there 8 squared means it should be written twice a to the power one means eight should be written only once so just even you can write so here the value is just eight then there one should be multiplied by itself how many times eight times and i told you that when we multiply one by itself as many times that we want the answer is what the result is every time one only so accordingly this side is greater okay so children this is the main idea about indices but remember when you go to upper grades you may learn some more about indices so i hope that you can understand what i taught during this lesson so now you can engage in new exercises in the textbook and also the miscellaneous exercises also can be done by yourself you

KzfWUEJjG18,"Hi I’m Rob, welcome to Math Antics! In this video we’re gonna learn about how to do math with things that only sometimes happen. They might be likely or unlikely. We’re gonna learn about Probability. Usually in math we deal with things that always happen the same way. They’re completely certain. Like if you add 1 and 1 you’re always gonna get 2. If you multiply 2 and 3 you’re always gonna get 6. There’s no uncertainty at all. But in the real world things aren’t always so predictable. Take a coin toss for example. We can’t predict whether it will be heads or tails. It’s unpredictable or random, and that’s why some people will flip a coin to help decide "
,"which of two things to do. That’s how I make every decision in life Why am I not surprised? Oh no! Good luck But even though we don’t know what each coin flip is going to be, we do know a few things about it. We know that with a fair coin toss that heads is just as likely to show up as tails. The Probability of an event (like getting heads or getting tails) is a value that tells us HOW LIKELY that event is to happen. With our coin toss, since each side is just as likely, and there’s only two sides to a coin, if we flipped a coin a lot of times, we should expect that about half the flips will be heads and about half the flips will be tails. And that means the probability of flipping heads is the fraction one-half and the probability of flipping tails is also one-half. Let’s look at this in a little more detail on something called a Probability Line. It’s a number line that goes from 0 to 1. A probability of zero means that an event cannot happen, it’s impossible. And a probability of 1 means that an event is definitely going to happen, it’s certain. That’s why the probability line only goes from 0 to 1. An event can’t be less likely than "
,impossible and it can’t be more likely than certain. A probability of one-half (like with our coin toss) means that an event is just as likely to happen as it is to 
,"NOT happen. A probability less than one-half means that an event is unlikely and a probability greater than one-half means that an event is likely. Oh, and in addition to fractions, it’s also common to write probabilities as decimals or percentages, since you can easily convert between those three. A probability of 0 is the same as a 0 percent chance of something happening, a probability of one-half is the same as a 50 percent chance of something happening, and a probability of 1 is the same as a 100 percent chance of something happening. Now that you know how a coin toss works, let’s see an example of an event that is unlikely using something a little more complicated than a coin. Let’s take a look at dice. A standard die has 6 sides numbered 1 through 6. When you roll it, any of those sides is just as likely to "
,"come up as the others. That sounds a lot like flipping a coin doesn’t it? Each side of a die is just as likely to come up as the others and each side of a coin was just as likely to come up as the other. So you might expect that the probability of rolling a 3 is 50%. But remember, with a coin toss there were only 2 possibilities: heads or tails. With dice there are 6 possibilities. And that’s going to make a difference in its probability. One way to think about it is that it’s certain that "
,"one of those six sides will land facing upwards, which is a probability of 1 (or 100%) But since ONLY one side can face upwards for a given roll, we have to divide up that value among all the possibilities. In the case of a coin toss, since there were only 2 possibilities, we had to divide the probability by 2. 1 divided by 2 is one-half, (which is the decimal 0.5 or 50%) But with the die, we need to divide the probability up evenly between 6 possibilities. 1 divided by 6 is one-sixth which is equivalent to 0.167 (or 16.7%) So that would be right here on our probability line. That means it isn’t likely that I would roll a 3 for instance, but it’s just "
,"as likely as rolling any other number. And since all 6 numbers have the same probability, each number should come up about as often as the others. To see if they do, I’m going to conduct some trials. That’s an excellent argument. Allow me to deliberate. Guilty! Actually, when dealing with probability, a trial (which can also be "
,"called an experiment) is a process that has a random outcome …like tossing a coin or rolling dice or spinning a spinner. And the outcome of a trial is what happens in that particular trial. Like flipping heads, or rolling a 3. So I’m gonna conduct several trials by rolling a die multiple times and keeping track of how many times I roll each number. Ah ha! You said that each number would come up just as often as the other numbers. But look! There’s more 2s here than there are 5s. How do you "
,"explain that?! Well remember, we’re dealing with things that are random. They’re unpredictable. We can’t know exactly what will happen, just what will happen on average. So now I have to calculate the average? Well, when we say “on average” we mean that the more trials you do the closer you get to the expected probabilities. Keep watching. There. Now that we’ve done a LOT of trials you can see that our totals are much closer to what you would expect them to be. I guess you’re probably right. That’s one of the really important things to keep in mind about probability. If you do just a few trials, the results might not end up very close to what you’d expect. In fact, they could be way off! But if you do more trials, you increase your chances of reaching the expected probabilities. There’s another thing I should point out. Remember, the probability of flipping heads is 1/2 and the probability of flipping tails is 1/2. The probability of rolling a 1 is 1/6, and the probability of rolling any other number on a die is 1/6. If you add up the probabilities for the coin flip, you get 2/2 or 1. And if you add up the probabilities for rolling a die, you get 6/6 which is also 1. And that’s not just a coincidence. If you add up the probabilities of all possible outcomes of a trial, the total is going to be 1 or "
,100% because it is certain that at least one of those possibilities will happen. Let’s look at some more examples. For these examples we’ll use a spinner. If we had 
,"a spinner with just six equally sized sectors, the probabilities would be exactly the same as with dice. So we want a few more sectors. There, that’s more like it. Now we have 16 equally sized sectors. So, what is the probability of spinning a 12? Well, just like with the dice where, we had to split up the 100% between all six possibilities, we’ll do the same thing now, but we’ll split it up between 16 possibilities. So the probability of spinning a 12 is 1/16 or about 6% which is right here on the probability line. We can see that the probability of spinning a 12 is less likely than the probability of rolling a 3. And that makes sense because there are more possible outcomes with our spinner. But what if we color some of the sectors a different color and we want to know the probability of spinning a certain color? Now we have 5 sectors colored blue and 11 sectors colored yellow. So what is the probability of spinning a blue? Remember how with a coin toss, we ended up with the fraction 1 over 2 and with a die roll we got the fraction 1 over 6. In both cases we had 1 as the numerator. And that’s because we were interested in only ONE of the possible outcomes, like the probability of flipping heads or the probability of the number 3 being rolled. But in this case the top number of our fraction will be 5 because any of these 5 sectors will give us the color we want. And the bottom number will still be the total number of possibilities, which is 16 because that’s how many total sectors we have. So the probability of spinning a blue is 5/16 or about 31%. That’s still considered unlikely, but it is more likely than spinning a specific number. And this method will work for figuring out the probability of any event. You just make a fraction with the numerator as the number of outcomes that satisfy your requirement, and the denominator as the total number of possible outcomes. Let’s try the same method to find the probability of spinning a yellow. Our top number should be 11 because there’s 11 yellow sectors. And our bottom number should still be 16. So the probability of spinning a yellow is 11/16 or about 69%. Now "
,"we finally have a probability that’s considered likely. And it makes sense, because you can see by looking at our spinner that it’s more likely to spin a yellow than a blue. And you’ll notice, if we add up 5/16 and 11/16 we get 16/16 or a probability of 1. So that’s a good sign that we did it right. Let’s look at another example. Suppose we have a bag of marbles. There are 3 green marbles, 7 yellow marbles and 1 white marble. If we mix them up and pull out a marble at random, what’s the probability of it being green? Well, the top number of our probability fraction will be 3 because there’s 3 green marbles so there’s 3 outcomes that get us what we want. And the bottom number will be 11 because there’s a total of 11 possible marbles that we could pull out. So the probability of pulling out a green marble is 3/11 or 0.27 or 27% It’s right here on the probability line. That means it’s unlikely. And that makes sense because you can see that it would be less likely to pull out a green marble than one of the other ones. Let’s try this again for calculating the probability of pulling out a yellow marble. This time the numerator of our fraction "
,"will be 7 because there’s 7 yellow marbles. The denominator will still be 11 because there are still 11 marbles total. So the probability of pulling out a yellow marble is 7/11 or 0.64 or 64%. …another example of an event that is likely. …how about pulling out the white marble? Well, the top number will be 1 since there’s only one white marble. And the bottom number is still 11. So the probability of pulling out a white marble is 1/11 or 0.09 or 9% …not very likely. And if we add up these probabilities we get 11/11, or 100%, just as we expected. Alright! So you should have a pretty good handle on basic probability now. You just have to remember to make a fraction with the numerator being the number of outcomes that give you what you want, and the denominator being the total number of possibilities. And we learned "
,"about the Probability Line, and that a probability can’t be less than 0 or greater that 1 (or 100%). We also learned that the more trials or experiments you conduct, the closer your results will get to the expected probabilities. Of course the way to get good at it is to practice. So be sure to do a lot of problems on your own. "

XIsJmSTjTdg,hello children today i'm here to teach you chapter 5 in your textbook that's indices so we'll look at what are indices take this 1 3 into 3 so you need the number how many times you multiply 3 1 2 3 4 5 6. instead of this we can write 3 6 times like this 3 to the power 6. so this one 3 to the power of 6 or 6 power of 3 so we call this is index notation so this is index notation so the number above this three we call the index index is the singular term indices is the plural index and the number here we call that's the base so base 3 and the index 6 3 to the power of 6 write as index notation so base is 9 now 1 2 3 4 5 6 9 to the power 6 base is 10 1 2 
,3 4 5 10 to the power 5 1 2 3 4 base is minus 3 to the power of 1 2 3 so negative 7 to the power of 3 and 0.3 is the base so 0.3 to the power 1 2 3 that's to the power 3. so that's how we write down these terms expanded version to index notation so some more examples 2.7 is the base so you can write 2.7 to the power of 3. one two three four five half to the power of five three fifths is the base now three fifths to the power of 1 2 3 so power of 3 minus 11 is the pace now to the power of 1 
,2 3 4 to the power of 4 here and minus 2.5 yeah i'll put all minus 2.5 that's the base to the power of 1 2 3 to the power of write these in expanded form the other way round eight to the power of three that means eight three times eleven to the power of four eleven four times nine to the power of five nine five times minus 11 to the power of 4 so you get minus 11 minus 11 11 and minus 11 1 2 3 4 and 5 8 to the power of 3 so you can write 5 over 8 5 over 8 and five over eight so three times 
,some more questions minus two point eight three times minus two 2.8 minus 2.8 and another minus 2.8 13 to the power 5 13 5 times 3 four five minus two sevens three times minus two over seven minus two over seven and another minus two over seven three times minus 37 to the power of four that means four times you have to write minus 37 twice three times and four times and three to the power five three five times so that's how we write index notation to expanded form powers that the base is an algebraic symbol so consider a a is an unknown term not equal to zero so what can you write this one one two three four five a to the power five so five is the index and a is the base so why this is cannot be 0 it's not defined now the term a if it's 0 what happens 0 to the power 5 0 0 5 times 0 so a is not equal to 0 any number you can write here so this is a general notation expand this one a to the power 3 a 3 times x to the power 4 x 4 times y to the power 5 by 5 times minus 8 to the power minus a to the power 4 and minus b to the power 3 so you get minus b minus v minus b so three times you have to multiply write in index notation now the other way around so 2 is there but it's not 2 is there but it's just once a how many times 1 2 3 so you get a to the power 3. now when you are multiplying this with a constant coefficient there so you don't write down the multiplication so you can just write 2a to the power 3 2 once and a 3 times this one 3 twice there 3 to the power 2 and how many x's are there 1 2 3 3 x's so how do you simplify this 3 squared 3 times 3 or you can write so no need to expand index notation so 3 square r and x cubed this one five how many times one two three five three times and b only once and a 1 2 a twice so 5 3 times a twice and 1 b so you can write this one as 5 to the power 3 a squared and b you can change the terms all is not important 5 to the power 3 a squared and b write as indices similar to the above 1 2 3 7 to the power 3 x is 1 2 x square this one three squared three twice are there and a twice b twice a squared b squared this one nine twice then p twice and q twice so power two so when you are writing down expressions make sure that the number you write first then the letters 11 3 times and m twice and in twice this one excess how many x's are there one two two x's how many y's one two three three y's and how many z's are there one two two z's write the followings in expanded form now we'll expand all these x to the power 3 x x x 3 x 2 to the power 3 1 2 3 and x squared means x and x two x's seven to the power four means you need to write four sevenths and then y squared y and what 2 squared a to the power 3 b squared 2 twice a 3 times and b twice 11 squared y cubed and z squared 11 twice y three times and z twice some more questions a squared b squared c squared a twice b twice and c twice c three times not twice c three times x cube y and z squared x three times y once and z twice seven p squared q to the power three are seven ones p twice and then q three times and then r once a squared bc a twice b ones and c ones x y squared z x once y twice and z what's finding the value of a power through substitution now we see how we can find the answer by substituting values so you need to find out the value of 2a squared when a equals 3. so what we do you write down this and then you can substitute a equals 3 that means 3 squared now find the answer 2 is there 3 squared means 3 times 3 that's 9. so 9 times 2 you get 18 as the answer find the value of 5 a squared b when a equals 3 and b equals to 5 a squared b now substitute 5 a is 3 i can write 3 
,squared and b equals 2. now find out separately 5 3 squared means 3 times 3 that's 9 times 2. so 5 times 2 10 10 times 9 90. this one 7xy square x equals 4 y equals 
,3. first substitute 7 instead of x i can write 4. instead of y i can write 3. now 7 times 4 3 times 3 9. so what's the answer 7 times 4 28 28 times 9 72 here 9 times 2 18 18 and 7 you get 25 the answer is 252 find the value of 11 p squared q squared when p equals 2 and q equals 1. now we'll substitute p is 2. so 2 squared q is 1 1 squared so 11 2 squared means 2 times 2 that's 4 1 square 1 to the power any number is 1 1 to the power 100 is also 1. so 11 times 4 you get 44. look at the other one a squared b c square so substitute the values a square that means 3 squared b is 2. c squared c squared means 5 square now 3 squared is 9 2 and 5 squared is 25 
,now what's the easiest way to multiply you can't yeah 2 times 25 50. 50 times 9. 450 this one x cube y square x equals half y equals 4 x is half so half to the power 3 y means 4 to the power 2. now when you are taking the fraction power 3 consider for both numerator and the denominator so you get 1 to the power 3 is 1 and below 
,2 to the power 3 what's 2 to the power 3 2 times 2 times 2 that's 8. and here you get 4 square now simplify 4 squared 4 times 4 16 and below 2 times 2 times 2 that's 8. 16 divided by 8 you get 2. find the value of this 36 a b squared when a equals one third equals half 36 a b squared so 36 times a is one third p is half half squared so i get 36 one third is there so this one 1 squared is 1 2 squared is 4 4 in the denominator 2 squared now simplify 4 times 9 36 3 times 1 and 3 times 3. so what's the answer you get 3 as the answer find the value of x cube y over 9 when x is 3 y equals 11. x is three so three to the power three eleven is there divide by nine what's three to the power three three times three times three that's twenty now simplify 9 times 1 9 times 3 3 times 11 you get 33 find the value of this one 7 a squared b c cube it's given a is 3 b is 2 and c is 1. so any power of 1 is 1 first we'll do 3 squared 3 times 3 you get 9 and this is 1. so you get 7 times 2 fourteen fourteen times nine nine times four thirty-six nine times one nine plus three twelve so hundreds twenty-six find the value of this one 16 m squared over n cube when m is 3 and n is 2. now we'll simplify 16 3 squared 3 times 3 9. 2 to the power 3 2 times 2 times 2 that's 8. now simplify you get 8 times 1 8 times 2 9 times 2 get 18. find the value of a squared b squared c squared here we'll change this to b squared here because it's given b square now substitute 4 squared let's be 3 and c 
,2 squared 4 squared means 16. 4 times 4. 3 times 3 you get 9. and below 2 times 2 means 4 so 4 times 1 4 times 4 9 times 4 36 now this is different write the number 
,81 as an index of three so we can divide and see how many threes are there when you take 81 divide by 3 3 times 2 6 and 21 that's 7 again divide by 3 you get 9 divided by 3 again you get 3 and again you get 1 till you get 1 you divide how many threes are there one two three four three four times so how can you write in index notation 3 to the power 4 is 81. right 5 to the power 3 into 5 to the power 2 expanded and as an index of 5 so what is 5 to the power 3 means 3 times 5 squared means 5 
,twice now all together how many fives are there 1 2 3 4 5. so you can write instead of 5 to the power 3 and 5 to the power 2 you can write 5 to the power 5. write a 
,3 and a 4 expanded and as an index notation a to the power 3 means 3 times you have to multiply a to the power 4 means 4 times now count all together how many a's are there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 to the power 7 write the value of x squared minus y squared if x equals 5 and y equals 3. first expand it and now we'll multiply 5 times 5 minus 3 times 3. 5 times 5 25 3 times 3 9 now subtract you get 16 as the answer write the value of a square plus b squared plus c squared if a equals 3. so we write down and b equals 2 and so we need to substitute b b equals 2. so 2 squared and c squared that means 5 square you have to do separately and add it 3 squared 3 times 3 
,nice 2 squared 2 times 2 5 squared means 5 times 5 25 now add all together 9 plus 4 13 25 and 13. just add it 38 is the answer write the value of x squared plus y squared over z if x equals 5 y equals 3 z equals 2 so substitute x equals 5 5 squared y is 3 3 squared over z is 2. now expand 5 squared means 5 times 5 that's 25 3 squared 3 times 3 that's 9. now when you do division first you have to simplify the numerator 25 plus 9 what's the answer 9 plus 5 is 14 and you get 3. so 25 and 9 when you add it 34 and divide by 2 now what's the answer 2 times 1 and for 14 that's 7. so 17 is the answer complete the following table power is given so what's the base they are 3 is the base index is 2 and the value is 3 squared means 3 times 3 9. now we'll do this one base is 5. power is 2 index is 2 so that means 5 times 5 you get 25 2 to the power 4 base is 2 index is 4 so 2 4 times what's the answer 2 times 2 4 4 times 2 8 8 times 2 16 7 square base is 7 index is 2 7 times 7 you get 49 
,6 to the power 3 base is 6 index is 3 6 into 6 into 6 6 into 6 36 36 into 6 260. 11 square basis 11 and index is 2 11 times 11 that's the answer 1 21 10 squared base is 10 index is 2 10 times 10 that's hundreds 4 to the power 3 this is 4 index is 3 4 3 times 4 times 4 16 16 times 4 that's 64. we'll check it at 64. write the value of 3 squared over a4 when a equals to 3 squared 3 times 3 a to the power 4 means 2 to the power 4. now what is 2 to the power 4 we know that you can do it at once 
,2 times 2 4 4 times 2 8 8 times 2 16. 3 times 3 9 and then 16. so what's the answer you can't simplify further you get a fraction 9 over 16. find a if 80 equals 2a now this is aldevera so how can we find out this one we'll take the number and see how many twos are there when you divide by 2 you get 4 here again when you divide by 2 you get what 2 3 times so 8 i can write 3 times this is 2 to the power now we can write in index notation this is 1 2 3 2 to the power 3. now look at this one this is an equation both sides should be equal and same base so you can compare the power so we can write a should be equal to 3 if this is an equation so straight away you can find a equals 3 now another one 9 equals 3 to the power b so what is 9 how many 3's are there divide and see that's twice so i can write 3 times 3 is 3 to 
,the power b 3 squared now can you see same base you can equate the powers so b equals 2. write the number 4 into 8 as a power of 2. so we'll do the separate ones 4. 
,divide by 2 you get 2 into 2 8 when you divide by 2 you get 2 into 2 into 2 3 times now how many twos are there one two three four five so we can write this is same 
,as 2 to the power 5. write the number 9 into 27 as a power of 3 what's 9 3 times 3 27 you get three three times three times three times three now when you multiply these two i can write first you've got two threes and the second you got three threes all together one two three four five five threes are there you can write as three to the power five find the value of 2 squared into 3 squared 2 squared and 3 squared what is 2 squared 2 into 2 that's 4. 3 into 3 that's 9. 9 times 4 36 find the 
,value of 5 squared and 2 to the power 3. you can do 5 squared that means five times five two to the power three means two three times five times five is twenty-five 
,two times two times two that's eight 25 times 8 what's the answer you know 25 times 4 is 100 so you get 200 so 8 times 5 40 8 times 2 16 plus 4 20. so 200 now we'll 
,look at the review exercise in your textbook expand each of the following as a product and find the value of the given expression so what's 3 squared 3 into 3 3 times 3 you get 9. 5 to the power 4 that means 5 4 times 5 times 5 25 again 5 times 5 25 25 times 25 625 this one 2 square that means 2 twice and 3 once 2 times 2 4 4 times 3 twelve six squared six times six five squared five times five so you can do yeah easy way is six times five thirty six times five thirty thirty times thirty so three times three nine and put two zeros so nine hundred question number two write down each of the following products using index notation base is four how many fours are there one two three we can write four to the power of 3 7 is the base how many sevens 1 2 3 4 7 to the power of 4. how many 2 is there twice and how many 3's are there twice so you can write 2 to the power of 2 and 3 to the power of 2. how many 3's are there 1 2 3 how many 5's 1 2 so you can write this one as index notation like that fill in the blanks in the following table 25 means 5 square base is 5 index is 2 5 to the power 2 so this one 343 base is 7 given so we'll check it out divide by 7 7 times 4 28. so 28 and you get 63 so you get 9 here 7 times 9 63 7 times 7 again 7 times 1 so you get base 7 what's the index 3 so 7 to the power 3. so how can you write this one 7 to the power 3 now next one 6 to the power 3 so 6 to the power 3 is this one so what's the base 6 index is 3 now we need to find out what's 6 times 6 times 6 6 times 6 36 36 times 6 6 times 6 36 3 remaining 6 times 3 18 plus 3 21 so yeah number is 260. write the number 16 using index notation with base 2. so we'll take 16 and how many twos are there you get 8 2 times 4 2 times 2 and 2 times 1 1 2 3 4. i can write 2 to the power 4 using index notation with base 
,4 so base 4 means i can find out how many 4s are there how many fours two times two four two times two four so four twice i can write the same thing as if it's base 
,four the power is two example number 1 write down the number 36 as a product of powers with prime numbers as bases so here 36 we can divide by 2 you get 18. divide by 2 again 9. now we can divide by 3. you get 3 and 1. so how can we write down 36 2 into 2 and 3 into 3. i can write 2 to the power 2 and 3 to the power 2. write down the 100 as a product of powers with prime numbers so take hundred and see how many twos are there you get 50. again you can divide by 2 you get 25 now divide by five you get five here again five you get one so hundred i can write as two times two and five times five so what's 2 times 2 2 to the power 2 5 into 5 means 5 to the 
,power 2 exercise 5.1 write 25 in index notation with 5 as the base so what's 25 when you divide by 5 you get 2 5's are there so 5 squared write 64 in index notation 
,with base 2 64. divide by 2 you get 36 divided by 2 again 18 divided by 2 9 and you can divide by 3. how many 2's are there 2 1 2 3 2 to the power 3 how many 3's are there that's 1 2. so you can write 2 to the power 3 into 3 to the power 2. write 81 in index notation with 3 as the base so we'll see how many 3's are there divide 
,by 3 you get 27 divide by 3 again 9 3 again you get 3 and finally one so how many threes are there one two three four so 81 i can write as 3 to the power 4. write 49 in index notation with 7 as the base so take 49 and divide by 7 7 times 7 so how many 7's are there so i can write 49 as 7 squared two sevens are there write each of the following numbers as a product of powers with prime numbers as bases take 18 you can divide by 2 that's 9 divide by 3 you get 3 here and 1. so how can i write 
,18 2 once and 3 twice that's 3 square 24 divide by 2 get 12 divide by 2 again you get 6 divide by 2 that's 3 divide by 3 you get 1. so 24 i can write how many twos that's three and how many threes that's one you don't need to write one two to the power three and three forty-five forty-five you can divide by three you get fifteen divide by three again you get 5 and divide by 5 you get 1 so 45 i can write 3 squared and 1 5 70 first we'll do 63 you can divide by 3 you get 21 divide by 3 again 
,you get 7 and divide by 7 that's 1. so 63 i can write 3 squared and 1 7 72 divide and see first you can divide by 2 that's 36 divide by 2 against 80 divided by 2 that's 9 now you can divide by 3 get 1 so how many 2s 2 to the power 3 and how many threes two threes three square example number one write down each of the following expressions using index notation p is a base how many p's are there one two three so p to the power three space is x and space is y how many x's you get two how many 
,y's you get 3 this one base 2 how many 2's that's 2. how many is 1 2 3 you can write 8 to the power 3 this one how many 3's 1 2 3 and how many m's you get 2 example 
,number 2 expand and write each of the following expressions as a product so m to the power 3 m 3 times p squared q to the power 3 means p twice and q three times five squared and x to the power three five twice and x three times exercise 5.2 write down each of the following expressions using index notation x how many times are there one two three four six to the power four a three times a you can write three times one two three this one you get two letters m to i m how many times not twice 
,one two three m three times in one two three three times this one seven how many times one two three and p twice this question first we'll write down the number one 
,two three seven 3 times and y 1 2 3 4 4 times you can write this without multiplication sign here i can simplify this one m to the power 3 n to the power 3 so this is also possible you don't need a multiplication sign there expand and write each of the following expressions as a product a square a times a two times you need to multiply two p squared two ones and p twice two to the power three and m square that means 2 3 times and m twice 3 squared x cubed 3 twice and x three times x cube y 
,cubed x three times and y three times so you can write like this that's the expanded form example number one find the value of each of the following expressions when x equals 5 so we'll substitute 5 to the power 3 x is 5 and you need to find the value 5 to the power 3 means 5 3 times so what's the value 5 times 5 25 25 times 5 125 3x that means 3 times 5. you get 15. example number 2 find the value of each of the following expressions when a equals 3 and b equals 5 a squared that means 3 squared and 5. what's 3 squared 3 times 3 9. 9 times 5 is 45 this one 2 a a means 3 to the power 3 and b means 5 to the power 2. now we'll do it separately 2 is there 
,3 times 3 times 3 3 times 3 9 9 times 3 27 and 5 squared means 5 times 5 you get 25 so this is easy 25 times 2 50 50 times 27 that means you put a 0 and multiply by 
,5 5 times thirty five three remain five times two ten plus three thirty so the answer is thousand three hundred and fifty exercise five point three find the value of each of the following expressions by substituting x equals 3 3 to the power 4. now do it at once 3 times 3 9 9 times 3 27 27 times 3 that's 81 this one 3 and x squared means 3 squared so this is same as 3 to the power 2 and 3 3 to the power 3 3 times you are multiplying so same thing 3 times 3 9 9 times 3 27 5 and 3 to the power 3. so what's 3 to the power 3 we found 27 so 5 times 27 now 5 times 7 35 3 remaining 5 times 2 10 plus 3 30 so 135 find the value of each of the following expressions by substituting a equals 3. so 2 is 3. so 3 squared so what's 3 squared 9. 2 times 9 you get 18. 2 squared and a is 3 3 squared 2 squared is 4 3 squared is 9 9 times 4 36 7 a squared 7 into a is 3 3 square 7 into 9 you get 63 find the value of each of the following expressions by substituting x equals 1 and y equals 7 so you get 2 letters x is 1 1 squared y is 7 1 to the power any number is 1 7 to the power 3 7 x 7 49 49 times 7 so 28 plus 6 323 this one 2 x is 1 1 to the power 3 and y 
,equals 7 this is 1 2 times 7 you get 14. this one 3 x is 1 y squared means 7 squared so 7 squared means 7 times 7 49 49 times 3 so 3 times 9 27 3 times 4 12 plus 2 14. so 147 question number four find the value of each of the following expressions by substituting a equals 2 and b equals 7 equals 2. so 2 to the power 2 and 7. 2 to the power 2 is 4 4 times 7 you get 28. a b squared a equals 2 b equals 7 so 7 squared 2 times 7 times 7 49 what's 2 times 49 2 times 9 18 1 remaining 2 times 4 8 plus 1 9 so the answer is 98 so a to the power 3 b to the power 2 so a equals 2 b equals 7 2 to the power 3 7 to the power 2. 2 times 2 times 2 that's 8. 7 times 7 49. so what's 49 times 8 72 and 8 times 4 32 32 and 7 39 so 392. this one three a square a means 2 2 to the power 2 b means 7 7 square so 3 2 times 2 4 7 times 7 49 so what's the answer 3 times 4 12 12 times 49 so we will do the multiplication 49 times 12 that means 10 and 2. you multiply by 1 multiply by 2 get 98. so add it together you get 500. so we covered all theory related to indices so you need to remember what's index notation and what is the base and what is the index and when the two powers are connected with the multiplication sign it is the basis of both the powers are not numerical values then it is not necessary to include the multiplication sign so that means something like this so here 2 a to the power 3 so no need to put the multiplication sign a value can be obtained for an expression in index notation with an unknown base by substituting a number for the unknown term so this is an important lesson you are getting questions related to this in your o level exam
,
1_DSMABQZbk,if you are a student and struggling with
,math if Math super difficult for you if math comes in your nightmare then
,you are on a right place because this video is going to change your whole student life
,after watching this video you will be solving that super easily like Albert
,Einstein in the next couple of minute I am going to share with you that mindset
,of every successful mathematician who created history in mathematics that
,mindset is the key ingredient to solve math like a piece of cake I got 97 out
,of hundreds in my 12th math exam and now you will also score obove 90 just by
,learning that mindset which is required to solve any math problem first you have to
,commit something to your self this is very important without this the video
,will be a waste for you now allows you to yourself that math is easy for me yes
,say it again I want to hear you louder more louder no matter who is near to you
,don't feel shy if you didn't do this you will go back to your old life where math
,is like a demon so do not care about anybody nobody is going to come and
,change your life only you can change your life so say this loudly to yourself
,that math is easy for me I can solve math easily Math is a piece of cake for
,me why this is important I will give you answer this is
,important to take off the wrong mindset wrong programming in your mind and
,filling it with positiveness like Math is easy for you once you really believe
,in this then you are on a right track it's not pause this video and go in
,front of a mirror and say this to yourself
,till you believe this from your within from your deepest heart that math is easy for me then play this video I will be
,always here so if you are ready completely ready let's begin first I
,will talk about the most toxic mindset to solve math whenever a math
,problem comes to the most of the people first they get frightened and say oh my
,god this question is so big this question is
,super difficult for me I can never solve this question huh where is the formula
,how I will solve this what will happen blah blah but you now you won't say this
,because you just change your mindset and then suddenly they will open a help
,book in which the solution of that question is already given and they will try to
,copy the solution from there after that they will cram the solution from there
,and cramming math is the most worst thing you can do about your math so
,never cram Math or if they do not find a help book what will they do they will
,find a similar question in which the solution is given and they will try to
,do the same in that question and it doesn't matter that done is right or not
,if the answer is right what you have learnt from that question nothing just cramming
,copying etc so never do this this will only make your math
,difficult for you and the more you do this the more you will get stuffed in
,this because this is like a spider dance so never do this because the question
,will only increase and cramming will not solve this now the time has come in
,which I will talk about that mindset I call it the learning + solution
,oriented mindset in which you focus on learning trying to learn something from
,the question and you focus on finding the solution of that question by
,focusing on the problem you have given first let me give you a tip for solving
,every math problem in your math book first make a list of all the formulas
,which are going to be used in that particular chapter you are going to
,solve this is a proven method to solve math problems if you have a list of
,formulas which can be used in that problem
,this makes math super easy for you so always before starting a chapter make a
,list of all the formulas which are going to be used in that chapter for example
,if you are going to solve trigonometry then make a list of all the formulas
,which are going to be used in it now you will say that I hardly remember any math
,formula it is so hard to remember them and I know but no problem with this
,mindset you will automatically start memorizing all the formulas in your math
,book without doing any effort if you practice what I say now you have a math
,problem and a number of formulas to solve that problem now how will you know
,which formula is right for the problem the answer is to read the problem
,carefully this is the first and the most important step to solve math problem
,most people never do this they never read the problem carefully they do this
,this question is of this chapter they solve it like this I will solve it like
,this I will copy this oh I didn't got the right answer oh no math is so difficult
, for me ask yourself do you ever read a math question carefully ever
,without starting to solve the problem if so first read the question and then
,you will know that formula automatically which is going to be used in that
,problem because you have a list of particular formulas which are going to
,be used in that chapter then do not suddenly start solving the problem first
,think in your mind how will I get from these value in the question to the one
,value of the answer I have to use the formulas which I have what to do think
,use your mind this will make math super interesting it is
,like solving the puzzle game you have given a puzzle and you have some patterns
,and some formulas to solve the problem and you have to get to the answer to the
,goal so how will you solve the problem think in your mind but I have to do what
,I have to change the values I have to change these numbers to this and then
,apply this formula make it super interesting in your mind and then start
,solving the problem lets say you got a wrong answer you try tried again you again got the wrong answer no problem you have to try again
,always remember Einstein said I am not intelligent I just stay with the problem
,longer than other people so the longer you will be with  the problem the more
,chances that you will solve the problem correctly and at last you will get
,the right answer yess you just solved a math problem on
,your own without any help book Congrats now you have to open a helpbook and see if
,your solution is right and learn from your mistake you did in the  previous
,question basically this is learning learning from your mistakes this will
,make your brain more sharper now you just solved a math problem on your own
,what do you think you did ?you made billions of connections in your mind you
,are using a trial and error method and constantly learning from your tries and
,by this you will start memorizing formulas easily because you will take up
,a formula and apply that in your question and this automatically memorizes
,formulas I tried this and all the math formulas just stamps in my mind if you
,practice this that you can solve any question in that chapter remember
,Einstein said imagination is more powerful than knowledge
,if you don't memorize formulas no matter but you should have a mind which is
,required to solve that problem a mind which has full of imagination that how
,you can get to the answer so next time when your teacher give you a homework of
,a question and try to use this method in this method will math super
,interesting for you and it will be like playing a videogame and please do not
,go back to what you were when you open this video because there is no other way
,to solve math more easy than this there are lots of other videos which tell how
,to solve math easily how to become a genius etc etc but there is no other way
,they will give you tips routines etc like I also gave you a routine but
,you have to stick with something something in this video or in any other
,video ok so take a simple thing and stick with it like if you say I do not want
,to do all this from tomorrow just do a simple thing like making a list of all
,the formulas in your chapter this will change something and you just ask
,growing so slow and steady wins the race now you know the way the single key to
,success in mathematics if you follow this getting above 90 is a piece of
,cake for you now let's get something practical we will take a universal math
,problem of seven standards so that everybody can understand it and will
,apply this method to solve that problem if you are a high standard student than
,see how I will solve that problem and apply the same method in your math problems
,this will clear this concept to you more so let begin take a look at this simple
,math question this is the seventh standard math question i took this
,question so that everybody can understand the mindset better in this
,question you are asked to find the volume of the cylinder of height five
,centimeters and radius two cm this this is a cylinder of height 5
,centimeters and radius 2 centimeters for high standard student just assume this
,as a demonstration of that mindset I will apply that mindset in this question
,to find the answer let's say we have a chapter in which we can find two types
,of questions first is the volume of the cylinder and second is the surface area
,of cylinders and we have new to all this and we don't know which formula of
,volume and this formula of surface area so assume that this is happening and now
,we will apply the method to solve that problem so first step is to read the
,problem carefully in this problem we have to find the volume of cylinder of
,height 5 centimeter and radius 2 centimeter for high standard students
,they will say that all this question is super easy this is of volume formula we have to chunk in these values and finds answer but no this is just a
,demonstration take it as a demonstration and use the
,same method in your difficult question so we have these two values first is
,height and second is radius of cylinder now let us write  first what is the
,radius of cylinder radius or cylinder equal to 2 cm and height of cylinder is equal to five centimeters so we have
,these two values and we have to get from these two values to the one value of the
,volume how do we get there we have to use one formula one formula of the
,volume we do what we have to do so first we have to know which formulas is of
,volume at which formula is of surface area so how do we know that see
,what is the area of circle that means all this what is the area of circle that
,is PI R square right so we have the area of circle this and if we
,multiply it by the height which is this then we will have a circle stacked on
,each other to five centimeter height and then we will have the volume so we know
,that this formula is of volume and for surface area tell me the parameter of
,circle that is 2 PI R right and if we have hollow circle stacked on each other
,to 5 centimeters then we will have the surface area of cylinder so we know that
,volume of cylinder is this and we will apply this in our question so volume of cylinder so the volume of
,cylinder which is this formula and we will apply that in our question that is
,PI R squared H so we first have chunk in the value okay so let's chunk in the
,value Phi is three point one four multiplied by r square which is 2 and 2 square
,equal to 4 multiply by h which is height which is 5 centimeter and now this is equal to 62.8 centimeter cube never forget to add the unit after the value in math    
,this is also very important tip for math so we just read the question carefully
,knew which formulas to be applied first thought what we have to do and then did it
,and found the answer and this is how you should always solve a math question hope
,you enjoyed this video I wish you all the very best for your further math
,studies in my next video I will share some amazing tips and some cool tricks which
,will definitely help you to math more easy so subscribe this channel to

bXkewQ7WEdI,"Hi …Rob here with Math Antics. …just wanted to say “hi” to all the people who watch our videos, and say thank you so much for watching and liking and subscribing. I "
,"know we usually don’t do milestone videos, but this seemed like a pretty cool milestone that we just had to mention it. We have one times ten to the six YouTube subscribers! That’s crazy!  That’s awesome! Thank you SO much! Oh wait… You don’t know what numbers like one times ten to the six even mean? Well you’re in luck! We have a video that explains it. In fact, it’s this video that you’re watching right now! Hi I’m Rob.  Welcome to Math Antics. Have you ever heard people use numbers like "
,"that?… 1 times 10 to the 6th or maybe 3.4 times 10 to the negative 8th? Well… those are examples of a way of writing numbers called Scientific Notation. Huh… that didn’t sound quite right, let me try that again. …Scientific Notation… Ah yes… that’s better. Numbers can be really big or really small, right? Like, if you wanted to "
,"count up all the cells that make up your body, it would be a really big number. …something like 35 trillion cells! But if you wanted to measure the diameter of one of those cells using meters, you’d get a really small number. …something like 0.0000005 meters. Not only are really big or small numbers a lot of work to write down because of all the zeros, they’re hard to quickly evaluate and compare. At a glance, it’s not easy to tell just how many number places there are in these really big or small numbers. And that’s where Scientific Notation can really help us out! Instead of using a long sequence of decimal digits to represent numbers, Scientific Notation uses a shorter number multiplied by a power of 10. And it’s always in that form:  some number “…times 10 to the…” some exponent. Here’s an example of a really "
,"long number: One-hundred, twenty-five million. And here’s the equivalent number written in Scientific Notation: 1.25 times 10 to the 8th Wanna see how these two numbers are just different ways of writing the same thing? Let’s start by making a copy of our big number and messing with its decimal point a bit. Where’s the decimal point you ask? Remember that it’s always here, immediately to the right of the ones-place. We just don’t need to show it if there aren’t any decimal digits. Okay, so "
,"what would happen if we shift the decimal point one place to the left? Well, doing that would change the number, right? By definition, the decimal point is always immediately to the right of the ones-place, so shifting the decimal point shifts the ones-place and all the other number places too. And if we line up the ones-place of our new number with the ones-place of the original number, you see that the new number is 10 times smaller. That means shifting the decimal point one place to the "
,"left is equivalent to dividing a number by 10. But, do we want a number that’s 10 times smaller than before? Well…no.  We don’t want to change the value of the number at all. We just want to write it in a different way. Since shifting the decimal resulted in a number that’s 10 times smaller than before, to compensate and keep the value the same, we need to multiply the new number by 10. Making the number smaller and then compensating for that might seem like a weird thing to do, but it will make more sense in a minute. Let’s do that process again. Let’s make a copy of the new number and shift the decimal point to the left again. Since that shifts all the number places, we can align the ones-places and see that the same thing happened. The new number is 10 times smaller than before. So to keep it the same value as "
,"the original number, we need to compensate by making it 10 times bigger. We need to multiply by another 10. And if we repeat that process again… if we make another copy and shift the decimal point again, we’ll see that the number gets 10 times smaller, so we need to compensate by multiplying by another 10. Alright, time out!  We seem to have a little problem here. Each time we shift the decimal point to the left, our number gets smaller. But since we have to compensate with a factor of 10 each time, it’s making kind of a mess! This part is getting shorter, but this part is getting longer! No problem… Exponents can fix that! Do you remember that exponents are a way of writing repeated multiplication? If you don’t, then be sure to watch our videos about them before moving on. Instead of writing 10 times 10, we can write 10 to the 2nd power, and instead of writing 10 x 10 x 10, we can write 10 to the 3rd power. That’s much better!  Now we can continue on. We’ll shift the decimal point again and multiplying by 10 again. But this time, instead of writing another “times 10”, we can just increase the exponent by 1 since there would be a total of four 10s being multiplied together. Let’s keep going with this process of shifting the decimal point to the left and multiplying by 10 for each number place we shift. And we’ll stop when there’s only one digit remaining to the left of the decimal point. Wow!  That’s quite a pattern. Each time we shifted the decimal, the number got 10 times smaller. So, each time we had to multiply by another 10 to keep the value the same. And because we did that, each one of these lines represents the same value. So even though it looks a lot different, this last line has the exact same value as the first one. In fact, it’s just the original number written in Scientific Notation. But, why is it only this last line, and not any of the others? I mean… they all look pretty scientific to me! Ah… that’s a good question. For a number "
,"to be in ‘proper’ Scientific Notation, it’s supposed to have only 1 digit to the left of the decimal. There can be more than one digit to the right of the decimal, depending on the accuracy of the number, but just 1 digit to the left. But why? I mean… that rule sounds kinda arbitrary. It’s not arbitrary at all! If there's more than one digit to the left of the decimal point, that would mean that we didn’t get out all of the factors of 10 that we could have. And factoring out ALL of the 10s "
,helps us quickly determine a number’s “order of magnitude”. Order of magnitude!? What in the world is that? That sounds kinda scary! Order of magnitude is basically 
,"just how many 10s you need to multiply to get a certain number. And when a number is in Scientific Notation, the order of magnitude is just the exponent, because that’s telling us how many 10s to multiply together. In this example, the Scientific Notation says that if we take this small decimal and multiply it by eight 10s, we’ll get our original number. So Scientific Notation is a way of taking a really big number and reducing it down to a value that’s less than 10, but keeping track of how many 10s we would need to multiply together to get the full number. You can think of it as basically just extracting its “order of magnitude” and storing it in exponent form. But why would we want to do that?  I mean… it seems kinda complicated. Well… yeah, but… did you see how much writing it saved us? When we wrote out 125,000,000 we had to write ELEVEN characters, including commas. But when we wrote the same number in Scientific Notation, we only had to write EIGHT characters. What? …not convinced that it’s worth the savings? Well how about this number?… That’s a LOT of zeros to write, isn’t it?! But in Scientific Notation, this number is just 8.4 times 10 to the 31st power. That’s much better! So Scientific Notation is very useful when it comes to writing down really large numbers… or really small ones. For "
,"example, this number is really small:  0.00000095 It’s much less than 1, but it’s not zero. And here’s the same number written in Scientific Notation. Again, it consists of a number that has only one digit to the left of the decimal point which is being multiplied by 10 to a certain power. But do you notice anything different about the exponent? Yep… it’s negative!  So what does that mean? Well, the short answer is that positive exponents show repeated multiplication while negative exponents show repeated division. And since this is a negative exponent with 10 as the base, it means to repeatedly divide by 10. To see how that works, let’s copy our original number and do that decimal-point-shift-thing again. Only this time, we’re gonna shift the decimal point to the right. What happens if we shift it one place to the right? It makes the number 10 times bigger than it was before. There used to be 6 zeros between the decimal point and the '9', but now there’s only 5. Again, we don’t want to change the value, so what can we do to compensate for shifting the decimal point? In this case, since shifting one place to the right made the number 10 "
,"times bigger, we need to compensate by dividing the number by 10. And because of the way multiplication and division are related, dividing by 10 is the same as multiplying by 1 over 10 (or one-tenth) so we can just multiply by one-tenth. OR… we can multiply by 10 to the negative 1, because 10 to the negative1 is just another way of writing one-tenth. That may seem odd if you haven’t learned about negative exponents before, and we explain it in more detail in our video about the Laws of Exponents. For now, all you really need to know is that multiplying by 10 to the negative 1 is the same as dividing by 10, so it compensated for shifting the decimal point one place to the right. Continuing on, if we shift the decimal point another place to the right, the same thing happens… we make the number 10 times bigger. So to keep the value the same, we have to multiply by another factor of 10 to the negative 1. And it you’re wondering whether we can combine these exponents, you’re on the right track! 10 to the negative 1 times 10 to the negative 1 combine to become 10 to the negative 2, which makes sense because we shifted the decimal point a total of two places to the right. And if we shift the decimal point 3 places to the right, we need to multiply by 10 to the negative 3 to compensate. And if we shift 4 places, then we need 10 to the negative 4 to compensate.  …get the idea? And if we continue doing that until the decimal point is positioned so that there’s only 1 digit to the left of it, that gives us the number in Scientific Notation:  9.5 times 10 to the -7 And can you figure out what the order of magnitude of this number is? "
,"Yep… just like before, the exponent tells us. It’s negative 7. Being able to quickly identify a number’s order of magnitude is pretty handy. For example, if the order of magnitude is a big positive exponent, then you know right away that you’re dealing with a really big number. But if it’s a big NEGATIVE exponent, then you know "
,"you’re dealing with a really small number. And if you’re comparing two really big number like these two, or two really small numbers like these two, it’s hard to tell at a glance which is actually bigger or smaller. But if you see them in Scientific Notation, it’s easy to see that this number’s order of magnitude is bigger than "
,"the other’s, which means that it’s bigger, and this number’s order of magnitude is less that the other’s which means that it’s smaller. So now that you’ve seen how Scientific Notation works, and you realize that it’s just a short-hand way of writing really big or really small numbers, let’s break down the procedure for converting back and forth between numbers written in regular form and Scientific Notation. Starting with these two examples in regular form… First, count how many number places you would need to shift the decimal point for there to be only 1 digit to the left of it. For this number we’d need to shift 8 places, and for this number; 6 places. The number of places you need to shift will be the exponent in the Scientific Notation form, but the sign of that exponent is determined by the direction you shifted. If you shifted to the left (because you started with a big number) then the exponent will be positive. But if you shifted to the right (because you started with a small number) then the exponent will be negative. So that gives you the “times 10 to the something” part of the Scientific Notation and to get the number that’s "
,"multiplied by that power of 10, you just take the shifted decimal number and remove any zeros that don’t really need to be shown. There… that wasn’t too hard, was it? But what if we start out with numbers in Scientific Notation and want to convert them into regular form? Let’s do that with these two examples. The first step is to look at the exponent which is the order of magnitude of the number. It tells you how many 10s you'll need to multiply or divide by to get the number in regular form. If the exponent is positive, it means that you’ll need to multiply by that many 10s. In this example, that means that we would need to multiply by a total of seven 10s to get the number in regular form. That would be a lot of work, but we can also just shift the decimal point that number of places. Which direction do we need "
,"to shift it? Well… since we’re multiplying by factors of 10, we need to shift it in the direction that will make the number bigger. That is, we need to shift it to the right. So, we’ll just shift the decimal point 7 places to the right. But as you can see, there’s aren’t 7 digits after the decimal, so any places that don’t have "
,"a digit will just be filled with a zero. There… Our number is regular form is 41,650,000 In this second example, the exponent is negative, which means that we’ll need to divide by that number of 10s to get the number in regular form. Again, we could just do that division, or we can shift the decimal point to save time. Since dividing by factors of 10 make a number smaller, we’ll need to shift the decimal point in the direction that results in a smaller number… that is, to the left. Since our exponent is negative 5, we’ll shift the decimal point 5 places to the left. And any places that we shift past that don’t already have a digit in them will get filled with a zero. We’ll also put a zero in the ones-place since that’s always good form for decimal numbers. There… Our number in regular form is 0.0000109 Alright… that’s the basics of Scientific Notation. It’s may seem a little confusing at first, but as you get more experience with it, it makes a lot of sense. And when it comes to writing really big or really small numbers, it’s totally worth it. And even if you understand how Scientific Notation works, it may take some practice to get good at converting back and forth between it and regular form, so be sure to practice on your own.

YompsDlEdtc,"What do Euclid, twelve-year-old Einstein, and American President James Garfield"
,have in common? They all came up with elegant
,"proofs for the famous Pythagorean theorem, the rule that says for a right triangle, the square of one side plus"
,"the square of the other side is equal to the square of the hypotenuse. In other words, a²+b²=c². This statement is one of the most"
,"fundamental rules of geometry, and the basis for practical applications, like constructing stable buildings"
,"and triangulating GPS coordinates. The theorem is named for Pythagoras, a Greek philosopher and mathematician"
,"in the 6th century B.C., but it was known more than a"
,thousand years earlier. A Babylonian tablet from around 1800 B.C.
,lists 15 sets of numbers that satisfy the theorem. Some historians speculate
,"that Ancient Egyptian surveyors used one such set of numbers, 3, 4, 5,"
,to make square corners. The theory is that surveyors could stretch
,a knotted rope with twelve equal segments to form a triangle with sides of length
,"3, 4 and 5. According to the converse"
,"of the Pythagorean theorem, that has to make a right triangle, and, therefore, a square corner. And the earliest known"
,Indian mathematical texts written between 800 and 600 B.C. state that a rope stretched across
,the diagonal of a square produces a square twice as large
,as the original one. That relationship can be derived
,from the Pythagorean theorem. But how do we know
,that the theorem is true for every right triangle
,"on a flat surface, not just the ones these mathematicians"
,and surveyors knew about? Because we can prove it. Proofs use existing mathematical rules
,and logic to demonstrate that a theorem
,must hold true all the time. One classic proof often attributed
,to Pythagoras himself uses a strategy called
,proof by rearrangement. Take four identical right triangles
,with side lengths a and b and hypotenuse length c. Arrange them so that their hypotenuses
,form a tilted square. The area of that square is c². Now rearrange the triangles
,"into two rectangles, leaving smaller squares on either side. The areas of those squares"
,are a² and b². Here's the key. The total area of
,"the figure didn't change, and the areas of the triangles"
,"didn't change. So the empty space in one, c² must be equal to"
,"the empty space in the other, a² + b². Another proof comes from a fellow Greek"
,mathematician Euclid and was also stumbled upon
,"almost 2,000 years later by twelve-year-old Einstein. This proof divides one right triangle"
,into two others and uses the principle that if the
,"corresponding angles of two triangles are the same, the ratio of their sides"
,"is the same, too. So for these three similar triangles, you can write these expressions"
,"for their sides. Next, rearrange the terms. And finally, add the two equations"
,"together and simplify to get ab²+ac²=bc², or a²+b²=c². Here's one that uses tessellation, a repeating geometric pattern"
,for a more visual proof. Can you see how it works? Pause the video if you'd like some time
,to think about it. Here's the answer. The dark gray square is a² and the light gray one is b². The one outlined in blue is c². Each blue outlined square
,"contains the pieces of exactly one dark and one light gray square, proving the Pythagorean theorem again. And if you'd really like"
,"to convince yourself, you could build a turntable"
,with three square boxes of equal depth connected to each other
,around a right triangle. If you fill the largest square with water
,"and spin the turntable, the water from the large square"
,will perfectly fill the two smaller ones. The Pythagorean theorem has more
,"than 350 proofs, and counting, ranging from brilliant to obscure. Can you add your own to the mix?"

OFAEx8FTNjA,hello children today i'm here to teach you chapter 14 in your textbook that's types of numbers and number patterns in this lesson we are identifying odd numbers even numbers prime composite numbers square numbers triangular numbers and also we are identifying number patterns formed by the above types of numbers look at these digits 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9. what are those we call these are digits in hindu arabic number system so 0 to 9. now we'll look at what are even numbers 2 4 6 8 10 12 14. look at the last digit the last digit of any one number is 2 4 6 8 or 0. for any large number the last digit is 0 2 4 6 8 then these numbers are called even numbers the last digit of above numbers are even numbers so therefore numbers are even any even number is divisible by 2 without a remainder so what's the rule in even numbers you look at the last digit if the last digit is 0 2 4 6 8 like that even numbers not not the other numbers 1 3 5 7 not those then these numbers are called even numbers and it is divisible by 2 without a remainder select and underline even numbers from the given numbers so how we identify look at the last digit if the last digit is 0 2 4 6 8 then that's an even number so this is an even number last digit is 8 even number this is not 6 is an even number this is not 0 yes it's an even number and here's 0 it's an even number 4 yes it's an even here last digit is 4 and here last digit is 8. so that means these are even numbers look at this one 1 3 5 7 9 11 30 other numbers not even numbers when dividing these numbers by 2 always you get a remainder 1 if a number divide by 2 and the remainder is 1 these are called odd numbers so remember the term odd if the last digit of any number is odd the whole number is an odd number above numbers are odd as the last digit is odd so look at 
,the last digit and if it's an odd number the whole number is an odd number select and underline odd numbers from the given numbers 5 is the last digit it's an odd number here 9 is an odd number but 6 even 5 years it's an odd number it's an odd number here 4 it's an even this one is an odd number nine is odd that means the whole 
,thing is odd one is odd whole thing is all or number but zero is an even number so you have look at the last digit if the last digit is an odd number the whole thing is an odd number write down all odd numbers in between 20 and 30. so starting from 21 then 23 25 27 29 so all numbers in between 20 and 30. write down all odd numbers in between 30 and 38 so starting from 31 you can write 31 33 35 37 so those are odd numbers write down all even numbers in between 21 and 31 so 22 because last digit is 2 24 26 28 and we can write 30 as well because in between 21 and 31 write down all even numbers in between 50 and 60. in between means we can't take 50. so we can start with 52 54 56 50 8 and you can't write 60 in between means you can't write down all even numbers in between 45 and 55 so starting from 46 46 48 50 52 64. 
,those are even numbers look at these numbers separate odd and even numbers from the following set of numbers we'll start from the first one last digit is 8 that's an even 738 second one is 271 last digit is 1 that's an odd number 357 odd number last digit is 7. this one is an even number 2440. 3157 that's an odd number 2668 that's an even number then here four thousand three hundred twenty four that's an even number six hundred and sixty it's an even number two thousand five or no this 1743 is an odd number here 2480 that's an even number the other one is last one is an odd number 3241 that's an odd number because the last digit is one take three digits one at a time and write five three digit numbers that are odd and that are even take three digits one at a time so you can't repeat the same digit and write five three digit numbers odd so you can start with last digit one so i can write any number 821 then i can put last digit 3 643 last digit 5. 705 then last digit 7 817 last digit 9 okay right 279 so you have to only think about last stitch last digit and be 1 3 5 seven nine for odd numbers even numbers you have can start with two last digit two five hundred and twelve last digit four three 354 last digit 6 126 last digit 8 978 1 2 three four another one last digit is zero 120 so you can think of 
,any number but only thing you have to consider the last digit addition of odd numbers look at these odd numbers one and three one plus three you get four three plus 
,five eight and you add 21 and 7 you get 28 37 and 31 you get 68. this one 25 and 27 5 plus 7 12 and you get 52 5 and 3 8 4 plus 3 7 78 look at carefully when adding 
,two odd numbers the answer is an even number so remember when you add any two odd numbers you get always an even number now we are adding three odd numbers plus three four four plus five nine three plus five eight eight plus seven fifteen seven plus three ten ten eleven one remaining 41 this one 9 and 11 20 27 5 plus 3 8 8 plus 
,1 9 here and 100 6 times 6 plus 6 plus 6 18 189 this one 10 11 1 remaining 2 3 4 41 now what happened 9 15 41 27 all these are odd numbers when adding three odd numbers you always get an odd number now adding four numbers three plus one four four plus five nine nine plus seven sixty eight eight plus seven fifteen fifteen plus nine twenty-four eleven plus nine twenty 20 and 10 30 here 11 plus 9 20 25 28 11 plus 9 20 33 33 plus 7 40. here 11 plus 9 20 33 and 34 when you add four odd numbers you always get an even number so remember to what numbers and addition you get an even now three odd numbers you get an odd number and four odd numbers when you add you get an even number according to previous information we see odd numbers of odd numbers addition you get an odd number even number of odd numbers addition get an even number addition of even numbers now now we are trying to find out what happens when you add even numbers 2 plus 4 6 6 plus 10 16. these all are even numbers 8 plus 12 you get 20 6 plus 18 you get 24 20 plus 12 you get 32 and here you get 44 so when adding two even numbers always it's an even number now we let three times even numbers three times ten plus two twelve eight plus six fourteen plus four eighteen here eighteen 18 plus 6 20 4 this one 18 and 12 you get 30 30 plus 8 38 this one 12 plus 10 22 22 plus 4 26 10 plus 8 80. now what happens still you get an even number 12 18 24 all are even numbers so when adding three one numbers always get an 
,even number four even numbers adding 10 and another 10 that's 20. here you get 20 and 30 44. this one 8 and 12 20 and 30 and 6 36 this one 22 plus 10 let's see 32 32 plus 2 34 34 plus 4 38 this one when you add 14 and 16 you get 30. here also you get 20 30 plus 20 that's 50 here 20 plus 8 28 and here 10 28 plus 10 38 so when you are adding four even numbers so you get an even number so remember when you add any number of even numbers you get the answer as an even number according to the previous information what we can say odd number of even numbers addition also even number even number of even numbers addition also you get even number so therefore even numbers or odd number of even numbers addition get always even number now we'll see when you subtract what will happen so subtraction of odd numbers both are odd numbers when subtracting odd numbers from an odd number 7 minus 3 you get 4 5 minus 1 4 this one 9 minus 1 8 5 minus 4 y 7 minus 1 7 0 2 minus 1 1. this one 6 you're 
,getting 31 minus 25 here 3 minus 1 2 6 minus 4 2 20 2 so what are the answers all are even numbers so when subtracting odd number from an odd number the answer is an even number this one 21 minus 10 first number is odd second number is even so what happens 1 and 1 11 35 minus 8. seven and two twenty seven nine minus four five thirty one minus twenty you get 11. this one you get 1 here 7 minus 8 so 17 minus 8 9 and this becomes 3 minus 2 1 53 minus 50 that's 3. now look at all the answers all are odd numbers so when subtracting even number from an odd number answer is an odd number look at this one 10 minus 3 you get 7 28 minus 21 what you get 7 50 minus 25 25 38 minus 31 get 7 28 minus 23 that's 5 40 minus 15 25 so when subtracting odd number from even number answer is an odd number so this is an even number subtracting odd number answer you get is an odd number subtraction of even numbers even number even number subtracting what happens 16 minus 10 that's 6 28 minus 8 38 minus 36 that's 2 24 minus 10 you get 10 30 minus 20 10 88 minus 70 you get 18. now what are the answers those are all even numbers when subtracting even number from an even number answer is an even number now we'll see what happens when you multiply three times five both are odd numbers multiplication three times five fifteen seven times one seven nine times three twenty-seven eleven times nine ninety-nine twenty-one times three you get sixty-three five times five twenty-five all the answers 
,are odd numbers multiplying two odd numbers answer is an odd number now odd number with an even number multiplication five times two ten seven times four twenty-eight eleven times ten hundred and ten nine times six fifty-four three times 20 60 and 71 times 10 710 now what happens when you multiply one odd number and one even number answer is always an even number multiplication of even numbers 8 times 2 16 4 times 6 24 10 times 4 40 3 times 4 12 4 times 7 20 8 11 times 8 88 now the answer is always even so when multiplying two even numbers you get even number so previously we found out odd number multiplied by even number that's also even so what can you say about when you multiply even numbers with any number or dot even answer is an even number identify where the answer is odd or even only by looking at the last digit without adding numbers only last digit 1 3 5 edit 8 plus 1 9 last digit is 9 you get odd number one three four four plus seven eleven last digit is one you get a number seven plus three ten ten plus one eleven that's an odd number five plus three eight eight plus three eleven that's an odd number this one seven plus 3 10 
,10 plus 9 19 9 is the last digit that's an odd number identify whether or even numbers by looking at the last digit without adding numbers only by looking at the last digit all these are even numbers 2 plus zero two two plus four six that's an even number four plus two six six plus eight fourteen two plus four six six plus eight fourteen fourteen plus two sixteen that sense even numbers those are these digits 2 and 8 10 14 16 even numbers then 3 plus 4 7 7 plus 8 you get 15 that's an odd number this one two plus eight ten ten plus two 12 even number so you are getting even numbers as well as odd numbers here one odd number and two even here all even so depend on how many times you are adding identify whether answer is odd or even without multiplying numbers so what can you say when you multiply any two even numbers you get even number this is even this is even you get even numb or numbers multiplication what you get five and three five times three fifteen you got odd number so odd and odd odd numbers this is even even even multiplication you get even number odd and odd you get odd number order never we found out when you multiply by any 
,number by even number you get even so even even number with odd number you get prime numbers and composite numbers what are prime and composite numbers take 12 you can write 1 into 12. 12 again you can write two into six two times six three times four so we call these are factors of twelve one two three four six twelve so how many factors for 12 6 factors are there so we'll see another number one one how can you write one times 1 only 2 2 times 1 or 1 times 2 same thing so how many factors 
,are there number of different factors you get 1 here 2 times 1 how many factors are there 2 3 times 1 again number of different factors 2 4 you can write 1 times 4 as well as 2 times 2 so how many factors are there 1 2 3 factors are there when you take 6 how many factors are there you get 1 2 3 4 4 factors are there because you 
,can write 6 as 1 times 6 2 times 3. now we'll take these numbers 2 means 2 times 1 3 means 3 times 1 5 5 times 1 so all these numbers got two different factors so what are the two factors 1 is 1 factor and the number itself is another factor so when you have factors 1 and the number itself we call those are prime numbers so 2 3 
,5 7 11 13 those are prime numbers what about 1 you get 1 and 1. so 1 has only one factor and 1 is not a prime number if you have 2 factors 1 and the number itself we call those a prime number so one is not a prime number identify prime numbers there's another method what are the rules circle one so one is not a prime so we'll circle it except two cross out multiples of two two times two four two times three six 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 all multiples of two i'm crossing out all multiples of two then except three cross out all multiples of three except three three times two six three times three nine three times four twelve three times five fifteen three times six eighteen three times seven 21 then 24 27 30 32 30 and 33 3 times 11 36 39 and then 42 45 48. so those are multiples of 3. now the next one except 5 cross out all multiples of 5 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50. now accept 7 cross out all multiples of 7 7 14 then you get all the other crossed out 7 times 7 49 now what are the other numbers 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47 all these are prime numbers so get all prime numbers less than 50. so what are prime numbers less than 50 i can write down 2 3 5 7 11 30. then 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 and 47 so those are prime numbers less than 50. prime numbers less than 50 so all these are prime numbers so 
,when you take any prime number take 31 you can only write with two factors 1 and number itself if you take 41 that's also 1 times 40 one only no other factors that's how you find out prime numbers now let's take four four means one times four or two times two six is one times six two times three eight one times eight two times four nine one times nine three times three above four six eight nine numbers have more than two factors here one two three three factors are there one two three four 
,four factors up one two three four factors here one two three three factors so more than two factors are there so these are called composite numbers so what is composite means when you get factors more than 2 if it's factors only 2 with 1 and the number itself those are prime not prime numbers are called composite numbers write 
,down first 20 composite numbers so you can't write 1 because 1 has only one factor so 2 3 4 4 is the first number 5 you can't write 6 7 can't 8 9 10. 11 12 13 can't 
,14 15 16 17 you can't 18. then 18 19 yukon 20 21 22 23 24 you can 25 26 20 7 28 see how many numbers we wrote 1 2 3 4 5 six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen another two twenty nine we can't thirty and thirty one you can't thirty two so those are first 20 composite numbers write down a prime number which is only one even number that's only 2 2 is prime that's the only even number write down prime numbers in between 20 and 30 21 no 22 no 
,23 is a prime number 24 no 25 no 26 27 28 29 is another prime number write down prime numbers in between 30 to 60 31 is a prime number 32 33 34 35 36 37 is a prime number 38 39 40 41 is a prime number 42 43 again 44 45 46 47 is another prime number 48 49 50. 51 you you can divide by 3 52 53 is a prime number 54 55 56 57 57 again can we divide yes divisible by 3 57 when you divide by 3 3 times 1 3 for 27 9 so it's divisible you can't write 57 58 59 is a priority so not divisible by any other number so those are prime numbers in between 30 and 60. write down all composite numbers in between 21 and 31 so 22 is a composite now 23 yukai 24 25 26 27 28 29 you can't 30. so those are composite numbers which those numbers have more than two factors identify prime and composite numbers from the given numbers 23 is a prime number 38 it's a composite number you can divide by 2. 43 is a prime number 51 is composite 57 you can divide by 3 so that's a composite one 60 composite 63 you can divide by 3. it's a composite twice 78 divisible by 2 79 can we divide by 3 you can't so that's 79 is a prime number 47 is a prime number 84 is composite and 37 is also price so that's how we identify prime numbers and composite numbers now we'll look at what are square numbers so one when you take one you can make a square like 
,this so that's a square four two by two you can make a square three by three you get nine so again another square four by four again this is a square you get sixteen circles inside so one times one one two times two two into two you get four three times three nine four times four sixty so when you take the next diagram that's five by five so five times five twenty-five six times six seven times seven 8 times 8 so you multiply the number itself above numbers are arranged in a square number of rows are equal to number of columns these numbers are called square numbers so here 1 times 1 2 times 2. so here 9 times 9 81 is a square number 10 times 10 100 is a square number so number of rows and number of columns are equal look at this pattern now we know 1 4 9 16 25 are square numbers one you can take as one four one plus three nine you can create like one plus three plus five you get nine sixteen one plus three plus 5 plus 7 9 plus 7 60 then 16 plus 9 you get 25 now we see the pattern how can you get square numbers when you add odd numbers you get the square numbers from first odd number get first square number from first two odd numbers you get the second square number from the first three odd numbers you get the third square number find the fifth square number what's the fifth square number so fifth square number is one plus three you are adding five odd numbers one two three four five so what's the fifth square number four four plus five nine nine plus nine 18 18 plus 7 what's 18 plus 7 25 so that's 25 so fifth one is fifth square number you can get it from adding first 5 odd numbers 10 square number how you get 10 square number is 10 times 10 that's 100 or you can say fifth square number is 5 times 5 also now we'll try to find out the pattern for this one 10 square number 10 100 means 10 times 10 that's the 10 square number is you need to add 10 odd numbers 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10. now when you take this and this what you get 19 plus 1 20 3 plus 17 also 20 5 plus 15 you get 20 7 plus 13 20 and 9 plus 11 20. now what can you say about this one we can say 25 times two three four five so twenty times five is hundred so that's another way of identifying square numbers now we look at what are triangular numbers you can make a triangle one is the lowest triangle number then you can make a triangle with three then with 6 when you add all these circles you get 6 circles so the next triangular number is 10 so first triangular number one you can write as one second triangular number three you can write as one plus two third triangular number six one plus two three three plus three six four triangular number ten so one plus two three three plus three six six plus four you get ten so fifth triangular number fifteen how you get one plus two three three plus three six six plus four ten ten plus five fifteen so can find the triangular numbers using counting numbers so if you want second one you take two numbers one two if you want fifth one two three four five so counting numbers adding you get the triangular numbers now look at this one what is this 1 2 6 6 triangular number so you get 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4 plus 5 plus 6 you get 7 2 plus 5 also 7 3 plus 4 also 7. so sum of numbers 1 to 6. so what's the value 7 you get 3 times so 7 3 times you get 21. so that's the sixth triangular number adding 1 to 6 counting numbers this one this is 1 to 10 10th triangular number 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus like that 
,so how many times you are getting this so sum of 1 to 10 is what what you get 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus like that you get how many times 5 times 11 you get 5 times that's 55 so that's the tenth triangular number can we rewrite this in another way think about that 11 is there 11 i can write 10 plus 1 and 5 i can write 10 divided by 2 
,what's that think about it tenth triangular number ten and eleven divide by two what about sixth triangular number six and seven divided by two so we'll try to find 
,out a pattern now we'll see adding 100 means that's hundredth triangular number so we'll try to find out what's the hundredth triangular number one plus hundred that's hundred and one two plus ninety-nine that's also hundred three plus ninety-eight hundred one so sum of numbers 1 200 is you get 101 how many times you are getting you will get that's 50 times so 50 times can you remember the pattern we observed before so 10 divided by 2 yeah if it's 10th one so likewise 50 how you get 100 divided by 2 so 100 into 50 so 101 into 50 so what's that number zero five times one five zero five so hundredth triangular number you can get it from this 100 into 101 divided by 2 so 50 times 101 you get 5000 50 is the 100th triangular number so you can find any triangular number by using this formula if it's hundreds hundred into hundred and one divide by two fifteenth triangular number fifty into fifty one divide by two now look at sum of numbers 1 to 40 that means 40th triangular number so we can say 1 to 40 what's the pattern we found 40 into 41 divided by 2 so you get 2 times 20 20 times 41 0 2 times 1 2 2 times 4 8 820 is the 40th triangular number then sum of numbers 1 to 20 means 20th triangular number so 20 times 21 divided by 2. so you get 10 210 so 210 is the 20th triangular number sum of numbers 1 to 50 means 50th triangular number so 50 times 51 divided by 2. so you get 25 here 25 times 51 25 and 5 times 1 5 5 times 5 25 so when you add it you get 1275 that's the 
,50th triangular number so mathematician carl frederick gauss introduced how to find the sum of numbers from one to any number observing above pattern so sum of any number you can use this formula so if you want 75th 1 to 75 adding all numbers 75 into 76 divided by 2 so what's the sum of 1 to 10. you know that 10 to 11 divided by 2 now so 2 times 5 11 times 5 55 so what is 1 to 20 all counting numbers adding up to 20 that's 20 into 21 divided by 2 that's 10 times 21 210 then what's the addition of 1 to 40 counting numbers 40 into 41 divided by 2. so you get 0 2 times 1 2 2 times 4 8 then 1 to 60. so that means 60 into 61 divided by 2 2 times 30 0 3 times 1 3 3 times 6 18 830. so using above method any triangular number can be found easily so this means 10th triangular number this is 20th this 40th triangular number and the other one is 60th triangular number find the 30th triangular number that means 1 to 30 counting numbers addition that's 30 into 31 over 2. so 15 times 31 multiplication 10 and 5 5 times 1 5 5 times 3 15 465 is the 30th triangular now find the 16th triangular number that means addition of 1 to 16. so that means 16 into 17 divide by 2 8 times 17 8 times 7 56 8 times 1 8 plus 5 30. so 136 is the 16th triangular number 1 to 10 10th triangular number 10 into 11 divided by 2 55 1 to 20 20th triangular number so 20 times 21 divided by 2 200 steps 1 to 40 addition that's the 40th triangular number multiplied by two put zero two times one two two times four eight then one two hundred this is hundredths triangular number 100 in 201 divided by 2 2 times this one 50. so put 5 0 and multiplied by 5 5 0 5 5 000 50 is the 100th triangle enough now we look at the exercises and examples in your textbook example number one write whether each number below is an even number or an odd number last digit is eight that's even last digit is 3 that's all last digit is 2 that's even and last digit is 7 that's what 100 last digit is 0 that's even 351 last 
,digit is 1 that's odd one last digit is one that's odd exercise fourteen point one copy the table below and complete it number even or odd first two you it's already done one is an odd two is even three is odd four is even five odd six even seven odd nine e seven odd eight even nine odds ten even eleven odd twelve even thirteen 
,odd fourteen eight fifteen odd and 16 even 17 odd 18 even and 19 and then 20 even from the numbers given below choose the even numbers write them in the first row of the table below choose the odd numbers and write them in the second row 6 isn't c 1 up 7 is an odd number 21 is odd 24 is evil 30 even 35 what 62 even 70 even 59 that's an odd number 100 that's even 87. that's an odd number 71 is an odd number 93 is an odd number and 94 is an even number question number three state whether the 
,answer of each of the following expressions is even or odd without solving so what we can do just check the last digit 2 plus 1 that's 3 so you get an odd number 3 and 7 let's check 10 means 0 is the last digit even number now when you subtract 12 minus 5 that's 7 7 is and eight plus four twelve let's send even numbers eleven minus 7 4 that's an even number so by looking at the last digit we can identify whether the number is even or what 8 minus 4 4 that's an even number 9 minus 2 7. that's an odd number now multiplication what's the rule for multiplication any two even numbers or with even always even both even that's even now here one is even one is odd the answer is odd odd odd odd you get odd number example number one write the even numbers between 0 and 10 here the answer does not include 0 and 10. so in between means you don't write 0 and 10. so what are the even numbers 2 4 6 8 those are even numbers write the even numbers from 0 till 10 so you can't take 10 here the 
,answer includes 0 but not 10 when you see the word till you can't take so what are the even numbers so zero from zero so you can take zero two four six eight but you can't take ten next one write the even numbers from 0 to 10 here the answer includes 0 and 10 so what are the even numbers 0 2 4 6 8 and 10 also you can take because this is 2 10 exercise 14.2 write the even numbers between 10 and 25 between so we don't consider the two numbers 12 40 16 18 20 22 24 so those are even numbers write the odd numbers from 19. till 35 so from 19 means you can start from 19 21 23 23 25 27 29 31 33 so you can't take 35 till 35 means we don't consider 35 write the 
,even numbers from 13 to 24 so boundaries you can take but 13 is not an even number so you can start from 14 16 18 20 2022 we can consider 24 as well from the list of numbers given below write the even numbers and the odd numbers separately so we'll write even and odd so first number 456 last digit is 6. 395 is odd last digit is 
,5. 740 is even 1852 is an even number 341 is an odd number then that last digit is 0 27 850 is an even number last digit is 0 forty 148 thousand four hundred is also even last digit is nine three hundred and ninety seven thousand six hundred and fifty nine is an odd number last digit is eight that's an even number eight million 
,eight so this is thousand this is million eight million and eight is an even number question number five write your year of birth month of birth and the date of birth respectively right whether each of them is an odd number or an even number so you are in grade six so 2009 will take november 12th so what's this number yes last digit is nine that's an odd number eleven eleven means november last digit is one that's an odd number and this is the day 12th last digit is 2 that's an even number 
,in a certain street of a city the following sign is posted vehicles can be parked here only on odd days of the month what are the days in the month of june that vehicles can be parked along the street so odd days odd days means first so june 1st 3rd 5th 7th 9th 11th 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 29 june is only 30 days so 20 up to 29th you can't take 31. so june these are the days that you can park the vehicles question number seven write five even numbers and five odd numbers that can be written using the digits 4 2 3 1 0 exactly once that means we have to use all digits so we'll write down even so last digit can be four for even so i can write any order one two three zero four that's one number then i can keep this 4 and change this 2 1 0 3 that's another number i can write with 2 2 here and 4 1 0 3 and i can keep 2 and change it 4 1 3 0 and i can put 0 also i'll put 0 as the last digit then i can change 3 1 2 4. you can change the other numbers then odd numbers what are the odd 
,numbers so i'll write it here odd what are the odd numbers i can write so the last digit can be 3 so i can change 4 1 2 0 then 3 again i can change it 1 4 0 2 and i 
,can put 1 also 1 three two four zero one bit i can change it two three zero four and another number i can keep one and change the other numbers 4 3 2 0 so those are 
,order even numbers exercise 14.3 the month of january of a certain calendar is given below draw circles around the prime numbers and draw triangles around the composite numbers so prime numbers you have to draw a circle 2 3 5 7 11. then thirteen seventeen nineteen twenty three 29 and 31 those are prime numbers then triangles around the composite numbers triangles 4 6 8 9 10. those numbers got more than two factors 12 14 15 16 18 20 21 22 24 25 26 27 28 30. those are composite numbers copy the figure given below from the given numbers choose the prime numbers draw an arrow from the each prime numbers to the circle indicating prime numbers from the given numbers choose the composite numbers draw an arrow from each composite number to the circle indicating composite numbers 33 is composite 35 is composite now 37 is prime number 38 is composite 39 you can divide by 3 a composite number 41 means a prime number 51 you can divide by 3 that's a composite number 53 is a prime number write two successive prime numbers two and three next to each other write two successive composite numbers eight nine question number four find the odd number between one and ten which is not a prime so 3 is prime 5 7 all are prime numbers so 9 is the only odd number that is not a prime find a pair of prime numbers whose addition is 30 what are the two prime numbers addition 30 so 2 with 28 no 3 with 27 no 4 width so you can check so what are the other numbers 5 with 25 no then 7 width when 
,you subtract 7 here you get 23 so that's okay so 7 and 23 you get 30. so both are prime numbers write 14 as a product of two prime numbers two and seven both are prime numbers what is the smallest prime number that's 2 not 1. what is the smallest composite number that's 4 write the composite numbers between 20 and 30 between means you can't consider 20 and 30. so starting from 21 22 23 you can't 24 25 26 27 28 29 you can't you can't write 30 as well what is the only even prime number that's true prime number that's only an even number exercise 14.4 look at the dates in the month of january in a calendar which dates are square numbers square numbers when you multiply the number itself one times one once two times two four three times three four times four sixty five times five twenty-five six times six thirty-six but this is up to thirty-one write down the square numbers from one to hundred so one two hundred square numbers one two times two four three times three nice four times four sixteen twenty-five 6 times 6 36 7 times 7 49 8 times 8 64. 9 times 9 81 10 times 10 also you can 1 200 that means you can write 100 as well so 10 times 10 
,100. write down the square numbers between 50 and 150 between means you can't consider so you can start from 64. that's eight times eight nine times nine 81 10 times 10 100 11 times 11 121 12 times 12 144 13 times 13 you get 169 so you can't write 169 at the odd numbers between 0 and 6 find whether the sum is a square number add the odd numbers between 0 and 6 1 3 you get 4 then one three five you get nine here one also you can consider that's the first square number then what are the other numbers you can't take 7 because 0 to 6 find whether the sum is a square number yes yes they are square numbers add the odd numbers between 0 and 10 find whether the sum is a square number in between 0 and 10 means you can't take 10 loss 1 1 1 plus 3 4 1 plus 3 plus five nine one plus three plus five plus seven sixteen one plus three plus five plus seven plus 9 25 and you can't take the next odd number that's more than 10. so we can see when you add odd numbers you get square numbers exercise 14.5 complete the figure given here in triangular formation and find the triangular number represent by it we'll fill that with the same color or different color we'll fill with a different color this is one two three four five then this becomes four this is one two three always one less than the below one this is three this is two and this is 1. so what's the triangular number 1 2 3 4 5 6. 6 plus 5 11. 11 plus 4 15. 15 plus 3 18 18 plus 2 20 20 plus 1 21 so that's the triangular number 21 complete the rows below as given in the first four rows 1 plus 2 1 plus 2 plus 3 all counting numbers 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4 plus 5 we get 15. one plus two plus 
,three plus four plus five plus six you get twenty one two three four five six seven now you get 28 one and two three four five six seven eight thirty six eight plus 
,twenty eight then we get up to 9. you get 45 so that's the other triangular number what is the smallest triangular number that's what a number is represented using dots that are arranged in a triangular formation then the bottom row consists of 11 dots so that means 11 in the last row one two three 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11. what is the triangular number so how many rows you can get then the next one becomes 1 less than that 10 so do you know that so the upper one is 1 1 2 up to 11 11 rows are there so what's the so here you can fill this but you don't need to draw it to identify the triangular number so what is the triangular number that's the 11th triangular number so how many dots are there we found a pattern for that so what's the number there a number is represented by the this one then the bottom row what is the triangular number that's 11 if you want to find out that you can find that number as well so what's the number 11 times 12 divided by 2 we found the pattern before multiplied by 6 so 66 dots are there add two consecutive numbers given in exercise 2 is the sum a square number exercise 2 what's that so that means any odd number so this is any counting number but they are asking any odd numbers and adding let me see at two consecutive numbers given in exercise 2 is the sum a square number no we got 1 3 6 10 15. when you add consecutive numbers means counting numbers so that's not those are not square numbers so we can just write one we got one one plus two we got three so three is not a square number 1 plus 2 plus 3 6 6 is not a so not square numbers certain numbers are okay one is a square number but not the other numbers exercise 14.6 13610 is the triangular number pattern starting at one written in ascending order find the eighth term so what's the eighth term if we know the pattern we can find out eighth triangular number 8 times 9 divided by 2 that's 36 is the eighth triangular number 1 4 9 16 is the square number pattern starting from 1 
,written in ascending order find the 12th term so 12th square number becomes 12 times 12 that means 144 in the above square number pattern which term is 49 49 means 7 times 7 so that's the seventh square number is 65 a term in this number pattern 65 is not a square number so no 60 4 is okay 8 times 8 is 64. and not 65 so 65 is not a square number what are the terms that are between 50 and 100 in this pattern these are square numbers so what are the numbers 7 times 7 49 8 times 8 64. 9 times 
,9 81 so 10 times 10 100 you can't take because this this is in between between 50 and 100 so 64 and 81 write the first five numbers in the number patterns given below first one the pattern consisting of all even numbers greater than five written in ascending order smallest two largest greater than five starting with six 8 10 12 
,14. so you need to write five one two three four five part two the pattern consisting of all multiples of 3 greater than 10 written in ascending order smallest to highest so 3 times 4 12 3 times 5 15 three times six eighteen three times seven twenty one and three times eight twenty four so we need to write five numbers one two three four five the pattern starting at one and consisting of triangular numbers that are not primes written in ascending order one plus 2 you get 3 3 you can't write because it's a prime number 3 plus 3 6 6 plus 4 10 10 plus 5 15 15 plus 6 21 so these are the triangular numbers but not prime miscellaneous exercise you have given set of numbers as given in the above order write the numbers from 1 to 50 in your exercise book so you can complete this 1 to 50. now draw a line across one so we have to write down all up to 50. now we'll do what they're asking so we did this before now draw a line across one draw a circle around two now draw lines across all 
,multiples of two other than two lines across so i can cross out all multiples of 10. then draw a circle around three then cross out all multiples of three other than 3 3 times 6 9 15 7 21 27 and then we get 33 39 45 that's all did we cross out all multiples of three yes now draw lines across all multiples of five other than five draw a circle around five cross out all multiples of five 25 35 so then again draw a circle around seven and cross out all multiples of seven you can cross it out get 49 is 7 times 7 so those are multiples of 7. now draw circles around the remaining numbers 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 47 what are those now draw circles around the remaining numbers confirm whether the numbers inside the circles are prime numbers so all our prime numbers here 43 also a prime now so yes all uh price so we did 
,this before that's another way of finding prime numbers amali says that when we consider two consecutive whole numbers one of them is an even number while the other 
,is an odd number is this statement true or false two consecutive number two three one is even one is odd five six one is odd one is even so always when you take two 
,consecutive whole numbers one of them is an even number while the other is an odd number so this is true because we are taking two consecutive numbers always one is 
,odd and the other is is even germany explains that by adding two consecutive triangular numbers we obtain a square number by using the examples below one plus three 
,adding two consecutive triangular numbers three plus six three is a triangular number six is a triangular numbers you get nine check whether her statement is true give three more examples to verify this so two consecutive triangular numbers so we'll take what's the other consecutive numbers 6 with 10 so you can add 6 and 10 that's 16 you get a square number then 10 with 15 25 that's a square number so we need another one more 15 and what's the other square number 21 you get 5 plus 1 6 36 so that's a square number so check whether her statement is true true all uh square numbers so when you add two consecutive triangular numbers you get a square number 
,question number four consider the sentences below mark the ones that are correct as correct sign and the others as raw one is a prime number no 2 is the lowest prime number the smallest prime number is 2 that's correct all square numbers are composite numbers 1. one is not a composite number all square numbers we can't say because one is not a composite so that statement is raw all triangular numbers are composite numbers one one is a triangular number so you can't say all and the next one 
,is what's the other triangular number one plus two that's 3 3 also not a composite num 36 is a composite number yes which is a square number as well as a triangular 
,number is it a triangular number check so we know 15 plus 621 is a triangular number 21 plus so 15 plus 6 21 plus 7 28 28 plus 8 36 so that's a triangular number so 
,36 is a composite number a square number and a triangular number that's correct so we covered all theory related to numbers if the ones place of a number has one of 
,the digits 0 2 4 6 8 that is a that is an even number if the ones place of a number has one of the digits 1 3 5 7 9 then the number is an odd number whole numbers greater than one which have only two different factors are called prime numbers whole numbers greater than one having more than two different factors are called composite numbers so one is not a prime number as well as composite number you

ARLS2TmFT94,hi today I will be showing you a bunch of different industry laws there will be the most fundamental laws that you need to solve basically any industry problem so firstly let's talk about why NZ is so say for example we have 2 to the power 5 this come to here for the base and the 5 here is indices or index and what this basically means is 3 times 2 times 2 times 2 22 5 times so we have rule 1 any number raised to the power 0 automatically equals 1 there's only one asset exception which is 0 raised to the power 0 is undefined so we have a number which is called a number X raised to the power 0 equals 1 except for 0 okay rule 2 any number raised to a negative in the sea caught the negative in CN what you do you just put one over the number per say it was two on e to the power negative 3 would be 1 divided by 2 to the power of 3 without the negative sign on the denominator okay so rule free you have a number X raised to power N and you multiply that by X to the power M so remember X to the base and nm are indices what do you do X 2 n plus M so when you multiply two bases the same and entities are different decide the indices so for example 
,two to three times two to the four this would be same as 2 to the power 7 plus 4 equal 7 and if you enter that into the calculator both sides would be the same number rule 4 so similar to multiplication X to the N divided by X to the M is just our X and instead of adding them this time you do negative so n minus M so if we use this example here do to the 3/2 to 4 with equal to 2 to negative 1 I remember negative 1 in row 2 is just thinking as 1/2 that would actually for 1/2 and you can test that to the power 3 divided by 2 to power 4 is the same as hearts as well so the two more rules guys so rule 5 if you have X to the power n inside practice raised to the power M it will be the same as X and times M so what does this basic thing use if you have 2 to the power 3 and you raise that to the power 4 this would be the thing that G to the power 3 times 4 which is control again you can verify this in your calculator and our last law rule rule 6 if you have X and divided by M this equals 2x square roots and you bring the end inside and the ML type 4 using an example due to the power 3 divided by 4 we would have 0 to the power 3 and on outside

_BgblvF90UE,"Hi, welcome to Math Antics. In our last video, we learned what negative numbers are, and we learned that they're part of a special set of numbers called ‘integers’. "
,"Next, we need to learn how to do arithmetic with those integers. In this video, we’re gonna learn how to add and subtract integers. In the next video we’ll learn how to multiply and divide integers. Adding and subtracting whole numbers is pretty easy because there’s really only two possibilities: you’re either adding two positive numbers, or subtracting two positive numbers. But adding and subtracting integers is more complicated, because with negative numbers in the mix, there’s a lot more possibilities. Fortunately, you don’t need to memorize all these possibilities. Instead, we’re gonna learn some simple rules and strategies that will make the process a lot easier . Let’s start by learning two key rules that are really helpful to know when working with negative numbers. The first rule is this:  Adding a negative is the same as subtracting a positive. To visualize what that means, suppose I give you positive two cupcakes, You’d be pretty happy, right? But what if I ‘give’ you negative two cupcakes instead? That’s the same as taking two cupcakes away from you. Would you still be happy? When it comes to math, this rule means that if you "
,"have a problem like this: 5 + -1 (where you’re adding a negative number), you can just change it to subtraction. Instead of 5 + -1, you can just write 5 ? 1. They’re different ways of writing the same thing. Okay, so rule #1 is:  Adding a negative is the same as subtracting a positive. Now what about rule number #2? Well the second rule is this:  Subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive. Let’s say you have negative two cupcakes.  Like if you have a debt… you OWE me two cupcakes. You wouldn’t be too happy having that negative, would you? But, what if I subtract that negative from you? Taking away the negative two made you more positive, right? Subtracting the negative gives you less debt! When it comes to math, this rule means that if you have a problem like 5 ? (-1), where you’re subtracting a negative number, you can just change it to addition. Instead of 5 ? (-1), you can just write 5 + 1, and that’s a problem you already know how to solve. Alright, now that "
,"you know our two rules, I want to show you that there’s really only four different types of problems (or 4 cases) when adding or subtracting integers. In case 1, you start with a positive number and you make it more positive. In case 2, you start with a positive number and you make it more negative. In case 3, you start with a negative number and you make it more negative. And in case 4, you start with a negative number and you make it more positive. The key to getting the right answer to the problem is to figure out which of these cases you’re dealing with, so let’s look at each case in more detail. In case 1, you start with a positive number and you "
,"make it more positive. The good news is that you already know how to do that!  That’s just what regular addition is. For example, when you have the problem 7 + 3, you’re starting with a positive 7 and you’re making it more positive by adding positive 3 to it, to get the answer of positive 10. But, what if instead of 7 + 3, you're given the problem 7 ? (-3)?  That seems a lot harder, right? Well, if you remember rule #2, it’s not harder at all. In fact, it’s exactly the same problem because "
,"rule #2 says subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive. We can change the “minus minus 3” into “plus 3” and we get the same answer: positive 10. So case 1 is just addition like you’re used to doing, but now that we have negative numbers, there’s a new way that it could be written that you need to be on the lookout "
,"for. Oh, and in this case (starting with a positive and making it more positive), you know your answer will always be positive because you stay on that side of the number line. In case 2, you start with a positive number, but you make it more negative. That is, you do something to it that makes its value smaller (or moves it to "
,"the left on the number line). But that’s just like regular subtraction like you already know how to do. For example, here we have the problem 8 ? 5. We start with a "
,positive 8 but we make it more negative by subtracting 5 from it. Subtracting 5 moves it to the left on the number line down to 3 as our answer. Our answer is still 
,"a positive number, but it’s less positive than it was before. And that raises an interesting question: What if we subtract even more, to move it further in the negative direction? Like, what if we subtract 8 instead of 5?  That would take us all the way back down to zero on the number line. And before you knew about negative numbers, back when you thought the number line just stopped at zero, you probably thought that’s all we could take away.  But watch this… Let’s start with positive 8 but then subtract 10 from it!  Can we do that? Can we subtract a bigger number from a smaller one? Now we can!  It just means that the answer we get will be a negative number. Starting with positive 8 and subtracting 10 takes us past zero, and down to negative 2 on the number line. So our answer is negative 2. As you can see, case 2 is a little more complicated, because the answer can be positive, negative or even zero, depending on the numbers you’re subtracting. And it’s even more complicated than that because there’s also another way this type of problem can be written, thanks to rule #1. Rule #1 says that adding a negative is really the same as subtracting a positive. And that means our original subtraction problem (8 ? 5) could have been written like this instead (8 + -5). But either way it’s written, you’re starting with a positive and making it more negative. Now on to case 3…  In case 3 you start with a negative number and you make it more negative. That’s really just the opposite of case 1 where we started on the positive side of the number line and made it more positive. For example, let’s say that you’re given the problem: -7 + "
,"-3. That means that you start with negative 7 and then you make it even more negative by adding negative 3 which gives you negative 10 as the answer. And as you might have guessed by now, thanks to our rules, there’s another way we could write this type of problem. Because of rule #1, we know that adding a negative 3 is the same as subtracting 3. So this problem could also be written like this: -7 ? 3. But either way it’s written, in this case you’re starting with a negative number and making it even more negative. And because of that, you know that your answer will always be negative for case 3 since you stay on the negative side of the number line. And finally, in case 4, you also start with a negative number, but this time you’re gonna make it more positive. Here’s an example of a problem like that: -8 + 5. This problem starts with negative 8 but then we add positive 5 which makes it more positive, or moves us to the right on the number line, up to -3 which is our answer. "
,"Our answer is still negative, but it’s less negative than what we started with. Ah, but this looks similar to case 2, right? Imagine what would happen if you made it even more positive. You could add 8 (instead of 5) and that would move you all the way up to zero. And if you added even more, like -8 + 10, that would take you to "
,"the positive side of the number line and give you the answer of positive 2. So just like in case 2, the answer here can be positive, negative or even zero depending "
,"on the numbers you‘re adding. And, just like before, there’s another way this type of problem can be written. Remember rule #2? …that subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive. Because of that rule, -8 + 5 could also be written as -8 ? (-5). That’s a LOT of negatives, but thanks to rule #2, we can write our “minus "
,"minus” as a “plus”. But either way it’s written, in this case, we start negative and move in the positive direction. Okay, now that we’ve learned our two rules and we’ve seen that there’s really just four types of problems (or 4 different cases) that you’ll need to solve, I want to give you a basic strategy that will help when you’re adding or subtracting integers. This strategy involves asking 3 simple questions: The first question is, “Am I starting with a positive or a negative number?” "
,"This question is easy to answer because all you have to do is look at the sign in front of the first number of the problem. If there’s no sign, then you’re starting "
,"with a positive number. But if there’s a minus sign, then you’re starting with a negative number. Once you know what you’re starting with, the next question to ask is, “Am I making it bigger or smaller?” In other words, is what you’re adding or subtracting going to make the value move in the positive direction of the number line or the negative direction? If you’re subtracting a positive or adding a negative (Rule #1) then you're making the value smaller, which is moving to the left on the "
,"number line. If you’re adding a positive or subtracting a negative (Rule #2) then you're making the value bigger, which is moving to the right on the number line. And the last question that you need to ask is, “Will my answer be positive, negative, or zero?” The answer to this will depend on which case you have and what values you’re working with. If it’s a case 1 problem, you know the answer will always be positive, and if it’s a case 3 problem, then you know the answer will always be negative. But you’ll remember that in cases 2 and 4, the answer could change between positive, negative or zero depending on the difference between the two numbers that "
,"you’re working with. So asking these three questions will help you visualize what’s happening in the problem that you’re trying to solve, and it’ll help you get the "
,right answer. But the most important thing that you can do to get good at integer arithmetic is to practice. It’s important that you try a lot of problems that you have an answer key for so that you know if you’re doing it right. And don’t get discouraged if it’s confusing at first.  You’ll get it if you practice! And you might

VTCo-aUzwEE,hello children welcome to my maths class starting from grade 6 to 11. as you know you overcome a big hurdle in your life that's your scholarship exam again you have 
,to take a challenge in your life that's your o-level exam so join with me you can overcome all your difficulties in maths maths is not hard it is a really easy subject and it's fun if you're good at maths you can succeed in any field so stay with me i'll teach you all the basic concepts related to maths so the first lesson in your textbook is circles so in this lesson we'll identify items which have the circular shape and circular designs using items which have the circular shapes what is the name of this figure you already know that that's a circle so we can write the name of this figure is a circle right several objects you know having a circular shape what are the shapes what about this one we all have this with us coins so coins are circular shape and what about this one this is a cd compact disk what about this you like to eat yogurt so this is circular shape yogurt cup class so you get circular shape you can write glass what else plate what about this one these are t strainers so here when you take this one is a circular shape what about when you go to the carnival what you see going round and round very sweet when you take vehicles tire tire off the vehicle girls what about this you need this letter makeup powder puff so you can write makeup powder puffs then in the kitchen have you seen safe so all these are circular shapes so every day you see circular shape figures and solids now we will see how we can draw circles so you need to know how to do it properly so draw three circles with the help of a two rupee coin so you know you get two types of two rupee coin the smaller one and the bigger one so i'll take the bigger one and show you how to draw it properly so you what you do you keep it on your paper and then you hold it with your finger in the middle and then you draw it properly so here you can start from one end like this go round and round but you have to hold it tight so that's how we draw a proper circle so we'll draw three circles so keep it here and you can draw round and round but make sure that you hold it properly another circle so hold it with a finger and draw around it so that you get a nice circle so here we drew three circles with the two rupee coin now we'll take the next one draw a circle using a compact disk so that's easy because it's a big one so here you get a small circle in the middle as well as outer circle so we'll draw the outer circle so keep it here and then you hold it with your finger in the middle and then you draw it round so that's how you draw it properly see how you draw the circle then what we have to do draw a circle using a bottle top so we'll take a bottle top keep it here hold it tightly in the middle and then draw round the circle so you get nice circles what about the other one draw three circles using 
,a five rupee coin that's a small one so this is five rupee coin so we'll keep it here and try to draw it hold it in the middle and draw it around the circle here we'll draw another one two circles you need three circles so we'll take it and draw it again so round and round so you'd better to take a sharpened pencil to draw circles another one here now we'll see another two circles using a small glass so i have a not a very small one i'll try to draw this circle so keep it here on top of your paper and hold it with the finger and make sure that you draw the circle with one try so we'll start from here and then go round and round here so how many circles you need to draw two circles so here again we'll try again keep it tightly hold it with the finger and then we'll start from here and with one try you have to complete the full circle if you can't do it then take another try so we did glass now we need to draw two circles using carom disk so that's a small one small circle we'll try to draw this so how many circles you need two circles so keep it and hold this with the finger and then try to draw it properly so with one try like this we'll take another one hold it tight in the middle and then right round with one try sometimes it's difficult when you have bigger ones it's difficult to go around with one try now what's the next one so by using various items to draw circles do the sizes of the circles differ or not look at carefully what do you think about the sizes those are not the same so we can write differ or not sizes are different this is an activity for you i did with two rupee coin now you have to do four circles using one rupee coin so again you get two types of coins a smaller one rupee coin and a bigger one so you can try with both so try to draw four circles using one rupee coin so take it keep on top of on your paper hold it tightly and try to draw the circle with one try now we'll look at this one draw a small circle using a small glass on a piece of paper cut along margin with a pair of scissors so take colored paper and cut a circle like this so this is the circle and then fold the above circle 
,right into two and draw a broken line along this fold so you have to take the circle so fold it into two parts like this and then what you have to do you have to draw a broken line like this then what's the next step you have to fold the circle right into two other directions so again another way like this fold it and you can again take it here and fold it again like this then what you do when you draw the lines you get something like this so after you fold it when you draw broken lines you get something like this so all the broken lines meet at a point do you agree with that when you take all these broken line what is this point this is the point of intersection so what is the name given to this point this is not in your syllabus but i'll teach you because it's a small word so try it now we call it center of the 
,circle so how we write center c e n t r e this is british way we are writing er also okay that's american way so we got used to write center c e and tre center of the circle so that's the intersecting point look at this circle write the distance from center or to the point p so how can we measure you can take the ruler take the 
,ruler and we need to measure op length so keep the zero point on the center point and then you can keep it like this and measure the length so what's the length from here to here i get 4 centimeters so this is op distance is 4 centimeters now write the distance from the center to the point q so we'll take the ruler and here we'll rotate and see and you have to keep it here on top of the center and measure so that's also 4 centimeters write the distance from the center o to the point r r is 
,here so i'll rotate this i'll take this i have to take this way because starting from zero so i'll keep it here and then rotate it so here this distance that's also 
,4 centimeters write the distance from the center o to the point s so we'll take any point s here i'll take s here now we'll try to measure so i'll just keep the s this zero point on the center and measure this distance that's also 4 centimeters so we can see all these lengths are equal so o p o q o r o s all these lengths are equal that's four centimeters each of these distances is known by the name what you call that this is not in your syllabus but it's good to know all these terms so we 
,call that's the radius radius of a circle a circle has many radii all are equal in length so when you take all these radius we call the fruital term radii so all these radii are equal in length look at this one you get three circles what's the center center is o point so what are the radii o a that's a small circle what about ob that's the inner circle the other circle and oc is the radius of the outer circle measure the length of these radii so we'll take the ruler and try to measure all these so we can keep zero point on top of this center point and we get oa is two point seven two point seven centimeters then you can measure here to here now what's 
,that four point four four point four centimeters for ob what about oc from here to here you get five point nine five point 5.9 centimeters that's oc so what can you 
,say about these values all are different so center and the radius of a circle is not in your grade six new syllabus but it is good to know so here we can see when you take different size of circles the radius values are different so radii are different values look at this circle is the point x inside outside the circle so here this is a circle it's inside so we call this area is inside out of that we call outside the circle so the point x is inside the circle where is the point y situated that's on the circle we call it it's on the circle where is the point z that's outside the circle so now you know how to identify whether any point is inside or outside or on the circle look at this circle write the points situated inside the circle what are the points inside we get a p q those are inside write the point situated on the circle on the circle you get y z and x write the point situated outside the circle what are the points outside k l m k l s those are the points outside the circle mark points a b c inside the circle so this is the circle you have to mark three points inside a b c mark points p q r is outside the circle so outside you can put p q r s mark points klm on the circle so you can mark on the circle k l m three points on the circle using a ruler mark six points six centimeter away from point o so we'll take this is point o and we'll measure six centimeter length so from here we can mark six centimeter length so i'll keep a dot here six marked another point six centimeter away from point o so i can rotate this but center is the same i can mark another six centimeter again rotate six centimeter here again you can rotate this and mark six centimeter away here again rotate this and keep the center point and the zero point together and mark six centimeter away from that so likewise mark more points first 10 more points and then we'll increase the number of points further so another point here six centimeters away another point here six centimeters away make sure that you keep the center and the o point together and then another point so likewise when you mark more points likewise manner increase the number of points still further what you get so we are drawing now more points we are drawing more points here what you get now increasing again so i'm drawing more points in between i'll draw it here also more points what can i say just observe when you draw the when you draw more points in between you see a special ship what's that ship okay so last one we'll take this one so what you see so what is the shape you are getting so you get a circle so this is the center point so what is the shape 
,you get you get a so you get a circle considering o to be the center so this is o is the center what is the diagram of obtain all such points equal distance from o r joint so what's the name here to here we use that word radius so equal distance when you mark points around one fixed point you get a circle so this is a circle so 
,what you call this point in the middle that's the center of the circle what about the shape shape is a circle and what you call this distance from the center to the 
,circle we call it as radius so you are you learned three words the shape is a circle the center point is the center of the circle and the equal distance from center 
,to the circle is called radius draw two circles on a straight line a b using a 5 rupee coin so what you can do take 5 rupee coin keep on top of this line and draw the circle so you need two circles so i use this tool to draw circles but you have to use five rupee coin so i'll draw circles like this so imagine my 5 rupee coin is 
,like this and i can draw two circles so i'll take another copy and keep it here so these are the two circles i'll keep it here and here on a b line so you can use five rupee coin to draw circles like this with the help of two rupee coin draw several circles to make a design color these in various shades so think about this is the two rupee coin and you can take how many circles several circles so i'll take three and try to make a design so i'll keep one here and i'll take another one and i'll keep it like this and i'll take another one and keep it like this so you get a design like this now we'll try to color that so i'll use colors in rainbow so one fairy came in violet and one more indigo i'll take this color indigo in blue green yellow orange red so these are the rainbow colors so all seven colors are there so 
,you can use any shade to collect with the help of a two rupee coin draw a different design and color this so take a two rupee coin and you can create another design 
,so i'll take something like this something like this and we'll try to color this one so i used how many circles i used i used four circles here so i can shade it i'll use different colors now i'll use this one green color and another green color here and here and i'll make it in the middle light colors purple something like this and something like this a design you can create your own design and color it using a larger one rupee coin draw a design and color it so we'll take one rupee coin so this is my one rupee coin will try to make a design now so i can i'll make it smaller i'll do smaller one rupee coin and the big one rupee coin something like this and now i'll try to color that so different colors you can use and i'll put red color in the middle something like that you can create your own design in the diagram shown above shade the area common to both circles so this is one circle there's a another circle overlaps with the first circle so which area is common for both that's b area so shade it with a color so i can shade like this so that's the area common to both the circles shade the circles shown in this diagram so you get a rectangle shape and a circle so they're asking just to color the circle part so that's the circle in this diagram shared the remaining area inside the rectangle leaving 
,out the circle so not the circle and outside the circle but inside the rectangle so which area this area so we'll try to color that so i'll use red color to color this so that's the area outside the circle and inside the rectangle look at this diagram how many circles are there in this diagram so i see one two three three circles are there so i'll right three circles are there write the letters pertaining to the shaded areas so these are the shaded ones a and b is not shaded c and e those are shaded write the letters pertaining to the unshaded area unshaded paths are d those are iron shaded part as well as as well as i can write f also f is not shaded 
,how many equal parts is this circle divided so here this is the circle divided into how many parts two equal parts how many parts are shaded out of two one part is shaded look at this circle now how many equal parts in this circle are divided so one two three four four equal parts are there and how many parts are shaded just one part shaded so one part shaded now look at this one how many equal parts is this circle divided one two three there are three equal parts how many parts are shaded 
,only one part shaded so you can write one part shaded look at this one how many equal parts is this circle divided one two three four five six seven eight one two three four five six seven eight parts are there so eight how many parts are shaded one two two parts are shaded look at this one write the numbers inside the circle inside the circle is this so what are the numbers there one 3 twice written 7 9 so you don't need to write 3 again so 1 3 7 9. write the numbers inside the rectangle but outside the circle inside the rectangle but outside the circle these numbers 0 2 4 6 8 0 2 4 6 8. look at this diagram in this diagram shade the areas common to all three circles write the relevant letters one two three so this region is a common region so this part is the common region so what's the letter relevant letter is e that's e how many circles are there in this diagram so we can circle it and see we'll count this is one two three four five and six so how many circles are there 
,there are six circles in this diagram how many circles are there in this diagram so we can start from here one two three four five six seven eight nine and 10 so there are 10 circles how many circles are there in this diagram one two three four and five so all together five circles are there in this diagram shared all four circles in this diagram so there are four circles we'll shade it this one i'll use different colors this is a another circle this is another circle and this is the other 
,one so four circles are there how many half circles are there in this diagram half circles so we'll try to draw it and see so this is one half one this is another one two three and this one is four so you get four half circles in this diagram now look at this one this is in your textbook so here you can you see there's a purple 
,color circular card is there and several shapes cd disk what about this one clock a drum is there and a tin whisker tip so those are circular shapes figures exercise 1.1 from the following item select and write down the ones in which the circular shape can be observed mathematics book textbook that's not circular that's a rectangle drum yes you get a circular shape in drop cricket but that's not circular that's like oval shape here in the corner so that's like here not a circular shape oval shape see if in the kitchen you get see that's a circular shape figure we knowing fan so we knowing fan also it's a circular figure wheel of vehicle yes that's circular steering wheel of a car that's a circular one teaspoon that's like oval shape so something like this so not circular pot so when you take the mouth of the pot something like this yeah some pots yes this mouth of the pot is circular shape exercise 1.2 from the following collection of items given below select the ones that can be used to draw circles and write down the corresponding numbers with the bottle yes we can draw a circle here this nut but if you take outside you can't but you can draw circles with the inside this circle so you can draw circles with the inside part this one code yes you can draw eraser you can't do drum yes this is a circular shaped figure and this is a prism you can't draw circles from that so you can here you can with the inside not with the outside here these three shapes you can draw circular shapes from the figure shown below select those which are circles and write down the corresponding numbers this is like oval shape not circle here this is a small circle this is a circle and this one is a circle all the others are not circles this is half of a circle in this figure which letters indicate positions inside the circle so look at carefully and write down the points inside the circle you get o a and point p inside the circle which letters indicate positions on the circle on the circle e l b x e l b x on the circle which let us indicate positions outside the circle what are the points outside just k k is outside the circle in a competition of throwing darts onto a circular board by standing at a location in front of it 10 points are awarded if the dart hits the circle so that means on the circle you get ten marks and five points are awarded if the dart hits inside of the circle but no points are awarded if the dart hits outside of the circle so how you 
,get marks 10 points awarded when you hit on the circle and five points for uh inside and no marks given for outside points now look at this one who are the students 
,who were awarded 10 points 10 points given if it's on the circle so sanjeeva sanjiva then who else mohan so sanjeeva and mohan get 10 marks who are the students who 
,were awarded five points that means inside the circle sunil nafil and pradeep so they get 5 points each who are the students who did not receive any points rajita didn't get any points if each of these student is given two more opportunities to throw dats what is the maximum number of points that mohan could receive in total so 
,mohan now gets 10 marks so already 10 marks so again giving another two opportunities so what's the maximum number so another 10 and 10 so all together 30 marks he can get which of this one is given two more opportunities to throw dots what is the maximum number of points that mohan could receive in total so you if he can get another two tens so the maximum is 30 marks look at these designs three circular designs created using circles are shown below such designs can frequently be seen on clothing materials festivals decorations and in religious places so how many circles used to draw this one how many 1 2 3 4 5 6 seven circles used to draw this one what about this one one two three four five six seven eight 10 11 12 13 14 circles used to draw this one so how many circles here one two three four five 6 7 8 9 10 10 circles so you can create different designs using circles now we'll see to create another design so i'll take these circles and try to create a design so how many circles are there something like that one two three four five six circles you can create a different pattern look at this one we see how many circles i used to create this one so we'll see we'll count and see you get a small circle here one two three four and five circles using five circles you can create that design we'll take another one we'll count afterwards how many circles i'm using to create this one what do you think i'm trying to do what's the shape what do you think that's my tree 
,i'll put it here so these are the branches so my circle trick so you can create different designs using circles we'll try to create another design one two three two 
,three i'm trying to create a symmetric pattern with circles so so you can create your own design yes count how many circles i'm using yes see you can create beautiful designs one two three four five six seven eight nine ten 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 circles i used to create this design so in this lesson we looked at all types of circular shapes and now you know how to draw a circle properly and how you create beautiful designs using circles

3bU21Z-xFEk,hello students today i'm here to teach you chapter 12 in your textbook that's indices so we'll see what are the theories behind indices so what are the other terms we call for indices the singular form is index exponents powers so those are the other terms that we can use for indices look at this one 9 multiplied five times so what we can write this is one two three four five when you are multiplying we are adding powers 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 5 times you get 5 9 to the power 5 x multiplied by 5 times 1 2 3 4 5 you can write x to the power 5 so this power 5 we can call it index index power exponent those are the terms that we can use for power what is 
,this one we call this is the base and the whole thing we can call it index notation so index notation means the whole thing index notation now we'll see how we can simplify with loss loss there are five laws in indices so we'll see what are they write these in index notation so that means as a power one single term with a power 
,one two three four four tens you can write ten to the power one two three four five seven to the power five now the base is minus three how many times one two three 
,four minus 3 to the power 4 1 2 3 4 5 8 to the power 5 minus 8 is the base now 1 2 three so you get power three now try this is a fraction but still you can write as index form index notation one two three four four times it's multiplying so this is 2 over 3 to the power 4 how many times x are there 1 2 3 4 5 6. i'll put another one 7 x to the power 7 now look at this one not a single term 2a is the expression now so 2 a make sure that you put brackets there how many times 3 times so 2a whole thing to the power 3. what's this one 2 is just once a is 3 times so 2 a 3 separately you have to write a to the power 3. so see the difference between 2a whole thing power 3 and 2a only power 3 it's different this one you can take these are the expressions here x y term repeating 1 2 3 4 times so you can put x y to the power f write these in expanded form now other way around you have given the index notation and you are asked to write in expanded form 7 to the power 4 that means 7 4 times 10 to the power 5 10 5 times minus 7 to the power 4. so you have to write minus 7 like this 4 times minus 5 to the power 4. x to the power six one two three four five 6 y to the power 3 1 2 3 2 p to the power 4 so that means 2 p 4 times three over seven to the power four three over seven to the power four three p q to the power 2 means you have to write down 3pq in one expression so twice 3 p q look at this one a into b whole thing squared so we can call this as power of a product this 
,is a product so power of a product this one separately a squared b squared this is product of a power product of a power and power of a product expand the power and 
,write as a product of powers product of powers means you have to write down separately so first expand this 3x square so that means 3x into 3x then how can you write down separately i can expand it 3x means 3 times x 3x means 3 times x now how many 3s are there i see 3 into 3. i can separate it 3 is an excess and then i can write how many times 3s are there 1 2 and how many times x's are there 1 2. so i can write 3 squared into x squared so likewise can you do this one 5 y to the power 3 so you can write 5 by 3 times first then i can write separately 5 separately 1 2 3 and y is also 1 2 3. now i can write 5 how many times 1 two three how many times wise are there one two three so 5 to the power 3 and y to the power 3. a b to the power 3 a b a b a b so this is a times a times a and b times b times b so a to the power 3 and b to the power 3 7 p cubed power 2 7 p q into 7 p cube i can separate it 7 times 7. 2 p's are there and 2 q's are there so how can i write i can write 7 squared p squared and q squared now look at this one write this as power of a product so here separately powers given and you are asked to write down power of a product so we have to separate it and put brackets now say 8 you can write 2 times 2 times 2 a to the power 3 3 is b to the power 3 3 b's now we can write this one 2 a b how many times 2 a b 2 a b and 2 a b 3 times now instead of this i can write this one as 2 times a times b 2 a b whole thing power 3 so this is called power of a product look at this one 25 x squared y squared 25 how can i write i can write 5 times 5 x squared means x into x y squared means y into y now separate it every term is twice so i can separate it five x over y how many times twice so how can i write as a power 5 x over y to the power 2. 121 x squared y squared what is 121 i can write 11 times 11. so 11 11. x squared is x into x y squared is y into i now i can write 11xy twice now how can i write as a power 11 x y whole thing power 2 product of powers with the same base same base multiplication now we'll expand it and see 9 to the power 3 that means 9 3 times 9 squared means 9 2 times now how many 9's are there 1 2 3 4 5 i can write this as 9 to the power 5. so what happens here how we get 5 we get 5 as adding 3 and 2 so 9 is 3 plus 2 you can write without expanding separately you can write when you add the powers you get the answer so 3 plus 2 becomes 9 to the power 5 powers are added when multiplying powers with the same base look at this one fill in the blanks and write as index notation now here same base multiplication so what we do we add the powers 2 plus 3 so 2 plus 3 becomes 5 9 to the power 4 here 6 is there how you get 6 2 plus 4 if it's 2 plus 4 this becomes 9 square 2 plus 5 that's 7. so you have to add 5 there how you get 11 power is 11 there 7 plus 4 is 11 so then when you write separately this is x to the power 7 and x to the power 4 8 is there as the answer so how you get 8 you have to add 3 to 5. so how you separately write this one y to the power 3 and y to the power 5. this one 2 times 5 10 is there now we have to consider a power a a3 and a2 you have to add 
,same base different powers multiplication you add the powers this becomes 3 plus 2 5 and here 4 plus 2 4 times 2 8 that's separately written and here x squared and x7 so how you write down your extra multiplication is there so 4 times 2 8 8 is there x squared and x 7 so you add the powers 2 and 7 so what's the power 2 plus 7 you get 9 there write the answer at once now same base different powers multiplication you add the powers 4 plus 2 6 3 to the power 6 4 plus 1 5 10 to the power 5. base is not changing 9 and 9 9 base 3 plus 3 6 base a 5 plus 7 12 base x is there 4 plus 3 7 this one 8 base 8 7 plus 1 8 base y 4 plus 3 becomes 7 base b 6 plus 2 8 and base q is there 9 plus 3 that's 12. and a is there x plus x adding becomes 2 x write the answer at once same base different powers multiplication you add the powers x plus 3 b is the base x and x becomes 2x base x is there a plus 5. base a here p plus q is the power so what's the first law first law in indices when there are same base different powers multiplication we add the powers base is not changing so powers are added when multiplying powers with same base simplify so here 3 and 2 you can just multiply and you get 6 a squared and a 4 like same base so you can add it 4 plus 2 6. here write down this one 5 times 3 are the numbers then 3 and 2 becomes 5. so what's the final answer 5 times 3 15 x to the power 5 7 and 2. so 7 times 2. p you need to add 3 and 3 6. so 14 b to the power 6 7 times 2 is 40. this one 
,4 and 3 are the numbers in front x terms you are can add 2 plus 4 6 so 4 times 3 12 x to the power 6. 9 times 2 y 4 plus 2 6 9 plus 2 18 9 my multiplied by 2 18 y to the power 6 division of powers with same base we'll see how we can do we'll expand this 9 to the power 5 9 5 times divide by 9 squared 9 2 times then what can you say i can cross it out 1 9 get cancel out another 9 get cancel out so how many 9's are there 9 9 9 3 times so according to the first law i can write this one as 9 to 
,the power three so look at carefully when it's division what happens to the power again we'll do this one x to the power six one two 3 4 5 6. divide by x to the power 4 x to the power 4 means x 4 times you have to multiply now cross it out 1x 2x 3x4 x now what's the remaining part x into x only 2 there so x to the power 2. now look at carefully five and two you get three six and four you get two we'll do this one also y seven times divide by 5 5 times now cross it out 1 y 2 3 4 5. so what's remaining 2 y's you can write y square now observe carefully when you subtract 5 minus 2 you get 3. 6 minus 4 2 7 minus 5 2. so we'll see how we get the pattern use subtraction of powers to get the answer because we observed from the previous one when you subtract the powers you get the answer now we'll use that 6 here divide by 2 so 9 6 minus 2 so what's 6 minus 2 you get 4. 10 is the base same base division with different powers you subtract the powers 7 minus 3 get 4 a is the base 8 minus 4 you get a to the power 4 same base x 10 minus 7 you get 10 to the power 3 same base y 5 minus 5 you get y to the power 0 write the answer at once now we can use that property same base different powers division we subtract the powers so a 7 minus 3 4 a is the base 8 minus 5. get 3. b is the base 10 minus 7 that's 3 m is the base 12 minus 8 that's 4. y is a base 3 minus 3 0 x is the base 8 minus 12 now 8 minus 12 you get a negative write the answer at once this is division x and 3. so what you do subtract x minus 3. b is the base subtract 5 minus x y is the base x minus 4 p is the base so p 3 minus a a is the base here x minus y so what's the law number two same base different powers division we subtract the powers so powers are subtracted when dividing powers with same base now look at this one if a to the power m divided by a to the power n is a to the power 5 right 3 pairs of suitable values of many so you can subtract and you need to get 5. so if you put 9 something so what should be the n value 9 minus 4 you get 5. if this is we can put any number uh 12 12 minus 7 you get 5. another one ten ten minus five you get five so when you subtract you need to get five power of index notation so index notation is here how we consider power a to the power 3 squared how you expand this i can write a to the power 3 and another a to the power 3 twice so that means according to the law number one same base different powers multiplication you can add power so 3 and 3 
,you can add so what's the answer you get a to the power 6. get 6 by we can see multiplying 3 and 2. so you need to observe this 3 times 2 you get 6. write the answer using expanding powers so again we can write x squared power three means two three times then same base different powers multiplication we can add the powers two plus 2 plus 2 6 2 2 times 3 you get 6 y to the power 5 twice 5 and 5 becomes 10 5 times 2 you get 10 a to the power 4 3 times 4 plus 4 plus 4 you get 12. 4 times 3 also 12. p to the power 5 twice 5 plus 5 you get 5 times 2 also 10. find the answer using multiplication now so what can you write 9 3 times 2. you get 6 10 4 times 2 you get 8. this one x 3 x 3 9 this one 5 times 2 you get 10 so when you multiply this one you get the power so especially when there are brackets what you do you multiply the powers find the answer using multiplication x 3 into a that's 3a y 5 into x that's 5x a x into 2 that's 2x by a into 3 that's 3 so what's the law number 3 when you get brackets you multiply the power so m n m into n you get m and powers are multiplied when there are brackets write the answer without brackets so what you do when there are brackets you multiply the power so you have to consider you have to consider the outside power for all these inside numbers so what's the answer you get you have to multiply this by 2 as well as this by 2. so 2 to the power 1 times 2 2 x to the power 3 times 2 6. now you can simplify 2 squared you can write as 2 times 2 4. so you can write 4 x to the power 6. this one here 3 is there means 3 to the power 1 is there so you have to consider all these with this power 2. multiply 3 to the power 1 times 2 2 x times 2 times 2 4 y times 3 times 2 6. so what's the answer 3 squared 3 times 3 9. 9 x to the power 4 y to the power 6 this one 2 times 2 3 times 2 so 2 to the power 2 times 2 4 y to the power 3 times 2 6. so 2 to the power 4 2 times 2 4 4 times 2 8 8 times 2 16 y to the power 6. this one multiply these two 7 times 2 times 2 4 and 8 to the power 3 times 2 6. so what's the answer 7 to the power 4 what's that 7 times 7 49 49 times 7 343 again we have to multiply by seven two thousand four hundred and one 8 to the power 6 7 times 3 21 7 times 4 28 plus 2 30 7 times 3 21 plus 3 24. so that's the answer now we'll look at 0 
,powers so first we'll write as division 9 to the power 3 this way divide by nine to the power three now expand nine times nine times nine here also nine times nine times nine then when you cross out the common factors what you get you get one now left hand side we'll use law number two same base different powers division we subtract the powers nine three minus 3 becomes 0. so what you get here 9 to the power 0 is 1. again we'll do for this one a squared i can write this one a squared over a square expand it a times a a times a now cross out the common factors you get 1. but left hand side i can use law number 2 2 minus 2 you get 1. so what's the law number 4 any base to the power 0 is always 1 but you need to remember a cannot be equal to 0 so we don't know the answer for 0 to the power 0 that's not defined so only we know any base to the power 0 so a cannot be equal to 0. write the answer at once now we know any base to the powers 0 is 1 7 to the power 0 1 minus 3 to the power 0 1 5 here brackets are there so first you need to use law number 3 multiplication 2 times 0 0 now 5 to the power 0 we know that's 1 and 1 to the power 0 is 1 negative powers now we'll first divide this 9 squared divided by 9 to the power 5. now expand this 9 twice and 9 5 times there now simplify two nines get cancel out like this so i get one above in the numerator and here how many nines are there according to first law nine to the power three left hand side what can you do using law 
,number 2 same base different powers division you subtract the powers 2 minus 5 2 minus 5 is minus 3. now what happens 9 to the power 3 is same as 1 over 9 to the power 3. so this negative 3 becomes positive 3 and it goes to the denominator here this is the numerator it goes to the denominator so minus 3 index becomes positive in the denominator now use that property so what's the left hand side using long number two three minus five you get minus two now we'll use normal division method a3 
,over a5 expand it three a's are there five ways are there now cross it out one two three so how many is that there 1 in the numerator a square so what happens negative 2 becomes positive 2 in the denominator write the negative indices as positive indices so what's the rule when there's negative it goes to the denominator as the 
,positive index 5 to the power minus 3 becomes 1 over 5 to the power 3 10 to the power minus 7 is 1 over 10 to the power 7 this one you get 1 over minus 8 to the power positive 2. negative power is there so how do you write as a positive power you have to write the reciprocal upside down 1 over a to the power positive 4 y to the 
,power minus 5 1 over y to the power plus 5 m to the power -3 1 over m to the power positive 3. so write the answer at once 1 over a to the power x negative power becomes positive power when you move to the denominator c to the power positive a x to the power minus a 1 over x to the power positive a 1 over y to the power positive b here z to the power minus c i can write 1 to the power z positive see so what's the law number 5 you can write any negative power you can write as positive power 
,by taking the reciprocal so it goes to the denominator numerator negative becomes positive denominator negative powers converted to positive powers by taking the reciprocal we say reciprocal numerator goes to the denominator look at this one 1 over 9 to the power minus 3 now the negative power is in the denominator so we'll rewrite this 1 divide by 9 to the power -3 1 we can write as 9 to the power 0 according to the law number 4. now according to law number 2 subtract the powers 0 minus minus 3 what happens so minus minus becomes positive so you get 9 to the power positive 3. left-hand side you get 1 over 9 to the power negative 3 now what happens when there is a negative power in the denominator it goes as the positive power of the numerator do this one also we can write as division 1 divided by 1 you can write 
,a to the power 0. now use subtraction minus minus 5 minus minus becomes plus you get a positive 5. now look at that one when there's a negative power in the denominator it becomes positive power in the numerator write these as positive indices so now negative power you can straight away write as positive power in the numerator here this one plus 2 minus 7 is the base this becomes plus 2 minus 8 is the base it becomes plus 3 minus 11 is the base this plus 8. a to the power minus 4 in the denominator a to the power plus 4 x to the power minus 3 becomes plus 3 when you take it to the numerator y minus 5 becomes plus 5. p minus 4 in the denominator becomes plus 4 in the numerator y plus 8 here now what's the law you can use the same law like before law number five but we'll take as law number six so law number six so 
,what's the law you get when there is a negative power in the denominator you can write as positive power in the numerator negative power in the denominator becomes positive in the numerator write these as positive powers so this one done for you this becomes positive x 15 to the power minus y in the denominator this becomes 15 to the power plus y x to the power minus a becomes plus a m to the power plus 6 q to the power plus y here a to the power plus a so negative power in the denominator 
,becomes the positive power in the numerator convert negative powers to positive powers 3 to the power -2 so this is in the numerator so what happens you are taking the reciprocal it goes down to the new to the denominator 3 squared you can write as 9 5 to the power -2 what can you write 1 over 5 square positive above we know 1 5 squared means 25 10 to the power minus 2 right as a positive power first 10 squared 1 over 10 square 10 squared means 1 10 times 10 100. so 1 over 100 this one minus 2 to the power minus 2. so 1 over minus 2 to the power plus 2. so what's that minus 2 times minus 2 you get positive 4 1 over negative 3 to the power 2 positive 2. what's negative 3 times negative 3 plus 9 minus 5 to the power minus 2 1 over negative 5 to the power positive 2. so minus 5 into minus 5 25 so 1 over 25 convert negative powers to positive powers and find the value now the negative power in the denominator it goes to the numerator as positive power 2 to the power 3 is 8 1 over 3 to the power minus 2 i can write 3 to the power plus 2 in the numerator 3 into 3 is 1 over 5 to the power minus 2 i can write 5 to the power plus 2 5 into 5 25 this one 10 to the power minus 2 in the denominator becomes 10 squared in the numerator sin squared is 100 4 to the power plus 2 in the numerator 4 times 4 60 11 to the power plus 2 in the numerator you get 121 convert to positive powers and find the answer so you have given 3 to the power minus 2 and 2 to the power minus 2 in the denominator what happens you switch switch upside down to take the positive power so 2 to the power minus 2 goes to the numerator this goes to down 2 squared is 4 3 squared is 9. we'll do the same thing switch 3 minus 2 in the denominator becomes 3 squared in the numerator this numerator goes down as the denominator with positive powers 3 squared is 9 5 squared is 25 7 to the power minus 2 goes down as the positive power 2 to the power -3 goes up as positive 3. 2 to the power 3 means 8 2 times 2 times 2 7 times 7 49 simplify now brackets are there so what you do first you need to multiply these two 3 times 2 6. now multiplication same base different powers you add the power so what's the answer 6 plus 3 becomes 9. this one again brackets brackets you multiply powers 4 times 2 8 e to the power minus 5 now multiplication with same base you add the powers 8 minus five you get positive three multiply the powers here minus three times minus two plus six now at the power six plus 
,3 9 p to the power minus 2 times minus 4 8. now at the powers 8 minus three you get five remove brackets and write the answer as positive powers minus two times three minus six now negative power in the numerator you can write as positive power in the denominator minus 3 times 2 multiply you get 6 you can write as a positive power by taking this reciprocal now see two terms are there you have to consider power for both a to the power three times minus 3 minus 9 b to the power 2 times minus 
,3 minus 6. now how you write as positive powers you take it down a to the power plus 9 b to the power plus 6 in the denominator consider the power for all this is like 2 to the power 1 multiply 2 to the power 2 and x to the power 3 times 2 6 and this is minus 6. now you can keep 2 to the power 2 is 4 in the numerator that's positive power only we can take the negative one down so answer is 4 over x to the power 6 this one take power 2 for both 3 to the power 1 times 2 2 y to the power minus 3 times 2 minus 6 3 squared you can write 9 that's in the numerator you don't need to change it but this negative 6 you can put it down as a positive power so y to 
,the power positive 6 this one again consider power for all 5 to the power 2 times 1 is 2 a to the power minus 4 times 2 minus 8. now 5 squared is 25 minus 8 power you can put it down and write a to the power 8. find the value when a equals 2 so first we'll simplify and then substitute 3 now here a into a so that means 2 squared 
,here you can substitute because that's a positive power 2 times 2 4 so 3 times 4 you get 12. this one inside you can substitute 3 times 2 and whole thing power 2. so 3 times 2 6 6 squared that's 36. this one a is negative first convert to positive power 5 over a3 a to the power 3 now substitute 5 over 2 to the power 3 what's 2 to the power 3 8 so 5 over 8. find the value when x equals 3 and y equals 2 we'll substitute 5 3 and 2 squared 2 squared is 4 4 times 3 12 12 into 5 60. substitute here 7 x is 3 3 squared and y is 2. 3 squared is 9 9 times 7 63 63 times 2 you get 126. this one 3 x squared that means 3 squared y squared is 2 squared now simplify 2 squared is four three squared is nine nine times four thirty-six thirty-six times three hundred eight three x y to the power three three x is three y is two two to 
,the power three two to the power three is eight three times three nine nine times 8 72 will simplify inside 2 into 3 into 2 squared 2 times 3 is 6 six times two two 
,twelve squared what's 12 squared hundred forty four twelve times twelve this one three x is three y is two whole thing square 3 times 3 9 9 times 2 18 18 squared what's 18 squared you have to multiply and see 18 times 18 10 and eight you get eight times eight sixty four eight times one eight eight plus six fourteen so when you add it you get three hundred twenty four now we look at review exercise in your textbook evaluate the following evaluate means find the answer 2 to the power 5. so you are multiplying 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 5 times you have to multiply what's the answer 32 minus three squared means minus three times minus three minus minus plus three times three nine plus nine minus four squared means minus four times minus four 4 times 4 16 and minus into minus also positive 2 3 squared that means you have to consider power for both here 1 1 2 squared over 3 squared so what's that 4 over 9 minus 3 to the power 3 minus 3 into minus 3 into minus 3 minus into minus positive positive into minus minus 3 times 3 9 9 times 3 27 minus 4 to the power 3 means minus 4 minus 4 minus 4 you get a negative answer here 4 times 4 16 16 
,times 4 you get 64. so minus 64 is the answer fill in the blanks x y whole thing square so you can separate it x y into x y then expand everything so x into y and here i'll write separately x into y x into y now how many x's x into x y into y so you can write x into x is x squared y into y is y squared this one p q whole thing power 3 so that means p q p q p q so you can write p into q p into q and p into q now 3p is separately 3 q separately so p to the power 3 n q to the power 3. 2 will be whole thing squared so you can write 2 a b into 2 a b now separate it 2 times a times b 2 times a times b now 2 twos two a's and two b's so you can write 2 to the 
,power 2 as 4 a squared and b squared 9 p squared q squared so 9 how can you write 3 squared so this one you can write 3 squared means 3 times 3. p squared is p times p q squared is q times q so we can separate 3pq 3pq twice so as a product power of a product you can write 3pq whole thing squared expand and write each of the following expressions as a product so expand first 2 a squared you can write a into a so that's the expanded form 3x squared y squared i can write 3 2 x's 2 y's minus 5 
,is there 2 p's and 1 q minus 3 to the power 5 you can write minus 3 5 times one two three four i'll write here the other minus three a b to the power three means a b a b a b three times now when you expand i can write a times a times a three times b times b times b three times x to the power four i can write x four times one two three four y to the power four means y four times one two three four example number one simplify the following same base different powers multiplication you add the power so this means power one so how you do that x to the power 2 plus 5 plus 1 8 like terms here you can add a squared and squared 2 plus 2. b you can add these two 2 and 3. so what you get a 4 b 5 3 plus 2 5. this one you can multiply the numbers 2 times 3 6. x you can add it 2 plus 5. so what's 2 plus 5 6 2 plus 5 is 7. so 6 x to the power 7 exercise 12.1 2 to the power 5 into 2 to the power 2. so you can write this one as 5 plus 2 addition 5 plus 2 becomes 7 4 and 2 same ways different powers multiplication you can add the powers 4 plus 2 4 plus 2 is 6. three terms here this is like power one so what's the addition three plus four plus one seven plus one you get eight five and three they are separately p to the power 3 and p to the power 1. so you can add 3 and 1. so what's the power 15 p to the power 4. this one you can write x squared and x 5 y 3 and y 5. now separately add 2 plus 5 and 3 plus 5 2 plus 5 you get 7 y 5 plus 3 that's 8. join each expression in column a with the expression in column b which is equal to it now see this is multiplication 7 plus 3 10 5 plus 2 7 7 plus 1 8 7 plus one here eight two plus two four four plus six ten and here two plus three five five plus two seven seven plus one eight so only these two question number three simplify and find the value so same base different powers multiplication you add the powers 5 and 5 10. now what's the value 3 times 3 times 3 like that 10 times you have to multiply so here we'll take three to the separate ones three to the power five what's the answer three times three nine nine times three twenty seven twenty seven times three eighty one eighty one times 3 243 so we'll take 243 into 243 because 10 times you have to multiply so 3 to the power 5 into 3 to the power 5 243 into 243 multiply first 200 40 and 3 put two zeros and multiply by two put zero and multiply by four multiplied by three and then add it you get 14 plus 620 10 19 what 59 000 forty nine this one seven square seven three seven one how many sevens seven to the power three plus two five five plus one six so what you do i can do 7 to the power 3 n 7 to the power 3. so what's 7 
,to the power 3 7 times 7 49 49 times 7. 343 so this is 343 into 343 so 340 and 3 multiplied by 3 multiplied by 4 and multiplied by three add it 11 76 49 so what's the value 117 649. simplify x is the base 6 plus 3 y x is the base 2 plus 2 4 4 plus 2 6 a is the base 3 plus 2 5 5 plus 4 9 2 is the coefficient here x to the power 3 plus 5 8. 5 times 2 10 p to the power 3 plus 2 5 4 times 2 8 8 times 3 24 x to the power 2 1 5 2 plus 1 3 3 plus 5 8 this one 2 there m m here these two 2 and 1 becomes 3 in in these 2 2 n 1 becomes 3 so 2 m to the power 3 n n to the power 3. now you can multiply the numbers two times three six six times five thirty thirty times two sixty eight terms two and this is one two and one that's 3. b terms b 2 and 3. that's 5. 2 plus 3. a pair of positive integral values that m and n can take so 
,that the equation x m into x n is equal to x eight wholes two is three and five for three plus five write all such pairs of positive integral values so what are the 
,possible values so one is they have given 3 and 5. then all positive ones one with seven two with six three with five given four with four five already given six seven eight so these are the possible values positive integral values for m and a so you can take other way around this is m m can be 3 1 2 4. now other way round you can take 5 and 3 this one other way round 7 and 1 this one 6 and 2. so this one you can't write again because m and n both are question number six write a value of a 
,for which the equation a squared plus 8 to the power 3 is equal to a to the power 5 holes if the statement is true and a value of a for which it is false so we'll check it a squared plus a 3 is equal to a 5 we'll substitute a equals 1 1 squared plus 1 to the power 3 is 1 to the power 5 1 squared is 1 1 squared is 1 cube is also 
,1 this is also 1 1 plus 1 2 this is not true so that's false and we substitute a equals zero zero squared plus zero cubed zero to the power five any power of zero is zero so you get 0 equals 0 that's true so when you substitute any value whole number the statement is false only when a equals 0 this statement is true example number 1 simplify the following expressions x to the power 5 into x squared i can write this one as x cube in the denominator numerator i can add the powers 5 plus 2 7 now you can subtract the powers and write 7 minus 3 that's 4. this question i can write 4x to the power 8 divide by 2x square 4 divided by 2 is 2. 8 and 2 this is division you can subtract the powers x to the power 6 8 minus 2 this one i can write numerator 3 plus 2 5 denominator you get 1. division you can subtract the powers 5 
,minus 1 that's 4. exercise 12.2 simplify using the laws of indices law number 2 division you subtract the powers 5 minus 3 that's 2 this is also division you can subtract the powers you can write 7 minus 2 is 5. 2 is there here i can write this one as this in the denominator 2 is there here division you can subtract the powers 8 minus 3 that's 5. 4p to the power 6 divide by 2 p to the power 3. 4 divided by 2 you get 2 6 and 3 you can subtract the powers because of division 6 minus 3 that's 
,3. this one 10 divided by 2 you get 5 5 and 2 powers you can subtract and write 5 minus 2 that's 3. numerator first you can add the powers because this multiplication 4 plus 2 6 and now we can subtract the powers x 6 minus 3 becomes 3. this one i can rewrite this n to the power 5 divided by n squared and n in the denominator now denominator you can simplify first this is multiplication you can add the powers 2 and 1 becomes 3. now you can subtract the powers 5 minus 3 you get 2 this one numerator i can write 2 times 2 4 x to the power addition of 3 and 1 that's 4. now divide by 4x 4 and 4 get cancel out this is 1 power so subtract the powers 4 minus 1 
,you get 3 this one i can write numerator 2 is there 5 plus 2 7 7 plus 6 13. denominator multiplication i can add the powers 7 plus 2 9. now simplify x terms 2 is there 13 minus 9. this one you can do separately is here and b is here subtract the powers 5 minus 2 three three minus two one this one two times two four you get p to 
,the power four and q to the power three denominator p1 and q1 now simplify p terms 4 is there 4 minus 1 you get 3. 3 minus 1 you get 2 for q question number 2 write 
,5 pairs of positive integral values for m and n which satisfy satisfy the equation e to the power m a to the power n e to the power eight subtraction is equal to eight so five pairs so we'll do what's the value we can take 9 and when you take 1 9 minus 1 you get 8. another one you can take 10 10 with 2 you get 8. so these all are positive integrals you have to write any power subtraction is 8 that's all you need to know 11 with 3 twelve width four so what are we did one two three four another one thirteen with five so you can write any number there question number three for each of the algebraic expressions in column a select the algebraic expression in column b which is equal to it and combine the two expressions using the equal sign so we need to simplify 2a to the power 5 divide by 2 a to the power 2 2 2 get cancelled out 5 minus 2 that's 3. so this is the set so this is equal so you can write 2 a 5 divided by 2a squared is equal to aq now we'll do the next one a to the power 6 and 4 you subtract the power so you get a squared this one a 6 divided by a 4 equals a squared when you simplify this one numerator first 7 plus 2 9 then subtract 6 9 minus 6 3. this one so i can write a to the power 7 a squared over a 6 is equal to a to the power 3. this one 3 and 1 subtract you get a squared a 3 over a equals a square simplify this one 4 get cancel out 5 and 1 6 6 minus 3 3. so you can write this one so what's the question 4 a to the power 5 into a over 4 a cubed is equal to a cube example number one evaluate the following to find out the value you need to write in positive powers so according to the law how can you write down 
,this one 1 over positive power in the denominator 2 to the power 5 is 32 so you get 1 over 32 now in the second question negative power in the denominator so convert to the positive power in the numerator 5 squared is 25 simplify so what you do 2 times 2 4 or you can write as positive powers 1 and 1 you get 2 to the power 2 x minus 2 n plus 3 addition 3 minus 2 you get 1 2 to the power 1 x to the power -4 now base 2 you can subtract the powers 2 2 and 2 1. so 2 minus 1 that's 1. x 1 minus minus 4. so 1 minus minus 4 becomes 1 plus 4 that's 5. so you get 5. so what's the final answer 2 x to the power 5. exercise 12.3 write each of the following positive indices with positive indices so negative power i can write positive power in the denominator this one positive power in the denominator 2 is just a number only the negative power i can write as positive power so 1 no need to write 5 is there only negative power of 2 i can write as a squared in the denominator 5 p squared both 
,are positive so keep those two only q term you can take it to the denominator this one is negative in the denominator so take it to the numerator with positive power 3 is there a to the power minus 2 you can write a square 2x is there and x to the power -4 i can write as positive power 4 now you can simplify 4 plus 1 that becomes 5 e is there 2 is already there those are positive powers only negative 3 goes up as positive 3. this one you take negative 2 power to the numerator 2 n to the power positive 2 or you can simplify and write m 2 squared that's 4 n squared when you expand 2 n into 2 n 4 n squared this one m is already there in the denominator t 
,minus 2 goes to the denominator with positive power p is there already q to the power minus 2 goes to the numerator as positive power of 2 x to the power -2 goes to 
,the denominator as positive power 2 is already there y to the power 2 goes to the numerator with positive power of 2 this one both negative so you switch 3y goes up 
,as positive 2 2 x goes down as positive 2. now expect 3 by squared means 3 squared y squared 2 x whole thing squared means 2 squared and x squared simplify 9 y squared over 4 x squared evaluate the following find the answer to find the answer you have to convert to positive power i can write 1 over 2 squared so that's 1 over 4 4 to the power minus 2 i can write it as 4 to the power 2. that's 16 negative 4 to the power plus 3 in the denominator so what's negative 4 times negative 4 times negative 4 4 times 4 16 16 times 4 64. you get negative 1 over 64 or you can write 1 over negative 64. minus sign either in numerator denominator or in front 2 to the power minus 7 i can write 2 to the power 7 in the denominator so what is 2 to the power 7 128 2 to the power 6 is 64. 64 times 2 128 3 to the power minus 2 i can write as positive 2. so what's that 1 over 9 3 squared this one i can use lower number 2 same base different powers division you subtract the powers 1 minus minus 2 that becomes plus so 5 to the power 3 5 times 5 25 25 times 5 125 10 to the power minus 3 1 over 10 to the power 3 what's what 10 to the power 3 that's thousand this one both negative switch upside down 3 to the power 2 goes to the denominator this goes to the numerator 4 squared is 16 3 squared is 9 you can write this as a mixed number 9 times 1 9 9 plus seven sixteen so seven over nine question number three simplify and write the answers with positive indices now negative two negative three adding you get negative five convert to positive power that's 1 over a to the power 5 2 minus 3 adding you get minus 1 convert to positive power that's 1 over a 2n minus 8 addition you get 2 minus 8 minus 6 and minus 5 here subtract the powers minus 6 minus minus 5 you get minus 6 plus 5 that's minus 1. so you get a to the power 
,minus 1 you can write as positive power 1 over a 2 times 3 6 minus 4 n plus 2 you get minus 2. now write as a positive power you keep 6 as it is only a squared goes 
,down 3 times 4 12 minus 2 minus 2 you get minus 4. how you write as positive power this power 4 goes down 10 divided by 5 you get 2 minus 5 minus 2 you get minus 7. 
,now write as positive power this goes down 4 divided by 2 2 minus 3 and minus 5 adding you get minus 8. now subtract the powers for division minus 8 minus 2 you get 
,minus 10 right has a positive power this goes down as positive 10. this one 2p is the term so what's the value here numerator minus 2 plus 3 that's 1. now subtract 1 minus 4 you get minus 3. so write as a positive power you write 2p whole thing square positive 3 if you want to simplify you can write 1 2 to the power 3 is 8 p 3 example number 1 simplify so you can just use laws of indices x to the power 0 you can take as 1 or you can just use the multiplication rule so here i'll do both ways if x is the x to the power 0 is 1 you get now subtraction of powers x to the power 5 7 minus 2 or you can do with 0 adding 0 plus 7 you get x to the power 7 over x 
,squared you get the same answer here anything to the power 0 that's what you don't need to simplify inside anything to the power 0 is 1. exercise 12.4 simplify the following expressions 8 minus 8 you get 0 x to the power 0 is 1. 4 minus 4 4 minus 4 0 anything to the power 0 1 3 plus 2 5 1 plus 4 5 5 minus 5 you get 0 anything to the power 0 is 1. 4 plus 2 6 here here 6 6 minus 6 0 y to the power 0 is 1 p to the power three plus five eight eight plus one nine six plus three nine now subtraction nine minus nine zero p to the power zero is one this one x to the power minus 4 minus 2 minus 6 minus 6 plus 6 0 why 8 minus 2 plus 6 6 minus 6 0 x to the power 
,0 is 1 1 to the here y to the power 0 is 1. answer is 1 evaluate the following 2 to the power 0 is 1 1 times 3 that's 3 any number to the power 0 is 1. the whole expression is 1 1 plus 1 you get 2. anything to the power 0 final answer is 1 5 to the power 0 is 1 1 plus 1 you get 2 anything to the power 0 is 1 anything to the power 0 is 1 anything to the power 0 is 1 1 minus 1 you get 0 here this is a b c to the power 0 that's what example number one simplify the following brackets you multiply the powers 5 times 2 10. now you can use addition rule 10 plus 1 that's 11. first multiplication 4 times 3 12. anything to the power 0 is 1. so the final answer is p to the power 12. this one you can consider power 2 for all 2 to the power 2 x to the power 2 times 2 4 y to the power 3 times 2 6 2 times 2 4 x to the power 4 n 
,y to the power 6 exercise 12.5 evaluate the following multiply the powers 4 times 2 8. what's 2 to the power 8 2 to the power 7 is 128 and multiply by 2 256 this one multiply the powers you get negative 2 convert to positive power by taking it down 3 squared what is 3 squared you get 9. 2 to the power 3 times 2 6. 2 to the power 0 is 1. what's 2 to the power 6 64 64 plus 1 you get 65 5 to the power 2 times negative 1 negative 2. 5 to the power negative 2 you can write as 5 to the power positive 2. what's 5 squared 25 1 over 25 plus 1 over 5 you have to find the lowest common multiple that's 25. so you have to take 1 this is multiplied by 5 so you do the same thing multiplied by 5 1 plus 5 6. over 25 multiply the powers 0 times 2 0 4 to the power 0 is 1 1 times 1 answer is 1. multiply the powers 2 times 2 4. 10 to 
,the power 4 means you put 4 zeros 10 000. simplify the x simplify the express using positive indices these expressions and using positive indices multiply the powers 3 times 4 12 this one minus 2 times 2 minus 4 you can't keep negative powers take it down and write down as a positive power this one consider power 2 for all a to 
,the power 4 b to the power 4 2 times 2 4 consider power for all 2 to the power 3 times 1 3 x 3 x 2 6 2 to the power 3 is 8 x 6. consider the powers first you can simplify division 5 minus 2 power 3. then consider power 3 there 3 times 3 9. this one you can consider separately a to the power 3 times 2 6 b to the power 2 times 2 4 negative power so how do you convert to positive power take upside down so n squared goes there m3 goes down and this is positive two now multiply the powers you get positive four and three times two six multiply the powers minus two times minus four plus eight this one 0 times 2 0 and a a to the power 0 is 1 1 times a you get 
,a miscellaneous exercise evaluate the following same base multiplication you add the powers 3 plus 2 5. and evaluate means you need to find out the value 5 to the power 5. 5 to the power 3 125 and then another 5 squared that's 25 so multiply this by 25 20 and 5. five times five twenty-five five times two ten plus two twelve five times one five plus one six so when you add it you get three thousand one hundred and twenty-five division subtract the powers 3 minus 2 you get 1 so answer is 5 same base multiplication at the powers 1 here 2 plus 1 3 what's 5 to the power 3 125 multiply the powers 5 to the power -2 convert to positive power it goes down as positive power 5 squared is 25 so 1 over 25 look at this one inside anything to the power 0 1 1 to the power 4 you get 1 numerator at the powers 3 minus 1 you get 2 this is multiplication powers 2 times 2 4. now subtract division becomes subtraction of powers 2 minus 4 you get minus 2 convert to positive power you put it down as 5 to the power plus 2 5 squared is 25 this one you have to do separately 5 squared 5 times 5 25 divide by 10 square 10 times 10 100 you can't use laws here because different bases now you can simplify 25 times 1 and here 4 you get 1 over 4 this one you can do 5 separately 2 minus 1 1 10 separately 3 minus 2 1 so 5 times 10 answer is 50. simplify the following power 2 there so you have to consider power 2 for everything 2 to the power 2 and x to the power 5 times 2 10 what's 2 to the power 2 
,4 4 x to the power 10 now consider power 3 for all you get 2 to the power 3 a to the power 3 and b to the power 3 times 2 6 2 to the power 3 is 8 a 3 b 6 this one 2 
,x is there consider power 2 for all 3 to the power 2 and x to the power 2 times 2 4. what's 3 squared 9 9 times 2 18. now here x powers you can add 1 plus 4 you get 
,5. this one consider power 3 for all 4 to the power 3 p to the power consider power 2 for all 2 to the power 2 p to the power 4 and q squared now like terms 4 to the power 3 4 times 4 times or you can simplify this one 4 to the power 3 p to the power 6. what's 2 to the power 2 that's 4. now simplify base 4 subtract the powers 3 
,minus 1 you get 3 minus 1 you get 4 to the power 2. 6 minus 4 for p you get p squared and q squared down so 4 squared is 16 p squared over q squared what about this 
,one consider power 3 2 to the power 3 p to the power 3 times 2 6 3 p q 2 to the power 3 8 and p is you can simplify 6 minus 1 division you subtract the power 6 minus 1 you get 5 and 3 q in the denominator what about this one take the power 2 2 to the power 2 a to the power 4 this one take power 2 for both 3 to the power 2 and b 
,to the power 2 times 2 4. now simplify a terms this 4 and this one subtract the powers 4 minus 3 4 minus 1 you get 3. b terms you can simplify 4 minus 3 you get 1 base 2 2 minus 1 you get 1 and what's remaining there 3 squared is 9 and 5 there so what's the final answer 2 times 9 18 a 3 b over 5. so we covered all theory related to indices what are the laws in indices when you get same base different powers multiplication you add the powers second one when you get same base different powers division you subtract the powers and when you get positive power you can write as a negative power taking the reciprocal and when you get brackets you multiply the 
,powers and any number to the base 0 is 1. so practice all these exercises and examples and thorough with indices

YTcjt2ODYwY,hello children today i'm here to teach you chapter 2 in your textbook that's called place value so i'll help you to read and write very large numbers this is important not only for children adults also can follow write all the digits used in writing numbers what are the digits we use we use 0 one two three four five six seven eight nine so these are the digits that we use to write numbers what is the name assigned to these digits what you call that hindu arabic number system hindu arabic number system how many digits are there in the number this one two four three five so you get four digits what about this one how many digits are there in this number 
,one two two digits are there what is the value of four in 47 so this is in tens place so when you take 47 we call the first digit to the right is one's place and this one we call tens place so what is the value of four there tens place means 40. what's the value of 7 7 is in the units place we call units or 1 same thing so this 
,is 7 means same number in the units place fill in the blanks in this table you get numbers value of the digit in tens place so here 3 is there in tens place so the value is 30. so 5 is in the ones place so the value is 5. now take a look at this one 53 so what's the value of the digit in tens place that's 50 units place is 3 the value is 3. when you take 83 8 is in tens place so the value is 80 and 3 is in the units place or ones place 38 3 in the tens place so that means 30 is the value 8 
,is in the units place or one's place that's 8. 74 70 is the value because this 7 is in the tens place 4 is in the ones place so you get 4 there 47 4 means tens place that's 40 7 is units place that's 7. fill in the blanks in this table digit intense place digit in one's place there so what's the value so we can write this is tens place and units place or ones place 38. this one 4 and 4 44 6 and 3 63 9 with 0 in the units place 9 0 90 7 and 7 77 9 9 99 what is the largest number that can be 
,obtained by using only two digits so you can use two digits so 99 is the largest two digit number fill in the blanks 38 you can write 30 plus 8 45 40 plus 5 92 how can you write 90 plus 2 76 70 plus 6 88 how can you write 80 plus 8 90 90 plus 0 57 50 plus 7. then what about this one 20 and 7 when you add you get 27 30 and 4 34 50 plus 9 59 60 plus 6 66 90 plus 9 99 10 plus 1 11 40 plus 7 47 so now you know numbers when you get tens place and ones place what is this this is called the abacus show 39 in the abacus so when you take the abacus so you get rods like this and counters you can put now this is one's place starting from the right hand side this 
,is one's place tens place when you increase the rods you can get hundreds place thousand plays like that you can increase when you get very large number you can increase the number of rods so what is the maximum number you can put in one rod maximum number of counters so that's nine when you put nine and if you want to show tell what you do you have to remove all these nine counters and put one in tens place so one and zero you get tens again if you want to show hundred what you do you put 
,nine and nine here that's 99 then you have to put one more so what you do you remove all counters in this one and this one and put one in the hundredths place so that's how you need to show the numbers now take a look at this one 39 so 9 is there in the ones place so you have to add 3 to the tens place to show this is 39. 293 so second rod already put nine counters so that's nine so in hundreds place that is 200 so you have to put two counters and in one's place you have to put three counters then the number shows as 293 so what is the maximum number of counters can be put into one rod in the abacus that's nine always nine counters we can put fill in the blanks how you get forty eight four tens and three not three eight once eighty three eight tens and three once seventy five seven tens and five ones 91 nine tens 
,and one once 42 four tens and two ones ninety nine tens and zero ones 57 five tens and seven once then other way around ten tens and eight ones so what you get ten tens that means ten times ten hundred and eight is there 108 that's little bit difficult because here 9 tens 90 9 times 10 ten tens means hundred hundred and eight ones seven tens seventy seventy and four seventy four nine tens and five ones ninety five one ten and one ones eleven three tens and three ones thirty three eight tens and eight ones eighty-eight nine tens and nine ones 90 9. fill in the blanks in this table number is given digit is given name of the position of the digit so 7 is 
,in tens place so position is tens tens place value represented by the digit that's 70 because that's in the tens place four here in the ones place so what's the value there that's just four nine here is in the tens place so you can write tens place yeah what's the value 90 6 here it's in the units place that i can write one's place so the value is 6 45 here 5 is in the units place or ones place and the value is 5. show the following numbers on an abacus 84. so one's place tenths place four 
,in the units place of ones place so four counters eight in ten small three four five six seven eight so 84 is that 37 three in tens place and seven in one's place one two three four five six seven this number 567 so 7 in one's place and sixth in tenths place and five in hundreds place so 567 495 5 in units place and nine in tenths place and four in hundreds place fill in the blanks in this table you have given number digit in tens place what's the digit in tens place that's seven digit in one's place that's three what's the value of tens place 70 and what's the value of one's place that's 3 73 84 8 is in the tens place 4 is in the units place or ones place so 80 is the value for tens place and 4 is the value for one's place 36 3 in tens place and 6 in the ones place so 30 is the value 6 is the value in the units place or ones place 52 now do it 5 is in the tens place 2 is in the ones place so 50 here and 2 here 33 same number but different values three three both three but tens place means thirty the value is different here three means just three what is the smallest number obtained by using three digits what's the smallest starting value with three digits that's 100 99 is the largest value for two digits and lowest value smallest number for three digits is hundred what is the largest number obtained by using only three digits 999. write the numbers given below in words so how we write down 257 so sometimes when you read we say and word 257 200 752 but when you are writing you don't need to put and so we can write 200 fifty seven two hundred seventy five seven hundred 50 2 understand how the value of 7 changes according to its position 7 is in units place so that's 7. here 7 is 7 t that's in tens place and here this 7 is in the hundreds place that 700 what is the largest number that can be written by using digits 3 4 5 7. so if you want largest you can start with the largest number 7543 so we are writing in order descending order highest to lowest when you want the highest value 7543 is the highest number or largest number so take a look at this one seven thousand five hundred forty three so when you take the last one that's in the ones place this is tens hundreds and thousands so what's the value of seven there this is thousands place so 7 000 is the value value of 5 this is in hundreds place 500 what's the value of 4 that's in tens place 40 and value of 3 that's in one's place that's 3. when you add it what you get you get this number that's 7500 write the values of these digits in 8495 value of 8 that's in thousands place eight thousand four is in hundreds place four hundred value of nine is in tenths place that's ninety value of five is in units place or one's place so when you add it together you get this number 8495 now we'll look at what are number zones or sometimes we call periods of numbers periods when there are there are large numbers they should be written in the periods take a look at this number so how we write down this one in periods when writing numbers in number zones or periods the digits must be written in groups of three this is important we write numbers in groups of three starting from the units place that's one's place leaving a small gap between these groups of three this is called numbers in standard form so how can we write down this number then so you can separate it like this three 3 like so you can write 24 leave a small gap and then 758 leave a small gap and 0 049 so very small gap you have to leave so sometimes we use commas so some countries they use commas to represent this one in standard form but the correct way of writing is without putting commas we put a small gap write the following numbers separated into periods so you have to start from one's place three three so how can you write down two and 758 and then 403 this one starting from here groups of 3 50 490 and leave a gap 872. this one three three and another three here six then leave a gap 735 
,leave a gap 784 leave a gap 572. this one starting from here groups of three 684 358 427 leave a gap here after every three digits here you get 5 272 907 428 three digits here 200 zero four five forty five and zero zero eight so these are in standard form divided into periods now look at this one period given so what's the first one unit saw once then thousands millions we call the next three digits millions and billions after that so what's the next one trillions so you need to know correct terms units thousands millions and billions and trillions so what's the number here starting from here you can write 0 0 1 then thousands 600 there and 054 millions and 40 billion how can we read this number 40 billion 50 million six hundred thousand one what about this one zero seven four in one's place units place zero four 
,eight in thousands 254 4 in millions and 143 in billions how we read this number 143 billion 254 million forty eight thousand seventy four this one zero eight nine 438 zero seven five eighty-three eighty-three 75 million 438 thousand 89. zero zero seven zero zero four zero zero two six six billion two million four thousand seven three hundred and eight 241 and 403 there and 75 75 billion 403 million 241 308 using 3794 digits what is the largest number that can be written so when you want the largest number we write in descending order largest to smallest 9743 9743 is the largest number using the digits shown above what is the smallest number that can be written so we write other way around starting from smallest value 3479 is the smallest number you can write right how the numbers given below are read 384 300. 80 
,4 5 four eight this is in thousand let's play five thousand five thousand two hundred forty eight here this one twenty three thousand seven hundred four this one two seven three one not four two hundred seventy three thousand two hundred seventy three thousand hundred five so when you call sometimes a hundred and five hundred and five but we don't write and write the numbers given below using numerical digits 439 439 48 000 so 48 300 21 three hundred twenty four thousand three hundred twenty four thousand two hundred 30 3 million now in the next period 3 million 400 498 200 24 so make sure that you put a small gap complete the table given below number 
,in words and number there 158 158 this one how you read 2 000 100 seventy five this one how you write three thousand three thousand six hundred eighty four this one 
,how you read 28 000 five hundred thirty-one this one two hundred forty four thousand two hundred forty four thousand six hundred 672 this one what's that thousand then the next one is million five million six hundred seven thousand six hundred 7 000 then 607 321 this one 6 million 224 224 000 38 38 so you have to put it 0 there 
,38 write the largest number that can be written using digits 2 3 5 8. so what we do starting with largest digit eight five three two right the smallest number can be written using digits five nine one three smallest means we have to start with the smallest digit one three five nine how many digits can be written in a period what's the maximum three write this number in periods with a small space so you have to separate it from right hand side 3 and then 27 27 small gap 946 small gap and then 826 look at this abacus in the above abacus how many counters can be put in one rod so we know that 9 is the maximum number of rods because this is in base 10 9 is the number of maximum number of counters we can put write down the number in the abacus ones place three one two three four five six and nothing means we put zero here three this is one two three four five and two so what's that two hundred and fifty three thousand sixty three how many digits can be written in a period that's maximum three write this in periods with a small gap how can you write down here here so 27 9 4 6 8 2 6 with a small space in between periods complete the table given below showing the correct number periods standard form you have to divide into groups periods 478 small gap and then 524 number inwards how we read this 478 thousand four hundred seventy eight seventy eight thousand five hundred twenty four five hundred no need to write and twenty four this one leave gaps here here and here two seven two one five seven three when you make groups like this we can easily identify whether it's thousand or million or billion so here this is thousand this is million 2 million 721 700 21 000 573 next one three here and four forty two and four seven nine that means 42 000 four hundred seventy nine look at this number three three here three eight four six two eight five so this means three million three million eight hundred forty six thousand eight hundred forty six thousand 285 200 880 85 this one three here three here five one two four seven nine five hundred twelve thousand five hundred twelve thousand four hundred seventy nine four hundred seventy nine this number three three so two one two three zero seven two two million seventy two 2 million 70 2. this one here three here three here seven then one two five zero three four seven million 125 100 225 thousand thirty four so that's how we write down numbers in words and how we pronounce it write using numerical digits 
,204 thousand 204 thousand five hundred twelve five hundred twelve three million four hundred four four hundred four thousand twenty six zero two six eighteen million eighteen million five hundred four thousand five hundred and four thousand two hundred thirty five six billion now billion six billion two hundred four 204 million 
,348 thousand 900 for so that's how we write down the number write the names of the periods so we'll take this number five five five same number but the place value is different so what you call this period once this one thousand and this one is then million and this one is billion and if it's further that's trillion so how we write this number 555 billion 555 million 555 000 555 so that's how we read the number so you can write 5 100 50 5 first billion then this one 500 fifty five million then again five hundred fifty five thousand five hundred fifty-five five hundred fifty five same number but the place value is different write the following large numbers in digits 148 million 148 million eight hundred four thousand three hundred fifty two six billion now six billion 834 834 500 22. 522 000 then 413 430 try to write this one 26 billion 26 billion eight million eight million means here you can this billion eight million means zero zero eight eight million nine thousand again 
,thousand place so here you can put zero zero nine nine thousand nine nine also zero zero nine so 26 billion eight million nine thousand nine 204 million 204 million 
,402 402 300 four so that's how we write down large numbers write the following large numbers in words three three three so this is million thousand and units two hundred eight so that's in million so million 424 400 twenty four four hundred twenty four thousand five hundred nineteen this one is again million 600 73 million then 
,258 thousand two hundred fifty eight thousand seven hundred 35 this one now this is million and this is billion two billion four hundred sixty eight million and then 320 300 20 9 thousand five hundred 12 right inwards what's this number one digit one one zero we call ten one zero zero hundred one with three zeros thousands one with four zeros ten thousand and one with five zeros hundred thousand one with six zeros we call it one million and one with seven zeros 10 million here this is 100 million and what's this one this is 1 billion number of zeros in million we know that six zeros one three zeros three zeros so this is hundred thousand this is one million number of zeros in billion one two three four five six seven eight nine nine zeros what about number of zeros in trillion trillion means one one two three one 
,two three one two three here and another one two three three three three three so you get 12 zeros for one trillion write the following numbers in periods so you can separate it like this two four eight five four six seven two million four hundred and eighty five thousand four hundred and sixty seven forty seven million eight hundred and fifty nine thousand hundred seventy two three three three two billion thirty four million hundred and seventy two thousand seven 333 what's that 957 million 284 1228 2 billion now 2 billion three million twelve thousand four hundred seventy nine three three here three so what's that 51 billion 831 million 217 thousand 
,572 write the following numbers in ascending order ascending means smallest to largest so what's the smallest number here look at this is thousands place so this is 
,the smallest one two seven eight four one four then this is also thousand place next number eight one four three five six then this is million so four million next and seventy three hundred and twelve here this is six million that's the largest one two five eight three naught four look at this one this is in thousands place so that's the lowest one two four eight nine five four that's the lowest one then when you take millions two million is the next one then 3 million value is the third one and finally 4 million value look at carefully the other one what's the lowest all these these two millions and these two thousand so this is the lowest four not seven one five seven is the lowest one next five six eight four two eight then millions two million is next and here 3 million so always starts with the smallest to largest that's called ascending order write down the smallest and largest numbers that can be written using following digits smallest start from the smallest 2 4 yeah 
,how many digits are there one two three four five six so two four five six seven eight that's the smallest largest other way around starting with the largest value eight seven six five four two this one one two three four five six six digits are there smaller starting from the lowest two then four six two four six then seven seven nine seven seven nine two four six seven seven nine what's the largest starting from the other way around nine seven seven six four two is the largest how many digits here one two three four five six seven eight eight digits are there so what's the smallest 2 and then 3 after that 4 5 6 4 5 6. four five six then seven eight nine seven eight nine that's the smallest one largest one is the other way around nine eight then seven six five four three two place value so look at this number three three and one so the last one to the right is units place so that's one one times 5 what's the value that's 5. 10 times 5 second 5 is 50. third one is 5 times hundred that means five hundred fourth one is five times thousand that's five thousand fifth one five into ten thousand fifty thousand is the value five into hundred thousand five hundred thousand is the value for the next five and this one means 5 into 1 million that means 5 million when you add it you get five five so what's the 
,value here five million five hundred fifty five thousand five hundred and fifty five write down the place value of the following digits so place value you need the value for this digit so 4 is in hundreds place so 400 is the place value this is in hundreds place three so 300 is the place value here eight in thousand place so eight thousand this is seven means 70 000 here 7 is again 70 000 and 9 here is 900 this one nine here so how many zeros two three four five six nine million this two means two thousand here this one two means two thousand eight here is units place eight this is zero means no value zero times ten thousand is zero there's no value for zero there this one five means five thousand this is in thousands place fill in the blanks number digit and place value 7 here 7 here that means 700 000 is the place value 5 five is here that means fifty thousand one one is here so what's that one and how many zeros one two three four five six seven one two three four five six seven three four five six seven so that means 10 million eight here eight with six zeros eight million seven is here how many zeros one and seven one two three and 
,here another zero here four five another three zeros three three one so all together seven zeros so that means this is seventy million five here is five hundred and 
,here 0 means this place so what's the value for 0 nothing that's 0 no value for zero there are eight cards with digits one to eight select only three cards and write down five different numbers that you can create write the number in words as well so here three cards only three cards so you can start with one okay i'll write one two three so only five different numbers i'll take one two three four five six then five six seven six seven eight and then seven eight one any three digits take it and write down the number in word what you call this 123 100 twenty three this one four hundred fifty six four hundred fifty six this one five hundred sixty seven five hundred sixty seven this one six hundred seventy eight six hundred seventy eight this one seven hundred eighty one seven hundred eighty one select six cards and 
,write down six different numbers that you can create write the numbers in words as well so what are the digits one two eight so six digits one two three four five six two three four five six seven three four five six seven eight you can create any six digit number four five six seven eight one then five six seven eight one two and i can write 6 7 8 1 2 3. so how we read this number 123 hundred twenty three thousand four hundred fifty six this one 234 thousand five hundred sixty seven 345 thousand six hundred six hundred seventy eight next one 456 thousand seven hundred eighty-one next one 567 thousand 812 last one 678 600 eight thousand one hundred 23 
,so you can write any six digit number there show the following numbers on an abacus so starting from one's place eight is the ones place one two three four five six 
,seven eight then seven in tens place one two three four five six seven five in hundreds place one two three four five then four in thousand plays one two three four 
,and three in ten thousands place one two three so that's how we show starting from units place to ten thousands place this number we can start from one's place three in one's place eight in tens place and nothing means here nothing then four in thousand place three in ten thousand place five in 100 000 place and 3 in million place next one starting from units place 5 in units place 1 2 3 4 5. then nothing means here in tens place 4 in hundreds place and then 2 in thousands place 7 in 10 thousands place 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and then 2 in 100 thousands place 2 this is this and then 4 in 1 million nothing there in this one and here 100 million there's three fill in the blanks you have given billions period millions thousands units number in standard form so how you write units place 238 and one in the thousand place 1238 this one 219 and then 297 in thousands period this one 5 1 4 here then nothing in thousands place and here 2 million is there 0 8 9 one two three thousands place and seven in millions place 109 308 in thousands place and 204 in millions place this one 720 18 units place 214 and 145 and 63 billion 119 here 508 409 and 7 billion here 095 units and 178 272 million and 175 billions this one zero one two 275 417 and 1 1 billion is there now we'll look at example in your textbook example number one number is 45 digit is 4 name of the position of the digit 4 means tense value represented by the digit that's 40 45 5 is the digit that's in one's place or units place you can right and what's the value that's just 5. 30 and 0 is in one's place and what's the value nothing means you can't write a value there exercise 2.1 complete the following table digit in the ones place that's three here six zero eight digit in the tens place so these are the numbers six 7 4 8 value represented by the digit in the ones place so here these ones so same value 3 6 0 8 but when it comes to tens place you have to write down 60 here 70 40 and 80. example number one write down the value represented by each digit in the number five nine six eight eight ones are there so that means one into eight just you have to write down the value once one into eight that's just eight six tens are there six into ten i'll write other way around six tens ten into six that's sixty nine hundreds hundreds into nine 
,that's nine hundred and five thousand thousand into five five thousand so when you add it together you get five thousand nine hundred and sixty eight exercise two point two in the number nine nine six not one what is the value represented by nine which is position fourth from the right one two three four this one so what's the value nine thousand what is the place value corresponding to the position of zero so place value is zero nothing means zero but it's in tens place third one what is the value represented by zero that's 0. here position is we'll write tens place then fourth one what is the value represented by 9 which is positioned fifth from the 
,right this number so that's the value is 90 000. question number two complete the following table number digi name of the position of the digit nine that's in hundreds place hundreds value represented by the digit nine hundred nine here that means tens place value is ninety five is in hundreds place so 500 is the value 7 is in tens place that's 70 five here in tenths place that's fifty four is in thousands place so the value is four thousand two is in one's place and value is two one is in 
,what's the value ten thousand so value is 10 000. 0 here is in 100th place the value is zero hundred times zero five is in thousands place value is five thousand question number three write down all the numbers of three positions that can be written using each of the digits four five 8 exactly once for each of these numbers write down the place value corresponding to the position of 8 and the value represented by 8. so 3 numbers so we'll start from 8 first 8 5 4 and also we can change this 
,eight four five then i can take eight to tens place four eight 5 now i can change these two 5 here and 4 here now i'll take this one to units place and four five here or five four now these are all possible numbers and you have to write down for each of these numbers write down the place value corresponding to eight so what's the place value for these that's eight hundred and the value represented by eight this is value this is hundreds place these two in tens place and the value is 18 and 
,these two units place or one's place and the value is eight question number four using each of the digits two four five nine exactly once write down the largest possible number of four positions and the value represented by each digit in that number largest possible number 9 5 4 2 and you have to give the value for each digit so 9 you can write just the nine you need nine means thousand place that's nine thousand five is 500 and 4 means 40 and 2 means 2 when you add it you get 9542 and the 
,second part the smallest possible number of four positions and the value represented by each digit so what's the lowest number starting from 2 2 4 5 9. so 2 means 2 
,000 4 digit means 400 that's the place value 5 means 50 and 9 means one's place that's nine when you add it you get 2 400 exercise 2.3 write down each of the following numbers in standard form standard form means you keep a space after every three digits 72 350 here 55 0 000 55 000. 0 here's three so 27 201 125 3 3 3 300 0 0 one two seventy nine this one three here three three two hundred ninety nine zero zero zero zero zero one 3 here 3 so 21 3 4 5 6 9 9. write down each of the following numbers which have been separated into periods in words so you have to write down the value in words okay so we'll write here 10 billion 40 million five hundred thousand that's all nothing in units place second one 4 billion 750 million fifty thousand fifty thousand two thousand no units third one one billion 10 million hundred thousand five hundred and the fourth one 75 billion 4 million 350 000 thousand three hundred fifty thousand 50 write down each of the following numbers in standard form and then write them in the table separated into periods so we'll take this one units here first one here units 735 then 76 second one 3 here 657 and here 864. third one three three 812 769 and 27 769 and 2 million fourth one 3 3 47 million 867 690 333 763 156 561 this number 3 here 3 3 6 billion also there 6 billion 746 9 7 1 two five six the last one three three two billion seven hundred 230 that's wrong that's not billion that's this means to here 2 million 765 231 so what's the number here if you write down the number this is 76 7 3 5 8 eight six four eight six four six five seven and here two separately 2 7 6 9 8 1 2 here 47 806 690 763 156 561 
,this is 6 746 971 250 six then the next one two here 765 two three one so those are the numbers now we'll try to write down the number in words now we'll write down 
,the numbers in words so what's the first one here thousands place so first one seventy six thousand seven hundred thirty five second one i'll put numbers here one two three four five six seven so second one what's the number eight hundred 64 thousand 657 600 50 7. next number two million two million seven hundred 69 thousand sixty nine thousand eight hundred twelve eight hundred 12 fourth one 47 million 47 million 800 sixty-seven thousand six hundred nineteen fifth one 763 million seven hundred sixty three million hundred fifty six thousand hundred fifty six thousand 100 100 doesn't matter 156 thousand or 156 thousand 561 five hundred sixty one next one six billion six billion six billion seven hundred forty six thousand nine hundred seventy one thousand 971 256 200 50 6. and the last one two million 765 thousand 
,two hundred thirty-one two hundred thirty one so that's how we write down these numbers write down each of the following numbers in standard form and write down the 
,name of the number as well here three three three so 50 800 435 three zeros so what's the name this is million this is billion 50 billion 800 million 435 000 nothing in units place tau set next one you need to separate it 500 800 this and 43 43 leave a gap and then 0 5 0 800 500. so what's the period this is billion 43 billion 50 million eight hundred thousand five hundred this number three three three five hundred and eighty five zero zero zero four hundred and thirty this means millions five hundred eighty five million and then 430 400 30 this number 3 here 3 3. so you can write in standard form like this 283 so how you rate this number 300 million 300 million one thousand one thousand two hundred eighty three this number how you write in standard form 299.003 so this is millions 200 99 million three this number three three three have you read 200 so here i'll write down the number two seven two zero zero zero zero two three two hundred seventy two million twenty three this one three three three three hundred two hundred and zero three zero zero zero zero so now it's billion hundred billion 200 million 30 000 that's all no units place 
,30 000. this one five i'll write here five five three zero zero zero zero zero zero that's million i'll write down that i can write down 553 million five hundred fifth t three million that's all this one zero zero zero 47 zero zero zero zero zero five that's also million forty seven million five question number five write the following numbers which have been given in words in standard form four hundred five thousand four hundred five thousand 325 325 500. third one four million four million eight hundred thousand eight hundred thousand fourth one six billion sixty million sixty million sixty million so this is million and this is billion 60 million fifth one 18 million 18 million twenty four thousand twenty four thousand zero two four twenty four thousand fifty so twenty four thousand fifty look at this question 
,the distance between the earth and the sun is this in kilometers write this number in standard form and write it in words too so we'll separate it into groups of three hundred and forty nine five nine seven eight seven zero kilometers so how you read this this is in millions 100 40 9 million five hundred ninety seven thousand eight hundred seventy question number seven a businessman plans to deposit receipt this much in a bank how does he write this amount in word on a bank so when you go to the bank you need to write the amount in words so it's really useful to know how to write it properly three three two fifteen zero zero six five hundred this is in rupees how we read that 15 million 15 million six thousand five hundred rupees miscellaneous exercise write down each of the following numbers by expanding in terms of the place value as shown in the example so 6745 means six thousands seven hundreds four tens and five ones so we'll write down this one 24 that means two tens and four ones how you write 40 that means 4 tens and 0 once third one 546 500 4 tens and 6 once seven one six three seven thousand and one hundreds and then six tens and three once and what's the last one nine two fifth one fifth one nine two six five one six five one so that means nine ten thousand and then two thousands and six 
,hundreds plus and five tens plus one once complete the following table number is given digit 3 you have to look at it place value of the digit hundreds place what's 
,the value represented by that it's 300 9 that's in tens place the value is 90 2 here is in thousands place this is 1000 ten thousand hundred thousands place hundred 
,thousand so the value is two hundred thousand eight ten thousand place ten thousand the value is eighty thousand four here that's in millions place so what's the value 4 million question number 3 using each of the digits eight six five three one exactly once write down the largest possible number of four positions only four positions and value represented by three in the number so the largest number will take the largest digit and six five three eight thousand six hundred fifty three so what's the three represent three is in one's place and the value is three then second one the smallest possible number so you can start from 3 5 6 4 position value and 
,now 3 is here 3 is in hundreds place and the value is 300 for that write the following numbers in standard form and write also how they are read here three three four fifty zero fifty so how do we read that number four hundred fifty thousand fifty 450 050 this one 37 and 504 537 have you read that 37 million 37 million 500 504 thousand five hundred thirty seven this number two one two three four five six nine nine so how you read that two hundred twelve million 345 340. five thousand six hundred ninety nine what is this number eight four three two one not nine six four zero now it's billion eight billion four hundred thirty-two million hundred nine one hundred a hundred nine thousand six hundred forty this number three three three two zero zero three zero four zero zero five zero what's the number two billion three million forty thousand 50 this number zero two 143.021 zero zero zero this is million hundred one hundred a hundred forty 3 million then 21 000 20 one thousand what is the smallest number that can be written using three different digits which has the millions period as its last period write this number in words too the smallest number but millions also there so million and what is the small number that we've written using three different digits so if you want the smallest number you can take 0 1 2. so 0's you can put here and then this is thousand this is one million and two so this is the number the smallest number that you can create with three digits so what you call that one million two question number six what is the greatest number which has the billions period as its last period write this number in words too so largest one we can take digit nine nine nine nine this is in billions period nine nine nine millions nine nine nine thousand nine hundred and ninety nine so 
,this is the largest number we can write so how we write in words 900 99 billion 900 ninety nine million nine hundred ninety nine thousand nine hundred ninety nine that's how you read the number so we covered all theory related to place value now i hope that you know how to read and write large numbers and how to find out the place value

XIsJmSTjTdg,hello children today i'm here to teach you chapter 5 in your textbook that's indices so we'll look at what are indices take this 1 3 into 3 so you need the number how many times you multiply 3 1 2 3 4 5 6. instead of this we can write 3 6 times like this 3 to the power 6. so this one 3 to the power of 6 or 6 power of 3 so we call this is index notation so this is index notation so the number above this three we call the index index is the singular term indices is the plural index and the number here we call that's the base so base 3 and the index 6 3 to the power of 6 write as index notation so base is 9 now 1 2 3 4 5 6 9 to the power 6 base is 10 1 2 
,3 4 5 10 to the power 5 1 2 3 4 base is minus 3 to the power of 1 2 3 so negative 7 to the power of 3 and 0.3 is the base so 0.3 to the power 1 2 3 that's to the power 3. so that's how we write down these terms expanded version to index notation so some more examples 2.7 is the base so you can write 2.7 to the power of 3. one two three four five half to the power of five three fifths is the base now three fifths to the power of 1 2 3 so power of 3 minus 11 is the pace now to the power of 1 
,2 3 4 to the power of 4 here and minus 2.5 yeah i'll put all minus 2.5 that's the base to the power of 1 2 3 to the power of write these in expanded form the other way round eight to the power of three that means eight three times eleven to the power of four eleven four times nine to the power of five nine five times minus 11 to the power of 4 so you get minus 11 minus 11 11 and minus 11 1 2 3 4 and 5 8 to the power of 3 so you can write 5 over 8 5 over 8 and five over eight so three times 
,some more questions minus two point eight three times minus two 2.8 minus 2.8 and another minus 2.8 13 to the power 5 13 5 times 3 four five minus two sevens three times minus two over seven minus two over seven and another minus two over seven three times minus 37 to the power of four that means four times you have to write minus 37 twice three times and four times and three to the power five three five times so that's how we write index notation to expanded form powers that the base is an algebraic symbol so consider a a is an unknown term not equal to zero so what can you write this one one two three four five a to the power five so five is the index and a is the base so why this is cannot be 0 it's not defined now the term a if it's 0 what happens 0 to the power 5 0 0 5 times 0 so a is not equal to 0 any number you can write here so this is a general notation expand this one a to the power 3 a 3 times x to the power 4 x 4 times y to the power 5 by 5 times minus 8 to the power minus a to the power 4 and minus b to the power 3 so you get minus b minus v minus b so three times you have to multiply write in index notation now the other way around so 2 is there but it's not 2 is there but it's just once a how many times 1 2 3 so you get a to the power 3. now when you are multiplying this with a constant coefficient there so you don't write down the multiplication so you can just write 2a to the power 3 2 once and a 3 times this one 3 twice there 3 to the power 2 and how many x's are there 1 2 3 3 x's so how do you simplify this 3 squared 3 times 3 or you can write so no need to expand index notation so 3 square r and x cubed this one five how many times one two three five three times and b only once and a 1 2 a twice so 5 3 times a twice and 1 b so you can write this one as 5 to the power 3 a squared and b you can change the terms all is not important 5 to the power 3 a squared and b write as indices similar to the above 1 2 3 7 to the power 3 x is 1 2 x square this one three squared three twice are there and a twice b twice a squared b squared this one nine twice then p twice and q twice so power two so when you are writing down expressions make sure that the number you write first then the letters 11 3 times and m twice and in twice this one excess how many x's are there one two two x's how many y's one two three three y's and how many z's are there one two two z's write the followings in expanded form now we'll expand all these x to the power 3 x x x 3 x 2 to the power 3 1 2 3 and x squared means x and x two x's seven to the power four means you need to write four sevenths and then y squared y and what 2 squared a to the power 3 b squared 2 twice a 3 times and b twice 11 squared y cubed and z squared 11 twice y three times and z twice some more questions a squared b squared c squared a twice b twice and c twice c three times not twice c three times x cube y and z squared x three times y once and z twice seven p squared q to the power three are seven ones p twice and then q three times and then r once a squared bc a twice b ones and c ones x y squared z x once y twice and z what's finding the value of a power through substitution now we see how we can find the answer by substituting values so you need to find out the value of 2a squared when a equals 3. so what we do you write down this and then you can substitute a equals 3 that means 3 squared now find the answer 2 is there 3 squared means 3 times 3 that's 9. so 9 times 2 you get 18 as the answer find the value of 5 a squared b when a equals 3 and b equals to 5 a squared b now substitute 5 a is 3 i can write 3 
,squared and b equals 2. now find out separately 5 3 squared means 3 times 3 that's 9 times 2. so 5 times 2 10 10 times 9 90. this one 7xy square x equals 4 y equals 
,3. first substitute 7 instead of x i can write 4. instead of y i can write 3. now 7 times 4 3 times 3 9. so what's the answer 7 times 4 28 28 times 9 72 here 9 times 2 18 18 and 7 you get 25 the answer is 252 find the value of 11 p squared q squared when p equals 2 and q equals 1. now we'll substitute p is 2. so 2 squared q is 1 1 squared so 11 2 squared means 2 times 2 that's 4 1 square 1 to the power any number is 1 1 to the power 100 is also 1. so 11 times 4 you get 44. look at the other one a squared b c square so substitute the values a square that means 3 squared b is 2. c squared c squared means 5 square now 3 squared is 9 2 and 5 squared is 25 
,now what's the easiest way to multiply you can't yeah 2 times 25 50. 50 times 9. 450 this one x cube y square x equals half y equals 4 x is half so half to the power 3 y means 4 to the power 2. now when you are taking the fraction power 3 consider for both numerator and the denominator so you get 1 to the power 3 is 1 and below 
,2 to the power 3 what's 2 to the power 3 2 times 2 times 2 that's 8. and here you get 4 square now simplify 4 squared 4 times 4 16 and below 2 times 2 times 2 that's 8. 16 divided by 8 you get 2. find the value of this 36 a b squared when a equals one third equals half 36 a b squared so 36 times a is one third p is half half squared so i get 36 one third is there so this one 1 squared is 1 2 squared is 4 4 in the denominator 2 squared now simplify 4 times 9 36 3 times 1 and 3 times 3. so what's the answer you get 3 as the answer find the value of x cube y over 9 when x is 3 y equals 11. x is three so three to the power three eleven is there divide by nine what's three to the power three three times three times three that's twenty now simplify 9 times 1 9 times 3 3 times 11 you get 33 find the value of this one 7 a squared b c cube it's given a is 3 b is 2 and c is 1. so any power of 1 is 1 first we'll do 3 squared 3 times 3 you get 9 and this is 1. so you get 7 times 2 fourteen fourteen times nine nine times four thirty-six nine times one nine plus three twelve so hundreds twenty-six find the value of this one 16 m squared over n cube when m is 3 and n is 2. now we'll simplify 16 3 squared 3 times 3 9. 2 to the power 3 2 times 2 times 2 that's 8. now simplify you get 8 times 1 8 times 2 9 times 2 get 18. find the value of a squared b squared c squared here we'll change this to b squared here because it's given b square now substitute 4 squared let's be 3 and c 
,2 squared 4 squared means 16. 4 times 4. 3 times 3 you get 9. and below 2 times 2 means 4 so 4 times 1 4 times 4 9 times 4 36 now this is different write the number 
,81 as an index of three so we can divide and see how many threes are there when you take 81 divide by 3 3 times 2 6 and 21 that's 7 again divide by 3 you get 9 divided by 3 again you get 3 and again you get 1 till you get 1 you divide how many threes are there one two three four three four times so how can you write in index notation 3 to the power 4 is 81. right 5 to the power 3 into 5 to the power 2 expanded and as an index of 5 so what is 5 to the power 3 means 3 times 5 squared means 5 
,twice now all together how many fives are there 1 2 3 4 5. so you can write instead of 5 to the power 3 and 5 to the power 2 you can write 5 to the power 5. write a 
,3 and a 4 expanded and as an index notation a to the power 3 means 3 times you have to multiply a to the power 4 means 4 times now count all together how many a's are there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 to the power 7 write the value of x squared minus y squared if x equals 5 and y equals 3. first expand it and now we'll multiply 5 times 5 minus 3 times 3. 5 times 5 25 3 times 3 9 now subtract you get 16 as the answer write the value of a square plus b squared plus c squared if a equals 3. so we write down and b equals 2 and so we need to substitute b b equals 2. so 2 squared and c squared that means 5 square you have to do separately and add it 3 squared 3 times 3 
,nice 2 squared 2 times 2 5 squared means 5 times 5 25 now add all together 9 plus 4 13 25 and 13. just add it 38 is the answer write the value of x squared plus y squared over z if x equals 5 y equals 3 z equals 2 so substitute x equals 5 5 squared y is 3 3 squared over z is 2. now expand 5 squared means 5 times 5 that's 25 3 squared 3 times 3 that's 9. now when you do division first you have to simplify the numerator 25 plus 9 what's the answer 9 plus 5 is 14 and you get 3. so 25 and 9 when you add it 34 and divide by 2 now what's the answer 2 times 1 and for 14 that's 7. so 17 is the answer complete the following table power is given so what's the base they are 3 is the base index is 2 and the value is 3 squared means 3 times 3 9. now we'll do this one base is 5. power is 2 index is 2 so that means 5 times 5 you get 25 2 to the power 4 base is 2 index is 4 so 2 4 times what's the answer 2 times 2 4 4 times 2 8 8 times 2 16 7 square base is 7 index is 2 7 times 7 you get 49 
,6 to the power 3 base is 6 index is 3 6 into 6 into 6 6 into 6 36 36 into 6 260. 11 square basis 11 and index is 2 11 times 11 that's the answer 1 21 10 squared base is 10 index is 2 10 times 10 that's hundreds 4 to the power 3 this is 4 index is 3 4 3 times 4 times 4 16 16 times 4 that's 64. we'll check it at 64. write the value of 3 squared over a4 when a equals to 3 squared 3 times 3 a to the power 4 means 2 to the power 4. now what is 2 to the power 4 we know that you can do it at once 
,2 times 2 4 4 times 2 8 8 times 2 16. 3 times 3 9 and then 16. so what's the answer you can't simplify further you get a fraction 9 over 16. find a if 80 equals 2a now this is aldevera so how can we find out this one we'll take the number and see how many twos are there when you divide by 2 you get 4 here again when you divide by 2 you get what 2 3 times so 8 i can write 3 times this is 2 to the power now we can write in index notation this is 1 2 3 2 to the power 3. now look at this one this is an equation both sides should be equal and same base so you can compare the power so we can write a should be equal to 3 if this is an equation so straight away you can find a equals 3 now another one 9 equals 3 to the power b so what is 9 how many 3's are there divide and see that's twice so i can write 3 times 3 is 3 to 
,the power b 3 squared now can you see same base you can equate the powers so b equals 2. write the number 4 into 8 as a power of 2. so we'll do the separate ones 4. 
,divide by 2 you get 2 into 2 8 when you divide by 2 you get 2 into 2 into 2 3 times now how many twos are there one two three four five so we can write this is same 
,as 2 to the power 5. write the number 9 into 27 as a power of 3 what's 9 3 times 3 27 you get three three times three times three times three now when you multiply these two i can write first you've got two threes and the second you got three threes all together one two three four five five threes are there you can write as three to the power five find the value of 2 squared into 3 squared 2 squared and 3 squared what is 2 squared 2 into 2 that's 4. 3 into 3 that's 9. 9 times 4 36 find the 
,value of 5 squared and 2 to the power 3. you can do 5 squared that means five times five two to the power three means two three times five times five is twenty-five 
,two times two times two that's eight 25 times 8 what's the answer you know 25 times 4 is 100 so you get 200 so 8 times 5 40 8 times 2 16 plus 4 20. so 200 now we'll 
,look at the review exercise in your textbook expand each of the following as a product and find the value of the given expression so what's 3 squared 3 into 3 3 times 3 you get 9. 5 to the power 4 that means 5 4 times 5 times 5 25 again 5 times 5 25 25 times 25 625 this one 2 square that means 2 twice and 3 once 2 times 2 4 4 times 3 twelve six squared six times six five squared five times five so you can do yeah easy way is six times five thirty six times five thirty thirty times thirty so three times three nine and put two zeros so nine hundred question number two write down each of the following products using index notation base is four how many fours are there one two three we can write four to the power of 3 7 is the base how many sevens 1 2 3 4 7 to the power of 4. how many 2 is there twice and how many 3's are there twice so you can write 2 to the power of 2 and 3 to the power of 2. how many 3's are there 1 2 3 how many 5's 1 2 so you can write this one as index notation like that fill in the blanks in the following table 25 means 5 square base is 5 index is 2 5 to the power 2 so this one 343 base is 7 given so we'll check it out divide by 7 7 times 4 28. so 28 and you get 63 so you get 9 here 7 times 9 63 7 times 7 again 7 times 1 so you get base 7 what's the index 3 so 7 to the power 3. so how can you write this one 7 to the power 3 now next one 6 to the power 3 so 6 to the power 3 is this one so what's the base 6 index is 3 now we need to find out what's 6 times 6 times 6 6 times 6 36 36 times 6 6 times 6 36 3 remaining 6 times 3 18 plus 3 21 so yeah number is 260. write the number 16 using index notation with base 2. so we'll take 16 and how many twos are there you get 8 2 times 4 2 times 2 and 2 times 1 1 2 3 4. i can write 2 to the power 4 using index notation with base 
,4 so base 4 means i can find out how many 4s are there how many fours two times two four two times two four so four twice i can write the same thing as if it's base 
,four the power is two example number 1 write down the number 36 as a product of powers with prime numbers as bases so here 36 we can divide by 2 you get 18. divide by 2 again 9. now we can divide by 3. you get 3 and 1. so how can we write down 36 2 into 2 and 3 into 3. i can write 2 to the power 2 and 3 to the power 2. write down the 100 as a product of powers with prime numbers so take hundred and see how many twos are there you get 50. again you can divide by 2 you get 25 now divide by five you get five here again five you get one so hundred i can write as two times two and five times five so what's 2 times 2 2 to the power 2 5 into 5 means 5 to the 
,power 2 exercise 5.1 write 25 in index notation with 5 as the base so what's 25 when you divide by 5 you get 2 5's are there so 5 squared write 64 in index notation 
,with base 2 64. divide by 2 you get 36 divided by 2 again 18 divided by 2 9 and you can divide by 3. how many 2's are there 2 1 2 3 2 to the power 3 how many 3's are there that's 1 2. so you can write 2 to the power 3 into 3 to the power 2. write 81 in index notation with 3 as the base so we'll see how many 3's are there divide 
,by 3 you get 27 divide by 3 again 9 3 again you get 3 and finally one so how many threes are there one two three four so 81 i can write as 3 to the power 4. write 49 in index notation with 7 as the base so take 49 and divide by 7 7 times 7 so how many 7's are there so i can write 49 as 7 squared two sevens are there write each of the following numbers as a product of powers with prime numbers as bases take 18 you can divide by 2 that's 9 divide by 3 you get 3 here and 1. so how can i write 
,18 2 once and 3 twice that's 3 square 24 divide by 2 get 12 divide by 2 again you get 6 divide by 2 that's 3 divide by 3 you get 1. so 24 i can write how many twos that's three and how many threes that's one you don't need to write one two to the power three and three forty-five forty-five you can divide by three you get fifteen divide by three again you get 5 and divide by 5 you get 1 so 45 i can write 3 squared and 1 5 70 first we'll do 63 you can divide by 3 you get 21 divide by 3 again 
,you get 7 and divide by 7 that's 1. so 63 i can write 3 squared and 1 7 72 divide and see first you can divide by 2 that's 36 divide by 2 against 80 divided by 2 that's 9 now you can divide by 3 get 1 so how many 2s 2 to the power 3 and how many threes two threes three square example number one write down each of the following expressions using index notation p is a base how many p's are there one two three so p to the power three space is x and space is y how many x's you get two how many 
,y's you get 3 this one base 2 how many 2's that's 2. how many is 1 2 3 you can write 8 to the power 3 this one how many 3's 1 2 3 and how many m's you get 2 example 
,number 2 expand and write each of the following expressions as a product so m to the power 3 m 3 times p squared q to the power 3 means p twice and q three times five squared and x to the power three five twice and x three times exercise 5.2 write down each of the following expressions using index notation x how many times are there one two three four six to the power four a three times a you can write three times one two three this one you get two letters m to i m how many times not twice 
,one two three m three times in one two three three times this one seven how many times one two three and p twice this question first we'll write down the number one 
,two three seven 3 times and y 1 2 3 4 4 times you can write this without multiplication sign here i can simplify this one m to the power 3 n to the power 3 so this is also possible you don't need a multiplication sign there expand and write each of the following expressions as a product a square a times a two times you need to multiply two p squared two ones and p twice two to the power three and m square that means 2 3 times and m twice 3 squared x cubed 3 twice and x three times x cube y 
,cubed x three times and y three times so you can write like this that's the expanded form example number one find the value of each of the following expressions when x equals 5 so we'll substitute 5 to the power 3 x is 5 and you need to find the value 5 to the power 3 means 5 3 times so what's the value 5 times 5 25 25 times 5 125 3x that means 3 times 5. you get 15. example number 2 find the value of each of the following expressions when a equals 3 and b equals 5 a squared that means 3 squared and 5. what's 3 squared 3 times 3 9. 9 times 5 is 45 this one 2 a a means 3 to the power 3 and b means 5 to the power 2. now we'll do it separately 2 is there 
,3 times 3 times 3 3 times 3 9 9 times 3 27 and 5 squared means 5 times 5 you get 25 so this is easy 25 times 2 50 50 times 27 that means you put a 0 and multiply by 
,5 5 times thirty five three remain five times two ten plus three thirty so the answer is thousand three hundred and fifty exercise five point three find the value of each of the following expressions by substituting x equals 3 3 to the power 4. now do it at once 3 times 3 9 9 times 3 27 27 times 3 that's 81 this one 3 and x squared means 3 squared so this is same as 3 to the power 2 and 3 3 to the power 3 3 times you are multiplying so same thing 3 times 3 9 9 times 3 27 5 and 3 to the power 3. so what's 3 to the power 3 we found 27 so 5 times 27 now 5 times 7 35 3 remaining 5 times 2 10 plus 3 30 so 135 find the value of each of the following expressions by substituting a equals 3. so 2 is 3. so 3 squared so what's 3 squared 9. 2 times 9 you get 18. 2 squared and a is 3 3 squared 2 squared is 4 3 squared is 9 9 times 4 36 7 a squared 7 into a is 3 3 square 7 into 9 you get 63 find the value of each of the following expressions by substituting x equals 1 and y equals 7 so you get 2 letters x is 1 1 squared y is 7 1 to the power any number is 1 7 to the power 3 7 x 7 49 49 times 7 so 28 plus 6 323 this one 2 x is 1 1 to the power 3 and y 
,equals 7 this is 1 2 times 7 you get 14. this one 3 x is 1 y squared means 7 squared so 7 squared means 7 times 7 49 49 times 3 so 3 times 9 27 3 times 4 12 plus 2 14. so 147 question number four find the value of each of the following expressions by substituting a equals 2 and b equals 7 equals 2. so 2 to the power 2 and 7. 2 to the power 2 is 4 4 times 7 you get 28. a b squared a equals 2 b equals 7 so 7 squared 2 times 7 times 7 49 what's 2 times 49 2 times 9 18 1 remaining 2 times 4 8 plus 1 9 so the answer is 98 so a to the power 3 b to the power 2 so a equals 2 b equals 7 2 to the power 3 7 to the power 2. 2 times 2 times 2 that's 8. 7 times 7 49. so what's 49 times 8 72 and 8 times 4 32 32 and 7 39 so 392. this one three a square a means 2 2 to the power 2 b means 7 7 square so 3 2 times 2 4 7 times 7 49 so what's the answer 3 times 4 12 12 times 49 so we will do the multiplication 49 times 12 that means 10 and 2. you multiply by 1 multiply by 2 get 98. so add it together you get 500. so we covered all theory related to indices so you need to remember what's index notation and what is the base and what is the index and when the two powers are connected with the multiplication sign it is the basis of both the powers are not numerical values then it is not necessary to include the multiplication sign so that means something like this so here 2 a to the power 3 so no need to put the multiplication sign a value can be obtained for an expression in index notation with an unknown base by substituting a number for the unknown term so this is an important lesson you are getting questions related to this in your o level exam

tZAhRkGxZ_g,hello everyone welcome to my channel learn with raza and today we are going to learn about the lesson indices it's grade 7. so in this video you will learn many things about the lesson indices so please watch this video until the end subscribe my channel like and share right index notation is used to write a number which is multiplied repeatedly in a concise way so this statement let's see it in a very deep manner now so let's see how to express a power and a base in index notation so for example if i take number 9 is equal to 3 to the power 2 this is read as 3 to the power 2 so they are what you have here is the base this is the base and we call this 
,one as the index so here what we do is we represent number 9 with a base and an index so we read this as 9 is equal to 3 to the power 2. so this power 2 means if i expand it and write down 9 is equal to 3 to the power 2 means 3 is written twice 3 times 3 is giving 9 so this is the index and this is the base now i'll teach you how to expand a product and how can we find the value of each expression for example now the example i'm taking here is 3 to the power 2 multiplied by 2 right here i'm going to teach you how to expand uh as a product how to expand as a product so 3 to the power 2 means i told you this is the base and this is the index to the power 2 means you write 3 twice and multiply it by 2 it is only 1 so 3 times 3 is 9 9 times 2 is equal to 18. so simply i can say that 3 to the power 2 multiplied by 2 is equal to 18. another example 2 to the power 3 read it with me 2 to the power 3 multiplied by 3 to the power 2 2 to the power 3 means listen very carefully 2 is written thrice because the power is 3 3 to the power 2 means 3 written twice now let's multiply 2 times 2 4 4 times 2 8 8 times 3 what is 8 times 3 24 24 times 3 you can multiply 24 times 3 you are getting 3 times 4 that is 12 2 here remainder 1 here 3 times 2 6 6 plus 1 72 so the answer will be 72 so what did we do here first we expanded the power and we multiplied continuously and got the answer as 72 right to make it more clear i'm going to take another example example number 3 2 to the power 4 multiply by 3 to the power 2 multiply by 5 now you try to do this alone pause your video and try to do this alone and check whether your answer is matching with 
,the answer that i am going to explain right 2 to the power 4 means 2 multiply by 2 multiply by 2 and again another 2 power 4 means 2 is written 4 times multiplied by 3 to the power 2 means 3 written 2 times 5 is only single now be careful 2 times 2 4 4 times 2 8 8 times 2 16 16 times 3 you know multiplication 16 times 3 3 times 
,6 is 18. 3 times 1 3 3 plus 1 4 48 48 times 3 again multiply continuously 3 x 8 24 4 here 2 here 3 times 4 12 12 plus 2 14 144 multiply by 5 so see you can see that 
,continuously it goes 144 multiplied by 5. 5 times 4 20 last digit here 2 here 5 times 4 again 20 20 plus remainder 2 22 5 times 1 5 5 plus 2 7 final answer is equal 
,to 720 see whether you understood see whether you got your answer 2 times 2 4 4 times 2 8 8 times 2 16 16 times 3 i multiplied and got 48 48 times 3 i got 144 144 times 5 i got 720 so this is the way of expanding the powers and getting the final answer well now i'll teach you the other way around when it is already expanded when it is already expanded how can you write it as powers for example this is expanded uh in the format so how can we write it as a powers powers means with a base and 
,with an index so if you note this number 2 you can see there are 1 2 3 4 2 is common the power will be since it is arising 4 times 2 to the power 4. multiply by 3 arises twice 3 to the power 2. another example right 3 is common so 3 base to the power 3 1 2 3 multiply 5 so it can be in two different places as well that's what i took this example it comes twice 5 to the power 2 multiply by 2 this 2 can be written as 2 to the power 1 also if this is not there even that's not a problem so this 
,is the way of writing the expanded numbers as powers as powers of certain basis so hope it's clear with uh hope that it's clear for you all so let's move to the next part now let's see how to write a given value as a power of a number so for example if i tell you write 25 as power of 5 how to write 25 as a power of base 5 x power of base 5 base is 5 so you know that the base is 5 means 5 times something should be 5 times how many 5s we need how many fives you need to make 25 yes of course it is two fives because 25 divided by five the short method 25 has how many fives that is five so five times five is 25 so i can write 25 is equal to 5 multiplied by 
,5 which is equal to 5 to the power 2 so you can see that the base is 5 power or the index is 2. so we wrote 25 as a power of base 5 similarly if i ask you to write down 64 as a power of base 8 base 8 how do you do that so you know that 64 we can divide in by 8 and see that 64 divided by 8 multiplication table 8 times 8 is giving 64. so 64 is equal to 8 multiplied by 8 which is equal to base is 8 how many 8's are there 2 8 to the power 2 next is let's see how to write the same number 64 as a power of base 2 right in your previous lesson unit number 4 factors and multiples part 2 you are learning how to divide it by prime factors and all so let's see 64 
,will divide by 2 because we want the base 2 right divide by 2 go with me 6 divided by 2 what is it yes 3 4 divided by 2 that is 2 no remainders 3 divided by 2 1 1 remainder it becomes 12 12 divided by 2 what is it 6. now 16 divide by 2 2 times table what number is giving you 16 yes 2 times 8 8 divided by 2 you divide it in your 
,mind 2 times table 8 divided by 2 4 4 divided by 2 2 2 divided by 2 finally 1 so finally until you reach 1 you have to keep on dividing so you can notice that the common base is 2 so 2 64 is equal to 2 to the powers how many twos are there 1 2 3 4 5 6 so 2 to the power 6 is giving 64. let's check our answer and see whether it's 
,correct how to check we'll expand 2 to the power 6 3 4 five six two times two four four times two eight eight times two sixteen sixteen times two what is it thirty two thirty 32 times 2 if you want i'll show you 32 times 2 you are getting 64. so since we are getting the answer 2 to the power 6 is the correct format of writing number 64 as a power of base 2 so this is the way of writing a given number as a power of any base they are asking us to do so let me give you some questions try to pause the video and do them and check it yourself well this is the question for you write 81 as a power of base 3 so i told you if you want to select any base if it is here it's base 3 so divide 81 continuously by number 3 base right start your timing now pause your video and start doing well 81 divided by 3 in 8 how many 3's are 
,there yes that is 2 because 3 times 2 is 6. so in 8 if you have 2 3's how many remainders are there that is 2 remained so they are you are getting remainder 2 it will become 21 so 21 has how many trees in three times table what number is giving you 21 3 times 7 27 divided by 3 in 3 times table what number gives 27 3 times 9 9 divided by 3 simply it is 3 3 divided by 3 you have only one so how many 3's are here now 81 is equal to 3 is our base how many threes are there are 4 so the answer will be 3 to the power 4 will give you 81. i'll explain you this again in 8 you have 2 3's but 2 remainders so 21 comes in 21 you have 7 3's 27 divided by 3 9 9 divided by 3 3 3 divided by 3 1 so 81 is equal to 3 to the power 4 right now it's time to go to the next part of your top lesson that is how to write down powers with an algebraic symbol algebraic symbol will be your base so that means for example base means you know the bigger number x x to the power 3 this is the base and this is the index as usual so only change is this is nothing new only change is the base is a letter algebraic means a simple letter in your alphabet so x to the power 3 means just like the one we learned we learn 2 to the power 3 let's say i told you 2 times 2 times 2 x to the power 3 is also x times x times x so this is the difference in algebraic and numerals so just like the same thing what we learned in numbers i taught you how to expand powers and i taught you how to write the expanded power in index format similarly i'm going to teach you here also so if you are given a base and an index in algebraic form for example y to the power 2 is z to the power 3 so y to the power 2 means y written twice is it to the power 3 means is it written thrice this is the expanded form so if you have if you are given an expanded algebraic expression for example p times p times q times p times q is equal to what as powers and bases how do we write down so there what you have to do is p is written twice and here once all together we have 3 ps p to the power 3 q is written twice so put a multiplication q to the power 2 so we can write this together as p times q 
,is p q here to the power 3 here to the power 2 this is the final answer so what did i teach you here powers with algebraic symbol as the base algebraic letter is the base power index is a number like in numbers same way we expand and like in numbers the same way we write the powers also counting how many letters are there of the same base and we write them as the powers right in the command base and we can get the final answer so this is simple right and suppose if you are getting something like this how do we do right expanding listen x multiply by x multiply by x 1 2 3 multiply by how many y's y into y into y so suppose if they ask you to short it like you know write it as a common product you know you can take x and y together both are having powers of 3 both are having powers of 3 so within brackets you can write and put the power 3 out that's also fine similarly here q multiplied by q multiplied by m multiplied by m two q's and two m's shortly you can write down q m to the power two because both are powers of two so this is the way of doing you know powers that have an uh algebraic letter as the base right now let's see suppose if you are asked to find the value of the power with the base of an algebraic letter right let's see how to do that right now go to the lesson now finding the value finding the value of a power by substitution right what is this substitution let me explain you it clearly uh let me take an example as usual we'll take x letter x to the power 3 let's say right x to the power 3 assume now you think that you think that x is number 2 this is called substitution you are substituting the valued number 
,2 instead of x i can write this as 2 to the power 3 which is equal to x to the power 3 so i can write down x to the power 3 is equal to 2 to the power 3 equal to 2 multiplied by 2 x 2 which means x multiplied by x multiply by x same thing so what did we do instead of x we wrote number 2 when we expanded what do we get here 2 times 2 4 4 times 2 8 which means that x to the power 3 is equal to 8 so this is called as substitution of a given value to the base let's do more examples well if i tell you take a is 3 and b is 5. and if i take a base with a a squared b to the power 3 this is your question let's see how to do this now substituting instead of a okay listen this very carefully i'll expand first of all if you listen it very carefully you will understand a to the power 2 means a twice b to the power 3 means b thrice instead of a i am writing number 3 again 3 but here b means 5 5 5 5 3 times 3 9 5 times 5 25 and another 5. now multiply 9 times 25 we'll multiply here 9 times 
,25 9 times 5 45 5 here 4 here 9 times 2 18 18 plus 4 22 now this we what what we do here we multiply this value 225 we get still one value is remaining we'll multiply it by 5 5 times 5 25 5 here 2 remainder 5 times 2 10 10 plus 2 12 again 5 times 2 10 10 plus 1 11 final answer will be 1125 multiplication part you have to do very carefully you have to substitute the correct values and you have to keep on multiplying in the same pattern and get the values right so try to pause the video and do the question and get the answers let me do more questions for you to keep on practicing well now have a look on this one x is equal to 1 y is equal to 7 now we are going to substitute right 3 is written here as it is because it's a number but x okay we'll write it down y to the power two means how many y yes two y's three multiply by x means now they have given it is one so we'll write down one y means it is number 7 again another y is there right now you have to know multiplication tables very clearly 3 times 1 3 okay 7 times 7 this multiplication mark i wrote here 7 times 7 that is 49 now what is 49 multiplied by 3 3 times 9 is 27 27 means last digit we write here remainder we take it here 3 times 4 12 12 plus 2 14 final answer will be 147 this is the way of substituting a given value for the algebraic base so now you are able to do all your exercises in this lesson so in this lesson what is a summary i can tell you you learn how to express an unknown term multiplying repeatedly by something called powers and there you have the base you have the index and you know how to substitute a given value uh for a base unknown base and you know how to expand index form and you know how to write down the expanded numbers in index format right these are the basic things in this lesson uh so hope you have understood the lesson and let's meet up with another video have a nice day

1bf7euwZqmg,index notation exponent or power today let us learn a new topic index notation index notation is a short way of writing a number that is being multiplied by itself many times for example instead of writing 4 into 4 into 4 into 4 into 4 it is easier to write it like this now to read this we need to know certain terms the number that is being multiplied by itself is known as the base so here 4 is the base the number written above the base is known as the index or exponent or the power of the 
,base it is the number of times that the base must be multiplied by itself here 5 is the index or exponent or the power of the base there are different ways to read it 1 4 to the power of 5 to the fifth power of 4 three four raised to the power of five now let us solve a few examples right 7 into 7 into 7 into 7 into 7 into 3 into 3 into 3 into 2 into 2 in the exponential form here 7 is multiplied by itself 5 times so we write 7 raised to the power of 5 three is multiplied by itself three times so we write it as 3 raised to the power of three and two is multiplied by itself two times so we write it as 2 raised to the power of two thus we write seven into seven into 7 into seven into 7 into 3 into 3 into 3 into 2 into 2 is equal to 7 raised to the power of 5 into 3 raised to the power of 3 into 2 raised to the power of 2 now let us expand 3 raised to the power of 2 into 2 raised to the power of 1 into 6 raised to the power of 3 we know that 3 raised to the power of 2 is equal to 3 into 3 2 raised to the power of 1 is equal to 2 six raised to the power of 3 is equal to 6 into 6 into 6 therefore 3 raised to the power of 2 into 2 raised to the power of 1 into 6 raised to the power of 3 is equal to 3 into 3 into 2 into 6 into 6 into 6 let us solve one more example find the value of 6 raised to the power of 2 into 2 raised to the power of 3 here firstly write the numbers in the expanded form thus 6 raised to the power of 2 into 2 raised to the power of 3 is equal to 6 into 6 into 2 into 2 into 2 now multiply the digits that is 6 into 6 is equal to 36 and 2 into 2 into 2 is equal to 8 now multiply both the products that is 36 into 8 which is equal to 288 thus we got the answer as 288 kids remember 1 any number raised to 1 is the number itself for example 2 raised to the power of 1 is equal to 2 to any base with zero as an index is always 1 for example 2 raised to the power of 0 is equal to 1 wasn't it easy learning index notation

ftB5VU64yGA,let's understand what length is and how to measure it the word length is used to measure how long an object is for example length of the classroom floor length of the blackboard length of a pencil etc it is also used to measure distances for example distance from your home to school distance between two cities or countries measuring length we can use the hand span the foot span or the cubit to measure smaller lengths what do you mean by hand span hand span is a distance from the tip of the 
,thumb to the tip of the little finger on an outstretched hand Lisa is measuring her max textbook with the help of hand span let's measure one two so the length of her math textbook is two hand spans now let's see what you mean by foot span foot span is the distance from the tip of the toe to the heel of the foot look Lisa is measuring the length of the classroom with her foot span let's measure one two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 and 20 so the length of the classroom is 20 foot spans now let's see how to measure with cubit cubit is the length from the elbow to the end of the fingers now Lisa is measuring the side 
,of the table with her cubit 1 2 3 4 so the length of the side of the table is 4 cubed you two can measure the length with your body parts and have fun

41eVMYPCWTQ,today let us learn prime and composite numbers before we begin let us understand what do we mean by natural numbers the set of numbers 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and so on are 
,called natural numbers natural numbers can be divided into prime numbers and composite numbers before we proceed ahead remember that any given number will always have one and itself as its factors now let us start with prime numbers look at the examples the factors of 3 are 1 and 3 the factors of 11 are 1 and 11 the factors of 17 are 1 and 17 all these numbers have only two factors one and the number itself such numbers are called prime numbers thus prime numbers are natural numbers that have only two factors one and the number itself composite numbers look at the examples the factors of 6 are 1 2 3 & 6 the factors of 14 are 1 2 7 and 14 the factors of 20 are 1 2 5 10 and 20 all the above numbers have more than two factors these numbers are called composite numbers thus composite numbers are natural numbers that have more than two factors remember these points one is neither prime nor composite as it has only one factor two is the smallest and the only even prime number three is the smallest odd prime number now why don't you list all the prime and composite numbers from 1 to 100

qc8LHRMs6FQ,today we will learn about factors first let us understand what we mean by the factor of a number let us take the number 12 to begin with let us find out the pairs of numbers that give 12 as their product 1 into 12 is equal to 12 2 into 6 is equal to 12 3 into 4 is equal to 12 so we get 3 pairs of numbers that give us the product 12 no other pair of numbers when multiplied will give the product 12 now let us take each pair of number separately and understand what it means let us take the first pair 1 into 12 is equal to 12 here when we divide 12 by 1 we get the quotient as 12 and when we divide 12 by 12 we get the quotient as 1 in both the cases the remainder is 0 thus it means that 12 is divisible by 1 and 12 pair to 2 into 6 is equal to 12 here when we divide 12 by 2 we get the quotient as 6 and if we divide 12 by 6 we get the quotient as 2 in both the cases the remainder is 0 thus it means that 12 is divisible by 2 and 6 pair 3 3 into 4 is equal to 12 here if we divide 12 by 3 we get the quotient as 4 and if we divide 12 by 4 we get the quotient as 3 here also we get the remainder as 0 in both the divisions thus it means that 12 is divisible by 3 and 4 thus we now understand that 12 is divisible by 1 2 3 4 6 and 12 hence we see that the numbers 1 2 3 4 6 and 12 are the factors of 12 hence we can define factor of a number as a number which exactly divides the given number or we can see that factors are numbers you can multiply together to get given number now 
,let us look at certain points which we need to understand related to a factor with the help of some examples point 1 1 is a factor of every number look at the examples 1 into 6 is equal to 6 8 divided by 1 is equal to 8 thus 1 multiplied by any number gives the number itself as the product and any number divided by 1 also gives 
,the number itself as the quotient hence we conclude that 1 is a factor of every number point to every number is a factor of itself we know that 6 into 1 is equal to 
,6 8 divided by 8 is equal to 1 thus any number multiplied by 1 gives the number itself as the product and any number divided by itself gives 1 as the quotient hence 
,every number is a factor of itself 3 the factor of a number is always less than or equal to the number look at the factors of 12 which we found out earlier they are 
,1 2 3 4 6 and 12 note that the factors 1 2 3 4 & 6 are less than 12 and the last factor 12 is equal to 12 thus it shows that the factor of a number is always less than or equal to the number for every number except one has at least two factors one and the number itself let us look at the factors of 7d are one and seven no other 
,pair of numbers when multiplied together will give the product seven that is the number seven has at least two factors one and seven that is number one and the number seven itself hence we can see that every number except one has at least two factors one and the number itself do remember these points properly they will help you 
,to find the factors as we go further now let us find the factors of one more number let us take the number 30 the pairs of numbers which give the product 30 are 1 into 30 is equal to 30 2 into 15 is equal to 33 into 10 is equal to 30 5 into 6 is equal to 30 thus the factors of 30 are 1 2 3 5 6 10 15 and 30 now look at these factors and remember these points 1 a factor of a number exactly divides that number to one is a factor of every number three every number is a factor of itself for the 
,factor of a number is always less than or equal to the number five every number except one has at least two factors one and the number itself wasn't it easy to learn about factors why don't you try to find the factors of some numbers yourself

Q64ggR7b1Mc,the thing that we use in our daily life are made up of different materials machines vehicles kitchen utensils and many other utility items are made above a certain hard material called metals metals are extracted from minerals substances found deep inside the earth in this chapter we will study minerals as an important natural resource minerals and ores the earth is made up of rocks which are composed of different substances called minerals minerals are found in the rocky part of the earth 
,and are important raw materials for construction and manufacturing industries they play a very important role in our day-to-day lives right from the huge buildings will live to the computers and mobiles we use even early man used tools made of rocks and stones most of the metallic and nonmetallic minerals are found near the surface of the earth some minerals like petroleum and natural gas are found very deep inside the earth the ocean bed is a treasure of minerals kinds of minerals minerals are of two major types metallic minerals and nonmetallic minerals these are present in the Earth's crust in the form of ores and/or is a mineral that contains a metal in such quantities that it can be extracted profitably the or may contain other minerals too metallic minerals are minerals from which metals are extracted iron copper manganese zinc silver nickel aluminum and gold are examples of metals that are extracted from different metallic minerals aluminum is extracted from bauxite one of its main ores copper it is a valuable metal as it is a good conductor of electricity it is largely used in making electric wires and electrical appliances copper when mixed with zinc forms brass and when mixed with tin forms bronze it is also used for making household utensils it occurs in small quantities in India it is found in Rajasthan Andhra Pradesh Gujarat Jharkhand and Tamil Nadu I iron is one of the most important minerals and is used in the manufacture of machinery and tools medical and agricultural implements vehicles and a host of household articles it is also used extensively in railways buildings bridges etc iron is extracted from iron ore found in the Earth's crust the iron and steel industry has contributed significantly in the progress of the country India has huge deposits of iron ore in Odisha Karnataka Jharkhand Chhattisgarh Telangana Andhra Pradesh aluminium aluminium is a light flexible rust-proof metal aluminium is used in the manufacture of utensils airplanes ships automobile bodies electric wires etc aluminum is also a cheaper substitute of wood for furniture making huge deposits of bauxite the chief or of aluminum are found in Odisha Tamil Nadu Chhattisgarh Gujarat Jharkand and Maharashtra manganese manganese is used in the manufacture of steel it is also used in chemicals and glass industries India has many deposits of manganese in Odisha Karnataka Madhya Pradesh Goa and Maharashtra nonmetallic minerals nonmetallic minerals are minerals that have no metallic shine and break easily these include sand coal gypsum petroleum limestone etc gypsum is largely used in making cement coal is an important mineral and source of energy it is largely used as fuel in India for domestic purposes such as cooking and eating and for generating thermal power coal deposits are found in charkh and West Bengal Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh crude oil or petroleum this valuable and very useful mineral is also a very important source of energy it is found in a thick dark form in the deep interior of the earth and under the seabed very deep oil wells have to be constructed in order to extract crude oil and petroleum from the oil reserves most of India's oil reserves are at Mumbai high on the western coast petroleum is also found at dig boy in Assam come birth and 
,uncle asheville and cologne in gujarat which have large reserves of petroleum the extracted crude oil or petroleum is then refined that is by removing impurities from it in refineries in India we have refineries in Mumbai Chennai Kochi Bangalore and Goa where crude oil is refined to obtain petroleum and petroleum products cooking gas kerosene petrol diesel and petroleum jelly are some byproducts of crude oil petroleum juice as fuel in cars is commonly called petrol and diesel petroleum is also called black goat many other products such as dyes paints and drugs and chemicals are the byproducts of petroleum conservation of Mineral Resources we all depend on natural resources for our survival sunlight air wind at water do not get exhausted and are thus called renewable resources however mineral resources are present 
,in limited amounts in the Earth's crust it takes thousands of years for the formation of coal or petroleum and they are thus considered to be non-renewable sources of energy we must therefore use our mineral resources wisely and must not waste a chance to conserve them thus we now know about the mineral resources of India

LFob6BY_W_E,weathering the Earth's surface consists of a variety of landforms such as mountains plateaus plains and valleys which are constantly changing due to the processes brought about inside the earth as well as on its surface one such process is weathering weathering is the process of wearing away or breakdown of rocks by the various 
,agents present in the atmosphere such as temperature changes moisture frost etc weathering is a static process which means that the rocks break up where they stand and the broken pieces remain at the same location there are three types of weathering processes the first process called mechanical weathering is a physical process during which the rock gets broken into smaller pieces each retaining the characteristics of the original rock mechanical weathering can occur in many ways extreme temperature changes can cause the rock to break especially in very hot and dry regions like deserts during the day the surface of the rocks gets extremely heated causing them to expand whereas at night the temperature cools down causing the rocks to contract this continuous expansion and contraction causes the rocks to crack and eventually break another factor that causes mechanical weathering is frost in cooler regions water that fills up in the cracks of the rocks freezes and turns into ice 
,at night freezing of water results in its expansion by about one tenth of its volume which causes rocks to crack during the day the ice melts and water seeps further into the cracks month after month year after year water freezes and thaws over and over again creating larger cracks in the rocks which causes them to break or crumble the second type of weathering is called chemical weathering chemical weathering includes the effect of weathering on the materials that the rocks are made up of 
,water is the main agent of chemical weathering it is inactive in its pure form but even small amounts of dissolved substances like chemicals can make it very active 
,for example carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or decaying matter combines with water and a weak acidic solution is formed this solution dissolves limestone and calcium carbonate present in rocks causing them to crack in built-up areas rain gets dissolved with industrial gases such as nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide causing acid rain acid rain causes widespread damage to soil plants buildings and monuments iron compounds present in rocks also combined with water to form iron hydroxide which results in the breaking up of rocks the third type of weathering is called biological weathering which includes the effect of animals and plants on the landforms 
,for example tree roots may grow into the cracks in the rocks in search of nourishment as the roots grow they exert great pressure on the rocks causing them to break 
,burrowing animals also contribute actively the process of weathering rodents insects as well as worms loosen the material and expose more rocks to the other agents of weathering such as temperature let us understand the effects of weathering the main effect of weathering is the process of soil formation when a rock is exposed to the atmosphere it gradually begins to break up because of the process of weathering the broken down pieces of the rock eventually form a loose layer which is called soil soil formation is a very slow process and it takes thousands of years a well-developed soil is formed only when the weathered particles of rocks remain undisturbed in one place for a long period of time there is no transportation involved in the process of weathering which just prepares the material which is transported by gradation that is the process of erosion and deposition illusion is the wearing away of rocks by agents of gradation such as running water moving eyes wind and waves eroded material is then transported from one place to another by the agents of gradation and gets accumulated eventually giving rise to new landforms thus we conclude that weathering is one of the most important natural phenomena that keeps changing the Earth's physical appearance constantly you

gT0HFbA1Mow,"Basic Division. Magician's Flop Show. Do you know why we divide? We divide to distribute things equally. Sign of division is. There are 8 carrots, they need to be divided equally among 4 rabbits. How many carrots will each rabbit get? First take away 4 carrots so that each rabbit gets 1 carrot each. 4 carrots are still left. Take away these also one by one. No more carrots are left. All the carrots are distributed and each rabbit has 2 carrots. We have taken away 4 carrots 2 times. This can be written as 8 minus 4 is equal to 4. 4 minus 4 is equal to 0. Thus, 8 divided by 4 is equal to 2. This means for equal distribution, that is, for division, we do "

7w7pEoGUxd0,hello children today i'm here to teach you chapter 7 in your textbook that's parallel straight lines so in this lesson we identify parallel straight lines and talk about the perpendicular distance between two parallel lines and then we'll draw parallel lines using straight edge and set square and draw rectilinear plane figures so before we start we need to know what is a line segment look at this one draw a straight line using ruler so when you want to draw a straight line so you have to take the ruler in your geometry set so take the ruler and any straight line means length is not specified you can draw you can draw any length take any length and draw a line so take the ruler and we can draw a line then name the line as l so i can name it as f this line is l mark a and b points on the straight line l so here we don't have any specific distance so you can mark one point as a and the other point as b so a b is a line segment look at this question pqrs points are situated above the a b line draw perpendicular lines from those points as p k q l r m s then measure and write them so we'll take the set square and what we can do we can keep this edge here on top of this line a b line first make sure that you keep it properly and then you can draw the line so we can first connect these two points so pk line then what you do you can drag this set square and keep it on top of a b line and connect the other two points q r so use the set square to draw the other line so that's q l and then again you can connect the other two points this is r m and again keep it properly and draw the other to connect the other two points using the ruler that's that's s and i so these are the lines perpendicular to the av line now what you have to do you have to measure the lengths so we can use the set square so what we can do you can keep it and measure the nets starting from here i see up to this point 5.4 5.4 5.4 centimeters then ql take the set square and measure this point this length 5.4 and measure our m line you get the same length 5.4 and sn that's also 5.4 so what can you say about those lines the lines are equal so we can say 
,lenses equal that means pk distance is equal to ql distance is equal to rm sn all these links are equal draw a line across ps what can be said about ps and a b lines so they are asked to draw a line along p and s connecting vns so you can use the ruler take the ruler and connect pns what can you say about these two lines p s and a b those are parallel we can say these two lines are parallel so draw a line and what can be said you can say ps line is parallel to a b so the root of a point that goes in a precise distance to a line is parallel to the line if the shortest distance between two lines is similar at each point those two lines are parallel to each other so in this diagram these are the perpendicular distances p k k l r m and s the perpendicular distances are equal so we can say p s is parallel to a ap write down the instances that parallel lines can be seen there you see look at the board so you can see vertical line edges are parallel as well as horizontal edges are parallel so we can say opposite edges of the whiteboard then when you take a roof beams of the panel beams of the roof beams of the roof or when you take a ladder what you call the panels of the ladder horizontal panel of a ladder what else when you take your book so opposite edges of a book and we can say opposite edges of a window do opposite edges of a window so all these are parallels look at this diagram what are the parallel lines drawn vertically vertically means this way so what are 
,the parallel lines we can say a b c d e f g h i j those are the parallel lines drawn vertically what are the parallel lines drawn horizontally this way horizontally 
,we can say a i and b j and k l k l and b j those are parallel lines drawn horizontally a b and c d are parallel so it is written as how we write down parallel lines 
,we write a b c d and here two lines like this so you remember how to show parallelize so a b you write down the two lines and then in between you draw two lines like that to show these two are parallel and also with the arrow head like this shows these two lines are parallel in this also p q parallel to p r so i'll take this is 
,another letter you can't take the same p value so i'll take s is point p q and sr what can i say about these two lines p q parallel to s r so these two lines are parallel what about these two lines ml here arrow heads show these two are parallel m and k l these two are parallel parallel lines do not cross each other so no intersecting point how long they are draw so it goes forever without intersecting now look at this diagram and identify parallel lines i can say when you take horizontal lines k l parallel to m n and also parallel to what's the other line o p so these three lines are parallel when you take this way what are the other lines parallel a 
,b is parallel to c d parallel to e f i'll take this point as f e f so these lines are parallel to each other in this diagram what are the parallel lines to a whereas a is like so what are the other parallel lines b and c what are the parallel lines to p p is this one so you get q r s now we'll see how we can draw parallel lines 
,straight edge that means you can take the ruler and the set square can be used to draw parallel lines so we'll do this question draw cd line parallel to a b line using straight edge and the set square so what you do placing one edge of the set square on a b lean the straight edge to it holding the straight edge with no shake draw the cd line by holding pushing the set square without shaking so we'll see how we can draw first you need to take the ruler and draw a line segment there's no length given so you can take any length so take any length and label this is a b now we need to draw a parallel line to a b so what we do you take the set square and we 
,can keep one edge yeah one edge lean with this a b line so like this and keep the ruler like this so you can keep the ruler with the other edge of the set score now 
,what we do hold the straight line in straight edge that means the ruler hold the straight edge and you can push the set square you can push the set square without shaking to any level and you can draw the line so i'll draw the line now so that's you need to be careful keep it and now you can draw the lines remove that now see this line is parallel to this one and i can label this as c d so after you draw that you can put two arrows like this to show that these two lines are parallel so i can write a b is parallel to c d line draw the rs line above parallel to pq so pq line is given and we need to draw another line rs above pq so what you do you take the ruler and the set square then what you do you you can extend this here keep on top of this point this line have one it should be on the line and then what you can 
,do you can take the ruler and keep that edge on top of this next to the set square like this and then hold the ruler and shake pull the ruler and without shaking you can move the set square to any point that you like and draw the line so we'll keep it like this and draw the line so i can draw the line parallel to pq and label this as r s and i can show with an arrow these two lines are parallel p q line is parallel to r s draw k l line parallel to m n so a min line is given so you need to draw a parallel line so what you do you take the ruler and the set square so you can keep the set square first on top of this line and then you keep the ruler next to the set square like this and you can either draw a parallel line above this or below so we'll try to draw two lines you can first draw above this hold the straight 
,edge it means ruler tightly and push the set square up and you can draw kl y this is kl9 so if you are doing that above that's the line if you want to draw it down you take this one down and draw the line so i'll show you both ways two lines above and below m so i label one line kl so that's k s and parallel means with this arrow so i can write n line is parallel to k l lines draw p q line pal to x y line okay so this is x y so you take the ruler and the set square then what you do first you take the set square and keep on top of this line and then you can take the ruler and keep it like this next to the set square like this now you can hold the straight edge tightly and push the set square we'll draw the line down some more and you can draw the line so this line segment is parallel to x y so we'll label that one 
,as p q so we can use arrows to show that these two lines are parallel so x y is parallel to p q drop a q line across point p parallel to a b line now there's a point p you take this one as p here now we need to draw a parallel line passing through the point p to av so same thing we are doing so we can take the ruler and the set 
,square so what we can do again you can keep it keep the straight edge keep the set square first on top of the line a b and this we can keep we can keep the straight 
,edge that's the ruler next to the square like this and then you will move it up because we have to draw the line above this av line passing through the point p so we can now push the sith square so that you get the line you're passing through this point now you can take the pencil and draw the line now you can remove this now see this line is parallel to a b and passes through the point p so what's the line p q so i can label this one as p q so a b is parallel to p q to which direction was 
,the line drawn the parallel line can be drawn by pushing up or down when one of the set square edges were kept touching it and holding the straight edge tight draw a main line across m and pal to a b so we take the ruler and the set square so you keep the set square on the a b line first so you need to keep it properly so like this and then take the straight edge that's the ruler and keep it on top of the set square on the other edge so i can first keep it properly like this so touches the 
,set square one edge with the ruler like this and now hold the ruler tightly and you can push the set square up because we need to draw a parallel line passes through endpoint if you like this so you can see this line passes through m and now you can draw the line and we can remove this and this line we can see parallel to a b and passes through m so what's the line we can label it as m n so m n line is parallel to a b drop a q line across p this point parallel to k l so that line so take the ruler and the set square so we can keep again this straight edge on top of this kl line i'll extend this and then take the ruler and keep the roller on top of this edge like this tightly and then you have to drag the set square drag the set square like this so that you get the line parallel to k l line as well as passes through the point p now we can connect so you draw the line and you can remove the two and see whether these two lines are parallel so these two lines are parallel we can 
,put an arrow head like this so what's the line p so i can write k l lines is parallel to p so this line passes through the point p this question draw a b line so that's a b line just above it in 4.5 centimeter draw the cd line parallel to ab now the distance is given so you need to measure that so first we'll take the set square so you need to draw the above the line so we'll take the straight edge keep on top of this a b line and then you need to measure 4.5 centimeters so 4.5 centimeters 
,is 4.5 is somewhere here and also we'll mark another point d above b now this is mark point c in a distance of 4.5 centimeter above vertical to a now we'll measure above b 4.5 distance 4.5 is somewhere here this is 4.5 so that's this point so we can just connect it you don't need a ruler there to keep here because we know if you take this is 4.5 and this is 4.5 the perpendicular distances are the same the line connecting these two points parallel to a b lab because the perpendicular distances are equal so you can take the ruler now take the ruler and you can here connect the these two points like this with the ruler so what are these points c above a d above b and this line is parallel to a b and the distance here is 4.5 this distance is 4.5 so you can write a b line is parallel to c d line draw cd line that's cd 
,line draw then draw x y parallel to line 4.5 centimeter above it so again 4.5 centimeters so you need to measure that take the ruler and the set square so we'll first keep this on top of the line and will measure 4.5 so we can do first we can first we can mark a point above c 4.5 centimeters away 4.5 somewhere here 4.5 here and 
,then mark another point above d 4.5 now you can take the roller and connect the two points this point and this point so you can connect it with a ruler this line is 
,parallel to c d so we can label it as x y so x y is parallel to c d line so x y is parallel to c d draw a b line then draw x y parallel to line 3.6 centimeters above it so first a b so i'll label this as a b not c d i want the line a b then x y parallel to this 3.6 centimeters away so take the set square and keep on top of this 
,line a b and measure 3.6 1 two three three point six is here and you can mark another point above the with same distance three point six so here now you can take the ruler and connect the two points so i can keep here so i'll take this point and connect this point as well so here are these two now we can draw the line here to here so what's the line x y and these two lines are parallel and we know this distance is 3.6 centimeters so we can write x y is parallel to a b look at this diagram drawing b d diagonal of a b c d rectangle draw p q and s are lines across a and c parallel to it so first they are asked to connect b bd diagonal so take the ruler and connect so that's the bd line then what you do you take the set square so you can keep it on top of the bd line just keep it properly something like this so keep on top of bdli and then what you do you take the ruler we need a ruler now and you can keep the ruler on on this set square touching this edge like this so we need more length so i'll put like this and then what you do you can hold the straight edge ruler tightly and push the set square so that you get the line parallel to vd and passes through the point a so this is the line you can draw the line now and then again push push it down so that you need to pass this point c so for that here i can't reach to point c so i can do other way round so my diagram is too big so what i can do i'll rotate this so that this line on the straight edge now now this is okay now i can push this set square down so like this and draw the line i can draw the line passes through the point c now see these two lines are parallel to b and passes through a and c so what are the two lines p q this is p q lines and the other one is sr s r so i can mark like this with an arrow head showing that these three lines are parallel so i can write a q or p q i can right p q line is parallel to b d as well as s r y we'll look at this question draw a parallel line to a b across c so we need to draw a parallel line here across c draw a parallel line to b c across a name the point crossing each other lines as d write the name of a b c d chord electron okay so we'll do that use the set square and the ruler so we can take the set square and keep it on top of amy so keep the set square on a b first and then take the ruler and keep up on top of this edge and then you hold it tightly and push the set square down and the line should pass us through c point so we keep it 
,like this and draw a line so we need to draw a big line there so make sure that you keep the ruler properly and draw the line and then what you do so that's the line parallel to av so this line is parallel to a then what you have to do draw a parallel line to b c now b c line across a then again you can take the square and keep 
,on top of the bc line now like this and then you take the ruler keep it on top of the straight edge keep on top of the set square like this and keep it tightly here 
,and push the set square up so that you get a line parallel to b c passes through a point so that's the a point you take the ruler and draw the line now you need to take a big line use the ruler to do that because you need an intersecting point now we can see there's a point with these two lines what's the point that point is d now we can see this line parallel to this one write the name of a b c d quadrilateral opposite sides are parallel what you call that parallelograms because opposite sides are parallel parallel to the a b diameter of the circle draw the two lines p m and q n so same thing you have to draw a parallel line so take the straight edge 
,and the set square so what you do first you take this set square keep on top of the a b line like this one edge should be on the straight line a b and then take the 
,ruler keep on top of this edge and what you do you need to draw two lines so you keep the straight edge tightly and push the set square up so that you draw a parallel line passes through p first like this and then we need to draw a parallel line passes through q so push it down so that we can draw the other parallel line so this one so these are the two panel lines this one this one and this one passes through p and q so we can label it as p m and q end draw this diagram with measurements accurately so we need to take these measurements so what is the first thing we can do we can draw the cd line and measure 6.5 centimeters so take the straight edge or ruler and draw a line and first you can mark a point that's d point and measure 6.5 centimeter length 6.5 here that's point c this is d this is c 6.5 centimeters that's the first step then what you do you have to draw a perpendicular to this so we need the set square for that we can keep the set square one edge on this cd line 
,like this so we'll take the point c here and measure three centimeters because here to here three centimeters so measure that one two three so this is the point so that's three centimeters from c i can draw the line and the point is b here then what you do so this point is b and this is perpendicular and 3 centimeters here now we need to draw a parallel line here so we can keep the set square and the ruler ruler on top of this like this and hold it tightly and we need the point here this way so you have to take it other way around so we'll put it like this and keep the ruler this way like this now you can hold the ruler and drag it drag the set square 
,so that you get the line passing through the point p so like this and here to here 4.5 centimeters as well so we can straight away measure 4.5 4.5 is here this point now we can connect it here to here and then finally we can connect these two points so this is the diagram a abcd trapezium this is a trapezium so you can mark it this is 4.5 centimeters and this is perpendicular as well and these two lines are regular check and write using the straight edge and the set square whether the lines given below are parallel to each other so we'll do that seems like parallel but we'll check it so what you do you take the set square keep on top of the line a b and take the ruler and keep it like this so that it's touches the set square like this and you can drag it and see whether you get the same line yeah it's parallel so 
,when you keep it properly it goes like this so it's parallel so we can say a b is parallel to c c now look at these two we can see that these two lines are not parallel we'll confirm that with the set square and the ruler so keep this rs on top of keep the set square on top of rs line like this and then the straight edge like this and drag hold the straight edge tightly and drag it and see yeah we see that pq line is not parallel so we can say our s is not parallel we can say across these two parallel lines not parallel to pq so this means not parallel now we'll look at your exercises in your textbook exercise 7.1 write down the names of two objects that can be observed in the classroom that have parallel edges can you name ruler ruler book sometimes your pencil box also sometimes two parallel ledgers are there and what else the horizontal ledges of the teachers table teachers table so you can write any two objects write down the names of two objects in your day-to-day environment that have parallel edges so what can you see we already wrote that horizontal panels of a ladder horizontal panels of a ladder what else what are the other objects that you use give me tv the horizontal edges of a tv flat tv when you take a flat tv not a curved one so you can say horizontal edges of a flat tv so two objects you can write whatever you like name four locations where parallel lines can be observed in architectural designs so beams of the roof beams of the roof so you see here you get parallel lines like this here this way parallel lines and what else you can see window opposite edges of a window then opposite edges of a dough and then walls edges of walls so we have to say opposite edges because not adjacent ones opposite edges of walls when you take the concrete so you get concrete wires also 
,parallel so you see lot of objects lot of locations where you see parallel lines question number four describe several arrangements and tasks which involve parallel 
,straight lines so we can say when you take the train tracks so we see parallel lights train tracks and when you lay tiles so it's parallel tiles on wall or floats you look at the parallel arrangement and then what else train track and when you make bookshelves so you get parallel lines making bookshelves and sometimes when you lay the concrete so the beams are parallel beams of a concrete slab so these are parallel arrangements in day-to-day life exercise 7.2 draw a straight line segment of length six centimeter and name it table so you need the ruler for that so take the ruler and you need to measure six centimeters first we'll draw a line segment and then i can mark a point here a and measure the length six centimeters one two three four five six yes so mark the point a and b first a b that's six centimeter length mark a point p which does not lie on the straight line segment so i can mark any point p here then you have to draw a straight line passing through p parallel to 
,a b using a ruler and a set square so you need to draw a parallel line here so what we can do we can take the ruler and the set square so take the set square and you can keep it on top of the line first a b line and then keep the ruler next to that like this and keep the ruler tightly and push this one up so that you get the straight line passes through the point p now you can draw the line so this is parallel to a b and passes through the point so we can say this line is parallel to this one then what you do find the gap between the two straight lines by using a straight edge and a set square so we need the perpendicular distance so what we do you take the set square and then you can measure and you can first draw the line this is the perpendicular line here to here and measure that measure that length i get 4.8 
,centimeters so this perpendicular distance is 4.8 centimeters that's the gap between the two straight lines question number two draw a straight line segment and name it p q mark a point a below p cube such that the perpendicular distance from a to p q is 4.8 draw a straight line segment which passes through a and is parallel to 
,peak so first draw any pq line mark a point a below peak so i'll mark somewhere here see and it says 4.8 so you can't mark at any point so you have to measure it 4.8 centimeters away so take the set square and the ruler and we need to measure the distance so i'll take it other way round so because i need to mark the point below 
,now keep the set square like this and you can mark 4.8 centimeters from there from here 4.8 centimeters one two three four here somewhere here so i can mark the point a that's a 4.8 centimeters away from pq line draw a straight line segment which passes through a and is parallel to pq so now you need to draw a parallel line so what we can do i can take the ruler you need to keep on top of the this set square like this and you have to hold it tightly and then drag the set square down so that the line passes through a now you can remove this or you can keep it like that and draw the line so this is this line passes through point a and parallel to pq line so you can mark it this is parallel and the distance between these two is 4.8 centimeters and the line is parallel to pq exercise 7.3 draw each of the following figures using a straight edge and a set square so the lengths are not given just you have to draw a square and a rectangle so we can take the ruler and the set square so we'll take certain distance so roughly what's the distance here four point eight i'll take five so what i can do i can first draw a line segment and mark the point alma this one is a so here to here 5 centimeters this is 5. now take the set square keep on top of this point point a and b you have to keep on the line a b like this and again mark five centimeters i can mark the point here that's five here and you can drag this and again mark five five centimeter length and what i can do so first i can draw the line perpendicular line here and here also i can draw the perpendicular line and i can draw the perpendicular line like this and what i can do i 
,can take the ruler or the set square and connect these two points as well so same distance because the all lengths are equal i took 5 centimeter length now we can see that this is a square abcd and these are perpendicular and all lenses equal that's a square how you draw a rectangle so these opposite lens are equal so take the ruler and the set square first draw a line and we'll take p q is any measurement of 7 centimeter like so i can mark this point p and seven centimeters from here that's q and then i can keep the set square here on top of this straight edge so i can take a different length here i'll take three centimeters so three centimeters or 4 
,centimeters this side and i can mark this point and draw the perpendicular line as well perpendicular line as well and then again keep on top of this point and measure the same length i measured 4 centimeters so this is 4 centimeter and draw the perpendicular line as well draw the perpendicular line as well and then i can take the straight edge the ruler and connect these two points connect these two points with the ruler so i get the rectangle pqrs p q r s and these are perpendicular to each other a trapezium like this so you get parallel lines here these two lines are you can take any point so what you do you can take the ruler and draw a line first 
,and then you can mark mn it's so you need to draw a parallel line for that you need the set square and the ruler so what you can do you keep the set square on top of the line mn and keep the straight edge next to that and then you can drag the set square up so that you can draw the other line parallel to m so i can take the ruler and draw the line i can draw the straight line now i can take any two points length is not important here just any two points i can take this is k and this is l and you can connect these two points with the ruler only thing you need to make sure these two lines are parallel so this is a trapezium klmm now a parallelogram to draw a parallelogram first you need to draw a straight line segment and mark d and mark d and then here you need lengths because opposite lengths are equal in a parallelogram so we'll take the ruler and the square and we'll measure the lens so keep the roller here and we'll measure seven centimeters that's this point e and take the set square keep on top of this straight edge and we can mark 5 centimeter or whatever this distance perpendicular distance i'll take five five centimeter and then 
,drag it again mark five centimeter length here so this means these are parallel so when you take the ruler and connect this this line is parallel you can connect the two points so these two lines are fairless now how we mark the other one we know gf length is also 7 because these opposite lengths are equal so we can mark any point here g g here and you can measure the distance now from here you need to get seven centimeters here now we have all lengths so we can connect all the lens with the so here to here and here too here now we know when you get equal distances you get these two lines also parallel so we can mark these two lines are parallel here also parallel because we took same distance i took seven centimeters and here also seven centimeters so what's the other point f and so this is a parallelogram another trapezium we can see these two lens are color so for that we can take the ruler and draw a line segment this way and mark the two points links are not important here i can mark w and z now i need to draw a parallel line to this one so take this square and the ruler so i can keep it other way around this way on top of the yz line and then keep the ruler so you need to keep it properly like this and then hold it tightly and drag the set square up so that you can draw the line so here i'll remove this now you can draw the line so i have the facility to draw the other lines you have to keep your ruler now i can mark any two points x y so this distance is smaller i'll take this point is x and this point is y only thing i know these two lines are parallel and now take the ruler and connect the take the ruler and connect these two points here to here and here to yeah now we see x y z w is a trapezium question number two write down for each of the above figures whether each pair of opposite sides is parallel or not so we have to take the previous diagrams and write down so we did first one a square abcd and pqrs so what we can say opposite sides are parallel a b c d parallel and b c and a d parallel a p q r s p q and r is parallel and p s and q are parallel in the rectangle so a b c d and p q r s so we can write down a b and c d lines are parallel b c and a b c d so a b and c d v c l a t in the second one p q r s p q is parallel to sr and p q r is this side is parallel to and pq rs so pq r s so p q and s are parallel q r and sp lines are parallel opposite legs are parallel in the second diagram third one third one what was the shape a trapezium so m n n l k m n n only one pair of parallel lines and the fourth one is a parallelogram what are the sides d e f g so d e f g so d e is parallel to g f ef is parallel to d g s so opposite sides are parallel there then fifth one is a trapezium again only x y and y z x y x y is parallel to w z here but we can say x w and y c x w and y z not parallel and also in the third one third one we can write k n and l k n and l m not parallel question number three using a straight edge and a set square draw a square of side length five so we can easily do that take the ruler and draw a line segment and you can mark a point first and then measure 5 centimeter 5 centimeters here and then what you do you take the set square keep on top of this straight edge like this and we can mark 5 centimeter length here and 
,then drag it and keep it here and mark 5 centimeter length as well as you can draw the line as well here also you can draw the line by centimeter from here and then 
,you can connect the two points so this is a square sit sides of our love and all let's ah equal all let's say 5 centimeter length this is also 5 seconds that's a square draw a rectangle of length eight and breadth five so take the ruler you can draw a line first and mark the point here and what's the length there eight centimeters so eight centimeter mark it the length is eight then what you do you take the set square and keep on top of the line and here this is perpendicular so you can first draw the line first you can draw the line here and the breadth is 5 so you can mark 5 centimeter length here and take the set square drag it and keep on top of this point and measure 5 centimeter as well let's let l you can draw the line as well now you can take the ruler cut it the two points and draw the line and draw the line now you can see this is a rectangle and these are perpendicular as well as parallel opposite lengths are parallel the length is 8 centimeters and the breadth is 
,5 centimeter so that's a rectangle question number 4 draw a straight line segment a b such that a b 6 centimeters draw the straight line segment bc such that it forms an obtuse angle with a b at b draw a straight line through c parallel to a b in the direction of a mark the point d on the straight line such that c d is 6 centimeters join a d to obtain the parallelogram abc so we'll draw the parallelogram so first draw a line segment with the rule and then you need to ma point a and measure 
,six centimeters here and mark the point b so these are av points six centimeter away from each other draw the straight line segment bc such that it forms an obtuse angle with a b at b so obtuse means angle more than 90 degrees and less than 180 so you can take the ruler and draw an obtuse angle like this draw an obtuse angle like this so this is the obtuse angle more than 90 degrees and less than 180 now draw a straight line through c so this point i can mark as c draw a straight line through c parallel to a b in the direction of a so you need to draw a parallel line here so what you do you take the set square so you can keep on top of a b line like this and then take the ruler and keep it next to the set square like this and then what you do you can hold the straight edge tightly and push the said square so that 
,it passes through c so here you can't see that so what i can do i can change the direction like this and now i can see where the line is passes through c and parallel to a b now you can draw that line now we have to draw the parallelogram so that means cd also 6 centimeter so we need to measure that so we'll take 6 centimeters from the set square so this is 6 centimeters so you can mark the point here that's d now we can connect those two points so this is d that's also 6 centimeters and now i can join these two points with the ruler so here to here that's abcd parallelogram this length is parallel to this one and this lens is parallel to this one so this is abcd parlor parallelogram we covered all theory related to parallel lines two straight lines in a plane which do not intersect each other are called parallel 
,straight lines two straight lines in a plane which are at a constant distance from each other are parallel to each other the gap between two parallel straight lines 
,is a constant so when you want to draw parallel lines use set square and the ruler

CqrYYiffPr0,good morning students today let us study the rules of divisibility these rules will help us determine whether a number is divisible by another number without actually carrying out the division process let us have a look at different divisibility tests divisibility by two if the number is even that is it ends in two four six eight or zero we say that the given number is divisible by two for example 26 ends in 6 thus it is divisible by 2 divisibility by 3 if the sum of the digits of the number is divisible by three we say that the given number is divisible by three for example look at the number 384 when we add up all the digits that is three plus eight 
,plus four we get the sum as fifteen we know that 15 is divisible by three thus we conclude that 384 is divisible by three divisibility by 4 if the number formed by the last two digits of the given number is divisible by four we see that the given number is divisible by four for example look at the number 164 its last two digits 
,"form the number 64 which is divisible by 4 thus the whole number 164 is divisible by 4 divisibility by 5 if the number ends in 5 or 0 we say that the given number is divisible by 5 for example 525 ends in 5 thus it is divisible by 5 look at this another example 330 ends in 0 hence it is also divisible by 5 divisibility by 6 if the number is divisible by both 2 and 3 we see that the given number is divisible by 6 for example look at the number 408 is it divisible by 2 the number ends in 8 thus it is divisible by 2 is it divisible by 3 4 plus 0 plus 8 is equal to 12 which is divisible by 3 which makes the number 408 divisible by 3 as well hence 408 is divisible by 6 divisibility by 8 if the number formed by the last three digits of the given number is divisible by 8 we see that the given number is divisible by 8 for example look at the number 50 3888 its last three digits form the number 8 on eighty-eight which is divisible by 8 thus 53,000 888 is divisible by 8 divisibility by nine if the sum of the digits of the number is divisible by nine we see that the given number is divisible by nine for example look at the number seven lakh twenty "
,nine thousand six hundred thirty-nine here on adding the digits seven two nine six three and nine we get the sum as 36 which is divisible by nine thus seven lakh twenty nine thousand six hundred thirty-nine is also divisible by nine finally let us look at divisibility by ten if the number ends in a zero we say that the given number is divisible by ten for example 8620 ends in zero thus it is divisible by ten kids now it is time for you to remember all these divisibility tests and find out the answer

HaEmIakO7f4,oh my this is a flood help help but first you need to learn about floods zoom in many of you might think that floods are just overflowing of water well it is much more than that an event when the dry piece of land suddenly gets submerged in water is usually known as floods oh don't take it lightly a flood comes in all depths sometimes it is so high that you don't even have a place to go the power of floods is sometimes very dangerous it can knock your car off and sweep you off your feet two causes of floods are heavy rains River overflow tsunami or hurricanes ice or snow melts breaking of dams etc so a flood can be divided majorly into three categories slow onset floods this kind of flood usually happens when water bodies over flood their banks as the name suggests this one developed slowly which can last for days or even weeks rapid onset floods this kind of flood thus for a day or two even though it is destructive it still takes a little time to develop and thus giving people a chance to escape now comes the most dangerous of them all flash floods this kind occurs within a very short time such as two to six hours and sometimes within minutes this doesn't give any time to prepare no warnings no words of caution just destruction but hey don't lose heart we can do a bit to prevent floods yes that's right planting more trees help preventing floods the roots of plants and trees dig deep into the soil and create spaces between soil particles which help in sipping and holding onto floodwater triviatime floods can even occur in deserts in ancient Egypt people relied on the Nile River floods because they created enriched soil for farmers so what are the three types of floods well you keep thinking and post your answers in the comment section below this is me zooming out tune in next time for more fun facts hey friends isn't the weather lovely wait a minute is B or is a ground moving whoa be careful it's a landslide let me tell you about this natural disaster when the upper mass of the soil gets dislocated from the lower layers and travels down slow it just referred to as a landslide it is also called a land slip or a mudslide landslides can be caused by a number of reasons it could be either natural causes like volcanic eruptions soils erosion and sometimes heavy rainfall increases the rods of landslides even human activities like mining cutting trees increase the fragility of land and make it more prone to landslides one of the most prevalent reasons is gravity well whatever is up has to fall down due to gravity isn't it landslides can either move very slowly like some millimeters per year or it could be disastrously fast sometimes more than hundred miles per hour but if you're living on a flat land with no hills or mountains then you're safe but if you're living somewhere between mountains and on a hilly terrain then my friends you might be at risk but don't worry you could always prepare with some simple steps avoid building houses near steep slopes or at the edges of mountains stay away from drainage paths because water flow increases the speed of landslides landslides do not only 
,happen on earth many scientists believe that planets like Mercury Mars triviatime landslides can happen underwater too and they are called submarine landslides the hot mountain landslide is the largest landslide ever recorded that has happened 50 million years ago so friends what are the other two names for landslides posted right below in the comment section and wait for more fun facts this is me zooming out Oh what's wrong with the water today one day of no water can be so troublesome isn't it but can you imagine living for a week without adequate water supply that's what happens in a drought and this is what we'll be talking about today come on zoom in droughts are usually defined as extended periods of time with less than average rainfall causing a water shortage on the surface in the atmosphere or in the ground water levels it truly becomes a disaster when it begins to affect crops and the lives of people and animals so light rods can lead to the destruction of crops erosion of soil similar to Jam water supply etc jorts can be classified into four different types these are meteorological jort this kind of trod is specific to different regions based on the weather for example 20 inches of rainfall in a year is normal for please say but the same amount could be very less to place be agricultural 
,draught this accounts for the water needs of crops and agriculture for instance not enough water at planting may cause the wheels leading to low plant populations hydrological draught refers to continuous low water volumes in streams rivers and reservoirs human activities can worsen hydrological draughts hydrological drought is 
,often linked with meteorological drugs socio-economic draught this occurs when the demand for water exceeds the supply examples of course could be when a state requires a lot more water than is produced from hydroelectric stations underground wells now that you know about what draughts are let me tell you some tips on how to survive them the one major rule you must keep in mind is save water so here are some tips for saving water during a draught sound of washing machine and dishwasher to full before starting them wash fruits and vegetables in a bowl of water instead of under running water don't leave the water running while washing your face or brushing your teeth take smaller shots or if you use a bathtub fill it only halfway and most importantly recycle don't waste water that can be reused somewhere else such as to water plants all cleaning triviatime only 0.3 percent of water on earth is fresh water available for human consumption a once-thriving settlement by the Pueblo 
,people in Chaco Canyon New Mexico was abandoned in the 13th century due to a 60-year megadrought well friends now you know what draughts are and how to prepare and survive through them for more fun facts tune in next time till then this is me zooming out hello it's quite windy today so I thought I'll take a quick flight you mean hurricane do you mean fly oh ok well that reminds me that today's topic is hurricane whoa a hurricane is a huge storm that generally forms over warm ocean waters near the equator the warm air above the ocean Rises upward thus creating an area of low pressure below air from the surrounding areas pushed in and try to fill the area with low air pressure which now becomes warm and moist and rises to as the moist air rises the surrounding air again tries to fill in and this process continues till the water in the air forms clouds soon the clouds and winds live around fueled by the oceans heat and water vapor therefore hurricanes could also be called giant 
,engines that use warm and moist air as their fuel when we see from the top hurricanes can be as huge as 300 miles wide the center of the hurricane is called the eye 
,of the hurricane which is the calmest part the eye wall surrounds the eye were the most damaging winds are found it can range anywhere from five to thirty miles then comes the rain bands which surround the eye wall these bands are a series of dense clouds that give a pinwheel like appearance to the hurricane which rains from 50 
,to 300 miles hurricanes are divided into five categories depending on the speed of their wind yeah take a look category three four and five are the most dangerous ones Rivia time a huge hurricane can release energy equivalent to ten atomic bombs per second degree hurricanes in the Pacific Ocean unknown as typhoons so this is me 
,coming out tune in next time for more fun facts bye whoa you're laughing right watching me tumble like that are you oh no no go ahead but hey do you know what just happened oh there we go again well this is nothing but an earthquake a small one indeed come let me tell you about earthquakes today zoom in the surface of the earth 
,is like a jigsaw puzzle yes it's not a single piece of land but approximately 20 pieces of a puzzle that constantly move but you don't feel it because they move quite slowly each one of those puzzle pieces are called tectonic plates so whenever those plates hit bump a slight past another plate and earthquake is caused the surface where these plates slip is called the fault or the fault plane so when do you think it happens well it happens all the time but hey don't be scared most of the times we don't feel the quakes as they are too small to reach us but sometimes they are so strong that they can be felt over a thousand miles away the place where the earthquake originates is called the hypocenter and the place where it occurs on the Earth's surface is called the epicenter there are three types of earthquakes convergent boundary here one plate is forced over another during an earthquake which causes a thrust many hills and mountains have been formed due to the convergent boundary divergent boundary your plates are drifted apart from each other forming a Rift zone this kind gives birth to new ocean flows transform fault your the plate slipped by each other and this is also called strike slip so earthquakes are nothing but the shaking rolling or a sudden shock of the Earth's surface now you know that whenever the other stressed or angry it shakes and crumbles don't be scared I was just kidding trivia time the instrument used by scientists to measure the intensity 
,of earthquake is known as a seismograph a tsunami is caused when earthquakes occur under water oh right I need to rush before I crumble again so this is me zooming out tune in next time for more fun facts hello friends Oh No I guess that's a tsunami come let me tell you all about it zoom in tsunamis are caused by sudden movements of the ocean flow due to earthquakes landslides on the seafloor land slumping into the ocean large volcanic eruptions or a meteorite crash on the ocean floor when 
,an earthquake a landslide or a volcanic eruption occurs on the sea or ocean bed a vertical jolt is created which displaces the bed and causes extreme tension in water the water is pushed upwards but gravity tries to pull it down this causes an upsurge in the water levels and the waves got moving away from the point of tension tsunamis are barely felt as a ripple on the ocean surface as the water is quite deep but as and when those wave reached the land the water becomes shallower and the waves constantly increase in height they hit the shore and all my cause a lot of destruction it just said the first wave of a tsunami is not the strongest but the successive waves are bigger and stronger oh and tsunamis can travel at a speed of about 500 miles per hour which is almost as fast as a jet plane and that's why tsunami 
,waves are called killer waves deadly isn't it trivia time did you know that a tsunami wave can be less than 30 centimeters in height and can pass off unnoticed if you get stuck in a tsunami don't swim because the currents will pull you in the opposite direction just hold on to a floating object and be safe so here's the deal go 
,watch this video to know more about earthquakes after all that's one of the major causes of a tsunami this is me zooming out tune in next time for more fun facts whoo hello friends who are you wondering what this is well it's the molten lava that comes out from a volcano come let me tell you what a volcano is then I'm sure you've seen mountains that open up and blurt out think molten same solid like substance well that's called a volcano let's learn more about it a volcano is a vent or chimney that connects magma from within the Earth's crust to the Earth's surface the liquid rock is called magma when it is under the Earth's surface and lava after it comes out so how does a volcano erupt the molten rock stone in the magma chamber rises through the crater pipe pockets as it travels up the main vent gasses expand and water becomes steam creating pressure when the pressure can no longer be contained the volcano erupts through the crater and secondary side vents common volcanic gases include water vapor carbon dioxide sulfur dioxide hydrogen chloride hydrogen fluoride and hydrogen sulfide popular belief is that volcanoes are large cone-shaped mountains but that's not true there are many more types of volcanoes such as white plateaus fresh air vents and bulging don't shapes there are also volcanoes found on the ocean floor and even under ice caps such as those found in Iceland trivia time the word volcano who originally comes from the name of the Roman god of fire Vulcan the tallest volcano in the solar system isn't on earth at all but on Mars so tune in next time for some more fun filled facts this is me zooming out

PIF3RcS8F6k,look at the beautiful apple farm how about visiting this farm and learning the division properties here it will be fun let us begin there are four division properties let us learn them one by one property one when a number is divided by one then the quotient is the number itself let us see how there are five kids in the farm but there is only one apple in the basket how many slices of Apple do we need to make so that the Apple is distributed equally since there are five kids and only one Apple we need to make five slices of the Apple to distribute it equally among the five kids therefore 5 divided by 1 is equal to 5 this concludes that when a number is divided by 1 then the quotient is the number itself property two when a nonzero number is divided by itself the quotient is 1 now we can see for kids and the number of apples in the basket is 4 how many apples does each kid get here there are 4 kids and for apples accordingly each kid gets one Apple so we have divided number four by four and got the answer as one thus this shows us that when a nonzero number is divided by itself the quotient is 1 property 3 when 0 is divided by a nonzero number the quotient is 0 oops there are 0 apples in the basket and the number of kids is 6 how many apples does each kid get there are six kids and no apples so here 
,each kid gets zero apples as there are no apples here simply we divided the number 0 by 6 and got the answer 0 thus when 0 is divided by a nonzero number the quotient is 0 property for when the remainder is zero the quotient and the divisor are always factors of the dividend look at the board it shows the division of 12 by 3 here we can see that 3 is the divisor 4 is the quotient and the remainder is 0 but we also know that 4 & 3 are factors of 12 that is 12 is equal to 4 into 3 is equal to 3 into 4 so we can see that when the remainder is 0 the quotient and the divisor are always factors of the dividend I'm sure you must have enjoyed learning about division properties at the apple farm

PB6clvm_rng,introduction one two three four five six seven eight nine one followed by nine zeros Wow he drove did you know that there are hundred crore bytes in one gigabyte of 
,course I did and did you know that if you added three more zeros you get one terabyte I didn't drove that would make it a very large number how do you read such a large number we say one terabyte is equal to 10 to the power 12 bytes that's really short and sweet too is this a new concept in mathematics Dhruv yes Aisha it is known as exponents in this lesson you will learn about exponents and powers at the end of this lesson you'll be able to express a number in exponential form identify the base and exponent of a number expressed in exponential form compare numbers expressed in exponential form multiply and divide numbers with the same base but different exponents multiply and divide numbers with the same exponent but different bases raise an exponential number to a power raise a number to the power 0 you heard Dhruv tell Varsha that one terabyte is equal to one zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero bytes when expressed so the number on the right is difficult to identify and use hence such large numbers are expressed in exponential form to reduce their size and make comprehension easy one zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero is nothing but 10 multiplying 12 times we use this knowledge and express one zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero 
,zero in exponential form as 10 raised to the power 12 therefore as rightly pointed out by drove one terabyte may be expressed as equivalent to 10 raised to the power 12 bytes 10 raised to the power 12 is made up of 2 integers 10 and 12 10 is known as the base and 12 is called the exponent we can express large numbers in exponential form by varying the base and the exponent look at this number expressed in exponential form basis for and exponent is two it is read as four raised to the power 
,to 4 raised to the power 2 as nothing but 4 into 4 hence it is also read as 4 squared one more exponential number base is 4 and exponent is 3 for race to the power 3 4 raised to the power 3 is nothing but 4 into 4 into 4 therefore it is also read as 4 cubed conversions and comparisons integers decimals and fractions can be expressed in exponential form similarly exponential numbers can be expanded back to their original form exponential numbers can also be compared in much the same way as integers fractions and decimals are compared let's take a look at conversions and comparisons of exponential numbers one by one conversions begin by expressing 64 in 
,"exponential form before can be written as 2 into 2 into 2 into 2 into 2 into 2 since 2 is multiplied with itself 6 times it can be written as 2 raised to the power 6 therefore 64 is equal to 2 raised to the power 6 let us now expand that is 7456 and express it in exponential form 7456 can be expanded as 30,000 plus 7000 plus 400 plus 50 plus 6 which is the same as 3 into 10,000 plus 7 into 1,000 plus 4 into 100 plus 5 into 10 plus 6 which can also be written as 3 into 10 raised to the power of 4 plus 7 into 10 raised to the power 3 plus 4 into 10 raised to the power 2 plus 5 into 10 plus 6 let us try and express 196 in exponential form let us first express it as a product of its prime factors 196 is equal to 14 into 14 which is the same as 2 into 7 into 2 into 7 we can rewrite it as 2 into 2 into 7 into 7 we can now Express the prime factors in exponential form therefore 196 is equal to 2 square into 7 square let us now convert some exponential numbers into their original form through simplification let us to simplify -4 raised to the power 3 minus 4 raised to the power 3 maybe expanded as minus 4 into minus 4 into minus 4 which is equal to minus 64 simplification of a negative number raised to an odd power gives a negative product let us now simplify -6 raised to the power 4 minus 6 raised to the power 4 is equal to -6 assesment drag-and-drop the options in the appropriate boxes self-assessment select the appropriate symbol to place between each pair of numbers laws of exponents exponents let us turn our attention to the laws of exponents pertaining to multiplication division of numbers with same base but different exponents multiplication division of numbers with different bases but same exponent racing of exponential numbers two powers racing of numbers to the power zero application division of numbers with same base but different exponents if q is a nonzero number then Q raised to the power M into Q raised to the power n is equal to Q raised "
,to the power M plus M product of two exponential numbers with the same base but different exponents is an exponential number whose power is the sum of the powers of 
,the multiplied numbers let us understand the law with the help of some examples product in exponential form nine square into nine raised to the power 3 is equal to 9 into 9 into 9 into 9 into 9 which equals 9 raised to the power 5 equals 9 raised to the power 2 plus 3 5 raised to the power 4 into 5 raised to the power 6 is equal to 5 into 5 into 5 into 5 into 5 into 5 into 5 into 5 into 5 into 5 which equals 5 raised to the power 10 which is equal to 5 raised to the power 4 plus 6 if q is a nonzero number then Q raised to the power M divided by Q raised to the power n as equal to Q raised to the power M minus M quotient of division operation between two exponential numbers with the same base but different exponents is an exponential number whose power is the difference between the powers of the dividend and the divisor let us put the law to use Express the quotient in exponential form raise to the power 6 divided by 8 raised to the power of 4 is equal to 8 into 8 into 8 into 
,8 into 8 into 8 upon 8 into 8 into 8 into 8 which equals 8 raised to the power 2 equals 8 raised to the power 6 minus 4 12 raised to the power 3 divided by 12 raised to the power 4 into 12 raised to the power 5 is equal to 2 have raised to the power 3 into 12 raised to the power of 5 upon 12 raised to the power 4 equals 12 raised to the power 3 plus 5 upon 12 raised to the power 4 equals 12 raised to the power 3 plus 5 minus 4 which equals 12 raised to the power of 4 multiplication and division of numbers with same exponent but different bases if P and Q are two nonzero number then P raised to the power M into Q raised to the power M which is equal to 
,P into P into P till M times into Q into Q into Q till M times which equals P into Q into P into Q till M times which is equal to P Q raised to the power M product of two exponential numbers with the same exponent but different bases is an exponential number whose base is the product of the basis of the two numbers multiplied and the power is the same as theirs let us understand this law with the help of some examples Express the product in exponential form seven raised to the power of 5 into 8 raised to the power of 5 is equal to 7 into 7 into 7 into 7 into 7 into 8 into 8 into 8 into 8 into 8 equals 7 into 8 into 7 into 8 into 7 into 8 into 7 into 8 
,into 7 into 8 which is equal to 7 into 8 raised to the power 5 which equals 56 raised to the power of 5 if B and Q are nonzero numbers then P raised to the power M divided by Q raised to the power M is equal to P upon Q raised to the power M of a division operation between two exponential numbers with the same exponent but different bases is a fraction with the base of the dividend as the numerator and the base of the divisor as the denominator raised to a power same as theirs let us now use the law Express the quotient in exponential form 9 raised to the power 6 divided by 4 raised to the power 6 is equal to 9 raised to the power 6 upon 4 raised to the power 6 which is 9 upon 4 whole raised to the power 6 similarly 36 raised to the power 5 divided by 12 raised to the power 5 into 4 raised to the power 5 is equal 
,to 36 raised to the power 5 upon 12 raised to the power 5 into 4 raised to the power 5 which is equal to 36 upon 12 a whole raised to the power of fines into 4 raised to the power 5 which equals 3 raised to the power 5 into 4 raised to the power 5 which is equal to 3 into 4 whole raised to the power 5 which will be 12 raised to 
,the power 5 raising of exponential numbers to powers if B is a number then B raised to the power x a whole raised to the power Y is equal to P raised to the power X 
,into P raised to the power X into P raised to the power X into so on till Y times which is equal to P raised to the power X plus X plus X plus so on till Y times which equals P raised to the power X Y if an exponential number is raised to a power the result is the base raised to the product of the two exponents as power let us look at some examples 7 raised to the power 7 raised to the power 3 is equal to 7 raised to the power 7 into 7 raised to the power 7 into 7 raised to the power 7 which is seven raised to the power 21 which equals 7 raised to the power 7 into 3 similarly 24 raised to the power 3 you raised to the power 5 is equal to 24 raised to the power 3 into 24 raised to the power 3 into 24 raised to the power 3 into 24 raised to the power 3 into 24 raised to the power 3 which equals 24 raised to the power 3 plus 3 plus 3 plus 3 plus 3 which is 24 raised to the power 15 which is equal to 24 raised to the power 3 into 5 a raising of a number to power 0 a number raised to the power 0 is 1 if s is a number then s raised to the power 0 is equal to 1 let us solve some questions based on exponents 0 simplify 8 raised to the power 3 divided 4 square into 2 raised to the power 5 we get 8 cubed upon 4 square into 2 raised to the power 5 is equal to 8 into 8 into 8 hoenn upon 4 square into 2 raised to the power 5 now by further simplifying it we get the answer 1 standard form what is common among these numbers 9 point 8 into 10 raised to the power 3 7 point 3 into 10 raised to the power 4 5.82 into 10 raised to the power 5 4 point 70 3 into 10 raised to the power 2 all of them contain decimal numbers between 1 and 10 multiplied by powers of 10 numbers that are expressed as products of decimal numbers between 1 and 10 and powers of 10 are said to be in standard form Express 9340 7 in standard form nine thousand three hundred forty seven is equal to nine thousand three hundred forty-seven upon ten cube into ten Q which is equal to nine thousand three hundred forty-seven upon one thousand into 10 cube which equals nine point three four seven into 10 cube now Express 345 in standard form by simplifying it we get 
,345 upon ten square into ten square which is equal to 345 upon hundred into ten square which equals three point four five into ten square self assessment match the numeric expressions on the left with the exponential forms on the right you summary let us summarize what we have learned expressing a number in exponential form I the base and exponent of a number expressed in exponential form comparing numbers expressed in exponential form applying and dividing numbers with the same base but different exponents flying and dividing numbers with the same exponent but different bases raising an exponential number to a power raising a number to the power zero

zdY3-P7ogWM,we're going to look at indices okay in indices is the plural okay which means more than one and if we're going to look at the singular of that its index number so that is ellipse number and obviously if there's more than one of them they're called indices so what I'd like you to do is draw me and I speak six and then put a four 
,like that for me okay so put a circle around the six now does anyone know in index numbers what the six is called or what any number in that position would be called it is an integer good girl well done but it's in terms of an index it's got a different name okay this one is called the base number also it can be a letter so when we move on to doing algebra you'll see that it could be an X or a Y or an A or a B okay and then this little number here this one is the index number so what does that mean we've got six with a little four at the top what does it actually mean well done it means this it means six times six times six times six the little number 
,at the top tells you how many times you have to multiply the base number by itself okay so if we have something like this 7 to the power of three what would that be 
,Molly yeah seven times seven times seven because the base number is seven the index number is three that tells you how many times to multiply by itself what about uh no no six we've had six already what about nine to the power of nine times nine yes any falls in it no so 9 times 9 times 9 times 9 that's right okay what about 8 to the power 5 that'd be Talent that's right okay so the base number is the number that repeats the index number tells you how many times you repeat it the most common error is that students would think that meant 24 why would they think that do you think what a mistake are they making Hoshi that's right they're doing 6 times 4 not 6 times itself 4 times there's a big difference okay so what we're going to look at then is we're going to look at index form expanded notation and then we're going to do something called evaluating does anyone have an idea what the word evaluate might mean what might evaluate to mean it's got a bit of a clue in the middle a 
,value 8 sort of yes you're on the right track sort of again you're on the right track by me answer absolutely that's what it means final answer so let's start with ah we've got three different things so we're going to look at index 4 expanded and then evaluates and that's what I'm going to teach you how to use calculator so another word for index form is index what it begins with an end well done very good so index form or index let's put that in brackets underneath index notation an expanded form can also be called expanded notation and just like Shantay says evaluate means let's put it in brackets find the answer okay so we'll start with two to the power of eight so that's your index form two to the power of eight who would like to do the expanded notation for me think about it base number multiplied by itself the number of times that the index number tells you Mackenzie yeah times - okay now we need to work out what that is as a number so this is when you use your calculator so those of you that have got the school calculator I'd love you to have unlimited please if we see you have got three different buttons okay you have x squared you've got the X to the power three button or the X cubed button and then you've got another one there's called X to the Y okay and that one is for you to use when you've got to do bigger powers now those of you that don't have the school calculator if you've got a scientific calculator this one here might be a second function so if you look on the score calculator you've got a yellow button that says second and what it's like the shift key on a calculator on a computer you know when you press shift and it does the upper number so that would be enough but on this score calculator all of these are first function your calculator it might be second function okay I think yours is the bless you yeah y'all know yours is the first function there it's that one okay and you can put the number in so this is what you do to evaluate to 2 to the power 8 okay in want you to do it in your calculator I want you to put in the base number so the first thing is you put in the base number so that's your first button your base number okay so you should have put in what - exactly the next button you press is the X to the Y button okay and what happens when you press that little square appears that's it for the index number and then you put the index number into that okay so you put two X to the Y eight 2 to the power of eight and then the last button that you press is equals that's right so what is 2 to the power 8 who can evaluate it for me Cameron okay you'll just have to borrow actually look do with actually then yeah sorry 256 okay so there are three answers you've got your index for expanded notation and your evaluation okay we're gonna do 
,another couple so so in next forum I know this time actually I'm gonna give you the expanded form and you've got to tell me the index form okay so there's your expanded form three times three times three times three times three times three who can tell me what the index notation for that is same good boy three to the power of six okay now to evaluate it then you put in your base number which is the three X to the Y put in the index number which is 6 and then press equals what does it come to Alex okay so Queen to the power 6 is 729 okay let's oh no let's actually make it a to the power a to the power of five okay now can anyone tell me what the expanded notation for that is Jo hand the passion baby maybe maybe very good okay so to evaluate it put your base number in your calculator press X to the Y which then gives you the index number box put your index number in which is five and then press equals what's the answer Molly so 30 2016 8 okay very good right okay we're gonna do something so like is that one with me with this thumbs okay excellent so we're gonna do something slightly different now let's do this I'm going to give you the expanded form and then I want you to give me the index notation okay so this one is slightly different who can give me the X the index form for this expanded notation Cassidy the index for what are our base numbers going to be two and three so we've got a 2 x + 3 there our base numbers what are our powers going to be they're telling two to the power of 4 times 3 to the power of 5 now how are we going to evaluate this you're going to simply blend how are we going to evaluate this this is a bit 
,different what do we have to do a good luck so everybody listen to is your base number put in X to the power Y then your next number will be 4 ok this time though we don't press equals do we what do we press it spawns times that's right times yeah but you have to be careful you have to yeah a little bit across or else it will do that so on your big dial in the middle if you have codes you've got like an arrow key move it across so that the times comes down now then again you're putting your base number I'll come and show you in a minute put in your base number put in your X to the Y but in your index number which will be fine and then press equals okay sir let me just check that that's going up so X to the Y 4 and then you move it across using that little button times 3 X to the Y 5 and then press equals 3888 very good okay stop you

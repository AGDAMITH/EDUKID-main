Perimeter,XxPw1uieViU,hello grade 8 children today I'm here to teach you a geometry lesson with you that's chapter 2 perimeter so what is perimeter so we'll take figures like this what's 
,,this one a triangle circle a square so these are called closed plane figures when you take one place you can go round and come to the same position in this one also 
,,you can start from any place and come to the same position so we call these a plane closed figures or closed plane figures then what about these figures these are open plane figures so we are finding perimeter perimeter of closed plane figures so what is perimeter means the outer distance of a closed plane figure so when you start from here any place you can come to the same position here so you take the total distance so we'll see what are the properties in perimeter and we'll take several plane figures in this lesson so perimeter is the total length of the boundary of a closed rectilinear plane figure is called the perimeter of the figure units of perimeter what are the units so this is about a length so we use measurements as length so what are the measurements we use for length millimeter centimeter meter and 
,,kilometer so what's the relationship between these measurements so you know when you take the small ruler so one centimeter is equal to ten millimeters and when you 
,,take the meter ruler you can divide into hundred parts that means 100 centimeter is 1 meter then if you take kilometers that's thousand meters is equal to one kilometer now select the appropriate units according to the size of the figure so if you want to measure a smaller length you take some times millimeter centimeters a bigger length meters so when you take distance of a rod or something bigger ones we use kilometres so you need to know which one to choose now what's the shape a square 
,,square means all sides are equal and this is four-sided figure each angle is 90 degrees so if you want to find out the perimeter of this figure so we start from one 
,,place go round and come to the same posture so what's the perimeter of this square if the length of one side is L so it's easy we take letters for words like length 
,,we can take L letter perimeter we can take peel it so if one side is L so starting from here L plus L plus L plus L so these are like terms you can add L for times when you are adding you get full L so what's the perimeter of the square if you know one side is L for L so we can use this formula to find out the perimeter of a square we'll use that one in this question find the perimeter of a square with length 12 now we know L is 12 we need to find out P P stands for perimeter so we can use 
,,the formula for L that means 4 times L L is 12 4 times 12 you get 48 what's the unit that's centi meters look at the second question find the perimeter of a square plot of land where one side is 20 meters now L is 20 at least 20 P we need to find so you can use the formula for L 4 times 20 that's 80 what's the unit meter so we can put 80 meters this one find the perimeter of a square board with side lengths to 0.3 meters so L is 2.3 PE we need to find use the formula for L 4 times 2.3 how we multiply 4 times 3 12 one remaining and 4 times 2 8 + 1 9 that's in meters so nine point two meters the perimeter of a square shape land is 48 meters find the length of one side now the other way around giver so perimeter is given P is given 48 and you're asked to find out L so we can find length of one side that's L is the total perimeter is 48 how you find one side you have to divide by four because P equals four L if you want to find L you divide by four to get n so P divided by four 48 divided by 4 you get the length of one side four times 1/4 and here to 12 meters the perimeter of a square cardboard is 88.8 centimeters find the length of one side again how you find out length of one side I can write L equals P over 4 P is given 88.8 centimeters and you need to find out so P is 88.8 divided by 4 so you get twenty two point two centimeters for length off one side look at this one find the length of one side of a square where the perimeter is 64 point four same thing P is given 64 point four and you are asked to find out the lid so a length of one side is P 64 point four divided by four have you divide four times one for two remaining four twenty four that's four times six twenty four and four times 1/4 so you get this is in sin T meters now what's this shape this is called a rectangle so pair of opposite sides are equal so we called the longer length longer side we called along the side as left shorter man as brick so L stands for length and B stands for bread or sometimes we call wick so how we find out the perimeter of a rectangle now starting from this place L plus B plus L plus B L plus B plus L plus B you can add like terms too well plus 2b now we see that two is common so you can take it out and inside I can write L plus B so I can explain this one as if you separate these 
,,two lengths what you get yeah I want to find out the length of this part that's L plus V I get two parts like that so L plus B here and L plus B this side so twice of that twice of L plus B so you can use this formula to find out the perimeter of a rectangle look at this one find the perimeter of a rectangular plot of 18 meters 
,,long and 14 meters wide so that means L is 18 B is 14 and you're asked to find the perimeter so what's the formula two times L plus B substitute L is 18 B is 42 times at these 2 8 plus 4 12 and 32 when you multiply you get 64 meters find the perimeter of the rectangle which is 24 meters long and 18 meters wide 24 is L breakfast 
,,18 and perimeter you need to find you can use the formula now substitute 24 plus 18 add these 2 8 plus 4 12 1 remaining 3 plus 1 4 2 times 42 84 but the unit meters 
,,look at this one find the perimeter of the rectangle with the length of 12 point 7 at least 12 point 7 and a width of 9.2 so what's the formula 2 L plus b2 times L twelve point seven and nine point two just add the decimal values it's easy to write in a column and add 7 plus 2 9 9 plus 2 11 so twenty one point nine so two times 
,,twenty one point nine have you multiplied ignore the decimal and first x - 2 times 9 18 one remaining 2 times 1/2 plus 1/3 2 times 2 4 then one decimal place you have to keep so I can keep here so forty three point eight meters a rectangular flowerbed is 7.2 meters long and three point four meters wide find the parameter L is the longer side seven point two why breath with me the width three point four P is the parameter we need to find so what's the formula two times length plus breadth two times here seven point two plus three point four add it together seven point two and three point four when you add it you get ten point six ten point six times two here brackets means multiplication two times six twelve one remaining so here two times one two so put a decimal point here and you are getting twenty one point two meters as the perimeter of this rectangular flowerbed the length of a rectangular piece of land is three times its width so if it's X this should be 3x find its length and breadth if the perimeter is 88 so what we can write in this 3x B is X so we need to find out the perimeter so use the formula P equals 2 times L plus B so parameter is given 88 so I can write this is 88 so here I can substitute 88 here so 2 times L is 3 X I break this X now like terms add 2 times 3 X plus X is 4 X is 88 
,,4 times 2 8 8 X equals 88 how can we find out X you divide by 8 so X is equal to 88 divided by 8 that's in a van meters so X is 11 meter so you ask to find its length and brick so what's length length is 3 X that means 3 times 11 33 what's the breath breath is equal to X that's 11 meters the length of a rectangular piece of land is 4 times its width find its length and breadth if the perimeter is 400 meters now if breadth is X this is 4 times that means 4x what's the perimeter 400 that's given so now you can use the form in a perimeter is equal to 2 times L plus B here this side we can write because this is the unknown side X we need to find 2 times 4 
,,"X plus X is 400 for X and X you get 5 X 2 times 5x 402 times 5 is 10 X is 400 divided by 10 you can get X so x equals 40 now X is 40 means what's the length length is 4 X that means 4 times 40 that's 160 centimeters no 160 meters breath is X that's 40 meters look at this one how many square float eyes with a side length 40 centimeters are required to fit a rectangular flow that is 12 meters and 6 meters what now we'll look at the length side what's the length 12 meters now the length of one side of a tile is given in centimeters so this is in meters so what's the first thing you can convert to the same unit we'll convert meters to centimeters length is 12 meters convert to centimeters there you need to multiply by 100 100 times 12 1,200 centimeters the number of floor tiles required for the length side if you keep tires this way only lengths side how many tiles we need the length of a tile is 40 centimeters so we need to divide by 40 take the length in centimeters divided by "
,,one side of the tire for you get thirty tiles along this side you need what about with now now you need to fit this way the width is 6 meters convert to centimeters 
,,this is 600 multiplied by hundred now how many tiles along the width you need 600 divided by 40 40 is the length of one tire you get 60 divided by 4 is 15 tiles we need this way so this way we need 15 tiles now what's the total number of tiles you need you need here this side 30 this side 15 30 times 15 so multiply by 3 putting 
,,0 3 times 5 15 3 times 1/3 plus 1/4 all together 450 tiles you need now this is one method of finding number of tiles but you can use another method what's the second method by finding the area of a tile so you can find the area of the flow and area of fun tile and divide now in this case you can use this but if it's a circular 
,,tile or something you can't use the area method because that's not fitting exactly with the flow you get gaps there so make sure that this way is easy to do for any 
,,type of tile this one how many square flow tiles with a side length 20 are required to fit a rectangular flow that is 10 meters long and 4 meters wide similar question so what's the length they are 10 meters convert to centimeters because the tie length is in centimeters so multiply by 100 you get thousand centimeters so what's 
,,the number of ties required for the length side you take the limp divided by length off one tile that's 20 you get 50 tiles you need what's the width 4 meters convert to centimeters that's 400 centimeters so how many tiles required for which side take the length divided by length of one tile that's 400 so you get 20 tiles you need so this way length side how many tiles 50 tiles and here 20 tiles so altogether you need fifty times twenty so thousand tiles you need for this flow this question find the breadth of the rectangle if the perimeter is 120 and the length is 36 and you need to be what's the formula perimeter of a rectangle tone times L plus B is equal to P now substitute to 36 plus B we need to find out B P is hundred 20 so divide the whole equation by 2 you get 36 plus B is equal to 120 divided by 2 you get 60 now how you find B subtract 36 from both sides so subtract 36 60 minus 36 so what's 60 minus 36 4 and your 4 5 6 24 is the answer what's the answer with units 24 meters so that's the breadth of this rectangle look at this question if the perimeter of a rectangle with a length 48 meters is hundred forty meters find its width so length is 48 perimeter is 140 you are asked to find B so you know the formula 2 into L plus B is P now substitute to 48 is L plus B is equal 240 divide the whole equation by 2 to get cancel out you get 48 plus B equals 70 140 divided by 2 now how we find B subtract 40 8 from both sides so subtraction means you subtract 48 here so 70-48 you get 22 the unit is meters so 22 meters for breath this question find the length of a rectangular board with width of 22 now with this given 22 and the perimeter is 140 you asked to find it let's now use the formula here 140 this is 2 times L is unknown B is 22 divide the whole equation by 2 to get cancel out you 
,,get L plus 22 is equal to 70 now take away 22 from both sides l equals 70 minus 22 that's 48 48 meters is the answer for length you can write here also 48 this question a rectangular frame of Y is formed by a square as shown above find it's one side length so rectangular frame this one you can create a square from this so you asked to find out the length of one side of this square so X is the length now we need to find out the perimeter because this is a wire around this rectangle so what's the perimeter of the rectangle you can find out using the formula so we know length is 48 breadth is 12 so substitute 2 times 48 plus 12 2 times 60 so 120 is the perimeter of the rectangle so that is equal to the perimeter of the square as well so length of one side is perimeter divided by 4 because all the inside the equal 4x 
,,is the perimeter of this square so divide by 4 you and find length of one side X that's thirty hundred twenty divided by four that's thirty what's the unit centimetres equilateral triangles so we did perimeter of a square perimeter of a rectangle now this is equilateral triangle what is equilateral means all sides are equal if this is a this is also a this is also a and what's the other property in equilateral triangle each angle is 60 degrees now we will find out the perimeter of this equilateral triangle start from one place go around a plus a plus a so what's that like terms Eddie sure you get three a so what's the perimeter of an equilateral triangle you can take one side and multiply by three find the length of one side of the triangle by dividing the perimeter of an equilateral triangle by three you can get 
,,one side so a equals P divided by three look at the question here this is an equilateral triangle with length eight centimeters so you asked to find the perimeter so what's the perimeter you can use the formula 3 L 3 times 8 that's 24 centimeters this question find the perimeter of an equilateral triangle which is 11 meters in length three-year is the formula L means given 11 so 3 times 11 that's 33 meters find the perimeter of an equilateral triangle which is eleven point three centimeter 
,,in length so this is an equilateral triangle you can use P equals three times L three times eleven point three three times 3 9 3 times 1/3 3 times 1/3 that's in centimeters find the length of one side of an equilateral triangle where its perimeters 30.6 now other vira so what you have to do you have to divide by three so P is given so how do you find L P divided by 3 so substitute 30 point six divided by three one zero two so ten point two centimeters is the length of one side of an equilateral triangle find the length of one side of an equilateral triangle where its perimeter is forty eight point nine so perimeter is given 48 point now that's three L 
,,so three l equals P forty eight point nine is three L how can we find out L divide this by three so you get L equals divided by this tree if you can't divide like this you can take separately and divide three times 1/3 18 that's six nine so here you have to keep the decimal place first and 4/9 that's 3 3 times 3 9 0 so 16.3 so length of one side is sixteen point three centimeters now this is any triangle so what you call this scalene all sides are different means scalene triangle what's the other type of triangle isosceles also the isosceles means two sides are equal so this is scaling one side is a the other side is B and the other one is C so how we 
,,find out the perimeter of the scalene triangle just add the three lengths a plus B plus C now we'll take this example a scalene triangle is given and you asked to find the perimeter so just add 9 plus 12 plus 7 9 plus 2 11 11 plus 7 18 and with this 2 that's 28 centimeters is the perimeter of this scalene triangle find the perimeter of the triangle whose sides are 12 10 and 9 so perimeter is just a plus B plus C adding all three lengths 12 plus 10 plus 9 what's the answer 11 and one two three so 31 centimeters find the perimeter of the triangle in which the sides are 20 point three eighteen point four and sixteen point seven so how do you find out the 
,,perimeter just add the three values if you can't add it it's better to write in a column and at say 1 + 3 10 14 1 remaining 8 + 6 14 + 1 51 remaining 3 4 5 so fifty 
,,five point four fifty five point four centimeters is the perimeter of this scaling triangle this one parameter is given that's 90 you are asked to find out one leg we can find these two 30 plus 27 is 57 now 57 plus x equals 90 I'll write x plus 57 is 90 because the perimeter is given as 90 so X is take 57 away that means subtract 57 from both sides 90 minus 57 so you get three one remaining six and here 333 centimeters is the x value what is this triangle I told you two sides are equal isosceles triangle perimeter of the triangle below is 34 centimeters find X so make a formula X plus X plus 10 that's the total distance in this triangle that's called perimeter that's equal to 34 X onyx becomes 2x now subtract 10 from both sides 2x equals 34 minus 10 when you subtract you get 24 is 2 X divided by 2 both sides X is 
,,equal to 12 so length of X is 12 centimeters if the perimeter of the triangle below is 45 centimeters fine lengths of each side of the triangle 3 X 2 X 4 X what's the ID sure that's the perimeter that's 45 like terms at 4 plus 2 6 +3 9 X equals 45 divided by 9 you can find out X so X is equal to 5 if x equals 5 what's this one so we'll take this one as so ABC triangle so a B is 3 X B C is 4 X and C a 2 X so a B is 3 times X X is 5 that's 15 centimeters BC 4 X 4 times 5 thats 20 centimeters 
,,and this one is C a 2 X 2 times 5 10 centimeters find the perimeter of the quadrilateral below this is quadrilateral means four-sided plane figure so how do you find out the perimeter when you start from one point you can go around and take the total distance that's called the perimeter so we can find out just adding all these numbers 8 plus 7 plus 9 plus 11 11 plus 9 20 28 plus 7 you get 35 centimeters this is also a quadrilateral what you call that trapezium if the these two lines are parallel we call that's a trapezium find the perimeter of the trapezium below yeah these lengths are equal if this is 8 this is also 8 this is also 8 we'll just add all the lengths 8 plus 8 plus 8 plus 12 12 plus 8 20 20 plus 16 36 centimeter is the unit this one similar to that one this is X X X find the value of x if the perimeter of the trapezium is 53 so we can write down X plus X plus X 3 X 3 X is equal to what 3 X plus 20 all right down 3x plus 20 is the perimeter now perimeter is given 
,,as 53 so what can you do subtract 20 from both sides you get 3x so 53 minus 20 you get 33 so 3x is equal to 33 have you find X you divided by 3x is equal to 11 so what's the unit centi meters look at this question a hundred and twenty centimeter long wire was cut into two equal pieces and she arc between our cheese and sujud from there argit made an equilateral triangle and Sujit made a square find the side length of the collateral triangle and the side length of the square so what's the total length of the wire 120 so what is one piece it's equally divided into two parts so 120 divided by 2 is 1 5 thats 20 centimeters so our jig has 16 120 divided by 
,,2 that 60 centimeters so a jet has 60 centimeters and Sujit also has 60 centimeter wire so how you find out one side of the equilateral triangle we know all sides are equal you know the perimeter 60 divided by 3 you get one side of the equilateral triangle that's 20 centimeters how can we find out the length of one side of a square square you get both sides equal sides so you have to divide by four so 60 divided by four you get 15 centimeter is the length of one side of a square now we will look at perimeter of composite closed rectilinear plain figures so combination of two or more figures what are the figures we did we did square rectangle triangle equilateral scalene to find out the perimeter now we look at this one two squares with side lengths eight combined and make a rectangle shown below fine its perimeter now if you take these two separately what's the parameter perimeter this one is one side is 8 so 40 times 8 here also 4 times 8 so 4 times 8 plus 4 times 8 so 32 plus 32 64 centimeters you are getting if you take separately these two squares when combining squares one side or laps with another side what happens this side and this side or laps and it's the inside length of the rectangle now if you want the perimeter of the new figure you can't take this net so outer length means this one so when combining squares one side overlap with another side so what's the perimeter of the rectangle how many eighths are there now one two three four five six now earlier eight now two sides overlapped and it's in the tangle so you can't take those two sites so we can check it so we'll see how many eighths are there 1 2 3 4 5 6 
,,so 8 times 6 48 centimeters so that combined figure has 48 centimeter as the perimeter of that rectangle find the perimeter of joint site formed by joining three squares that are 8 centimeters in length all sides are 8 centimeters now this is the combined figure there are 4 sides in one square we know that there are 4 sides total number of sites for three squares 4 times 3 that's 12 12 sides are there number of joint sides touching each other now if you take this one that's this one 1 and here half here half here another one so 2 this one 3 4 this square and this side 4 so 4 let's overlap and these are inside the figure so you can't take four lengths number of joint sides touching each other is for now so perimeter of the composite figure now how many sides all together earlier 12 sides four sides inside now 12 minus 4 8 8 times 8 but we'll check that out with finding lengths outside starting from one place how many eighths are there 1 2 three four five six seven and this half and this half eight so we can say eight times eight 64 centimeters is the perimeter of the combined figure shown in the figure are two identical cards of six centimeters length and three centimeter with they combined and formed a large rectangle find the perimeter of the rectangle so this is the combined figure the two sides shown by the dotted lines are located inside the image so here this side overlaps with this one now find the perimeter so we'll take outer length of this one so how many threes are there 1 2 3 times 2 how many Sixers are there 1 2 3 4 6 times 4 3 times 2 6 6 times 4 24 24 plus 6 30 centimeters is the perimeter of this combined frikkin find the perimeter of the figure below 2 sides of the 3 centimeter are located inside the figure yeah this one is overlap so we can't take that length so how we find out the perimeter so we'll take outer length how many threes are there 1 2 3 4 3 times 4 how many 6 is 1 2 3 six times three now add it 3 times 4 12 6 times 3 18 you get 30 30 centimeter is the perimeter of the combined shape find the perimeter of the figure below it's given one and a half and one and a half is three so we'll start from this point how many sixes are there 1 2 3 6 times 3 how many threes are there 1 2 3 and these two another one for 3 times 4 so 6 times 3 18 3 times 4 12 when you add it together you get 30 centimeters as the perimeter of the combined figure so I can highlight this is one and a half and be a happy took as one unit that's 3 centimeter unit find the perimeter of the figures which is aligned with the square and rectangle shown below this is a square with length 4 rectangle length 8 and breadth 4 centimeters so they combine and you can't take the inside length for pairing it only outside boundary so we'll take how many sides are 4 yeah 4 1 2 3 & 4 so 4 times 4 and what about 8 1 2 8 times 2 so 4 times 4 16 8 times 2 16 you get 32 centimeters further perimeter of the combined figure look at this combined figure two sides four centimeter are located inside the figure so this side overlaps so that's inside we can't take it now we'll find out the perimeter of this figure we'll start four centimeter sides one two three four five and we'll take these two separately so four times four then eight one only one so 8 times 1 + 2 x2 + 2 you can write 2 times 2 now add it all sides are taken 2018 - 1 8 + 4 so you get 32 centimeter as the perimeter of the combined figure this one here 2 sides 4 centimeter long I located inside this one you can take it now take the outer length 4 centimeter ones 4 1 2 3 4 5 6 6 times 4 and 1 8 centimeter long length times 1/6 times 4 24 + 8 you get 32 centimeters as the perimeter of the combined figure find the perimeter of the joint triangle and the rectangle shown below so these two sides over laughs and this is inside so you can't take that length so we'll check out a length 1 2 3 3 times 4 centimeter length and 8 1 to 2 times 8 4 times 3 12 and 16 you get 28 centimeter as a parameter of the combined figure this one find the perimeter of the figure formed by combining four triangles of sight four centimeters to a 
,,square so you can't take these four sides that's inside so we check outside length all lengths are 4 centimeter so we'll count how many fours are there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 4 times 8 32 so the perimeter is 32 centimeters this one find the perimeter of the combined figure you can't take this one that's inside how many 12 are there 1 + 2 + 3 3 times 2 then how many Force 1 to 4 times then what is this slap now look at carefully this total length is 12 and this height is 4 so what's this length 12 
,,minus 4 12 minus 4 is 8 you get 8 centimeter length for this one so you need to add that length here now we took all sides did we take all sides no yeah we missed one length 1/2 yeah this is 3 so we'll multiply 4 times 3 here now it's correct so 3 times 12 36 4 times 3 12 and 8 and 12 plus 8 20 and this is 56 centimeters this one to trapeziums together find the perimeter so don't take inside land only outside length you have to take 4 perimeter so how many 6 centimeter legs are there 1 2 3 
,,4 4 times 6 how many 10 legs are there 10 centimeter length 1 2 so 6 times 4 24 plus 20 you get 44 centimeters using square and triangle the following figure is formed find the perimeter so this is the combined one so don't take the inside let so how we find out the perimeter how many fours are there 1 two three four four four and then five point six is this set four times four 16 plus five point six and it together you get point 6 and 6 plus 5 6 plus 5 11 and so twenty one point six centimeters now two rectangles and one square perimeter of the rectangle so this is length is 8 and breadth is 4 so 2 times 8 plus 4 2 times 12 24 perimeter of the square 
,,4 times 4 16 centimeters now we'll see find the perimeter of the combined figure back now combine all three shapes so you are not getting these two inside lens now so how we find out the perimeter you can find out how many fours are there 1 2 three oh five six seven eight eight four and how many eighths are there one to two times eight now add it together eight times for 32 and 16 you get 48 centimeters so 48 centimeter is the perimeter this one again same length a 10-4 so this is 8 and this is 4 now in this one we can't take this part this part the inside let's we'll find out outside length how many fours are there one two three four five six seven eight eight fours how many eighths are there one and two now we can add it two times eight 32 and 16 48 centimeter this is the perimeter of this combined figure perimeter of the rectangle here 8 is length and breadth is 3 so what's the perimeter 2 times L plus B 2 times 8 plus 3 11 so 22 centimeters is the perimeter of this rectangle de la Vega is formed using three rectangles above so same rectangles before now when you combine all together you get inside length so you can't take these ones 
,,so what's the outer length outer length will count how many threes the breadth is 3 centimeters 1 2 3 4 4 times 3 how many eighths 1 2 2 times 8 now how we find out 
,,this length total length is 8 and this is 3 8 minus 3 this is 5 and here also so 5 & 5 that's twice then we missed one length here these two get one and another two 
,,eights so altogether four so I'll erase this one and write for this one should be 4 4 times 8 4 times 3 12 32 and 10 you get 4 here and 554 centimeters is the perimeter of this combined figure what is this shape one two three four five six six sided plane figure hexagon so find the perimeter one side of this figure is four so parameter is full into 6 because 6 sides are there 24 centimeters now look at the perimeter of the combined figure so combining three hexagons but nothing happens nothing overlap so you can take 24 times 3 so 24 times 3 is the perimeter of this combined one so just attached from here only so not overlapping sides so 3 times 4 12 1 remaining 3 times 2 6 plus 1 7 so 72 centimeter is the perimeter of this combined figure now in this one how many sides come by here two sides one from this one and one from another to another to another to another - so how many sides overlap 2 4 6 8 10 sides overlap earlier how many sides were there 6 times 3 6 times 3 hexagons 6 times 3 80 now 4 if you take separately 6 times for 24 and 10 sides overlap actually you are getting 14 sites we'll check that out so it's better to always take 
,,outer lengths now we will see how many fours are there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 so 14 sides are correct so either you can use this method or this method but 
,,I think better to take outer length and find the perimeter four times for 16 and 4 times 1/4 plus 156 centimeter is their combined parameter find the perimeter here 
,,so what are the lengths given here if you take this one fourteen point one four fourteen point one four so fourteen point one four times two then what are the other 
,,lengths twenty another twenty twenty times two and here are ten and ten totus now don't take these two inside lengths you can't take four perimeter now multiply 2 times 4 8 2 times 1/2 again 8 and 2 20 times 2 42 times 10 20 so when you add it together you get fine to wait there and 8 4 plus 2 6 6 plus 2 8 so 88.2 8 centimeters 
,,look at this one now you get a circle part as well find the length of the circle if the perimeter is 40 now we know that perimeter is 50 centimeters given length of 
,,two lines 14 and 14 14 times 2 that 28 centimeters now how can we find out the circle length length of this pot we call that an arc arc length length of the circle is 50 minus 28 so here I'll write 28 here so this one is length of the circle is 50 minus 28 that's 22 centimeters now look at this one as shown in the figure above the boundary of 400 meter long flow path find the length of the two circles so the whole thing is 400 meters so this is 90 meters this is 90 meters so what's the perimeter given 400 meters so length of both sidelines this line is 90 this is also 92 times 90 that's 180 meters so length of the circular area so this one and this becomes the perimeter - the two lengths so perimeter is 400 - 180 you get 220 meters is the length of circular paths this one and this one so that's the length we are not taking these two this one the perimeter of the given figure is 70 point 4 find the length of a smaller semicircle we are lengths of bigger circle which is thirty 
,,point two so this part is thirty point two centimeters given we are asked to find the smaller one so this one is same as this one because this side is equal to this 
,,one so what's the perimeter given 70 point four and what's the length of large semicircle 30 point two lengths of small semicircle is you have to subtract the two values so seven two point four minus thirty point to do it here seventy point four thirty point to subtraction you get here forty point two this is in centimeters now 
,,the length of one of the smallest semicircle so this is two semicircles is this much so what about one semicircle you have to divide this by two you get twenty point one centimeter is the length of one semicircle find the perimeter of a smaller semicircle when the perimeter of the compound figure is ninety point six so all three sides are equal means this is equal to this one is equal to this one all lengths of semicircles are equal so perimeter is given 90 point six centimeters so what's the length of one of the smaller semicircle you have to divide this by three because parameter means three lengths we are not considering inside let's so take ninety 
,,point six divided by three it's one length thirty point two centimeters is their length off one semicircle now we will look at review exercise find the perimeter of 
,,each of the figures given below so this is an equilateral triangle one length is five centimeters so what's the perimeter perimeter is five times three that's 15 centimeters this is isosceles triangle this is six and this is six as well so what's the perimeter here 6 plus 6 plus 4 10 10 plus 6 16 centimeters this one is a scalene triangle just active since 5 plus 6 plus 7 7 plus 5 12 12 plus 6 18 centimeters this is a square one length is 6 so what's the perimeter 4 times 6 because there are 4 equal sides in a square so 24 centimeters this is the rectangle opposite sides are equal so what's the formula 2 times L plus B length and breadth so two times length is 10 breath this for 2 times 14 you get 28 centimeters what's a shape here trapezium this is 5 this is also 5 so what's the perimeter perimeter is add all the lids 5 + 6 + 5 + 8 10 18 + 6 24 centimeters question number 2 the perimeter of a square shape wall tile is 160 so the perimeter is 160 how many such tiles are needed for one lengthwise row of a wall of length 4 meters if the tires are to be fixed without any gaps between them so what's the length of the wall is equal to 4 meters multiply by 100 you get 400 centimeters now we'll find out one side of a tile one side of a tile because the perimeter is given hundred 60 divided by 4 you get one side of a child then you can find how many tiles needed you know them twice number of tiles needed length twice 400 divided by 40 so you need ten tiles for this way question number three if the perimeter of the rectangular shaped paddy field of length forty meters this is 40 meters and we don't know the breadth but the perimeter is given 130 so parameter is given 130 length is 40 and you need to find out the breath use the formula P equals 2 times L plus B perimeter is 132 times 40 plus B 
,,divide both sides by 2 let's get canceled out under 30 divided by 2 65 then subtract 40 from both sides you get B equals 65 minus 40 that's 25 meters question number 4 the length of a rectangular shaped wall tile is greater than its breadth by 10 centimeters if the breadth of the tile is 15 fine its perimeter so what's the length length is 10 centimeter more than the brick so length is 15 plus 10 that's 25 centimeters breadth is given 15 centimeters and you asked to find out that parameter 
,,so formula is 2 times L plus B 2 L is 25 B is 15 when you add it together 2 times 40 80 centimeters is the perimeter question number 5 there are two pieces of wire of length 6 two centimeters each amali makes an equilateral triangle by bending one of these pieces of wire son Domini makes a square find the length of side of equilateral triangle made by amali and find the length of the side of the square made by Sun Domini so there are two pieces of wire so the length of the wire is 60 centimeter each so if this is equilateral triangle you get three sides so what's the length of one side of an equilateral triangle 60 divided by three that is 20 centimeters now we'll look at the square square has four sides equal sides so what's the length of a square 60 divided by four so 15 centimeters question number six the length and breadth of a rectangular shape flowerbed are seven meters L three meters how many square shaped bricks of length 25 centimeter each are needed to place one row of bricks around the flower bed without any space left between the bricks so around this flowerbed seven meters and three meters now we'll see lengthwise how many bricks are needed so this is Lindt is 7 meters convert to centimeters you get 700 centimeters so number of bricks lengths twice so here one brick is 25 centimeter long so 700 divided by 25 so 25 times 254 200 so you would get 8 so 28 bricks lengthwise then how many bricks needed for this side number of bricks for bread side 300 is the length divided by 25 what's that 25 and 450 that's 2 but we know when you are taking the tiles here how many tiles on up here yeah 2 tiles overlap yeah so that means you have to take you have to subtract how many times one two three four tiles you have to subtract after you taking the total length so we'll take that so if 
,,you take number of a bread side this so actually if we take out these two how many ties are there you need 10 tiles so we'll find out the total number of trials needed twenty-eight this way and twenty-eight this way as well and here you have to subtract two from here to from there so actual one is 20 minus 2 and 20 minus 2 there what's the total so 10 10 20 30 40 50 60 60 plus 16 you get 76 all together the total number of tiles needed around this is 76 so this is one method we found using 
,,perimeter seven plus three this one but you need to subtract for a number of tiles because that's overlapping each other if you take the perimeter what's the second 
,,method you can do perimeter of this figure is 700 plus 300 into 2 2 times L plus B so what's that mm is the total length then divide by 4 divide by the length of the tire 25 so you can find number of tiles is equal to u divided by 25 and then you have to subtract again for from that let's see what you get 25 times a 80 minus 4 76 this way also you get the same of tax question number seven the length of a rectangular shape playground is twice its breadth if the perimeter of the playground is 360 meters fine its length L its breadth so we'll put X from X for bread and twice 2x for length and it's 2x and B is X now use the formula 2 times L plus B is P 2 
,,times 2x plus x equals 360 divided by 2 2 X and X becomes 3x 360 divided by 2 180 so divide this by 3 you get x equals 60 so X is the length of the size of the brick so what's the unit so this is bread 60 meters and what's the length then length is 2 times of 60 120 meters example number one calculate the perimeter of each of the figures below so these are all combined figures so rectangle and a equilateral triangle combined together and you ask to find the perimeter so when you take the perimeter you are taking only outer lengths so we'll take the first one how many sevens are there 1 to 2 times 7 how many trees are there 1 2 3 so 1 times 2 14 and 9 23 centimeters this one we take 6 6 1 only 1 6 if you take 8 1 2 2 weights then how many force 1 2 2 4 and then you get 10 6 plus 8 times 2 16 4 times 2 8 and 10 add 
,,it together 12 1 remaining so here 6 + 6 12 12 plus 8 22 remaining 2 3 4 40 centimeters part three so you need to find out the perimeter of the figure so we will find out separately gh gh is high five centimeters a B what's the length yeah total length is 5 this is 2 Phi minus 2 3 so divided equally so this is one and a half and one and a half so what's a B 1 then 1/2 or 1.5 so we can dry find out five minus two divided by two so one and a half or 1.5 will write 2 times a B this I do know now 2 times a B a B is 1 point 5 multiplied by 2 you get 3 centimeters so this is 3 centimeters so what's the perimeter 5 this one yeah we will see how many fives are there 1 2 3 3 5 so I multiply this by 3 5 3 times then 2 1 2 3 then 1 and 1/2 and one and a half we get 3 that's all so you can multiply 15 and 324 this is in centimeter so very meeting is 24 centimeters exercise to 0.1 calculate the perimeter of each of the figures given below so we'll see how many sides are there with five centimeter length 1 2 3 4 5 5 times 5 25 centimeters is the parameter this one 1 to 2 times 5 7 1 to 2 times 7 10 plus 14 that's 24 centimeters look at this figure combination of 2 rectangles so what's the perimeter you take 6 lengths 1 2 3 3 times 6 when it comes to 2 1 2 & 3 2 times 3 and then you need to find out this length so how do you find out that length 6 minus 2 you get 4 centimeters so you need to add four there 6 into 3 18 6 plus 4 10 and 18 that's 28 centimeters now look at this 
,,one this is a good question you have given this side for this one 5 so this is a rectangle and now the rectangle we don't know the lengths okay think about this one 
,,this length and this length when you add what you get the total length for so take this length and move it up so you get here this left move it there what you get this is same as a rectangle so length is five breakfast for so what's the perimeter perimeter is two times four plus five two times nine 18 centimeters this one we let all limbs yeah this is also similar to the previous question if you move this one up actually this is a rectangle and you get extra two let's but we'll add it together this is 12 this is 10 and this is 10 10 times 2 4 4 4 that's 12 and this 4 and this 4 you get another 8 when you add it 12 12 24 24 20 and 8 so you get 52 centimeters take this one here this is 11 here can you see this length is equal to this length so this is 8 now we can find out the perimeter perimeter is equal to 11 plus 8 and another 8 2 times 8 five and four now add it together eleven plus 16 plus five and four sixteen one remaining two three so 36 centimeters for the parameter this figure all lengths are given so this is given and which side not given here this is 90 degrees means this is four and this is for same length this is like a rectangle so all lengths we know this is 5 this is also hot now we'll find out the perimeter 15 and this is 15 15 times 2 how many fours are there 1 2 3 4 4 times how many fives are there 1 2 now what about this one this length this is equal to this given 6 now we'll find out the length 6 1 2 3 4 4 times 6 now add it together 30:16 10 and 24 one remaining here 4 5 6 7 8 80 centimeters this is a trapezium you have given all let's hear this is same as this one this is thirteen point four now you can find the forum Peter thirteen point four two times this is twelve thirteen and five here multiply two times four eight six and two twenty six point eight plus here this is 3 plus 2 5 5 5 10 and 30 so add it together you get point eight and six with five fifty six point eight that's in meters question number two a figure of a 
,,gate with two panels is given here calculate the perimeter of the gate so we need to find out the perimeter of the gate this is equal this is 3 this is 3 this is 4 this one is four now we'll find out 3 twice three times 2 4 twice and 2.5 and 2.5 twice so what's the perimeter six eight two point five times two you get five fourteen plus five nineteen the unit is meters look at this one a figure of an entrance structure constructed to welcome the students of grade one to a school is given with its measurements find the minimum length of the ribbon required to fix around the entrance structure so basically that means perimeter of this figure you get carefully this is one this is one so this is three so what's this 1 1 + 1 2 2 + 3 then this is 1 meter this is also 1 and what is this side this is 3 so this is 3 3 now we'll find the perimeter you can add how many ones are there 1 2 3 4 4 times 1 how many threes 1 2 3 4 5 and this is 5 this one is 5 now add 4 plus 15 plus 5 you get 
,,24 meters so the length of the ribbon required is 24 meters this question a figure offer net use to construct a solid is shown here calculate its perimeter so all sides I equals six so parameter means outer length how many sixes are there 1 2 3 4 5 6 6 into 6 that's 36 centimeters this one a section of a courtyard constructed with square shaped flow tiles of length 40 centimeter each is shown in the figure find the perimeter of this section so perimeter means outer length so one tile is 40 
,,centimeters so this one is 40 so we'll see how many forties are there so B equals very meet one two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 24 times 40 0 4 times 4 64 times 2 8 + 1 9 so this is in centimeters so perimeter of this section is 960 centimeters look at question number 6 if the perimeter of a wall hanging composed of a square shaped wooden lamina and an equilateral triangular shaped wooden lamina with base equal to a side of the square is hundred 60 centimeters so the whole parameter is Rancic's T so all these sides are equal because this base is same as the length of this square so equal sides there are how many sides 1 2 3 4 5 5 sides are there so the perimeter is hundred 60 so what's the first question calculate the length of a side of the square shape wooden lamina that means all together five sides are there so length of the square is 160 divided by five you get 32 centimeters then calculate the perimeter of the equilateral triangular shape wooden lamina so they're asking only the perimeter of this one so three times of that so perimeter of the equilateral triangle only three times one side is 32 3 times 32 96 centimeters look at this one question number seven what is the least of the parameters of the composite plane figures that can be made with two rectangles of length six and breadth for so when you take two rectangles either you can combine like this with the bread side so six six four four oh what's the other way you can combine with the Landsat now they are asking least of the Perim a parameter least of the parameter means the lowest value so we what do you think which one you need to get the lowest value breath is normally smaller than the length so here when you take length side inside you get the parameter least so this shape is the correct one but if you can't figure it out we'll calculate and see so what's the perimeter of this figure so you can't take this one parameter we can find to force two times four and one two three four four times six but you get 8 and 24 32 centimeters this one this is six four four four and six what's the perimeter here two times six and how many fours are there 4 4 times 2 times 6 12 and 16 28 so we can see that this is the least valid the lowest value out of this so this 
,,is the least parameter so least parameter parameter is 28 centimeters freshener made a composite figure form with 4 rectangles of length 8 and breadth 4 centimeters 
,,each and a square of side length 4 square of side length 4 so this one it's shown here calculate the perimeter of the figure so perimeter only the outer length it's 
,,a perimeter is equal to we'll see how many eighths are there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 8 times 8 how many Falls 1 2 3 for now edit 64 last 68 so you get 80 centimeters for the perimeter of this figure question number 9 every morning be newly walks twice around the path shown in the figure find the total distance she walks around the park 
,,each day so twice of that so find the perimeter and multiply by two now can you see this is a rectangular shape figure so when you move this length here and this length here what you get you get her rectangular shape figure so find the perimeter using two times length is 705 with these 475 two times addition of these two ten eight eleven two times zero 2 times 8 16 2 times 1/2 plus 1/3 2 so this is the perimeter of this figure but be newly box twice around so you have to multiply by 2 so total distance is 2 times this 0 12 7 and 4 so this is in meters 4720 so we covered all theory related to perimeter so we found perimeter of square rectangle triangle 
,,scalene isosceles and equilateral and then we did composite figures beining two or more figures together so when you're finding perimeter so the perimeter of the combined figure is not the same as the perimeter of separate figures and also when calculating the perimeter of a composite rectilinear plane figure only the lengths of the straight line segments by which it is bounded should be added not the inside length so make sure when you take a combined figure you add all outer lengths

,NwO363dyeOg,Barry meter today let's learn how to find the perimeter of a polygon the word parameter comes from two Greek words Perry and Metron Perry means around and Metron means measure thus parameter is the total distance of all the sides of a closed plane bigger hence it is found by adding the length of all the sides of a closed clean bigger today we will learn how to find the perimeter of the polygons triangle rectangle and square using formulas let's start with the triangle a triangle has three sides side a side B and side C to find the perimeter of a triangle we add the lengths of all its sides thus perimeter of a triangle is equal to a plus B plus C let's 
,,find the perimeter of a triangle having the dimensions P is equal to 7 meters Q is equal to 8 meters and R is equal to 10 meters we know that perimeter of a triangle is equal to the sum of the lengths of all its sides which is equal to P plus Q plus R that is 7 plus 8 plus 10 which is equal to 25 meters thus perimeter of the triangle is equal to 25 meters now let us look at the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle we have already learned that a rectangle has both sides where in its opposite sides are equal in length thus the perimeter of rectangle is equal to length plus length plus dred plus bread therefore perimeter is equal to 2 into L plus 2 into B where L is the length and B is the breadth which is equal to twice or length plus spread now let's find the perimeter of a rectangle having the dimensions length is equal to 18 kilometers and Brett is equal to 12 kilometers using the formula perimeter of the rectangle is equal to 2 into in brackets 18 plus 12 is equal to 2 
,,into 30 which is 60 kilometers thus the perimeter of the rectangle is 60 kilometers finally let's look at the parameter of the square we know that the lens of the both sides of a square are the same thus the perimeter of a square can be calculated by adding all the four sides of a square thus parameter of the square is equal to 
,,s plus s plus s plus s which is equal to four times the length of a side now let's find the perimeter of a square having sides or ten centimeters using the formula perimeter of the square is equal to AU into 10 which is equal to 40 centimeters thus parameter of the square is 40 centimeters wasn't it easy to find the parameters of these polygons you

,j_HO22TBv1s,now look at this picture drawn in this postcard the picture occupies some space this space is called the area the space occupied by a shape is called the area now this space occupied is called the area now let us compare the two figures and tick the figure which has the greater area among these two this is greater these two figures this is greater these two figures this will be greater in these two you can find out that this will be greater in these two this is greater than this again here 
,,in these two figures you can see this is greater in these two figures this would be greater in these two figures this will be greater and in these two this is a bit 
,,greater than that and in these two this is greater than this you now we shall see area on the scrap paper you all must have seen your max notebooks you all will find your paper in your max notebooks your paper is like this yes or no you all will find these small small boxes now each box is measured as one centimeter each one is 
,,one centimeter or one square centimeter each box you turn out your max mode book you will find these small small boxes now each box is one square centimeter the unit for measuring the area is a square unit area of this square unit is one square centimeter this is one square centimeter there are four unit squares in this square you see there are four unit squares one two three four one unit squares one square centimeter each one is one square centimeters totally here you have one two three four four square centimeters each one is one square centimeter totally you have four squares here one two three four see you count here one two three four five six seven eight nine ten 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 square centimeters square unit can be returned as square unit so each unit is sent each secretin meter square centimeter so that's why I have written 24 square centimeters you now let us find out the areas for the following shapes so one box is how much did I tell you 
,,one square centimeter now we'll count how many boxes and right how many square centimeters 1 2 3 4 5 6 so this will be 6 square centimeter it is necessary you have to write square centimeters now again here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 so this would be how much 12 square centimeters again here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 so this will 
,,be 11 square centimeters now I'm moving on to this one let's count the boxes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 so this will be 9 square centimeters here again 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 so this again will be 9 square centimeters here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 11 square centimeters you now we shall compare parameter and Asia now for this parameter we first find the parameter parameter of the squirrel and then we learn find the area first parameter of the square is just like walk around I'll walk around from here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 so 12 you will start from here it's just like walking and going about and finishing your walk we just measure the boundary alone so I'm just measuring the boundary I am starting to walk from your imagine you're starting to walk from here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 and 12 you just I'm just measuring the boundary line alone so perimeter of the square is 12 centimeter here area we will count the area inside so this will be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and 9 so it will be 9 square centimeter okay as this chapter is going to end we should do some revision for this now fill in the blanks area of one unit is how much one square centimeter the sum of all the sides of a shape is nothing but a parameter square unit can be written as its cube unit we can easily find the perimeter and area of a shape drawn on a graph paper the space occupied by a shape is called area now we should find the area and very meter of the following figures to find the area we will count in the inside box right one two three four so the area is 4 square centimeter the perimeter will be one two three four five six seven eight centimeter here area again will counting inside boxes one two three four five six six what do you write square centimeter parameter is just like a long walk we'll just measure the boundary zero one two three four five six seven eight nine and ten so ten centimeter same way here area will be one two three four five and six six how do you write square centimeter perimeter one two three four five six seven eight nine ten 11 12 12 centimeter here again click on the area first one two three four five and six six square centimeter perimeter we just measure the boundaries alone 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 so 14 centimeters you

Perimeter,3uzWUQlZvm0,do you see that French it's raining acid out there well I know what you guys must be thinking is it really possible or am I just cooking a fictional story well acid 
,,rain is a real thing and can harm our environment so in today's episode let us learn more about this haunting aspect of nature and explore a vital topic we call acid rain zoomin so what is this phenomenon with a terrifying name called the acid rain well we all know that rain clouds are formed of pure water but sometimes gases such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide chemically reacts with the water and oxygen in the atmosphere and fall back to earth in the form of acid rain a shower which 
,,we don't want to take the type of acid rain that contains water is called wet deposition whereas acid rain formed with dust or gases is called dry deposition but how do these gases reach the atmosphere in the first place well there are two main sources for it first is the natural source like rotting vegetation and erupting volcanoes release some chemicals that can cause acid rain but most acid rain is a product of human activities like burning of fossil fuels smoke coming from Baku and chemicals released from the factories and now comes the most crucial question and Lantis what causes the rain to turn acidic well it's important to understand that normal rain is already a little acidic yes my friends while falling towards the ground the rain dissolves carbon dioxide from the atmosphere that forms carbonic acid with a pH of 6 but when we burn fossil fuels that release gases such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide a much stronger acid gets into our rain to form acid rain with 
,,pH 3 which increases the acidity of rain significantly high still confused ok let's try to understand it with an example you see plants in takes some sulfur to grow 
,,that they obtain from potassium sulfate already present in the soil the sulfate is consumed through the roots as the sulfur atoms bond with carbon atoms in the leaves protein and after millions of years when these plants eventually die and turn into coal these sulfur atoms and carbon atoms remain intact and when we burn the fossils of these dead plants the sulfur and carbon atoms mix with the oxygen in the air and are released into the atmosphere as sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide and when the sunlight hits these gases a chemical reaction takes place where the sulfur dioxide reacts with more oxygen to form sulfur trioxide that eventually mixes with the rainwater to a sulfuric acid similarly when our vehicles release nitrogen oxide into the atmosphere they react with more oxygen and mixes with rainwater to form nitric acid and now we know how the rain turns acidic so let us now learn its effect on our environment acid rain has many ecological effects primarily on lakes rivers and other aquatic environments acid rain makes such waters more acidic which results in more aluminum absorption from the soil which is carried into lakes and rivers making the water toxic for the aquatic animals to survive not only that acid rains harm forests as well by damaging leaves and robbing the soil of essential nutrients and making it difficult for trees to consume water so now the main concern is what can we do to stop acid rains well the one easy step we can take is just reducing the burning of fossil fuels that will decrease the number of pollutants responsible for acid rains and the next thing is to share this video with your friends and family to spread awareness about it as we now feature drip your time did you know acid rain damages buildings monuments and statues especially those made of limestone and marble as they contain large amounts of calcium carbonates the calcium compounds react with the acid in the rain damaging them yes exhaust gases from the Mathura refinery greatly affected the Taj Mahal at Agra and changed its colour to a great extent hope you enjoyed today's episode until next time it's me dr.

Perimeter,XxPw1uieViU,hello grade 8 children today I'm here to teach you a geometry lesson with you that's chapter 2 perimeter so what is perimeter so we'll take figures like this what's 
,,this one a triangle circle a square so these are called closed plane figures when you take one place you can go round and come to the same position in this one also 
,,you can start from any place and come to the same position so we call these a plane closed figures or closed plane figures then what about these figures these are open plane figures so we are finding perimeter perimeter of closed plane figures so what is perimeter means the outer distance of a closed plane figure so when you start from here any place you can come to the same position here so you take the total distance so we'll see what are the properties in perimeter and we'll take several plane figures in this lesson so perimeter is the total length of the boundary of a closed rectilinear plane figure is called the perimeter of the figure units of perimeter what are the units so this is about a length so we use measurements as length so what are the measurements we use for length millimeter centimeter meter and 
,,kilometer so what's the relationship between these measurements so you know when you take the small ruler so one centimeter is equal to ten millimeters and when you 
,,take the meter ruler you can divide into hundred parts that means 100 centimeter is 1 meter then if you take kilometers that's thousand meters is equal to one kilometer now select the appropriate units according to the size of the figure so if you want to measure a smaller length you take some times millimeter centimeters a bigger length meters so when you take distance of a rod or something bigger ones we use kilometres so you need to know which one to choose now what's the shape a square 
,,square means all sides are equal and this is four-sided figure each angle is 90 degrees so if you want to find out the perimeter of this figure so we start from one 
,,place go round and come to the same posture so what's the perimeter of this square if the length of one side is L so it's easy we take letters for words like length 
,,we can take L letter perimeter we can take peel it so if one side is L so starting from here L plus L plus L plus L so these are like terms you can add L for times when you are adding you get full L so what's the perimeter of the square if you know one side is L for L so we can use this formula to find out the perimeter of a square we'll use that one in this question find the perimeter of a square with length 12 now we know L is 12 we need to find out P P stands for perimeter so we can use 
,,the formula for L that means 4 times L L is 12 4 times 12 you get 48 what's the unit that's centi meters look at the second question find the perimeter of a square plot of land where one side is 20 meters now L is 20 at least 20 P we need to find so you can use the formula for L 4 times 20 that's 80 what's the unit meter so we can put 80 meters this one find the perimeter of a square board with side lengths to 0.3 meters so L is 2.3 PE we need to find use the formula for L 4 times 2.3 how we multiply 4 times 3 12 one remaining and 4 times 2 8 + 1 9 that's in meters so nine point two meters the perimeter of a square shape land is 48 meters find the length of one side now the other way around giver so perimeter is given P is given 48 and you're asked to find out L so we can find length of one side that's L is the total perimeter is 48 how you find one side you have to divide by four because P equals four L if you want to find L you divide by four to get n so P divided by four 48 divided by 4 you get the length of one side four times 1/4 and here to 12 meters the perimeter of a square cardboard is 88.8 centimeters find the length of one side again how you find out length of one side I can write L equals P over 4 P is given 88.8 centimeters and you need to find out so P is 88.8 divided by 4 so you get twenty two point two centimeters for length off one side look at this one find the length of one side of a square where the perimeter is 64 point four same thing P is given 64 point four and you are asked to find out the lid so a length of one side is P 64 point four divided by four have you divide four times one for two remaining four twenty four that's four times six twenty four and four times 1/4 so you get this is in sin T meters now what's this shape this is called a rectangle so pair of opposite sides are equal so we called the longer length longer side we called along the side as left shorter man as brick so L stands for length and B stands for bread or sometimes we call wick so how we find out the perimeter of a rectangle now starting from this place L plus B plus L plus B L plus B plus L plus B you can add like terms too well plus 2b now we see that two is common so you can take it out and inside I can write L plus B so I can explain this one as if you separate these 
,,two lengths what you get yeah I want to find out the length of this part that's L plus V I get two parts like that so L plus B here and L plus B this side so twice of that twice of L plus B so you can use this formula to find out the perimeter of a rectangle look at this one find the perimeter of a rectangular plot of 18 meters 
,,long and 14 meters wide so that means L is 18 B is 14 and you're asked to find the perimeter so what's the formula two times L plus B substitute L is 18 B is 42 times at these 2 8 plus 4 12 and 32 when you multiply you get 64 meters find the perimeter of the rectangle which is 24 meters long and 18 meters wide 24 is L breakfast 
,,18 and perimeter you need to find you can use the formula now substitute 24 plus 18 add these 2 8 plus 4 12 1 remaining 3 plus 1 4 2 times 42 84 but the unit meters 
,,look at this one find the perimeter of the rectangle with the length of 12 point 7 at least 12 point 7 and a width of 9.2 so what's the formula 2 L plus b2 times L twelve point seven and nine point two just add the decimal values it's easy to write in a column and add 7 plus 2 9 9 plus 2 11 so twenty one point nine so two times 
,,twenty one point nine have you multiplied ignore the decimal and first x - 2 times 9 18 one remaining 2 times 1/2 plus 1/3 2 times 2 4 then one decimal place you have to keep so I can keep here so forty three point eight meters a rectangular flowerbed is 7.2 meters long and three point four meters wide find the parameter L is the longer side seven point two why breath with me the width three point four P is the parameter we need to find so what's the formula two times length plus breadth two times here seven point two plus three point four add it together seven point two and three point four when you add it you get ten point six ten point six times two here brackets means multiplication two times six twelve one remaining so here two times one two so put a decimal point here and you are getting twenty one point two meters as the perimeter of this rectangular flowerbed the length of a rectangular piece of land is three times its width so if it's X this should be 3x find its length and breadth if the perimeter is 88 so what we can write in this 3x B is X so we need to find out the perimeter so use the formula P equals 2 times L plus B so parameter is given 88 so I can write this is 88 so here I can substitute 88 here so 2 times L is 3 X I break this X now like terms add 2 times 3 X plus X is 4 X is 88 
,,4 times 2 8 8 X equals 88 how can we find out X you divide by 8 so X is equal to 88 divided by 8 that's in a van meters so X is 11 meter so you ask to find its length and brick so what's length length is 3 X that means 3 times 11 33 what's the breath breath is equal to X that's 11 meters the length of a rectangular piece of land is 4 times its width find its length and breadth if the perimeter is 400 meters now if breadth is X this is 4 times that means 4x what's the perimeter 400 that's given so now you can use the form in a perimeter is equal to 2 times L plus B here this side we can write because this is the unknown side X we need to find 2 times 4 
,,"X plus X is 400 for X and X you get 5 X 2 times 5x 402 times 5 is 10 X is 400 divided by 10 you can get X so x equals 40 now X is 40 means what's the length length is 4 X that means 4 times 40 that's 160 centimeters no 160 meters breath is X that's 40 meters look at this one how many square float eyes with a side length 40 centimeters are required to fit a rectangular flow that is 12 meters and 6 meters what now we'll look at the length side what's the length 12 meters now the length of one side of a tile is given in centimeters so this is in meters so what's the first thing you can convert to the same unit we'll convert meters to centimeters length is 12 meters convert to centimeters there you need to multiply by 100 100 times 12 1,200 centimeters the number of floor tiles required for the length side if you keep tires this way only lengths side how many tiles we need the length of a tile is 40 centimeters so we need to divide by 40 take the length in centimeters divided by "
,,one side of the tire for you get thirty tiles along this side you need what about with now now you need to fit this way the width is 6 meters convert to centimeters 
,,this is 600 multiplied by hundred now how many tiles along the width you need 600 divided by 40 40 is the length of one tire you get 60 divided by 4 is 15 tiles we need this way so this way we need 15 tiles now what's the total number of tiles you need you need here this side 30 this side 15 30 times 15 so multiply by 3 putting 
,,0 3 times 5 15 3 times 1/3 plus 1/4 all together 450 tiles you need now this is one method of finding number of tiles but you can use another method what's the second method by finding the area of a tile so you can find the area of the flow and area of fun tile and divide now in this case you can use this but if it's a circular 
,,tile or something you can't use the area method because that's not fitting exactly with the flow you get gaps there so make sure that this way is easy to do for any 
,,type of tile this one how many square flow tiles with a side length 20 are required to fit a rectangular flow that is 10 meters long and 4 meters wide similar question so what's the length they are 10 meters convert to centimeters because the tie length is in centimeters so multiply by 100 you get thousand centimeters so what's 
,,the number of ties required for the length side you take the limp divided by length off one tile that's 20 you get 50 tiles you need what's the width 4 meters convert to centimeters that's 400 centimeters so how many tiles required for which side take the length divided by length of one tile that's 400 so you get 20 tiles you need so this way length side how many tiles 50 tiles and here 20 tiles so altogether you need fifty times twenty so thousand tiles you need for this flow this question find the breadth of the rectangle if the perimeter is 120 and the length is 36 and you need to be what's the formula perimeter of a rectangle tone times L plus B is equal to P now substitute to 36 plus B we need to find out B P is hundred 20 so divide the whole equation by 2 you get 36 plus B is equal to 120 divided by 2 you get 60 now how you find B subtract 36 from both sides so subtract 36 60 minus 36 so what's 60 minus 36 4 and your 4 5 6 24 is the answer what's the answer with units 24 meters so that's the breadth of this rectangle look at this question if the perimeter of a rectangle with a length 48 meters is hundred forty meters find its width so length is 48 perimeter is 140 you are asked to find B so you know the formula 2 into L plus B is P now substitute to 48 is L plus B is equal 240 divide the whole equation by 2 to get cancel out you get 48 plus B equals 70 140 divided by 2 now how we find B subtract 40 8 from both sides so subtraction means you subtract 48 here so 70-48 you get 22 the unit is meters so 22 meters for breath this question find the length of a rectangular board with width of 22 now with this given 22 and the perimeter is 140 you asked to find it let's now use the formula here 140 this is 2 times L is unknown B is 22 divide the whole equation by 2 to get cancel out you 
,,get L plus 22 is equal to 70 now take away 22 from both sides l equals 70 minus 22 that's 48 48 meters is the answer for length you can write here also 48 this question a rectangular frame of Y is formed by a square as shown above find it's one side length so rectangular frame this one you can create a square from this so you asked to find out the length of one side of this square so X is the length now we need to find out the perimeter because this is a wire around this rectangle so what's the perimeter of the rectangle you can find out using the formula so we know length is 48 breadth is 12 so substitute 2 times 48 plus 12 2 times 60 so 120 is the perimeter of the rectangle so that is equal to the perimeter of the square as well so length of one side is perimeter divided by 4 because all the inside the equal 4x 
,,is the perimeter of this square so divide by 4 you and find length of one side X that's thirty hundred twenty divided by four that's thirty what's the unit centimetres equilateral triangles so we did perimeter of a square perimeter of a rectangle now this is equilateral triangle what is equilateral means all sides are equal if this is a this is also a this is also a and what's the other property in equilateral triangle each angle is 60 degrees now we will find out the perimeter of this equilateral triangle start from one place go around a plus a plus a so what's that like terms Eddie sure you get three a so what's the perimeter of an equilateral triangle you can take one side and multiply by three find the length of one side of the triangle by dividing the perimeter of an equilateral triangle by three you can get 
,,one side so a equals P divided by three look at the question here this is an equilateral triangle with length eight centimeters so you asked to find the perimeter so what's the perimeter you can use the formula 3 L 3 times 8 that's 24 centimeters this question find the perimeter of an equilateral triangle which is 11 meters in length three-year is the formula L means given 11 so 3 times 11 that's 33 meters find the perimeter of an equilateral triangle which is eleven point three centimeter 
,,in length so this is an equilateral triangle you can use P equals three times L three times eleven point three three times 3 9 3 times 1/3 3 times 1/3 that's in centimeters find the length of one side of an equilateral triangle where its perimeters 30.6 now other vira so what you have to do you have to divide by three so P is given so how do you find L P divided by 3 so substitute 30 point six divided by three one zero two so ten point two centimeters is the length of one side of an equilateral triangle find the length of one side of an equilateral triangle where its perimeter is forty eight point nine so perimeter is given 48 point now that's three L 
,,so three l equals P forty eight point nine is three L how can we find out L divide this by three so you get L equals divided by this tree if you can't divide like this you can take separately and divide three times 1/3 18 that's six nine so here you have to keep the decimal place first and 4/9 that's 3 3 times 3 9 0 so 16.3 so length of one side is sixteen point three centimeters now this is any triangle so what you call this scalene all sides are different means scalene triangle what's the other type of triangle isosceles also the isosceles means two sides are equal so this is scaling one side is a the other side is B and the other one is C so how we 
,,find out the perimeter of the scalene triangle just add the three lengths a plus B plus C now we'll take this example a scalene triangle is given and you asked to find the perimeter so just add 9 plus 12 plus 7 9 plus 2 11 11 plus 7 18 and with this 2 that's 28 centimeters is the perimeter of this scalene triangle find the perimeter of the triangle whose sides are 12 10 and 9 so perimeter is just a plus B plus C adding all three lengths 12 plus 10 plus 9 what's the answer 11 and one two three so 31 centimeters find the perimeter of the triangle in which the sides are 20 point three eighteen point four and sixteen point seven so how do you find out the 
,,perimeter just add the three values if you can't add it it's better to write in a column and at say 1 + 3 10 14 1 remaining 8 + 6 14 + 1 51 remaining 3 4 5 so fifty 
,,five point four fifty five point four centimeters is the perimeter of this scaling triangle this one parameter is given that's 90 you are asked to find out one leg we can find these two 30 plus 27 is 57 now 57 plus x equals 90 I'll write x plus 57 is 90 because the perimeter is given as 90 so X is take 57 away that means subtract 57 from both sides 90 minus 57 so you get three one remaining six and here 333 centimeters is the x value what is this triangle I told you two sides are equal isosceles triangle perimeter of the triangle below is 34 centimeters find X so make a formula X plus X plus 10 that's the total distance in this triangle that's called perimeter that's equal to 34 X onyx becomes 2x now subtract 10 from both sides 2x equals 34 minus 10 when you subtract you get 24 is 2 X divided by 2 both sides X is 
,,equal to 12 so length of X is 12 centimeters if the perimeter of the triangle below is 45 centimeters fine lengths of each side of the triangle 3 X 2 X 4 X what's the ID sure that's the perimeter that's 45 like terms at 4 plus 2 6 +3 9 X equals 45 divided by 9 you can find out X so X is equal to 5 if x equals 5 what's this one so we'll take this one as so ABC triangle so a B is 3 X B C is 4 X and C a 2 X so a B is 3 times X X is 5 that's 15 centimeters BC 4 X 4 times 5 thats 20 centimeters 
,,and this one is C a 2 X 2 times 5 10 centimeters find the perimeter of the quadrilateral below this is quadrilateral means four-sided plane figure so how do you find out the perimeter when you start from one point you can go around and take the total distance that's called the perimeter so we can find out just adding all these numbers 8 plus 7 plus 9 plus 11 11 plus 9 20 28 plus 7 you get 35 centimeters this is also a quadrilateral what you call that trapezium if the these two lines are parallel we call that's a trapezium find the perimeter of the trapezium below yeah these lengths are equal if this is 8 this is also 8 this is also 8 we'll just add all the lengths 8 plus 8 plus 8 plus 12 12 plus 8 20 20 plus 16 36 centimeter is the unit this one similar to that one this is X X X find the value of x if the perimeter of the trapezium is 53 so we can write down X plus X plus X 3 X 3 X is equal to what 3 X plus 20 all right down 3x plus 20 is the perimeter now perimeter is given 
,,as 53 so what can you do subtract 20 from both sides you get 3x so 53 minus 20 you get 33 so 3x is equal to 33 have you find X you divided by 3x is equal to 11 so what's the unit centi meters look at this question a hundred and twenty centimeter long wire was cut into two equal pieces and she arc between our cheese and sujud from there argit made an equilateral triangle and Sujit made a square find the side length of the collateral triangle and the side length of the square so what's the total length of the wire 120 so what is one piece it's equally divided into two parts so 120 divided by 2 is 1 5 thats 20 centimeters so our jig has 16 120 divided by 
,,2 that 60 centimeters so a jet has 60 centimeters and Sujit also has 60 centimeter wire so how you find out one side of the equilateral triangle we know all sides are equal you know the perimeter 60 divided by 3 you get one side of the equilateral triangle that's 20 centimeters how can we find out the length of one side of a square square you get both sides equal sides so you have to divide by four so 60 divided by four you get 15 centimeter is the length of one side of a square now we will look at perimeter of composite closed rectilinear plain figures so combination of two or more figures what are the figures we did we did square rectangle triangle equilateral scalene to find out the perimeter now we look at this one two squares with side lengths eight combined and make a rectangle shown below fine its perimeter now if you take these two separately what's the parameter perimeter this one is one side is 8 so 40 times 8 here also 4 times 8 so 4 times 8 plus 4 times 8 so 32 plus 32 64 centimeters you are getting if you take separately these two squares when combining squares one side or laps with another side what happens this side and this side or laps and it's the inside length of the rectangle now if you want the perimeter of the new figure you can't take this net so outer length means this one so when combining squares one side overlap with another side so what's the perimeter of the rectangle how many eighths are there now one two three four five six now earlier eight now two sides overlapped and it's in the tangle so you can't take those two sites so we can check it so we'll see how many eighths are there 1 2 3 4 5 6 
,,so 8 times 6 48 centimeters so that combined figure has 48 centimeter as the perimeter of that rectangle find the perimeter of joint site formed by joining three squares that are 8 centimeters in length all sides are 8 centimeters now this is the combined figure there are 4 sides in one square we know that there are 4 sides total number of sites for three squares 4 times 3 that's 12 12 sides are there number of joint sides touching each other now if you take this one that's this one 1 and here half here half here another one so 2 this one 3 4 this square and this side 4 so 4 let's overlap and these are inside the figure so you can't take four lengths number of joint sides touching each other is for now so perimeter of the composite figure now how many sides all together earlier 12 sides four sides inside now 12 minus 4 8 8 times 8 but we'll check that out with finding lengths outside starting from one place how many eighths are there 1 2 three four five six seven and this half and this half eight so we can say eight times eight 64 centimeters is the perimeter of the combined figure shown in the figure are two identical cards of six centimeters length and three centimeter with they combined and formed a large rectangle find the perimeter of the rectangle so this is the combined figure the two sides shown by the dotted lines are located inside the image so here this side overlaps with this one now find the perimeter so we'll take outer length of this one so how many threes are there 1 2 3 times 2 how many Sixers are there 1 2 3 4 6 times 4 3 times 2 6 6 times 4 24 24 plus 6 30 centimeters is the perimeter of this combined frikkin find the perimeter of the figure below 2 sides of the 3 centimeter are located inside the figure yeah this one is overlap so we can't take that length so how we find out the perimeter so we'll take outer length how many threes are there 1 2 3 4 3 times 4 how many 6 is 1 2 3 six times three now add it 3 times 4 12 6 times 3 18 you get 30 30 centimeter is the perimeter of the combined shape find the perimeter of the figure below it's given one and a half and one and a half is three so we'll start from this point how many sixes are there 1 2 3 6 times 3 how many threes are there 1 2 3 and these two another one for 3 times 4 so 6 times 3 18 3 times 4 12 when you add it together you get 30 centimeters as the perimeter of the combined figure so I can highlight this is one and a half and be a happy took as one unit that's 3 centimeter unit find the perimeter of the figures which is aligned with the square and rectangle shown below this is a square with length 4 rectangle length 8 and breadth 4 centimeters so they combine and you can't take the inside length for pairing it only outside boundary so we'll take how many sides are 4 yeah 4 1 2 3 & 4 so 4 times 4 and what about 8 1 2 8 times 2 so 4 times 4 16 8 times 2 16 you get 32 centimeters further perimeter of the combined figure look at this combined figure two sides four centimeter are located inside the figure so this side overlaps so that's inside we can't take it now we'll find out the perimeter of this figure we'll start four centimeter sides one two three four five and we'll take these two separately so four times four then eight one only one so 8 times 1 + 2 x2 + 2 you can write 2 times 2 now add it all sides are taken 2018 - 1 8 + 4 so you get 32 centimeter as the perimeter of the combined figure this one here 2 sides 4 centimeter long I located inside this one you can take it now take the outer length 4 centimeter ones 4 1 2 3 4 5 6 6 times 4 and 1 8 centimeter long length times 1/6 times 4 24 + 8 you get 32 centimeters as the perimeter of the combined figure find the perimeter of the joint triangle and the rectangle shown below so these two sides over laughs and this is inside so you can't take that length so we'll check out a length 1 2 3 3 times 4 centimeter length and 8 1 to 2 times 8 4 times 3 12 and 16 you get 28 centimeter as a parameter of the combined figure this one find the perimeter of the figure formed by combining four triangles of sight four centimeters to a 
,,square so you can't take these four sides that's inside so we check outside length all lengths are 4 centimeter so we'll count how many fours are there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 4 times 8 32 so the perimeter is 32 centimeters this one find the perimeter of the combined figure you can't take this one that's inside how many 12 are there 1 + 2 + 3 3 times 2 then how many Force 1 to 4 times then what is this slap now look at carefully this total length is 12 and this height is 4 so what's this length 12 
,,minus 4 12 minus 4 is 8 you get 8 centimeter length for this one so you need to add that length here now we took all sides did we take all sides no yeah we missed one length 1/2 yeah this is 3 so we'll multiply 4 times 3 here now it's correct so 3 times 12 36 4 times 3 12 and 8 and 12 plus 8 20 and this is 56 centimeters this one to trapeziums together find the perimeter so don't take inside land only outside length you have to take 4 perimeter so how many 6 centimeter legs are there 1 2 3 
,,4 4 times 6 how many 10 legs are there 10 centimeter length 1 2 so 6 times 4 24 plus 20 you get 44 centimeters using square and triangle the following figure is formed find the perimeter so this is the combined one so don't take the inside let so how we find out the perimeter how many fours are there 1 two three four four four and then five point six is this set four times four 16 plus five point six and it together you get point 6 and 6 plus 5 6 plus 5 11 and so twenty one point six centimeters now two rectangles and one square perimeter of the rectangle so this is length is 8 and breadth is 4 so 2 times 8 plus 4 2 times 12 24 perimeter of the square 
,,4 times 4 16 centimeters now we'll see find the perimeter of the combined figure back now combine all three shapes so you are not getting these two inside lens now so how we find out the perimeter you can find out how many fours are there 1 2 three oh five six seven eight eight four and how many eighths are there one to two times eight now add it together eight times for 32 and 16 you get 48 centimeters so 48 centimeter is the perimeter this one again same length a 10-4 so this is 8 and this is 4 now in this one we can't take this part this part the inside let's we'll find out outside length how many fours are there one two three four five six seven eight eight fours how many eighths are there one and two now we can add it two times eight 32 and 16 48 centimeter this is the perimeter of this combined figure perimeter of the rectangle here 8 is length and breadth is 3 so what's the perimeter 2 times L plus B 2 times 8 plus 3 11 so 22 centimeters is the perimeter of this rectangle de la Vega is formed using three rectangles above so same rectangles before now when you combine all together you get inside length so you can't take these ones 
,,so what's the outer length outer length will count how many threes the breadth is 3 centimeters 1 2 3 4 4 times 3 how many eighths 1 2 2 times 8 now how we find out 
,,this length total length is 8 and this is 3 8 minus 3 this is 5 and here also so 5 & 5 that's twice then we missed one length here these two get one and another two 
,,eights so altogether four so I'll erase this one and write for this one should be 4 4 times 8 4 times 3 12 32 and 10 you get 4 here and 554 centimeters is the perimeter of this combined figure what is this shape one two three four five six six sided plane figure hexagon so find the perimeter one side of this figure is four so parameter is full into 6 because 6 sides are there 24 centimeters now look at the perimeter of the combined figure so combining three hexagons but nothing happens nothing overlap so you can take 24 times 3 so 24 times 3 is the perimeter of this combined one so just attached from here only so not overlapping sides so 3 times 4 12 1 remaining 3 times 2 6 plus 1 7 so 72 centimeter is the perimeter of this combined figure now in this one how many sides come by here two sides one from this one and one from another to another to another to another - so how many sides overlap 2 4 6 8 10 sides overlap earlier how many sides were there 6 times 3 6 times 3 hexagons 6 times 3 80 now 4 if you take separately 6 times for 24 and 10 sides overlap actually you are getting 14 sites we'll check that out so it's better to always take 
,,outer lengths now we will see how many fours are there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 so 14 sides are correct so either you can use this method or this method but 
,,I think better to take outer length and find the perimeter four times for 16 and 4 times 1/4 plus 156 centimeter is their combined parameter find the perimeter here 
,,so what are the lengths given here if you take this one fourteen point one four fourteen point one four so fourteen point one four times two then what are the other 
,,lengths twenty another twenty twenty times two and here are ten and ten totus now don't take these two inside lengths you can't take four perimeter now multiply 2 times 4 8 2 times 1/2 again 8 and 2 20 times 2 42 times 10 20 so when you add it together you get fine to wait there and 8 4 plus 2 6 6 plus 2 8 so 88.2 8 centimeters 
,,look at this one now you get a circle part as well find the length of the circle if the perimeter is 40 now we know that perimeter is 50 centimeters given length of 
,,two lines 14 and 14 14 times 2 that 28 centimeters now how can we find out the circle length length of this pot we call that an arc arc length length of the circle is 50 minus 28 so here I'll write 28 here so this one is length of the circle is 50 minus 28 that's 22 centimeters now look at this one as shown in the figure above the boundary of 400 meter long flow path find the length of the two circles so the whole thing is 400 meters so this is 90 meters this is 90 meters so what's the perimeter given 400 meters so length of both sidelines this line is 90 this is also 92 times 90 that's 180 meters so length of the circular area so this one and this becomes the perimeter - the two lengths so perimeter is 400 - 180 you get 220 meters is the length of circular paths this one and this one so that's the length we are not taking these two this one the perimeter of the given figure is 70 point 4 find the length of a smaller semicircle we are lengths of bigger circle which is thirty 
,,point two so this part is thirty point two centimeters given we are asked to find the smaller one so this one is same as this one because this side is equal to this 
,,one so what's the perimeter given 70 point four and what's the length of large semicircle 30 point two lengths of small semicircle is you have to subtract the two values so seven two point four minus thirty point to do it here seventy point four thirty point to subtraction you get here forty point two this is in centimeters now 
,,the length of one of the smallest semicircle so this is two semicircles is this much so what about one semicircle you have to divide this by two you get twenty point one centimeter is the length of one semicircle find the perimeter of a smaller semicircle when the perimeter of the compound figure is ninety point six so all three sides are equal means this is equal to this one is equal to this one all lengths of semicircles are equal so perimeter is given 90 point six centimeters so what's the length of one of the smaller semicircle you have to divide this by three because parameter means three lengths we are not considering inside let's so take ninety 
,,point six divided by three it's one length thirty point two centimeters is their length off one semicircle now we will look at review exercise find the perimeter of 
,,each of the figures given below so this is an equilateral triangle one length is five centimeters so what's the perimeter perimeter is five times three that's 15 centimeters this is isosceles triangle this is six and this is six as well so what's the perimeter here 6 plus 6 plus 4 10 10 plus 6 16 centimeters this one is a scalene triangle just active since 5 plus 6 plus 7 7 plus 5 12 12 plus 6 18 centimeters this is a square one length is 6 so what's the perimeter 4 times 6 because there are 4 equal sides in a square so 24 centimeters this is the rectangle opposite sides are equal so what's the formula 2 times L plus B length and breadth so two times length is 10 breath this for 2 times 14 you get 28 centimeters what's a shape here trapezium this is 5 this is also 5 so what's the perimeter perimeter is add all the lids 5 + 6 + 5 + 8 10 18 + 6 24 centimeters question number 2 the perimeter of a square shape wall tile is 160 so the perimeter is 160 how many such tiles are needed for one lengthwise row of a wall of length 4 meters if the tires are to be fixed without any gaps between them so what's the length of the wall is equal to 4 meters multiply by 100 you get 400 centimeters now we'll find out one side of a tile one side of a tile because the perimeter is given hundred 60 divided by 4 you get one side of a child then you can find how many tiles needed you know them twice number of tiles needed length twice 400 divided by 40 so you need ten tiles for this way question number three if the perimeter of the rectangular shaped paddy field of length forty meters this is 40 meters and we don't know the breadth but the perimeter is given 130 so parameter is given 130 length is 40 and you need to find out the breath use the formula P equals 2 times L plus B perimeter is 132 times 40 plus B 
,,divide both sides by 2 let's get canceled out under 30 divided by 2 65 then subtract 40 from both sides you get B equals 65 minus 40 that's 25 meters question number 4 the length of a rectangular shaped wall tile is greater than its breadth by 10 centimeters if the breadth of the tile is 15 fine its perimeter so what's the length length is 10 centimeter more than the brick so length is 15 plus 10 that's 25 centimeters breadth is given 15 centimeters and you asked to find out that parameter 
,,so formula is 2 times L plus B 2 L is 25 B is 15 when you add it together 2 times 40 80 centimeters is the perimeter question number 5 there are two pieces of wire of length 6 two centimeters each amali makes an equilateral triangle by bending one of these pieces of wire son Domini makes a square find the length of side of equilateral triangle made by amali and find the length of the side of the square made by Sun Domini so there are two pieces of wire so the length of the wire is 60 centimeter each so if this is equilateral triangle you get three sides so what's the length of one side of an equilateral triangle 60 divided by three that is 20 centimeters now we'll look at the square square has four sides equal sides so what's the length of a square 60 divided by four so 15 centimeters question number six the length and breadth of a rectangular shape flowerbed are seven meters L three meters how many square shaped bricks of length 25 centimeter each are needed to place one row of bricks around the flower bed without any space left between the bricks so around this flowerbed seven meters and three meters now we'll see lengthwise how many bricks are needed so this is Lindt is 7 meters convert to centimeters you get 700 centimeters so number of bricks lengths twice so here one brick is 25 centimeter long so 700 divided by 25 so 25 times 254 200 so you would get 8 so 28 bricks lengthwise then how many bricks needed for this side number of bricks for bread side 300 is the length divided by 25 what's that 25 and 450 that's 2 but we know when you are taking the tiles here how many tiles on up here yeah 2 tiles overlap yeah so that means you have to take you have to subtract how many times one two three four tiles you have to subtract after you taking the total length so we'll take that so if 
,,you take number of a bread side this so actually if we take out these two how many ties are there you need 10 tiles so we'll find out the total number of trials needed twenty-eight this way and twenty-eight this way as well and here you have to subtract two from here to from there so actual one is 20 minus 2 and 20 minus 2 there what's the total so 10 10 20 30 40 50 60 60 plus 16 you get 76 all together the total number of tiles needed around this is 76 so this is one method we found using 
,,perimeter seven plus three this one but you need to subtract for a number of tiles because that's overlapping each other if you take the perimeter what's the second 
,,method you can do perimeter of this figure is 700 plus 300 into 2 2 times L plus B so what's that mm is the total length then divide by 4 divide by the length of the tire 25 so you can find number of tiles is equal to u divided by 25 and then you have to subtract again for from that let's see what you get 25 times a 80 minus 4 76 this way also you get the same of tax question number seven the length of a rectangular shape playground is twice its breadth if the perimeter of the playground is 360 meters fine its length L its breadth so we'll put X from X for bread and twice 2x for length and it's 2x and B is X now use the formula 2 times L plus B is P 2 
,,times 2x plus x equals 360 divided by 2 2 X and X becomes 3x 360 divided by 2 180 so divide this by 3 you get x equals 60 so X is the length of the size of the brick so what's the unit so this is bread 60 meters and what's the length then length is 2 times of 60 120 meters example number one calculate the perimeter of each of the figures below so these are all combined figures so rectangle and a equilateral triangle combined together and you ask to find the perimeter so when you take the perimeter you are taking only outer lengths so we'll take the first one how many sevens are there 1 to 2 times 7 how many trees are there 1 2 3 so 1 times 2 14 and 9 23 centimeters this one we take 6 6 1 only 1 6 if you take 8 1 2 2 weights then how many force 1 2 2 4 and then you get 10 6 plus 8 times 2 16 4 times 2 8 and 10 add 
,,it together 12 1 remaining so here 6 + 6 12 12 plus 8 22 remaining 2 3 4 40 centimeters part three so you need to find out the perimeter of the figure so we will find out separately gh gh is high five centimeters a B what's the length yeah total length is 5 this is 2 Phi minus 2 3 so divided equally so this is one and a half and one and a half so what's a B 1 then 1/2 or 1.5 so we can dry find out five minus two divided by two so one and a half or 1.5 will write 2 times a B this I do know now 2 times a B a B is 1 point 5 multiplied by 2 you get 3 centimeters so this is 3 centimeters so what's the perimeter 5 this one yeah we will see how many fives are there 1 2 3 3 5 so I multiply this by 3 5 3 times then 2 1 2 3 then 1 and 1/2 and one and a half we get 3 that's all so you can multiply 15 and 324 this is in centimeter so very meeting is 24 centimeters exercise to 0.1 calculate the perimeter of each of the figures given below so we'll see how many sides are there with five centimeter length 1 2 3 4 5 5 times 5 25 centimeters is the parameter this one 1 to 2 times 5 7 1 to 2 times 7 10 plus 14 that's 24 centimeters look at this figure combination of 2 rectangles so what's the perimeter you take 6 lengths 1 2 3 3 times 6 when it comes to 2 1 2 & 3 2 times 3 and then you need to find out this length so how do you find out that length 6 minus 2 you get 4 centimeters so you need to add four there 6 into 3 18 6 plus 4 10 and 18 that's 28 centimeters now look at this 
,,one this is a good question you have given this side for this one 5 so this is a rectangle and now the rectangle we don't know the lengths okay think about this one 
,,this length and this length when you add what you get the total length for so take this length and move it up so you get here this left move it there what you get this is same as a rectangle so length is five breakfast for so what's the perimeter perimeter is two times four plus five two times nine 18 centimeters this one we let all limbs yeah this is also similar to the previous question if you move this one up actually this is a rectangle and you get extra two let's but we'll add it together this is 12 this is 10 and this is 10 10 times 2 4 4 4 that's 12 and this 4 and this 4 you get another 8 when you add it 12 12 24 24 20 and 8 so you get 52 centimeters take this one here this is 11 here can you see this length is equal to this length so this is 8 now we can find out the perimeter perimeter is equal to 11 plus 8 and another 8 2 times 8 five and four now add it together eleven plus 16 plus five and four sixteen one remaining two three so 36 centimeters for the parameter this figure all lengths are given so this is given and which side not given here this is 90 degrees means this is four and this is for same length this is like a rectangle so all lengths we know this is 5 this is also hot now we'll find out the perimeter 15 and this is 15 15 times 2 how many fours are there 1 2 3 4 4 times how many fives are there 1 2 now what about this one this length this is equal to this given 6 now we'll find out the length 6 1 2 3 4 4 times 6 now add it together 30:16 10 and 24 one remaining here 4 5 6 7 8 80 centimeters this is a trapezium you have given all let's hear this is same as this one this is thirteen point four now you can find the forum Peter thirteen point four two times this is twelve thirteen and five here multiply two times four eight six and two twenty six point eight plus here this is 3 plus 2 5 5 5 10 and 30 so add it together you get point eight and six with five fifty six point eight that's in meters question number two a figure of a 
,,gate with two panels is given here calculate the perimeter of the gate so we need to find out the perimeter of the gate this is equal this is 3 this is 3 this is 4 this one is four now we'll find out 3 twice three times 2 4 twice and 2.5 and 2.5 twice so what's the perimeter six eight two point five times two you get five fourteen plus five nineteen the unit is meters look at this one a figure of an entrance structure constructed to welcome the students of grade one to a school is given with its measurements find the minimum length of the ribbon required to fix around the entrance structure so basically that means perimeter of this figure you get carefully this is one this is one so this is three so what's this 1 1 + 1 2 2 + 3 then this is 1 meter this is also 1 and what is this side this is 3 so this is 3 3 now we'll find the perimeter you can add how many ones are there 1 2 3 4 4 times 1 how many threes 1 2 3 4 5 and this is 5 this one is 5 now add 4 plus 15 plus 5 you get 
,,24 meters so the length of the ribbon required is 24 meters this question a figure offer net use to construct a solid is shown here calculate its perimeter so all sides I equals six so parameter means outer length how many sixes are there 1 2 3 4 5 6 6 into 6 that's 36 centimeters this one a section of a courtyard constructed with square shaped flow tiles of length 40 centimeter each is shown in the figure find the perimeter of this section so perimeter means outer length so one tile is 40 
,,centimeters so this one is 40 so we'll see how many forties are there so B equals very meet one two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 24 times 40 0 4 times 4 64 times 2 8 + 1 9 so this is in centimeters so perimeter of this section is 960 centimeters look at question number 6 if the perimeter of a wall hanging composed of a square shaped wooden lamina and an equilateral triangular shaped wooden lamina with base equal to a side of the square is hundred 60 centimeters so the whole parameter is Rancic's T so all these sides are equal because this base is same as the length of this square so equal sides there are how many sides 1 2 3 4 5 5 sides are there so the perimeter is hundred 60 so what's the first question calculate the length of a side of the square shape wooden lamina that means all together five sides are there so length of the square is 160 divided by five you get 32 centimeters then calculate the perimeter of the equilateral triangular shape wooden lamina so they're asking only the perimeter of this one so three times of that so perimeter of the equilateral triangle only three times one side is 32 3 times 32 96 centimeters look at this one question number seven what is the least of the parameters of the composite plane figures that can be made with two rectangles of length six and breadth for so when you take two rectangles either you can combine like this with the bread side so six six four four oh what's the other way you can combine with the Landsat now they are asking least of the Perim a parameter least of the parameter means the lowest value so we what do you think which one you need to get the lowest value breath is normally smaller than the length so here when you take length side inside you get the parameter least so this shape is the correct one but if you can't figure it out we'll calculate and see so what's the perimeter of this figure so you can't take this one parameter we can find to force two times four and one two three four four times six but you get 8 and 24 32 centimeters this one this is six four four four and six what's the perimeter here two times six and how many fours are there 4 4 times 2 times 6 12 and 16 28 so we can see that this is the least valid the lowest value out of this so this 
,,is the least parameter so least parameter parameter is 28 centimeters freshener made a composite figure form with 4 rectangles of length 8 and breadth 4 centimeters 
,,each and a square of side length 4 square of side length 4 so this one it's shown here calculate the perimeter of the figure so perimeter only the outer length it's 
,,a perimeter is equal to we'll see how many eighths are there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 8 times 8 how many Falls 1 2 3 for now edit 64 last 68 so you get 80 centimeters for the perimeter of this figure question number 9 every morning be newly walks twice around the path shown in the figure find the total distance she walks around the park 
,,each day so twice of that so find the perimeter and multiply by two now can you see this is a rectangular shape figure so when you move this length here and this length here what you get you get her rectangular shape figure so find the perimeter using two times length is 705 with these 475 two times addition of these two ten eight eleven two times zero 2 times 8 16 2 times 1/2 plus 1/3 2 so this is the perimeter of this figure but be newly box twice around so you have to multiply by 2 so total distance is 2 times this 0 12 7 and 4 so this is in meters 4720 so we covered all theory related to perimeter so we found perimeter of square rectangle triangle 
,,scalene isosceles and equilateral and then we did composite figures beining two or more figures together so when you're finding perimeter so the perimeter of the combined figure is not the same as the perimeter of separate figures and also when calculating the perimeter of a composite rectilinear plane figure only the lengths of the straight line segments by which it is bounded should be added not the inside length so make sure when you take a combined figure you add all outer lengths

Perimeter,1xfo5aLn2lU,hi kids today we will learn how we can find the parameter an area of rectangle and square so let's get started parameter kids parameter is the distance or the length of boundary of a figure today we will learn finding the perimeter of rectangle and square here we have a square with its side given its side measures 5 centimeters 
,,we have to find its parameter that is the length of the boundary of the square if the site is given we can find the parameter using the formula parameter equals 4 multiplied with side here side is 5 centimeters so parameter is 4 multiplied with 5 4 multiplied with 5 equals 20 so parameter is 20 centimeters now let's take another example here we have a square with side 3 centimeters let's find its parameter neino parameter equals 4 multiplied with side and here the side is 3 centimeters so parameter equals 4 multiplied with 3 equals 12 centimeters now let's move to another question here we have a square with parameter 36 centimeters and we have to find 
,,the length of its side we are given with the parameter and have to find its side we know parameter is four multiplied with side filling the value of parameter we get 36 equals 4 multiplied by side we have to solve this equation or we can think like multiply 4 with which number so that it gives us 36 if we multiply 4 with 9 we get 36 so here side equals 9 so side of the square is 9 centimeters we can also solve it the equation way keeping S on the right hand side we can shift 4 on the right 
,,hand side and change its sign like here it's getting multiplied so on right hand it will be divided so s equals 36 divided by 4 and 36 divided by 4 we get 9 so side 
,,equals 9 centimeters here let's solve a few questions in a quick fashion parameter of square with side 5 centimeters will be 5 multiplied by 4 equals 20 centimeters 
,,parameter of square with side 3 centimeters will be 4 multiplied by 3 equals 12 centimeters side of the square with parameter 20 centimeters will be 20 divided by 4 
,,equals 5 centimeters side of the square with parameter 40 centimeters will be 40 divided by 4 equals 10 centimeters now let's learn how we find area of square here we have a square with its side mention it is five centimeters formula for finding area of a square is side square or side x side so area of this square equals five x 
,,5 equals 25 centimeters square as R is always mentioned in square unit here we have another square its side is 4 centimeters let's find its area the area of square is side square or side x side so 4 x 4 equals 16 so area of this square equals 16 centimeters square now let's solve a quick question in a quick fashion area of square with side 5 centimeters will be 5 x 5 equals 25 centimeters square area of square with side 3 centimeters will be 3 x 3 equals 9 centimeters squared now let's learn finding area and perimeter of rhombus this is a rhombus shape rhombus also have all sides equal so finding perimeter and area of rhombus is just same as we did for square parameter of rhombus with side 8 centimeters will be 8 x 4 8 x 4 equals 32 centimeters so perimeter of rhombus with side eight centimeters is 32 centimeters 
,,area of rhombus with side 4 will be 4 multiplied by 4 equals centimeters square so kids finding area and parameter in case of a rhombus is same as we find in a square now let's learn finding parameter of a rectangle we know rectangle also have 4 squares but it's all sides are not equal its opposites are equal to of its opposite 
,,sides are smaller than other two sides here we have a rectangle with its length and breadth mention let's find its parameter here the length of this rectangle is 7 centimeters and the breadth of this rectangle is 3 centimeters now let's find it parameter formula to find the parameter in case of a rectangle is 2 times length plus breadth that is 2 multiplied with the sum of length of breath here length is 7 centimeters breadth is 3 centimeters playing the values we get 2 x 7 plus 3 2 x 10 2 
,,x 10 equals 20 centimeters so perimeter of this rectangle is 20 centimeters now let's take another example here we have another rectangle with its length and breadth mentioned length is 5 centimeters breadth is 4 centimeters now let's find it parameter we no parameter is two multiplied by the sum of length and breadth so putting the values of length and breadth in formula parameter equals two x five plus four parameter equals two x nine so parameter equals 18 centimeters now let's learn how to find the area of rectangle here we have a rectangle let's find its area formula to find the area of a rectangle is very simple just multiply length with breadth 
,,length x Brett so area of rectangle is a product of its length and breadth so putting the value we get area equals 7 x 3 area equals 21 centimeters squared remember 
,,area is always mentioned in square units now let's solve a few questions on based of what we learned 1 will be the area of rectangle with breadth 5 centimeters and length 9 centimeters we know area of rectangle is length x breadth and length and breadth are 9 x 5 centimeters so area equals 45 centimeters square now let's solve another question find the length of a given rectangle having area as 195 meters square and breadth 13 meters we know length x breath equals area putting the values we will get length x 13 equals 195 breath is teen meters and area is 195 meters square so we have this in the form of a mathematical equation solving this mathematical equation we get length equals 195 divided by 13 195 divided by 13 is 15 so like this 15 centimeters now let's solve another question how would you find the difference between the parameter and area of the rectangle measuring 8 meters by 4 meters we have to find the difference between parameter and area so first we have to find 
,,the parameter and area of this rectangle so putting the values we get parameter equals 2 multiplied with the sum of 8 and 4 so we get 2 multiplied with 12 that is 24 centimeters so we got the parameter now let's find the area we know area of a rectangle is length multiplied with breath putting the values we get 8 multiplied with 4 equals 32 centimeters square so we got the area 2 now we have to find the difference between the area and the parameter and we know we subtract the smaller thing 
,,from the bigger thing here the bigger one is area so let's subtract the parameter from area area is 32 centimeters square and parameter is 24 centimeters 32 minus 24 equals 8 centimeters so difference between area and perimeter of this rectangle is 8 centimeters now let's solve another question here we have a grid where each cell is of measure 1 centimeter by 1 centimeter or each small square has side 1 centimeter we have to find how many cells in rows and columns together would make a square of parameter 20 centimeters first let's try to understand the question we have to find how many cells in rows and columns will make a square of parameter 20 centimeters parameter 20 centimeters means side x 4 equals 20 centimeters first of all find the side of the square whose parameter is 20 centimeters so side of square would be 20 divided by 4 equals 5 centimeters so a square with side 5 centimeters will have parameter 20 centimeters so we have to find the square with side 5 centimeters this is the grid with side 5 centimeters as each square has side 1 centimeter so 5 squares will make a side 5 centimeters this square is made up of 25 squares so 
,,our answer is 25 squares let's answer another question the length and breadth of the rectangle is given below in the figure find the cost of fencing on the boundary 
,,at the rate of $12 per centimeter we have to find the cost of fencing on boundary so first we need to find the parameter of this rectangle and we know parameter is 2 times the sum of length plus breadth 2 multiplied by 7 plus 4 equals 2 multiplied by 11 equals 22 centimeters so the parameter of this rectangle is 22 centimeters and we are given cost of fencing the boundary is 12 dollars per centimeter and we have to find the cost of fencing 22 centimeters we will multiply 22 with 12 to get the cost of fencing 22 centimeters as the boundary is 22 centimeters long cost of fencing 1 centimeter is $12 so cost of fencing 22 centimeters will be 12 x 22 equals 264 dollars so kids let's revise what we have learned we have learned parameter of square is 4 times the side parameter of rectangle is 2 times length plus breadth 
,,area of square is side square or side x side area of rectangle is length times the prep that is and in case of a rhombus and square it's same as a square so kids now you may go ahead take a quiz to learn more toot way has thousands of animated videos on math English and science to clear the core basics of these subject

,,this triangle is mentioned parameter of this triangle is also mentioned can you calculate the length of its third side let's find it out let the third side be X centimeter we can write it in the form of a mathematical equation as four centimeters plus five centimeters plus x equals 14 centimeters that is 14 centimeters now let's solve this equation four plus five we get nine so nine centimeters plus x equals 14 centimeters and solving the equation we get to know x equals 14 centimeters minus 9 centimeters and so we get x equals 5 centimeters so the third side of the triangle is 5cm so we got to know that we need to subtract the sum of two sides from the parameter of the triangle to get the length of third side of the triangle now let's take another example here we have a triangle and it's parameter is given it is 
,,22 centimeters and lengths of two of its sides is given it's 10 centimeters and 6 centimeters and we have to find the length of the third side of this triangle and we know the length of the third side equals parameter minus sum of the other two sides here the sum of other two sides will be 10 centimeters plus 6 centimeters equals 16 centimeters so the length of the third side equals parameter minus 16 centimeters where parameter equals 22 centimeters so the length of the third side is 6 centimeters kids we need to know that in any triangle the sum of the length of any two sides is always greater than the third side now we will be learning how to find the area of a triangle here we have a triangle we have to find its area for finding its area we need two things base height face of triangle can be any side of the triangle and height is measured at right angle to the base that is let any side of triangle be the base enjoy perpendicular to it to get the height of the triangle like this an area is equal to base x height divided by 2 now let's take an example here we have a triangle let's find its area we know area equals base x height divided by 2 and base can be any side of triangle on which we draw a perpendicular and here it's a right triangle so already there is a perpendicular a B to the base B C so the area of triangle ABC equals base x height divided by 2 and here length of the base is 3 centimeters and length of height is 4 centimeters so 3 x 4 divided by 2 
,,3 x 4 equals 12 12 divided by 2 equals 6 centimeters so the area is 6 centimeters square remember the unit of area is always centimeters square or meters square that is always in square units and we write it like this area of this triangle is 6 centimeters square we can also find the area of triangle the other way you can also take the perpendicular BC to the base a B let's find this way also so area triangle ABC equals base x height divided by two and here the base is four centimeters and 
,,hi is 3 centimeters cell 4 multiplied by 3 divided by 2 so the area of triangle will be again 12 divided by 2 equals 6 centimeters square so kids any side of the triangle can be a base on which the perpendicular is drawn now let's find the area of another triangle here we have a triangle we have to find its area and we know area is base x height divided by 2 and here height is given it is 12 centimeters and base is also given which is 20 centimeters so area equals 12 x 20 divided by 2 12 x 
,,20 equals 240 240 divided by 2 we get 120 so the area is 120 centimeters square now let's take another example here we have a triangle we have to find its area we know we can take any side as base select BC be the base now as it's not a right triangle so we will have to draw a perpendicular to the base to find the area so let's 
,,draw a perpendicular to the base BC you can use the protractor to draw perpendicular now here we have a perpendicular now let's measure the height of perpendicular using a scale measure the height of triangle measuring the height of perpendicular up to the vertex opposite to base BC that is vertex a and height of the triangle is five centimeters now we can find the area we know area is base x height divided by two height is five centimeters and the base is 14 centimeters 14 multiplied by five we get seventy seventy divided by two we get 35 so area of triangle is 35 centimeters square so kids today we learnt about triangles how to find their parameter and area now you may go ahead and take a quiz to learn more Oh bye to tway has thousands of animated videos on math English and science to clear the core basics of these subjects

Perimeter,AAY1bsazcgM,"Hi! Welcome to Math Antics. In this lesson, were going to learn about an important concept in Geometry called Perimeter. Perimeter is just a fancy math term that "
,,means the distance (or length) around a shape. ...but
,,what exactly does the distance around a shape mean? Well... distance (or length) is a 1-dimensional quantity that we can measure with units like
,,"centimeters, inches or miles. That means that perimeter is also a 1-dimensional quantity that we can measure with units of length. For example, the perimeter of a shape wouldnt be just 10, but it could be 10 cm. Or, instead of being just 25, it could be 25 miles. The units are REALLY important"
,,"when youre talking about perimeter! Okay, but what exactly do we mean by,"
,,around a shape? It seems like there would be a lot of different ways
,,to go around a shape. Some of them would be short
,,"and some of them would be very long. Well, perimeter means the absolute shortest distance possible around a shape. That would be the distance youd get if you traced the path exactly around the border (or edge) of a shape. A good way to see what perimeter is, is to imagine that you could walk right along the edge of a shape, like this 5-sided polygon. Imagine starting at one of the polygons vertices and then walking along each side until you got all the way back to the point that you started from. The total distance you traveled would be the perimeter of that shape. In this case, if the length of each side of the polygon was 10 meters, the total length you would travel along all 5 sides would add up to 50 meters. Another good way to see what perimeter is, is to imagine that you could take a shape, like this square, and break it at one of its corners. Then, you could unfold the shape until it formed a straight line.  The length of that line is the perimeter of the shape. Doing this helps you understand why perimeter is a 1-dimensional quantity, even though it applies to 2-dimensional shapes like this square. Its 1-dimensional because its the distance of the lines that go around the 2-dimensional shape. Okay, so now that you know what perimeter is, how do we measure or calculate it for different geometric shapes? Well... that depends on the shapes. Finding the perimeter of shapes that have curves, like circles or hearts or things like that, can be tricky. In fact, well wait and talk about the perimeter of a circle in another video. In this video, were just going to focus on how to find the perimeter of polygons. Since polygons are made from only straight sides, its easy to find their perimeter. If you know the length of each side, all you have to do is add them up, and the total length you end up with is the perimeter of the polygon. Lets try doing that with a few examples so you see how it works... the first polygon well try is a triangle. "
,,"This triangle has three sides that are each a different length: 3cm, 4cm and 5cm. Now, to find the perimeter of the triangle, all we have to do is add up the lengths of those three sides. 3 + 4 + 5 = 12 But dont forget.  Its not just 12. Its 12 centimeters. Always remember to also put down the units of the perimeter. Okay, that was easy.  Lets try another one. This time our polygon is a rectangle.  And you can see that the shorter sides are each 5m long and the longer sides are each 10m long. So... lets add them all up. We can add up the sides in any order we want to, as long as we dont forget any sides or accidentally count any of them twice. And I think Ill add up the two short sides first. 5 + 5 = 10 Next, Ill add up the two longer sides. 10 + 10 = 20 And now, if I add up those two answers, Ill get the total for all 4 sides. 10 + 20 = 30 So, the perimeter of this rectangle is 30 METERS! Ha!  You thought I was going to forget my units, didnt you. Not this time! Ah, heres another good example. This is a 6-sided regular polygon. A regular polygon means that all its sides are exactly the same length. Thats good because this diagram only shows the length of ONE side. (4 cm). But since the polygon is regular, we know that all the sides must also be 4 cm long. Now, we could just add up "
,,"all the sides like we did before, but since they are all the same, we can use multiplication as a shortcut. Thats because multiplication is really just repeated addition. All we have to do is multiply the number of sides (6) by the length of the sides (4 cm). 6 x 4 = 24 so that means the total perimeter must be 24. 24 what?    "
,,"                                 . Ooo - Centimeters !!! Thats better.                            . And this formula works for ANY regular polygon, no matter how many sides there are. If the sides are ALL THE SAME LENGTH,  you can just multiply the number of sides by the side length, and you have the perimeter! Okay, let's try "
,,one more example. This polygon also has six sides but its NOT a regular polygon. The sides are different lengths and this ones really tricky because they only show us
,,the length of four of the sides. The other two are missing!
,,"So how can we figure them out? Problems like this come up all the time in math; problems where you arent quite given all the information. When you have this kind of problem, the key is to use what you DO know to figure out what you DONT know.  Heres what I mean... Look closely at the two vertical sides that we DO know the lengths of (4 inches and 6 inches) Now... imagine that those two vertical sides could be moved straight across to the other side... the side that we dont know the length of. By doing that, you can see that the missing length would just be the combination of the two vertical lengths we DO know: 4 inches and 6 inches. And since 4 + "
,,"6 = 10, the missing vertical side must be 10 inches long. Notice that we can do the same thing for the horizontal sides that we do know. If we imagine those moving down to the side that we dont know, we see that its length must equal the combination of those two lengths. 10 inches plus 5 inches equals 15 inches. There, weve used the lengths that we DID know to figure out the lengths that we DIDNT know. And now that we know the length of ALL the sides, we can just add them all up to get "
,,"the perimeter. 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 And then 15 + 15 = 30 30 + 10 = 40 and last of all, 40 + 10 = 50 So, the sum of all the sides is 50 inches."
,,"Thats the perimeter of this shape. And thats the end of this lesson. Weve learned that Perimeter is the distance (or length) around a geometric shape, and weve learned how to calculate it for any polygon. You just add up the lengths of all the sides and the total length is the perimeter. Oh... and dont forget your units! Also, dont forget that to get good at math takes practice!

,,am good be bald my parents have cut down on family eat outs I am only allowed to eat all us only on Sundays I really look forward for Sunday's every week when I come to your shop I see so meaty on this Sunday Golu bye so here you have a very good manner with mix of tasty and healthy food my wife and my doctor both are happy yes 
,,the menu of healthy foods keeps us healthy and fed I feel active the whole day long yours is release hot cells only fried oily food we all know how bad it is for health myself healthy for all likes spicy food at her heels shop but for my health I know this is better for me now I know why the number of customers ever did used in 
,,our shop I don't like the waves oh hell ankle spoke about our shop but it is true people are more keen to have healthy food now upper upper I know the reason why customers are not coming to our shop nowadays they have become very health conscious and so they want to eat tasty as well as healthy food I think we should also add some healthy dishes to our menu Appa huh what healthy food I don't think so I know that my expertise is to make and sell tasty fried food I don't think so I can get into this new type of cooking and if you don't cook it well we will suffer further losses I don't think so it is a good idea Iqbal but Appa we ourselves are eating healthy food see the vegetable salad banana and soup I can help you in this let us do it okay let's add few things to our menu steamed at least toklas sooo juices sandwich and salads

Perimeter,69lzkfvFUqQ,simple tenses present past and future let us learn about simple tenses remember in simple tenses the verbs simply indicate an action in the present past or future the simple present tense resembles the base verb but we add s es or IES to a base verb when the subject is in the third-person singular he/she it for example I do but 
,,he does or you carry the load but she carries the load here we see that the base verb do and carry remain the same for first person I and second person you but for third person he or she we need to add es of IES to the base verb the simple present tense is used to indicate the following habits for example he goes for a walk every day regular actions for example the cobbler men's shoes current situation for example I am unwell general truths of facts for example trees give oxygen the simple 
,,past tense is formed when we add the suffix IDI to base verb for example the children jumped into the river the simple past tense shows an action that happened in the past and is over now for example he worked in Dubai last year it is also used to talk about a past habit for example he exercised every day irregular verbs to not 
,,add IDI they take different forms for example he ran last night the simple future tense is formed by adding will or shall before the base verb for example I will watch television after I complete my homework the simple future tense shows an action that will happen sometime in the future for example I will be in grade 5 next year remember simple present and simple past tenses do not have helping verbs we use singular verbs such as is was washes nose etc with singular subject for example she 
,,knows it we use plural verbs such as our work wash no etc with plural subjects for example they know it we can form negative sentences and questions using verbs in simple tenses for example he does not exercise every day will we reach on time

Perimeter,J-kLTQPNnPc,hello children we know that all geometric figures are built by basic figures like points lines line segments rays and planes let us revise these basic figures and also learn about intersecting lines parallel lines and perpendicular lines lene a plane is a flat surface it extends infinitely in all directions it has no boundaries 
,,point a point indicates a position in space it has no length red or thickness B and this are all points in space we read them as point B point R and point s line a line contains an infinite number of points the arrows at the ends of a given line indicate that it has no beginning or n that is a line extends in both directions look at this line we represent it with letters and the symbol of the line about them like this we read it as line PQ or line QP look at this line two points on a line can be used to name it such as line a B line BC line AC line C B line c a.o line ba now look at this line we can also name and read the line by a single small letter 
,,for example line L line segment a line segment contains a finite number of points it is a fixed distance between two points on a line it has two endpoints here de is a line segment it is written as de or Edie now let us see how to measure a line segment the distance between two points is called the length of the segment to measure a line segment we use a ruler a ruler is marked with centimeters each centimeter is divided into ten parts each part is one millimeter now let's solve an example 
,,measure the line segment XY thus we say the length of line segment XY is equal to five point three centimeters next is REE arrey contains an infinite number of points arrey has one endpoint the other end of the Ray is extended indefinitely XY is a ray it can be read only as Ray XY as we always start from the end point do not read it as real YX it is written as shown this ray can be read as ray a be Ray AC now let us learn about intersecting lines when two lines meet at one point they are called intersecting lines here line a B and C D meet at point P hence line a B and line C D are called intersecting lines coming two parallel lines two lines that are 
,,at the same distance and do not meet are called parallel lines here line a B and line CD are parallel lines we read it as line a B is parallel to line C D we write it as shown kids look here two lines drawn on either side of a ruler are parallel lines lastly perpendicular lines two intersecting lines make a right angle at the point of intersection then they are called perpendicular lines here line a B and line C D intersect at Point P here angle a PC is equal to 90 degrees hence these two lines are perpendicular lines it is read as a B is perpendicular to CD it is written as shown look here all four angles at the point of intersection P ah right angles kids remember a point as only position and no dimension a line extends indefinitely in both directions a segment is a part of a line with two end points arrey has one endpoint two lines intersect only at one point many lines can pass through a single point perpendicular lines intersect at a point making a 90 degrees angle battlin lines never meet you

Perimeter,0kRuFlWC6iA,introduction Hugo jogging in a park the park is a square each side of the park is 250 meters long you take five rounds of the park and return home your mother wants 
,,to know how many meters you jumped can you calculate the concept that you need to use is perimeter in this lesson we will discuss the concept of perimeter in detail 
,,objectives at the end of this lesson you'll be able to define perimeter calculate the perimeter of a square calculate the perimeter of a rectangle calculate the perimeter of other regular shapes let us now try to answer your mother's question how many meters did you cover jogging in every round of jogging you covered the four sites of the park since the park is a square all its sides are equal thus in one round you covered 250 plus 250 plus 250 plus 250 meters that is 1000 meters therefore 
,,"in five rounds you covered five into 1,000 meters that is 5000 meters of five kilometers now you're ready to answer your mother's question in this calculation we used the concept of perimeter when we worked out the distance you covered in one round perimeter is the total length of the boundary of a closed two-dimensional figure "
,,here is a simple technique of measuring the perimeter of a shape take a close to geometric shape such as a circle square triangle or rectangle made of string unite the string and measure its length the length of the string is the perimeter of the chosen geometric shape we can generalize by saying that the perimeter of any closed geometric figure is equal to the length of the string with which it is made now that you have understood what perimeter stands for let us try to calculate the perimeter of a pentagon we have seen that the perimeter of a geometric figure is the sum of the lengths of its sides a Pentagon is a closed geometric figure of five sides suppose the lengths of the five sites a b b c CD de and EA are a b as for centimeters bc as five centimeters CD as three centimeters de as three centimeters and EA 
,,as four centimeters the perimeter of the pentagon is 4 centimeters plus five centimeters plus three centimeters plus three centimeters plus four centimeters that is 
,,"equal to 19 centimeters let us now calculate the perimeter of a rectangle rectangle is a four-sided geometric figure whose opposite sides are equal and therefore the perimeter of a rectangle is twice its length plus twice its breadth we can rearrange little and say that the perimeter of a rectangle is twice the sum of its length and breadth we wish to plant flowers on all sides of a rectangular patch of land whose length is 800 meters and breadth is 500 meters calculate the total distance to be covered by flowers the distance to be covered by flowers will be equal to the perimeter of the rectangular patch the perimeter of the rectangular patch is 2,600 meters therefore the total distance to be covered by flowers is 2600 meters now let us work out the formula for the perimeter of a square you already aware that all the four sides of a square are equal in length therefore the perimeter of a square is 4 multiplied by its side now you want to add frills to all sides of a square table mount length of whose side is 5 centimeters calculate the length of the frill required the length of the frill required is equal to the perimeter of the table mount the perimeter of the table Mount is 20 centimeters therefore 20 centimeters long frill is required it is time to check your understanding drag and drop the correct options in the respective boxes shapes that have all sites of equal length and all angles of equal measure are known as regular shapes square is a perfect example of regular shapes another regular shape is the equilateral triangle whose three sides are equal perimeter of an equilateral triangle is 3 multiplied by its side suppose there is an equilateral triangle of side 3 centimeters then the perimeter of the equilateral triangle is 3 multiplied by 3 which is 9 centimeters perimeter of "
,,a regular hexagon is 6 multiplied by its site suppose there is a regular hexagon of side 5 centimeters then the perimeter of the regular hexagon is 6 multiplied by 5 which is 30 centimeters summary let us summarize what we have learned perimeter is the total length of the boundary of a closed two-dimensional figure perimeter of 
,,a geometric figure is the sum of the lengths of all sides perimeter of a rectangle is equal to 2 into length Plus breadth perimeter of a square is equal to 4 into length of a side perimeter of an equilateral triangle is equal to 3 into length of a side figures in which all sides and angles are equal are called regular closed figures

Perimeter,QQsybALJoew,I'm sorry well it does matter kitty in fact everything around us is matter yes my friends I'm sure you must have heard the term matter before and how everything that will come across in our lives like the air you inhale the books you read toys you play with I mean literally everything is made of matter still confused don't worry my friends in today's episode let us explore what is matter and it's state and find the answer to an important question why matter matters so much zoom in so what is matter well as we all know that matter is everything around you rocks then water even you are made of matter but the vital question is how do you define matter well according to science matters defined as everything that has weight and takes up space or as volume I'm sure you are already aware of what greatest is just how heavy something is but what do we mean by taking up space or volume volume is the amount of space something occupies for example the door takes up a small volume while the Sun occupies a large volume or takes larger space to fit in likewise different states of matter will fill volumes in different ways depending upon how big little 
,,long or short the object is but why why do they vary in looks and sizes well that's because matter comes in different states and the three most common states are known as solid liquid and gas let's start with the most obvious state of matter that is the solid state there are objects that keep their own shape and do not flow in a given temperature examples of solids our study table sugar cubes glass Rock most metals etc ice is a solid as well but when it melts it becomes liquid speaking of liquids they blow move around a little and fill up containers you put them in like a water bottle so we can say they occupy the space inside the containers we fill them in but what about the weight of water well we all know that water has weight if you carry a water bottle with you and as you drink from the bottle it gets lighter and lighter giving you a good idea about the weight of the water next comes an interesting state of matter that can't be seen easily but it's there all the time like the air we inhale which is a gas the third main state of matter but I know you must be wondering is a really matter and if it is then how we see if it takes up space and has weight well we can prove that with a simple experiment at your home to do so take an empty glass and load it vertically downward in a vessel filled with water you will observe that the level of water inside the glass is less than the level of water outside it it is because the air within the glass is trapped and does 
,,not allow the water to rise up it means air has occupied the space inside the glass now when you tilt the glass aside you will see bubbles of air rushing out and it 
,,is replaced by water hence proving that air occupies space but how do we show that air has wait take two empty balloons and tape them to the ends of a meter stick then hang the meter stick on a string so that it's perfectly balanced now blow up one of the balloon and stick it back to the meter stick you will find the end of the 
,,air-filled balloon will Bend downwards because of air giving it the extra weight hence proving the fact that air is matter as it has volume and weight it's trivial time did you know that there are more than three states of matter yes besides the solid liquid and gaseous there are also three for the different states of matter that have been created by man these are plasma FEM Yannick condensates and bose-einstein condensates it's question time today's question is what are the three main states of matter to write your answer in the comment section below and hit the like and subscribe button if you haven't yet to be a part of the B couple kids juicy beautifully and get a chance to get it featured by the end of our videos so your other winners of the previous episode hope you enjoyed today's episode until next time it's me dr. by NOx zooming out ah never mind hey kids you liked my videos didn't you before you go don't forget to click on the subscribe button and the bell so you won't miss out on my latest videos hahahaha see you

,,"are in the other group. Two groups of 784 will be 7 and 84. 7 helps us to find the tens place digit of the square root. 7 lies between the squares 4 and 9. Square root of smaller number 4, that is, 2 is the tens place digit of the square root. The remaining group, that is, 84 helps us to find the units place digit of the square "
,,"root. Units place digit of 784 is 4. For units place digit of the square root, there are two possibilities, 2 and 8. Choose the correct digit out of 2 and 8. Multiply the tens place digit of the square root, that is, 2 by its successor 3. 2 into 3 is equal to 6. 7 is greater than 6. Thus, choose the greater of 2 and 8. Therefore square root of 784 is 28. Let us take another example. Find the square root of 1849. Its two groups are 18 and 49. 18 lies between 16 and 25. Thus, tens place digit is 4. Units place digit is either 3 or 7. Now, 4 into 5 is equal to 20 and 18 is less than 20. Therefore, smaller of the two, that is, 3 is the units place digit. Therefore, square root of 1849 is 43."

,,need to know the perimeter the perimeter is the distance around a shape wait wait wait what is the perimeter the perimeter of a shape is the distance around a shape 
,,and it's easy to find you can find the perimeter of a shape by adding all of the sides that will tell you what the distance around the shape is great now let's practice finding the perimeter look at this triangle what is the perimeter of this triangle okay first we need to know how long all of the sides are then we can figure out the perimeter with this triangle all three sides are the same length so how long are they let's pretend we measured it and each side is 10 centimeters now remember to find the perimeter of a shape we need to know the distance around the whole shape so we just add the sides together what's 10 plus 10 plus 10 that's three tens what is that equal yeah 30 awesome the perimeter of this triangle is 30 centimeters remember cm is an abbreviation for centimeters 30 centimeters is the perimeter of 
,,this triangle okay let's try this one what is the perimeter of this square first we need to know how long all the sides of the square are then we can figure out the 
,,perimeter of the square okay so this is a square it has four sides and all four sides are the same size let's pretend we measured it and each side is one yard remember yd is an abbreviation for the distance of a yard each side is one yard remember the perimeter is the distance around a shape so we'll need to add all of these sides up okay what's one plus one plus one plus one yeah for the perimeter of this square is four yards the perimeter remember is the distance around a shape if you were to go around this entire square it would be four yards okay this is the final one what is the perimeter of this rectangle well first we need to know how long all the sides of the rectangle are then we can figure out the perimeter remember a rectangle has four sides and two of the sides are shorter than the other two sides with this rectangle let's pretend we measured it at one meter on the short side and three meters on the longer sides okay remember to get the perimeter we have to add all of the sides together so we're going to be adding four numbers together again to make it easier we're going to group the smaller numbers together and then put the 
,,larger numbers in our equation what's one plus one plus three plus three those are all the sides what's one plus one plus three plus three yeah eight that means the 
,,perimeter of this rectangle is eight meters Wow we told you is going to be fine oh it's such a blast finding the perimeter the perimeter is so much fun to find it's 
,,like a game remember you can find the perimeter of a shape by adding all of the sides and the perimeter of a shape is the distance around a shape I'm so brother I'm 
,,so proud now you know how to find the perimeter of something the perimeter is the distance around a shape I can find the perimeter of this tablet right all I would need to do is measure each side and add them together and I would find the perimeter but right now I got to find an internet connection there's no Wi-Fi out here there's no reason to be in the desert I need water there's not this doesn't make any sense okay so I'm gonna go you go ahead and find perimeter enjoy the perimeter is the distance around the shape go have fun thanks for watching for people who want to join team pop teen pop enables us to accomplish our mission well is our mission our mission yeah we understand whoa - one more and he's dead - ha ha ha join our team we could use your help well I have a question to ask a really interesting question I hope you don't mind me asking this but would you like to be on one of our videos well now you can ask a parent or an adult to help you leave a comment right here under our YouTube video and what's fun is here a quick little story and quick joke you can say hello to friends or family you can say whatever you want and you may

Perimeter,AAY1bsazcgM,"Hi! Welcome to Math Antics. In this lesson, were going to learn about an important concept in Geometry called Perimeter. Perimeter is just a fancy math term that "
,,means the distance (or length) around a shape. ...but
,,what exactly does the distance around a shape mean? Well... distance (or length) is a 1-dimensional quantity that we can measure with units like
,,"centimeters, inches or miles. That means that perimeter is also a 1-dimensional quantity that we can measure with units of length. For example, the perimeter of a shape wouldnt be just 10, but it could be 10 cm. Or, instead of being just 25, it could be 25 miles. The units are REALLY important"
,,"when youre talking about perimeter! Okay, but what exactly do we mean by,"
,,around a shape? It seems like there would be a lot of different ways
,,to go around a shape. Some of them would be short
,,"and some of them would be very long. Well, perimeter means the absolute shortest distance possible around a shape. That would be the distance youd get if you traced the path exactly around the border (or edge) of a shape. A good way to see what perimeter is, is to imagine that you could walk right along the edge of a shape, like this 5-sided polygon. Imagine starting at one of the polygons vertices and then walking along each side until you got all the way back to the point that you started from. The total distance you traveled would be the perimeter of that shape. In this case, if the length of each side of the polygon was 10 meters, the total length you would travel along all 5 sides would add up to 50 meters. Another good way to see what perimeter is, is to imagine that you could take a shape, like this square, and break it at one of its corners. Then, you could unfold the shape until it formed a straight line.  The length of that line is the perimeter of the shape. Doing this helps you understand why perimeter is a 1-dimensional quantity, even though it applies to 2-dimensional shapes like this square. Its 1-dimensional because its the distance of the lines that go around the 2-dimensional shape. Okay, so now that you know what perimeter is, how do we measure or calculate it for different geometric shapes? Well... that depends on the shapes. Finding the perimeter of shapes that have curves, like circles or hearts or things like that, can be tricky. In fact, well wait and talk about the perimeter of a circle in another video. In this video, were just going to focus on how to find the perimeter of polygons. Since polygons are made from only straight sides, its easy to find their perimeter. If you know the length of each side, all you have to do is add them up, and the total length you end up with is the perimeter of the polygon. Lets try doing that with a few examples so you see how it works... the first polygon well try is a triangle. "
,,"This triangle has three sides that are each a different length: 3cm, 4cm and 5cm. Now, to find the perimeter of the triangle, all we have to do is add up the lengths of those three sides. 3 + 4 + 5 = 12 But dont forget.  Its not just 12. Its 12 centimeters. Always remember to also put down the units of the perimeter. Okay, that was easy.  Lets try another one. This time our polygon is a rectangle.  And you can see that the shorter sides are each 5m long and the longer sides are each 10m long. So... lets add them all up. We can add up the sides in any order we want to, as long as we dont forget any sides or accidentally count any of them twice. And I think Ill add up the two short sides first. 5 + 5 = 10 Next, Ill add up the two longer sides. 10 + 10 = 20 And now, if I add up those two answers, Ill get the total for all 4 sides. 10 + 20 = 30 So, the perimeter of this rectangle is 30 METERS! Ha!  You thought I was going to forget my units, didnt you. Not this time! Ah, heres another good example. This is a 6-sided regular polygon. A regular polygon means that all its sides are exactly the same length. Thats good because this diagram only shows the length of ONE side. (4 cm). But since the polygon is regular, we know that all the sides must also be 4 cm long. Now, we could just add up "
,,"all the sides like we did before, but since they are all the same, we can use multiplication as a shortcut. Thats because multiplication is really just repeated addition. All we have to do is multiply the number of sides (6) by the length of the sides (4 cm). 6 x 4 = 24 so that means the total perimeter must be 24. 24 what?    "
,,"                                 . Ooo - Centimeters !!! Thats better.                            . And this formula works for ANY regular polygon, no matter how many sides there are. If the sides are ALL THE SAME LENGTH,  you can just multiply the number of sides by the side length, and you have the perimeter! Okay, let's try "
,,one more example. This polygon also has six sides but its NOT a regular polygon. The sides are different lengths and this ones really tricky because they only show us
,,the length of four of the sides. The other two are missing!
,,"So how can we figure them out? Problems like this come up all the time in math; problems where you arent quite given all the information. When you have this kind of problem, the key is to use what you DO know to figure out what you DONT know.  Heres what I mean... Look closely at the two vertical sides that we DO know the lengths of (4 inches and 6 inches) Now... imagine that those two vertical sides could be moved straight across to the other side... the side that we dont know the length of. By doing that, you can see that the missing length would just be the combination of the two vertical lengths we DO know: 4 inches and 6 inches. And since 4 + "
,,"6 = 10, the missing vertical side must be 10 inches long. Notice that we can do the same thing for the horizontal sides that we do know. If we imagine those moving down to the side that we dont know, we see that its length must equal the combination of those two lengths. 10 inches plus 5 inches equals 15 inches. There, weve used the lengths that we DID know to figure out the lengths that we DIDNT know. And now that we know the length of ALL the sides, we can just add them all up to get "
,,"the perimeter. 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 And then 15 + 15 = 30 30 + 10 = 40 and last of all, 40 + 10 = 50 So, the sum of all the sides is 50 inches."
,,"Thats the perimeter of this shape. And thats the end of this lesson. Weve learned that Perimeter is the distance (or length) around a geometric shape, and weve learned how to calculate it for any polygon. You just add up the lengths of all the sides and the total length is the perimeter. Oh... and dont forget your units! Also, dont forget that to get good at math takes practice!

Perimeter,xCdxURXMdFY,"Hi, welcome to Math Antics. In our last geometry video, we learned that "
,,"all 2-dimensional shapes have a 1-dimensional quantity called Perimeter which is basically the outline of the shape. In this video, we're going to learn that these shapes also have a 2-dimensional quantity called Area. To help you understand what Area is, let's start by imagining a line that's 1 cm long. Now, let's imagine moving that line in a perpendicular direction a distance of 1 cm. But while we move it, it leaves a trail almost like the end of a paint brush. By moving the 1-dimensional line that way, we formed a 2-dimensional shape, and all of the space (or surface) that we covered along the way is the Area of that shape. which as you can see here is just a square. Ok, but how much area does this square have? Well, our original line was 1 cm long, and we moved it a distance of 1 cm, so we could say that this shape is a square centimeter. Just like a centimeter is a basic unit for measuring length, a square centimeter is a basic unit for measurement for area. But there are other units for area too. For example, instead of a centimeter, what if our line had been a meter long, and then we moved it 1 meter? The area we'd have gotten "
,,"would be 1 square meter! Or, what if it was a mile long, and we moved it a mile!?  We'd have a square mile of area. So, just like with perimeter, the units of measurement are very important when we're talking about area! Alright, so that gives you a good idea of what area is, but how do we calculate area mathematically? Well, there's some special math formulas (or equations) that we can use to find the area of different shapes. In this video, we're going to learn the formula for squares and rectangles and the formula for triangles. To find the area of any square or rectangle, all we have to do is multiply its two side dimensions together. They're usually called the length and the width, so the formula looks like this: Area equals length times width. But it's often written with just the first letters of each word as abbreviations: A for Area, L for Length and W for Width. So let's see if that formula works for our original square centimeter. If we multiply the length (1 "
,,"cm) times the width (1 cm), what do we get? Well, 1 x 1 is just 1, but what about cm x cm? Cm x cm just gives us square centimeters, which we can write like this using a '2' as an exponent. We read this as ""centimeters squared""  and it's just a shorter way of writing cm x cm. So whenever you see units like centimeters squared, or inches squared, or meters squared, or miles squared, you know it's a measurement of the 2-dimensional quantity area. Ok, our formula (area equals length times width) worked for our square. Now let's see if it works for a rectangle. Here's a rectangle that's 4 cm wide"
,,"and 2 cm long (or tall) First, we plug the length and width into our formula (2 cm and 4 cm) Then we just multiply 2 x 4 equals 8 and cm x cm is cm squared. So, according to our formula, the area of this rectangle is 8 centimeters squared. And we can see that's correct if we bring back our original square centimeter. If we make copies of it, you can see that exactly 8 of those square centimeters would be the same area as this rectangle. Great, let's try our formula on one more rectangle. This rectangle is 2 cm long but only half a centimeter wide. And our formula (area equals length times width) tells us that we just need to multiply those two sides together to get our area. Two times one-half equals one. So this rectangle is also 1 square centimeter. How can it be a square centimeter?"
,,"It's not even a square! Ah - but just because a shape takes up 1 square centimeter of area, that doesnt mean it has to be a square shape. It just means that the total area would be equal (or the same) as a square centimeter. You can see that if we break the rectangle in half and rearrange it, then it would form a square. In fact, we can use square units (like square centimeters) to measure ANY area, no matter what the shape is. It could be a rectangle, a triangle, a circle"
,,"or ANY other 2-dimensional shape. Okay, now that you know how to find the area of any square or rectangle using our formula, we're going to learn the formula for finding the area of any triangle. But to do that, we're going to start with a rectangle again. The dimensions of this rectangle are 3 m by 4 m. So what's it's area? Well, using our formula,  we know that the area would be 3 m x 4 m which is 12 meters squared. But now, what if we were to cut this rectangle exactly in half along a diagonal line from opposite corners? It forms two triangles! And because each of these triangles is exactly half of the rectangle, that means that the area of either "
,,"triangle must be exactly half of the area of the rectangle. We already calculated that the area of the entire rectangle is 12 meters squared, so the area of this triangle must be 6 meters squared, and the area of this triangle must be 6 meters squared, since 6 is half of 12. Ah ha!  So the formula for the area of a triangle should just be half of the rectangle. So does that mean that instead of, ""Area equals length times width"" , it should be, ""Area equals one-half of length times width"" ? "
,,"Yep!  That's basically it, but with one important difference. Instead of 'L' for Length and 'W' for Width, we're going to use two different names for our triangle's "
,,"dimensions. We're going to call them ""Base"" and ""Height"""
,,"and here's why. The names ""Length"" and ""Width"" worked okay for this right triangle because a right triangle is exactly half of a rectangle. But those names don't really work for other kinds of triangles like acute triangles or obtuse triangles. Because how do you tell which side should be which? So for triangles, we do something different. First we choose one of the three sides to be the ""Base"". It doesn't really matter which side you choose, and in a lot of math problems, the base will already be chosen for you. Once we decide which side the base is, we imagine setting the triangle down on the ground so that its base is flat on the ground, like this "
,,"Next, we find the highest point of the triangle, which is the vertex that's not touching the ground. From that point, we draw a line straight down to the ground. The line we draw must be perpendicular with the ground. The length of that line (from the tip of the triangle to the ground) is called the ""height"" of the triangle. Oh, and some people call the height of a triangle the ""altitude"" which makes a lot of sense if you pretend that your triangle is a tiny little mountain. Sometimes the height line is inside the triangle, like with an acute triangle. And sometimes it's outside the triangle, like with a obtuse triangle. And sometimes,"
,,"it lines up exactly with one of the triangle's sides, like with right triangles. But no matter where it is, the formula for finding the area of ANY triangle is the same: Area equals one-half base times height. So, if we know those two measurements (base and height), we can just plug them into the formula to calculate the area. At first, you might not see how the same formula could work for all three types of triangles, but watch this Here's an acute triangle and this box is one-half its base times its height. If we cut our triangle up, you can see that it fits perfectly inside that area. But wait, there's more! Here's an obtuse triangle with a box that's one-half its base times its height. Again, if we cut up the triangle, . it fits perfectly inside the box Now you can see how the formula, area equals one-half base times height, works for ANY kind of triangle. Okay, we already figured out that the area of this right triangle was 6 square meters, so let's practice using our new formula to calculate the area of these last two triangles. Our diagram shows that the base of this acute triangle is 5 m and it's height is 8 m. So we plug those "
,,"values into our formula for area and we get area equals one-half of 5 times 8. 5 times 8 is forty and one-half of 40 is 20, so the area of this triangle is 20 meters squared. Don't forget that the units of measurement for area will always be square units! Okay, that was pretty simple.  Let's try our last example. The diagram of "
,,"this obtuse triangle tells us that the base is 4 inches, and the height is 7 inches, so let's plug those values into our formula. We end up with the equation: area equals one-half of 4 times 7. 4 times 7 would be 28, and then we can calculate what one-half of 28 would be by dividing by 2. 28 divided by 2 is 14, so the area of this obtuse triangle must be 14 square inches. Okay, now you know all the basics of area. You know that area is a 2-dimensional quantity that we measure in square units. You've learned the formula for calculating the area of any square or rectangle: ""Area equals length times width"". And, you've learned the formula for calculating "
,,"the area of any triangle: ""Area equals one-half of the base times height"". But don't forget to practice what you've learned by working some problems on your own. That's how you really get good at math! As always, thanks for watching Math Antics,"

,,at the rate of $12 per centimeter we have to find the cost of fencing on boundary so first we need to find the parameter of this rectangle and we know parameter is 2 times the sum of length plus breadth 2 multiplied by 7 plus 4 equals 2 multiplied by 11 equals 22 centimeters so the parameter of this rectangle is 22 centimeters and we are given cost of fencing the boundary is 12 dollars per centimeter and we have to find the cost of fencing 22 centimeters we will multiply 22 with 12 to get the cost of fencing 22 centimeters as the boundary is 22 centimeters long cost of fencing 1 centimeter is $12 so cost of fencing 22 centimeters will be 12 x 22 equals 264 dollars so kids let's revise what we have learned we have learned parameter of square is 4 times the side parameter of rectangle is 2 times length plus breadth 
,,area of square is side square or side x side area of rectangle is length times the prep that is and in case of a rhombus and square it's same as a square so kids now you may go ahead take a quiz to learn more toot way has thousands of animated videos on math English and science to clear the core basics of these subject

Perimeter,LoaBd-sPzkU,What I want to do in this video
,,is a fairly straightforward primer on perimeter and area. And I'll do perimeter
,,"here on the left, and I'll do area"
,,here on the right. And you're probably pretty
,,"familiar with these concepts, but we'll revisit it"
,,just in case you are not. Perimeter is
,,essentially the distance to go around something
,,or if you were to put a fence around
,,something or if you were to measure-- if you were to
,,"put a tape around a figure, how long that tape would be. So for example, let's"
,,say I have a rectangle. And a rectangle is a figure that
,,has 4 sides and 4 right angles. So this is a
,,"rectangle right here. I have 1, 2, 3, 4 right angles. And it has 4 sides,"
,,and the opposite sides are equal in length. So that side is going to be
,,"equal in length to that side, and that side is equal"
,,in length to that side. And maybe I'll label the
,,"points A, B, C, and D. And let's say we"
,,know the following. And we know that
,,"AB is equal to 7, and we know that"
,,"BC is equal to 5. And we want to know, what"
,,is the perimeter of ABCD? So let me write it down. The perimeter of
,,rectangle ABCD is just going to be equal to the sum
,,"of the lengths of the sides. If I were to build a fence, if"
,,"this was like a plot of land, I would just have"
,,to measure-- how long is this side
,,"right over here? Well, we already know"
,,that's 7 in this color. So it's that side right
,,over there is of length 7. So it'll be 7 plus
,,"this length over here, which is going to be 5. They tell us that. BC is 5. Plus 5. Plus DC is going to"
,,"be the same length is AB, which is"
,,"going to be 7 again. So plus 7. And then finally, DA a or AD,"
,,"however you want to call it, is going to be the same length"
,,"as BC, which is 5 again. So plus 5 again. So you have 7 plus 5 is 12"
,,plus 7 plus 5 is 12 again. So you're going to
,,have a perimeter of 24. And you could go the
,,other way around. Let's say that you
,,"have a square, which is a special case"
,,of a rectangle. A square has 4 sides and 4 right
,,"angles, and all of the sides are equal. So let me draw a square here. My best attempt. So this is A, B, C, D. And"
,,we're going to tell ourselves that this right
,,here is a square. And let's say that this
,,"square has a perimeter. So square has a perimeter of 36. So given that, what is the"
,,"length of each of the sides? Well, all the sides are going"
,,"to have the same length. Let's call them x. If AB is x, then BC is x,"
,,"then DC is x, and AD is x. All of the sides are congruent. All of these segments"
,,are congruent. They all have the same
,,"measure, and we call that x. So if we want to figure"
,,"out the perimeter here, it'll just be x plus x"
,,"plus x plus x, or 4x. Let me write that. x"
,,"plus x plus x plus x, which is equal to 4x, which"
,,is going to be equal to 36. They gave us that
,,"in the problem. And to solve this, 4"
,,"times something is 36, you could solve that"
,,probably in your head. But we could divide
,,"both sides by 4, and you get x is equal to 9. So this is a 9 by 9 square. This width is 9. This is 9, and then the height"
,,right over here is also 9. So that is perimeter. Area is kind of a
,,measure of how much space does this thing take
,,up in two dimensions? And one way to think about area
,,"is if I have a 1-by-1 square, so this is a 1-by-1 square--"
,,"and when I say 1-by-1, it means you only have"
,,to specify two dimensions for a square or a rectangle
,,"because the other two are going to be the same. So for example, you could"
,,call this a 5 by 7 rectangle because that immediately
,,"tells you, OK, this side is 5 and that side is 5. This side is 7,"
,,"and that side is 7. And for a square, you could"
,,say it's a 1-by-1 square because that specifies
,,"all of the sides. You could really say,"
,,"for a square, a square where on one side is 1,"
,,then really all the sides are going to be 1. So this is a 1-by-1 square. And so you can view
,,the area of any figure as how many 1-by-1 squares
,,"can you fit on that figure? So for example, if we were going"
,,"back to this rectangle right here, and I wanted to find out"
,,the area of this rectangle-- and the notation
,,we can use for area is put something in brackets. So the area of rectangle
,,ABCD is equal to the number of 1-by-1 squares we can
,,fit on this rectangle. So let's try to do
,,that just manually. I think you already
,,might get a sense of how to do it a little bit quicker. But let's put a bunch of 1-by-1. So let's see. We have 5 1-by-1 squares
,,this way and 7 this way. So I'm going to try my
,,"best to draw it neatly. So that's 1, 3, 3,"
,,"4, 5, 6, and then 7. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. So going along one of the"
,,"sides, if we just go along one of the sides like"
,,"this, you could put 7 just along one side just like that. And then over here,"
,,how many can we see? We see that's 1 row. And that's 2 rows. Then we have 3 rows and
,,"then 4 rows and then 5 rows. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. And that makes sense because"
,,"this is 1, 1, 1, 1, 1. Should add up to 5. These are 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1. Should add up to 7. Yup, there's 7. So this is 5 by 7. And then you could"
,,"actually count these, and this is kind of straight"
,,forward multiplication. If you want to know the
,,"total number of cubes here, you could count it, or you can"
,,"say, well, I've got 5 rows, 7 columns. I'm going to have 35--"
,,did I say cube-- squares. I have 5 squares in this
,,"direction, 7 in this direction. So I'm going to have"
,,35 total squares. So the area of this figure
,,right over here is 35. And so the general
,,"method, you could just say, well, I'm just going to"
,,take one of the dimensions and multiply it by
,,the other dimension. So if I have a
,,"rectangle, let's say the rectangle is"
,,"1/2 by 1/2 by 2. Those are its dimensions. Well, you could"
,,"just multiply it. You say 1/2 times 2. The area here is going to be 1. And you might say, well,"
,,"what does 1/2 mean? Well, it means,"
,,"in this dimension, I could only fit 1/2"
,,of a 1-by-1 square. So if I wanted to do
,,"the whole 1-by-1 square, it's all distorted here. It would look like that. So I'm only doing half of one. I'm doing another half"
,,of one just like that. And so when you add this
,,"guy and this guy together, you are going to"
,,"get a whole one. Now what about area of a square? Well, a square is"
,,just a special case where the length and
,,the width are the same. So if I have a square--
,,let me draw a square here. And let's call that XYZ-- I
,,"don't know, let's make this S. And let's say I wanted"
,,to find the area and let's say I know
,,"one side over here is 2. So XS is equal to 2, and I"
,,"want to find the area of XYZS. So once again, I"
,,use the brackets to specify the area of this
,,"figure, of this polygon right here, this square. And we know it's a square. We know all the sides are equal. Well, it's a special"
,,case of a rectangle where we would multiply the
,,length times the width. We know that they're
,,"the same thing. If this is 2, then"
,,this is going to be 2. So you just multiply 2 times 2. Or if you want to
,,"think of it, you square it, which is"
,,"where the word comes from-- squaring something. So you multiply 2 times 2,"
,,which is equal to 2 squared. That's where the
,,"word comes from, finding the area of a"
,,"square, which is equal to 4. And you could see"
,,that you could easily fit 4 1-by-1 squares
,,on this 2-by-2 square.

Perimeter,jLfAK8slPZc,hello great 10 students today I'm here to teach you mathematics relevant to your grade 10 textbook so what is the first lesson in your textbook that's called perimeter so here we'll see what are the basic concepts related to perimeter now when you are using perimeter in future purposes we can use the letter P instead of perimeter otherwise you have to write down the word again and again so I'll write down the letter P for perimeter in geometry you get different shapes what are the shapes that you know you know rectangles squares circles triangles so we'll see those figures and try to find out the perimeter so we'll take one shape what is the shape this is a rectangle so here in a rectangle opposite sides are equal and angles up 90 degrees we'll take another one what is this shape a triangle what about this one a circle sometimes you get shapes like this now we'll see when you're taking this shape we'll start from this position and if we can go around and come to the same position we say those are closed figure now what about this one we can start from any place go around and come to the same position what about this one you can start from any place go around and come to the same position so if you can come to the same position we call dosa closed playing figures so here these are closed plane figures why we say these are plane figures because I drew these on this plane now what about these months start from any place and when you go round and round you are not 
,,getting the same position here also you are not getting the same position so we call these are open plane figures so what is parameter so parameter is defined as the total outer distance of a closed plane figure so here this is a closed plane figure so the total outer distance of a closed plane figure here in this one we are not finding parameter because this is an open plain figure so in grade 10 syllabus we are finding perimeter of closed plane figures like this now we will look at what are the units we can use for perimeter so perimeter is basically a distance or a length so what are the units for length so you have to use the same units we are using for length for the perimeter so what are the units that you know units that we are using for a distance or a length is millimeters centimeters meter then kilometres what's the conversion between all these units we know when you take your geometry set you get 15 centimeter ruler so in that 15 centimeter ruler when you take one 
,,centimeter 0 to 1 you get 10 gaps so that means you get 10 millimeter lines equal to 1 centimeter and when we take a meter ruler you get hundred centimeter units so 
,,we say hundred centimeters is equal to one meter and also when you take meters and kilometers we know that thousand meters is equal to one kilo meter so you need to 
,,memorize all these conversions because it is very important when you get a question with different units you have to know the conversion between all of these so in per meter this is really important so the first basic shape that you need to know is about rectangles so what are rectangles so rectangle is a quadrilateral with four sides opposite sides are equal and all angles 90 degrees so here we'll take the longer side we call length what about the shorter side we call its breadth so we can't write the word length and breadth again and again so what we can do we can use letters instead of lentil bread so I'll take length as L and breadth as B and what 
,,is perimeter we took perimeter as capital P now I want to find out the Paree meter of this rectangle so what can I do I can start from one place go around this figure and come back to the same position now if I want to find out the perimeter I can start from here so here I took length as air so the opposite sides I equal means this is also L if this is B this side also be now we'll try to find out the perimeter so we can start from here l then again you get breadth B this side again L and this side again B so here we'll try to simplify this we know in algebra we can simplify the like terms so Ln L I can write by adding this is 2 L what about B & B I can write 2 B and here I can take 2 out because 2 is common to both of these terms I can write L plus B so this is the parameter formula for a rectangle so if you know the length and the breadth of the rectangle you can find out the perimeter by first add the length and breadth and multiply by 2 now we'll see how we can apply this in examples we'll take the first example so what is this shape this is a rectangle because 90 degree is given so we know opposite sides are equal so this is also 12 this is also 8 so what's the formula perimeter is equal to 2 times a plus B so you can just add L is given L is the longest side well Brett is the shorter one so eight so first brackets according to bod mas 12 plus 8 is 22 times 20 you get 40 now what's the unit here all these measurements given in centimeters so you have to use centimeters now take the next example one side is 12.5 and the other side is 7.5 so here we know this is length this is also 12.5 this is breck 7.5 this is also 7.5 but you can easily use the formula this is equal equal to double of L plus B so here apply the values length is 12.5 breadth is 7.5 so when you add these two what 
,,you get seven point five plus twelve point five you get 20 so 20 times 2 20 times 2 becomes 40 here also centimeters so you can write forty centimeters now look at this one this is also a rectangle straightaway you can use the formula two times link+ brick when you simplify this you can add it together 8 plus 6 is 14 so 142 times 140 you get 280 so this is in meters so the units we have to use as meters now look at this question is slightly different so here length you know as 35 and breadth not given but the perimeter is given as 100 so what'd you do so you can find bread by using the perimeter now we'll look at the formula P equals double of L plus B so this substitute permeate is 100 given so we can substitute hundred here - is there L what is L at least 35 so we can write 35 but we don't know the breadth so how can we solve this equation so the first thing you can do you can divide both sides by 2 so when you divide both sides by 2 you what happens this 2 get cancelled out 100 divided by 2 is 50 is equal to 35 plus B so how can we find B you can take 35 to the other side B equals 50 minus 35 so you get 15 meters because the units given is in meters the next shape that's called squares so what's the difference between a square and a rectangle so square is also a four-sided figure but we know in a square all sides are equal and 1 all these angles are 90 degrees so that's the difference between a square and a rectangle so here we'll take one side as L so all these sides are L so if I want to find out the perimeter of a square I can start from here go around the figure and find out the total distance so what's perimeter P 
,,equals so I'll start from here L here you get L what about this one another L and this also another yeah so you get so all these are like terms so L plus L plus L plus L you can edit and write down that's for L so here we can use this formula to find out the perimeter of a square so if you know one side as L just multiply this by 4 so here you need to memorize this formula if you want to find out the perimeter of a square so we'll take an example I'll take an example so this is given like this and marked all sides are equal and given one side is 8 centimeters so how can we find out the perimeter we know this is a square so straight away you can apply the formula P equals four times one length so 4 times 8 that's equal to 32 centimeters we'll take another example one side is given 10.3 find the perimeter of this figure so how can we find out we know one length is ten point three so straight away you can write down this is as four times ten point three so four times ten point three multiplied by 4 4 times 3 12 4 times 1/4 and you need to put a decimal place so if this is the meters the perimeter also in meters now we'll take this question 
,,so here it's given find the length of the square when the perimeter is given 48 so it's mentioned this is a square so we will sketch the diagram this is the square and it's given you don't know the side but the perimeter is given 48 so you can use the perimeter formula so what is perimeter four times one length now substitute the values for t-80s perimeter and four times L so how can we find out L we can divide both sides by 4 what happens for 4 get cancel out you get L 48 divided by 4 you 
,,get 12 so what's one side this is 12 centimeters because the perimeter is given in centimeters next shape that you need to know is about triangles now do you know there are several types of triangles one is all sides are not equal the other one is two sides are equal and another shape we know all three sides are equal can you remember those names all sides are different we say scaly triangle so all angles also different if two sides are equal we call isosceles triangles what you call when all sides are equal we call equilateral triangles so we'll first see when you get scalene triangles how we can find out the perimeter so we'll take scalene triangle' 
,,we know all sides are different so we can use one side is a the other side is B and the third side is C so here if you want to find out perimeter what we do we can start from one place go around the figure and come back to the same position so here when you start from here you get B then C and then a so here in scaling triangles what we do just add there at all sides so here basically I can rewrite this as a plus B plus C so the perimeter of a scalene triangle just add three sides for example I'll take a triangle with one side is eight centimeter other side is six second two meters and the other one is ten centimeters now if I want to find out the perimeter what I do I can add all these three sides eight plus six plus ten so what's the answer 8 plus 6 is 14 14 plus 10 24 centimeters because the units of these lengths also in centimeters so if remember when you get a scaling triangle all sides are not equal so you can just add there at all sides now here this is an example for scaling triangle and you're asked to find out X when the perimeter is given seven centimeters and then hence hence means using x find the lengths of all sides so how can we do so we know how we find out perimeter we can just add all sides so one side is 2x plus three other side is x plus nine what's the other side this is 3x minus two so when you add all together you get the perimeter but in the question perimeter is given as 70 centimeters so I can write 70 centimeters instead of perimeter so I'll write here instead of P I can substitute 70 now this is an algebraic equation so how can we solve we need to first add like terms and take all X terms to one side and all the numbers to the other side I'll find X so we'll try to add like terms 2x X you get 3x 3x and 3x you get 6x what about the numbers 3 plus 9 you get 12 12 minus 2 you get 10 so 6 6 plus 10 is equal to 70 so how you solve for x you can take 10 to the other side so 6x equals 70 minus 10 so what is 70 minus 10 you 
,,get 60 so 6x is 60 how you find out X you divide both sides by 6 so when you divide both sides by 6 you get x equals 60 divided by 6 becomes 10 so what is the x-value this is 10 centimeters now we found out X but they are asking all lengths so here you can substitute the x value in these expressions and find out the other lengths so here we'll take this first length 2x plus 3 so you can just substitute the value 2 times X is 10 now 2 times 10 plus 3 so according to barbers make sure that you multiply the numbers first and then add at this number so 10 times 2 20 20 plus 3 is 23 so one side is 23 centimeters what's the next one you get X plus 9 so X is 
,,10 10 plus 9 so what's the answer 19 centimeters what's the third one 3x minus 2 so what is 3x minus 2 3 times 10 minus 2 so according to boredom are 3 times 10 first so you get 30 30 minus 2 you get 28 centimeters so these are the lengths of this triangle now we will look at equilateral triangles so what I equilateral triangles I explained before when all sides are equal and what about the angle can you remember one angle 1 angle is 60 degrees now we need to find out the perimeter so we know if one length is L this is also L this is also L so if you want to find out the perimeter you can just start from one place go around this figure and find out all the lengths so here what's the perimeter P equals L plus L plus L so when you simplify what you get those are like terms you can add L plus L plus L becomes 3l so here if you want to find out the perimeter of an equilateral triangle you can use this formula now we'll see an example this is given and here these three lines given that means all sides are equal and ical give this side is 6 centimeters so what's the perimeter of this figure this triangle V equals we know all sides are equal so this is an equilateral just multiply the length given by 3 so 3 times 6 you get 6 18 centimeters now we'll take another one another triangle is given like this and 
,,then marked like this so same thing all sides are equal if one is one side is ten point two meters find the perimeter of this figure so what you do you just take one side and multiply it by three so what is three times one hundred to three hundred six but this is there's a decimal place so make sure that you put a decimal place 
,,there so 30 point six what's the unit this is in meters so we did two types of triangles one is scalene all sides are not equal and the other one is equilateral all 
,,sides are equal now the next important shape is about a circle so what do you know about a circle so when you take a circle so what is this point in the middle we call that's the center center of a circle what about the line from the point to any point on the circle we call this length is radius or you can use simple art for that here normally we use a letter for center then what about a line passes through the center and these two points on the circle what you call that that's a diameter so diameter we can use simple D for diameter so here we need to know if there's a circle the middle point we call center and the line from the center to a point on the circle we call radius and a line passes through the center and the two points on the circle be called the diameter and what about the perimeter of a circle there's a special name for that when you start from one place and when you go around the figure and come back to the same position that's called perimeter of a circle without writing perimeter of a circle we can say circumference so circumference is basically the perimeter of a circle so we can use capital C for that now what's the relationship between the circumference and the radius or circumference with the diameter so in previous grades you have done that so we found out the circumference is equal to 2 pi already so here what's pi value you can use Pius 22 over 7 what about the relationship between the radius and the diameter we know double of radius is the diameter so here if d equals 2r double of radius is diameter I can plug instead of to R I can plug T so what's the other formula you can use for circumference so 
,,I can use - R - R is diameter so I can use PI D so when you get a circle how can we find out the circumference if you know the radius you can use 2 PI R formula if you know the diameter we can straight away write down PI into D so this formula you need to memorize so basically D is the diameter and R is the radius now we'll look at this example so there's a circle and find the circumference of a circle when diameter is 14 so we'll sketch your diagram so there's a circle so the diameter is the line passes through the center on the two two points on the circle so here this is given 14 centimeters so here they are asked to find out the circumference so you can straightaway use the formula PI D because D is given so hi what's the value we can substitute 22 over 7 and what is D D is given 14 so substitute here we can see 7 and 14 we can simplify cross out this one you get 2 here 2 times 22 becomes 44 what's the unit this is in centimeters we'll check the second example find the circumference of a circle when radius is 7 in this case radius is given seven centimeters so what's the formula suitable formula is in terms of R 2 PI R then substitute the pi value that's 22 over 7 radius value is 7 now see whether you can simplify yes this 7 get cancel out with this 7 2 times 22 you get 44 what's the unit this is also in centimeters now we'll take another example it says find the radius of a circle when the circumference is 88 now the circumference is given and you are asked to find out the radius so here 88 centimeter is their circumference so this is related to radius so we can straight away use the formula C equals 2 PI R and we know circumference is 88 so you can substitute 88 instead of sick so 2 times what is pi value pi value is 22 over 7 so what is the radius value we don't know so we can 
,,use our as radius and try to simplify we will first multiply this one 2 times 22 is 44 are over 7 is equal to 88 so how can we find our you have to make R as the subject of the formula I can rewrite this in this way so I can write this one first and write down this is 88 so how can I solve this I need to multiply both sides by 7 to get rid of this server so what happened 7-7 get cancel out I get 44 r equals 88 times 7 we are no need to multiply here because later when we are dividing by 44 
,,you can simplify easily so what is Aria you need to divide both sides by 44 so you get 88 into server and divided by 44 so can you see 44 times 2 is 88 so 2 times 7 
,,you get 14 so what's the unit circumference given in centimeters so you have to use centimeters now we look at your review exercise in the textbook so we did all these shapes rectangles triangles square and circle so we'll see whether we can find out perimeter so in the first question perimeter of each of the following plain figures so this is a rectangle can you remember the formula you can straight away write 2 times length plus brick so 2 times what is length here along the side we call 
,,length 20 plus 10 according to Bob mass first brackets 20 plus 10 is 30 30 times 2 you get 60 so what's the unit here you have to use centimeters so what's this shape all sides are equal so this is a square so here what's the formula for a square four times one length one length is given seven centimeters so four times seven you get 28 centimeters what is this shape this is a this is an equilateral triangle all sighs I equal so what's the formula if you know one side you have to multiply by 3 so 3 times 12 so what's the answer 36 centimeter for the perimeter now we look at this ship you are asked to find out the perimeter but when you look at carefully you need to see this one so what is this distance and this distance when you add these two what you get you get same as 8 centimeters and if you take this one I'll 
,,take another color here if you take this distance and add it to this one what you get you get this 12 centimeter distance so here this is actually a rectangle when you move the lens okay we'll take these two and this one if you move this one to this side you get this length so here this length is already there and if you move this one to this length you get here so basically you are getting a rectangle one side is eight other side is 12 so what's the formula for perimeter you can use double of length plus brick so 12 plus 8 you get 20 20 times 2 you get 40 so what's the unit here 40 centimeters now here also in this question look at carefully when you 
,,take this one and this one what you get you get tip so here I'll draw this and this so I get tip and if you take this length and this length what you get okay so here this is a square one side is 10 the other side also 10 10 so this is a square so what's the formula we can use parameter equals four times one side so 4 times 10 is 40 so 40 centimeter for this perimeter of this figure what about the third one third one is a circle what's given radius is given so straight away you can use the 
,,formula the circumference is equal to 2 PI R so here PI is 22 over 7 so what's the radius radius we can use a 7 now try to simplify 7 get cancel out and you get 2 times 22 is 44 this is in sainty meters now we look at the second question find the perimeter of the following figure now here also you have given certain distances these are equal now here this is 3 and this is also 3 this is also 3 because all these lengths are equal when you start from here you have to add this Plus this Plus this Plus that's the shape given so the perimeter means total outer length when you start from here what is this distance and this distance becomes we can see this and this same as this total distance so here I can I'll start from here so you get three here then this and this becomes four plus six that's ten and here you get three another three and then here here you get six and you need to find out this distance now how can we find out this distance look at carefully what is given this is 90 degrees given one side is three the other one is four how can we find out this distance can you remember you did Pythagoras theorem before if it's a right angle triangle and two sides are given you can find out they add the lengths so here we call this is hypotenuse so you can find out the hypotenuse by using pythagoras theorem so here you'll find out x x squared the hypotenuse squared is equal to the sum of square terms of the other two sides so here 3 squared is 9 4 squared is 16 16 plus 9 becomes 25 so how can we find out X square root of 25 so here what square root of 25 that's plus or minus 5 but we take the positive value because this is a link so we'll take 5 centimeter for X so here you need to this is X we found so you have to add that value as well so what's the perimeter of this figure and all together 3 plus 3 6 6 plus 3 9 9 plus 6 15 15 plus 5 20 20 plus 10 30 so what's the perimeter of this figure 30 centimeters now we'll see what's a sector mean sector of a circle so here we'll first take a circle okay so this is the center I'm taking these two radius so here this is o and I'll take a and B now I want to cut this part so I want to cut this part AB separate it so what happens when you separate I'm taking this part out so I'm getting the shape or a B now I want to cut it so here I'll 
,,cut this part from here so here have you seen this shape something like this so when you buy Kraft cheese what can you see so you get different slices like this cheese slices like this so when you take one cheese slice you get this shape whereas you see this shape when you buy pizza so also you get pizza cut into these shapes so here we call these shapes are sectors so what is a sector so sector is defined as the plane figure bounded by two radii and an arc so this part is a part of a circumference so we call that sin arc so this is radius this is also readiness what about this one this is also a sector so two radii and the arc length but what's the difference between these two so when you look at the angle here this angle is a small amount so we call acute angle what about this one you get a big gang more than 180 so what you call those angles reflex angles but those two are sectors so here we'll try to find out how we can find out the arc length when you get a sector so here I'll erase this one and show you when you want to find out the arc length the angle here is important so what you call this angle angle at the centre so here we'll call this angle as the angle at the centre okay so we'll take a full circle and when you take the point in the middle you get all together how many degrees altogether 360 so 360 for the full circle now we want to find out a part of that so that's a sector so we'll take this part I want to take this part if the angle here I'll use theta so what is Theta theta is a Greek letter instead of feet you can use any letter ABC any letter but in mathematics mostly we use Greek letters because most mathematicians are Greek mathematicians so that's why they have used Greek letters so theta is a Greek letter so here if this angle is Theta so how can we find out this Clint we'll put L for arc length so here we know if this is 360 degrees the full circle what's the circumference of a full circle we know 2 PI R so for 360 degrees that's 2 PI R because that's the full circle and R is the radius of a circle we want one degree what is 1 degree length means so that means you have to divide this by 360 and we want to find out if the angle is Theta what's the length so if this is Theta what's the length so here we need to take this value and multiply by theta so when you rearrange this what you get this is the arc length so we can write arc length is equal to we can use L here I'll rearrange theta and 360 together and girl divided by three-sixty into two PI R so I can see there's a formula if you want to find out the arc length of a sector you can use this formula so what's the formula here angle at the center divided by three-sixty into two PI R so what is R there R is the areas of a circle and what is Theta theta is the angle at the center so this is the arc length of a vector now we'll take some examples to see the pattern hundra need to decrease what is the shape that's a semi circle semi circle this 
,,sandal is hundred eighty so what's the ratio of this angle divided by the angle around a point that's 180 divided by 360 and what's the simplified fraction when you 
,,simplify you see double of this one is 360 180 times two is 360 so you can write half as the simplified fraction so what's the arc length so using the previous formula we can say 1/2 is the fraction that you are getting angle divided by three-sixty into two PI R so when you do that you can see you can simplify this and write PI 
,,R goes half and to get cancel out and you can write fire now what about the next one if it's 90 what's the shape you are getting this is a quarter of a circle 90 degrees so here what's the ratio 90 divided by 360 when you simplify what you get 9 times 4 is 36 so here one foot and how can we find out the arc length take the fraction multiplied by two PI R you can simplify and write PI R over 2 but we don't need to simplify we'll see a pattern if it's 270 what's the shape you're gay Tina shape like this so this is 270 so here how can we find out the arc length angle divided by 360 and when you simplify you get 9 times 3 and 9 times 4 so 3/4 so what's the arc length 3/4 into 2 PI R what about this 160 degrees you are getting an acute angle something like this this is 60 degrees given so what's the ratio 60 over 360 when you simplify this what you get you get 1 over 6 so once the arc length 1 over 6 into 2 PI R this one 30 30 is another small one compared to 60 again what's the ratio 30 over 360 when you simplify what you get 1 over 12 3 times 12 is 36 so what's the arc length 1 over 12 into 2 PI R what about 45 you get bigger than that and 
,,smaller than 60 so what's the ratio 45 over 360 try to simplify this 9 times 5 9 times 4 this is 5 times 1 5 times 8 so you get 1/8 so what's the arc length 1 over 8 into 2 PI R what about 120 120 you get an obtuse angle something like this so this is 120 so what's the ratio 120 over 360 when you simplify this 12 times 3 is 30 so you get 1/3 of a circle so 1/3 into arc length is 1/3 into 2 pi ah now we've found several arc lengths with the angles given as 100 80 90 to 70 like that if this is Theta any angle theta how can we find out the arc length now look at the pattern so first we found out the ratio so the ratio here is theta over 360 angle divided 
,,by 360 so here you can't simplify further we can write theta over 360 here so what's the arc length this value this ratio multiplied by 2 pi so can you see the formula now so always this ratio comes first and then multiplied by 2 PI R so what's the ratio we have to find angle at the center divided by 360 so here we can write down for any sector if you want the arc length this is equal to angle divided by three-sixty into two PI R so memorize this formula and find out the arc length of a sector now we'll look at the example 1 in your textbook so here what is this ship this is a sector given and what is the angle at the sector 45 and the radius is given 
,,seven centimeters so first part they asked to find out what fraction of the circumference of the circle in the figure is the arc length of the shaded sector so the full circle is 360 angle at the center is given 45 so what's the ratio so what fraction so divide 9 times 5 9 times 4 and 5 times 1/5 times 8 so 1 over 8 and the second part is find the claim so we know you can straight away find out the arc length using the formula the fraction of the angle to three-sixty into two PI R hi you can use 22 over 7 what's the R value R value given as 7 now try to simplify this so first we can write 2 times 22 times 7 in the numerator and 8 times 7 in the denominator now see whether you can simplify I can simplify this with this and 2 with 1 2 with 4 and again 2 with 2 two with 11 so what's the answer 11 divided by 2 if you 
,,want this one in decimals what's the value so you get 5.5 what's the unit unit is centimeter so the arc length of this sector is five point five centimeters now we look at example number two so now obtuse angle given at the angle of the sector the arc length of the sector in the figure is 44 so this distance here to here given as 44 so you are asked to find out the radius so we'll put radiuses are so what can we do we can use the formula so what's the formula arc length is equal to angle over 360 into 2 pi ah so angle given as 120 360 into 2 what is Phi value 22 over 7 and you need to find out the radius and the arc length is given 44 now how can we simplify first you can write again all numerator values separately 120 222 and R divided by 360 and 7 so 44 here now try to simplify so what can you do we can see 12 times 336 what else you can't multiply so here you get 2 times 22 is 44 are over 3 times 7 21 is equal to 44 so I can rewrite this as 44 are over 21 is equal to 44 how can I find out you have to do the opposite operations so opposite operations means you have to first multiply by 21 and divided by 44 so you do the same thing for 
,,the other side x 21 and divided by 44 so what happens 21 21 get canceled out 44 44 get canceled out here 44 44 get canceled out here as well so what's the answer r equals 21 what's the unit centimeters so here we can find out easily the R value when the arc length is given now example number three look at the diagram you have given a sector the arc length of the sector in the figure is eleven centimeters that means this length is given eleven centimeters find the angle at the center so that means you asked to find out this angle so theta so what is the formula we can use we can straight away use the formula L equals angle divided by 3/16 to 2 PI R so what's the angle we have to find out 360 is there 2 times pi value what's the pi value high value we can take as 22 divided by 7 and what's the R value R value we can take as 9 centimeters so what's the arc length given our clip is given as 11 now we'll try to find out theta so first we'll write down all the numerator values together 2 times 22 times 9 theta over 360 into 7 is equal to 11 now how can we find out theta try to simplify first I can see it's 9 9 times 1/9 times 4 what else I can simplify 2 with this 40 you get 20 again divide by 2 you get 11 and 10 now try to rewrite this I get 11 theta over 10 times 7 70 is equal to 11 so how can I find theta I can multiply this by 70 and divide this by 11 so I to simplify 11 11 get cancel out 77 to get cancel out so here also 11 get cancel out so what state PETA is equal to 70 what's the unit here this is about an angle so we use degrees as there you need tough angle on say is 70 degrees now we look at these three examples it says first one fine P Q R click so P Q arc length means you asked to find out this length so here how can we find out straight away you can use the formula so what's the formula we are using n equals angle over three-sixty into two PI so here what's the angle given 140 over 360 into - what's the pi value high value you have to take 22 over 7 what's the R value our value given here is 18 now try to simplify this I can see 7 L this one get cancel out and you get 20 and here 0 0 2 times 2 4 4 times 9 36 and here 9 with this 80 you get 2 so what's the final answer you get 22 times 2 that's equal to 44 what's the same unit centimeters now we look at the next 
,,example it says find theta when our Clent is given 22 so here they have given this length that's the arc length that's 22 centimeters so you asked to find out the angle at the centre so what you do straightaway you can use the formula so what's the formula L equals angle over 3 6 2 into 2 pi so what's the angle you have to find 
,,out 360 is there 2 and pi is 22 over 7 and what is the our value our value is 18 so substitute 18 there so what's the arc length it's given as 22 now try to simplify this we'll first rewrite everything 2 times 22 times 18 theta over 360 into 7 is equal to 22 so how can we find theta you can do the opposite operation so angle theta equals you multiply by this so 22 x 360 into 7/2 times 22 times 18 now try to simplify this further I can see 22 get canceled out and here 18 times 1 18 times 2 and again 2 times 20 that's 10 so what's the answer theta equals 10 times 7 that's 70 degrees now we'll look at this question so you get a reflex angle here so you asked to find out the angle when arc length is given 88 so arc length means this length I'll show you with another color this length so this length is given as 88 and 
,,you asked to find out this angle so here use the formula L L is 88 is equal to angle let's theta divided by three-sixty into two PI pi 22 over 7 into our but the radius given 21 now try to simplify here I can simplify 7 and 21 and write 3 and here also I can write 3 with 360 I can write hundred 20 now rewrite this and do the opposite operation to get theta so what is Theta theta is equal to 88 x 120 divided by this value so 2 times 22 so what's the answer 2 times 22 is 44 44 times 2 is 88 so 2 times 120 you get 240 decrease now we look at exercise 1.1 in your textbook so here first question they asked to find out the arc length of each of the sectors given below so here this is a semicircle so what's the angle at the center this is 180 because with the semicircle so you need to know the angle at the center is 180 
,,so how can we find out the arc length so you can use the formula aliquots angle over 3 16 to 2 pi R now here what's the angle it's 180 over 360 2 pi value is 22 over 7 and what's the R value this is given as the diameter so what's the radius half of it what is half of 28 you get 28 divided by 2 you get 14 as the radius so then try to simplify this one you get double of this one these two and this to get canceled out and what about seven and fourteen seven times 1/7 times 2 so what's remaining 22 times 2 you get 44 centimeters now we look at the second diagram the angle at the center is 90 degrees so here straight away you can use the formula angle 90 divided by three-sixty into two PI value pi value we take 22 over 7 into our what's it radius here 7 now try to simplify 90 times for 360 and then this seven get cancel out with this seven so here two with this for you get to 21 divided by two you get 11 so what's the arc length of this figure 11 centimeters now here you are getting an obtuse angle here so how you find out the arc length angle that's 120 divided by three-sixty into two PI value is 22 over 7 into R R is given 21 now try to simplify this 12 times 336 and this 7 and this 21 you get 3 this 3 with this one get cancel out and what is remaining 2 times 22 so 2 times 22 is 44 centimeters so here we found arc lengths of these figures so that means this length this length and this length now we'll look at the next part so you have given the angle at the center is 36 degrees so straight away we'll use the formula angle divided by three-sixty into two what's the pi value 22 over 7 our value so our value is given 3.5 so it's easy to convert to fraction and write down the fraction value for simplification so here what is 3.5 how can I write I can write 3 and 1/2 or I can write as 7 over 2 as the improper fraction so I can write instead of 3.5 7 over 2 so I'll write 7 over 2 there now try to simplify 36 times 136 times 10 and this 7 get cancel out 
,,this to get canceled out and you get 22 divided by 10 what's the answer two point two centimeters what about the next one this is anger 240 so use the formula angle 
,,divided by three-sixty into two PI value pi value is 22 over 7 and our value our value is given 35 now try to simplify here 0 0 get cancel out 6 times 4 and 6 times 
,,6 again you can divide by 2 - x - 2 times 3 what else we can simplify this 7 + 35 you can write as 5 can we simplify further no we can't simplify further so what's the answer 2 times 2 for 4 times 5 20 20 times 22 divided by 3 now try to simplify you can multiply by 2 and put a 0 - x - 4 - x - 4 by three so here you can write as a fraction three times 1/3 14 divided by 3 3 times 4 12 2 remaining for 23 times 6 18 2 remaining so 2/3 so 146 and 2/3 centimeters what about this one now what's the angle at the center there the outside angle is given 60 not the angle at the center so the first thing we need to find out this angle how can we find out we know 
,,when you take a point around the point that is equal to 360 so how can we find out this angle if the whole thing is 360 this is 60 so you can subtract and find out we are the angle so the angle at the center is 360 minus 60 that's 300 now you can apply the formula so l equals and girl divided by three-sixty into two PI value is 
,,22 over 7 are ten point five which one we use a decimal value or a fraction value fraction value is easier than using decimal value so here how can I write ten point five ten point five means 10 and a half when I write as an improper fraction this is 21 over 2 so I can write this one as 21 over 2 now try to simplify this 0 0 get cancel out this to get cancel out with this 2 7 cancel out with 21 and write can write 3 this 3 you can divide by this one and write 12 there because 12 times 3 is 
,,36 what else I can simplify 6 times 5/6 times 2 and here again this two and this 21 I can write 11 so what's the final answer 11 times 5 you get 55 centimeters now we will look at perimeter of a sector of a circle so far we found out arc length of a sector so we'll see how we can find the perimeter of a sector so we'll take sectors I'll take this one oh I can draw something like this this is also sector angle at the center I can write theta here this is the theta here and if the radius is R I can write this is radius R this is radius R here when you look at these two sectors we can use this is as the mine are - sector because the angle is the acute angle so remember this word - sector what about this one the angle is reflex so we call it this one as major sector now we'll try to find out the perimeter of any sector so here what is perimeter means total outer distance of a closed plane figure so when we start from here we can go round this and find out the perimeter so we'll start from here so what is the perimeter you need to find out R + what is this one this is the arc length we found before so here arc length will put L and here again another ah so in this case also see the diagram look at the diagram carefully I take this color so if you start from here this is the arc length R and another R so 
,,same thing you are getting so here we'll try to simplify this R and R you can write to R so what is L we found arc length before so what's the formula we use for click angle divided by three-sixty into two PI so here when you take 2 r out what can you write you can write 1 plus theta or 360 into R or you can remember without taking 2 are out you can write double of our plus angle over three-sixty into two PI R so memorize this formula if you want to find out the perimeter of a sector so what is our R is the radius of the sector what is Theta theta is the angle at the centre and PI we can take as 22 over 7 now we'll take these examples and we'll find out the perimeter not the arc length so here you have given 21 as the radius and 60 as a angle at the centre so what's the perimeter of this figure you can write double of our R is 21 plus angle angle is 60 over 360 into - what's the pi value Phi value 22 over 7 into R what is our 21 now try to simplify we'll simplify this part first I can see zero zero get canceled out six and thirty six you get six here what else we can cancel out seven with 21 you get three here and this 3 and this two becomes six get canceled out with this six so what's the answer there you get 22 so here two times 21 is 42 42 plus 22 what's the answer you get 64 centimeter as the perimeter of this sector now take the next example the radius is 10.5 and the angle is 120 so here you can use the perimeter formula double or far I told you it's easy to use the fraction instead of 10.5 so what is 10.5 ten-and-a-half and when you write as improper fractions this is 21 over 2 so we'll use 21 over 2 so double of our 2 times 21 over 2 plus angle 120 over three-sixty into two PI value 22 over 7 and what's the R value our value is 21 over 2 now try to simplify this part 0 0 get canceled out 12 times 3 is 36 and what is we can't simplify here 7 bit 21 this is 3 and this 3 and this 3 get cancelled out this 2 and this 2 get cancelled out and what is remaining 22 what about this side this to get cancel out with this 2 so what is the answer you get 21 plus 22 what's the answer 43 centimetres now this is a sector major sector you have given and this is ninety degrees what is the angle at the center we know the whole angle is 360 and this is given 90 so what's the angle at the centre 360 minus 90 so what is 360 minus 90 you get 270 now we'll find out the perimeter so perimeter is equal to double of r r is given seven right down plus 
,,angle is 270 we found that divided by three-sixty into two PI value you can write 22 over 7 and our value is seven now try to simplify this zero get cancel out with 
,,this zero this seven get cancel out with this one 9 times 3 9 times 4 2 times 2 and here 22 with 2 you can write 11 so what is remaining there 11 times 3 33 so what 
,,is 2 times 7 you get 14 plus 33 so this is 4 plus 3 7 47 centimeters now we will take this one and I'll take this as 42 centimeters this is a minor arc and minor sector so you asked to find the perimeter so straight away you can use the formula double of the radius 42 plus angle is given 60 over three-sixty into two PI value is 
,,22 over 7 into radius radiuses forty-two now try to simplify 60 times six is 360 this seven and forty-two you get six and this 6 and the 6 get canceled out so you get 2 times 22 that's 44 so here you get 2 times 42 is 84 and 44 together you get 128 centimeters now we'll look at example 1 in your textbook first example it says the figure denotes a sector of a circle of radius 21 and with angle at the center hundred 25 its perimeter so perimeter means you are finding all these outer distance 
,,so here straight away you can use the formula perimeter is equal to double of our that's 20 mile plus angle so now we are trying to find out the arc length arc length how can we find out angle angle is given 120 so 120 over three-sixty into two PI value pi value is 22 over 7 into r r is given 25 now try to simplify this part you get 3 times 12 is 36 and 7 with 21 you get 3 this 3 get cancel out with this 3 so what is remaining 2 times 21 is 42 and 2 times 22 44 so what's the answer 42 plus 
,,44 you get 86 this is in centimeter so the perimeter of this sector is 86 centimeters now we look at example number 2 so it says this perimeter of a sector which is 
,,2/3 of a circle is 260 find its radius so here 2/3 of a circle so something like that so here when you take a circle divided into 3 parts and then 2/3 of that so that means something like this so 2/3 of a sector is given and the perimeter is given 216 so here we'll put our here and this part is 260 so this length is given 260 centimeters so you are asked to find out the radius so here how you find out the perimeter so perimeter is equal to double of our plus angle over 360 so what is 2/3 means actually the angle divided by 360 is given as 2/3 so theta over 360 into 2 PI R now I can substitute the values are we don't know parameter is given 260 and angle what is angle 2/3 this whole part is given 2/3 you don't need the angle just the fraction is given 2/3 2 Phi value is 22 over 7 and what's the radius you can use same R value now try to simplify you can write 2 R plus 2 times 2 4 4 times 2288 are over 7 and then 3 also there so will 7 times 3 I can write 21 is equal to 260 so 
,,I need to get rid of this 21 so what I can do I can multiply everything by 21 so what happens here 21 get canceled out then what is remaining 21 into 260 is equal to 21 times 2r plus 88 are no I see you can simplify the like terms what is 21 times 2 you get 42 what is 88 here 88 are so when you simplify like terms you get 8 plus 2 10 1 remaining 9 plus 4 1330 R is 21 times 260 so how can I find our I can divide both sides by 130 so I can write R as 21 times 260 over 130 so I can see double 
,,of this one is 216 2 times 21 is 42 so radius of this sector is 42 unit is centimeters now we will look at exercise 1.2 in your textbook so these are the grooms given and you asked to find out the arc length but this is under parameter so I'll find out parameter for all of these shapes I think this is a mistake in your textbook 
,,so I'll find out both arc length you need to find out the perimeter as well so I'll find out perimeter for this figure so this is whole angle is 180 so angle at the 
,,centre is 180 so what's the formula for perimeter two are so two are actually what's two are that's the diameter so you can write to R that means fourteen plus angle is 180 over 360 into 2 pi PI is 22 over 7 into R so what is our here 14 is the diameter so 14 divided by 2 you get seven now try to simplify 180 times two is 360 this to get cancel out with this to seven get cancelled out with seven is seven and you get 14 plus 22 so what's the answer you get 36 centimeter for the perimeter so 
,,not the arc length so are doing very meter okay look at the second one so you have given a quart off a circle then you asked to find the perimeter so here straight away use the formula double off are 2 times 14 because R is 14 plus angle angle is 90 divided by three-sixty into two PI values 22 over 7 into R is 14 now we'll simplify this part first ninety times four is 367 times to 14 this 2 and this 2 becomes 4 get cancel out with this fall so what's remaining you get 22 so the answer is 2 
,,times 14 is 28 plus 22 so you get 50 centimeter for the perimeter of this figure now look at the next one and go like the center is 60 degrees and the radius is given 21 so you use the same formula so what's the perimeter you can find double of far plus angle is 60 divided by three-sixty into two PI value is 22 over 7 into R now try to simplify 60 times 6 is 360 this seven with this 21 you get 3 3 times 2 6 and this 6 get cancelled out so what is remaining 2 times 21 is 42 plus 22 you get 64 centimeters further perimeter of this figure in the last part the angle at the center is 200 and the radius is given 7 centimeters so how can we find out the perimeter use the formula double of are 2 times 7 plus angle is given 200 divided by 360 into 2 into PI into R now simplify so here 7 and 7 get canceled out and here this 0 get cancel out with this 0 what else we can cross it out to with this 36 you get 18 and this 1/2 you get 10 yeah and nine here / - and then that's all 10 into 20 
,,2 is 220 over 9 so when you simplify what you get 14 so when you write as a mixed number what you get 9 times 2 18 4 49 times 4 36 and for remainings 4 / 9 so when you add these two together what happens 4 4 8 3810 4 / 9 centimeters now we look at question number 2 it says find the radius of the sector when the angle at the center is 180 and the parameter is given hundred centimeter so we'll sketch a diagram so here 180 so that should be a semicircle so this is hundred eighty giver and the 
,,perimeter is given 180 so we'll use the formula so what's the formula P equals double of R plus angle / three-sixty into two PI R we know the perimeter is hundred eighty two times are we we need to find out our angle is given 182 into pi pi is 22 over 7 and are you can write as R so here try to simplify 180 times to 360 this 2 and this 2 get cancelled out and we'll rewrite this 182 times our two are what you get here 22 are over 7 now we need to get rid of this server so what we can do I can multiply all these terms by because this is an equation can do the same thing for all terms so here what happens here seven times 214 are this seven and this seven get canceled out you get 22 are then seven times 180 simplify the right hand side because you get like terms so what you get 14 plus 22 you get 36 are is equal to seven times 180 so what is our seven times 180 divided by 36 so now simplify you can divide by 9 9 times 4 9 times 2 so 20 divided by 4 you get 5 7 times 5 you get 35 what's the unit here centimeters for the radius now take the second part so what's the second part says when the angle at the center is 120 so 120 is an obtuse angle so something like this so this is given 120 and we'll put our as the radius so perimeter is given 43 so here use the formula perimeter is double of R 2 R plus angle is 120 over 360 into 2 pi is 22 over 7 and R is there so perimeter I can write this one as 43 no can be simplified here I can simplify 120 times 3 is 360 and then 
,,what else that's all so I can rewrite this as 43 2 R plus 2 times 22 44 are over 21 3 times 7 you get 20 bar now there's a fraction so how can we get rid of this fraction multiply all these terms by 21 then we see this 21 get cancel out so what you get here 21 times 43 is equal to 2 times 21 is 42 R plus 44 are when you add these two together 4 + 2 6 4 + 4 886 R is 21 times 43 so what is our value you can divide this by 86 so 21 times 43 divided by 86 so here can you see 43 times 2 is 86 so you can divide by 2 so the answer is 21 over 2 centimeters or when you simplify and write as a decimal you get ten point five centimeters now we look at the third question in the third question it says find the angle at the centre of the sector when the perimeter is 64 and the radius is given so we will sketch the diagram for the first one we don't know whether it's a minor sector or major sector but it's given me you can just draw a sector we don't know the angle the radius is 21 and the 
,,perimeter is 64 so you can use the formula so the perimeter 64 is equal to double of radius plus angle at the center divided by three-sixty into two PI pi is 22 over 7 into our R is 21 now trying to simplify this part I can cancel out 7 with 21 and write 3 here and again this 3 and this 2 becomes 6 6 times 6 36 and here again this divided by 2 11 and you get 30 here so here 64 equals 2 times 21 42 so here plus so what's remaining here 11 theta over 30 so here how can we solve kita I can first take 42 to the other side so 11 theta over 30 is equal to what is 64 minus 42 you get 22 so 11 theta over 30 is 22 how can I find theta multiplied this by 30 and 
,,divided by xi multiplied this by 30 and divided by 11 so here you get theta equals here 11 times 2 2 times 30 you get 60 decrease so this is a minor factor now we look at the second part when the perimeter is 53 and the radius is 21 now here draw something like this we don't know we know the radius 21 and you are asked to find out the angle at the center so parameter is given 53 so we'll use the formula perimeter is equal to love radius 2 times 21 plus and girl divided by three-sixty into two PI is 22 over 7 and radius 21 now try to simplify this part 7 times 3 21 3 times 2 6 and this divided by 6 you get 16 what is I can simplify it with divided by 2 
,,11 and 13 so what's remaining I'm getting 53 here 2 times 21 42 plus 11 theta over 30 so how you find 11 theta over 30 I can subtract 42 from 53 when I subtract 53 and 42 from 53 but I'm getting I'm getting 11 so what is theta theta is equal to multiplied by 30 and divide by 11 so 11 get cancelled out and the angle here is 30 decrease now we'll look at compound figures now what are compound figures here can you see you get a rectangle and a semicircle so when you join different shapes together we call these our compound figures so here this is an example of a compound figure so here come found figures so we are now try to find out perimeter of compound figures so in this example it's given length is 20 and brain this 14 in this rectangle and you are asked to find out the perimeter of this figure so what is perimeter means outer total outer distance so here you get 20 and you get an arc here and another 20 and 14 so that's the perimeter so first thing we can do we can find out this arc length how do you find out the arc length you need to use the formula a equals angle over 316 to 2 PI R so we'll first find out the arc length so arc length is equal to that's the formula angle what is semicircle means angle is 180 over three-sixty into two PI R value here this whole distance is 14 so that means the diameter of this semicircle is 14 so what's the radius so the radius becomes half of it that's 7 so I'll plug instead of PI 22 over 7 and the radius is 7 now try to simplify this 180 times 2 is 367 7 get cancel out this 2 and this 2 get cancelled out so what's remaining you get 22 as the arc length now we'll try to find out the perimeter of the compound figure so here when you start from here you get 1420 and this arc length is 22 we found before and this length is 20 so when you add all together you get the perimeter of this compound figure so here 20 20 40 40 plus 2 26262 +14 what'd you get 76 centimeters as the perimeter of this compound figure now we'll look at example number two it says the figure represent a square lamina of side length 15 so this side is given 15 if the shaded sector AGB this is the sector and the triangular portion this triangular portion GF g EF are cut out find the perimeter of the Porsche bc d FG b c d FG means you are asked to find out the perimeter of this figure so how can we find out the perimeter so can you see this whole distance is 50 and this distance is 8 so what is this part so you have to subtract so 
,,15 minus 8 you get 7 centimeters now this is a sector quarter of a circle the radius of the quarter of a circle is now 7 centimeters and here you can find out this arc length using the formula l equals angle over 316 to 2 pi ah now what's the angle they are 90 degrees you can write 90 over 360 into 2 pi is 22 over 7 so what's the r-value know R is 7 so here try to simplify 7 7 get cancel out 90 times 4 is 360 and here 2 times 2 you get 4 again you can divide by 2 and right here 11 so what's the arc length you eleven centimeters now we found this part and what about this length we know the total distance is 15 this is seven so this part becomes again 15 minus 7 you get 8 centimeter so this side is 15 and what about this side we know the total distance is 15 15 minus 6 is this part so 15 minus 6 is what 9 centimeters and how can we find out this length we know this is a square so this is right-angled so what you get here you get a right angle triangle so one side is 8 the other side is 6 we need to find out this length so what's the theorem we can use we can use Pythagoras theorem so how can we find out this side you can use Pythagoras so 
,,according to Pythagoras hypotenuse squared is equal to sum of square of the other two sides when you do that 8 squared is 64 6 squared is 36 when you add these two together you get 100 square root of 100 so what is square root of 100 you get 10 times 10 so 10 centimeters so you follow this side is 10 so how can we find out the perimeter of this figure we can add all the sides now we will do that so what's the perimeter I can add I'll start from here what's the arc length we found we found 11 then we have to add 8 this side is 15 and this length is 9 and this length we found as 10 centimeters so what's the total perimeter so add all together 11 plus na 
,,8 is 19 19 plus 10 29 29 plus 15 is 44 44 plus 9 you get 53 so what's the perimeter of this figure you get 53 centimeters for the perimeter of this figure now we'll 
,,take an example to find out are in this one when the perimeter of the running track is 400 meters so here what's the compound shape here you get a rectangle and two 
,,semicircles two semicircles becomes one full circle so you're asked to find out the radius so radius means half of this distance so here perimeter of this running track is given 400 that means this Plus this Plus this and this all together that's given 400 meters so how can we do that we know this distance is 90 so this is the rectangle this is also 90 now can you see this semicircle and this semicircle you get one full circle and this is the radius R so what's the circumference of a circle we you know that circumference is 2 PI R so here what's the perimeter then perimeter of this figure is 2 PI R that's the full circle plus 90 and 90 and that's given as 400 so we'll do it here 400 is equal to 2 pi pi is 22 over 7 times R plus 90 plus 90 you get hundred 80 now try to simplify first we'll take 180 to the other side 400 minus 180 what's the answer 400 minus 180 you get 220 so you can write 220 is equal to 2 times 22 r over 7 how can we find our I can multiply both sides by 7 and divide by 2 and 22 I can do the same thing here divide by 2 and 22 so here this get cancel out with this one you get R so what is our R is equal to 22 times 10 222 times 5 10 7 times 5 you get 35 what's the unit here 35 meters as the radius of death of the running track we'll take another example so here there's part shaded and you are asked to find out the perimeter of the shaded region so that means you need to find out this length this length this one is already given 40 you have to find this one and this length so those are the lengths for the perimeter so we have to add together so first we'll see what is this and this so first find the bigger 
,,one 21 is the diameter there and that's a semicircle angle is 180 so we will first find arc length of the same bigger semicircle bigger one so you know angle is 180 
,,divided by three-sixty into two PI is 22 over 7 R is 21 divided by 2 because diameter is given 21 so 21 over 2 so simplify this 180 times 2 this 2 and these 2 get cancelled out this 7 and this 21 you get 3 and here are 2 with this 22 you it get cancelled out and you get 11 so what's the answer 11 times 3 you get 33 so 33 is the 
,,arc length of the bigger semicircle now we look at the small about now we know this full length is 21 21 divided by 2 is the diameter of the small one so both diameters are equal so here this semicircle and this semicircle you can say that's one circle what's the radius now what's the diameter there Amita is 21 over 2 now we'll 
,,find out the circumference of the full circle that's 2 PI R so 2 times pi is 22 over 7 times so here R value what is our value there now the diameter of this circle 
,,is 21 over 2 what's the radius 21 over 2 divided by 2 again so here you get 21 over 2 multiplied by 1/2 take the reciprocal you get 21 over 4 as the radius so here what's the radius here 21 over 4 now try to simplify this 7 times 21 you get 3/2 with this for you get 2 again divided by 2 you get 11 so what is 11 times 3 you get 33 what can you see so this is these two circles inside a rectangle so when you are dividing these two together it's same as this side can you see you got the arc length 33 here also two semicircles you get 33 now look at this 133 and 33 here we can see that when you get a rectangle and when you divide this into several semi circles you get the same arc length so here if you divide into two or three several semi circles the same arc length you are getting so if you see something like this you don't need to do the calculations again you can straight away write down you found this circumference 33 here also 33 now what's the perimeter now perimeter of the total figure is 21 for the big semicircle we found 33 for small two semicircles also 33 so this side 40 and another 40 so 40 plus 40 so what's the final answer you 
,,get 3 plus 3 here 33 33 becomes 66 plus 80 you get 646 senti meters now look at the third question this is a square and you are asked to find out the perimeter of the shaded region so that means you need to find out this length and this length and this one so here the square side is 28 centimeters so that means what is half of it divide by 2 you get 14 each here 90 degrees caught of a circle the radius is 14 and here also you're getting quarter of a circle so quarter and quarter becomes a semicircle so here you get 180 semicircle angle and radius is 14 so we can find out the perimeter by calculating the arc length first so first we'll find out the arc 
,,length angle 180 divided by three-sixty into two PI is 22 over 7 into radius radiuses 14 now let's try to simplify 180 times 2 7 and 14 you get to hear this 2 and this 2 get canceled out so 22 times 2 you get 44 and what about this side so that is the arc length so this is in centimeters now easily you can find out the perimeter of the shaded part so we try to start from here 14 14 14 14 so how many four teens are there you get four four teens and then add the arc length so arc length is 44 so what's the answer 4 times 4 16 one remaining 4 times 1 4 4 plus 1 5 plus 44 when you simplify you get 100 centi meters as the perimeter of the shaded region now 
,,we look at the next example so in this example it's a square and given this length is 7 and you asked to find out the perimeter of the shaded region so here that means you have to take the total length of these four distances now when you take one part I'll take this part and write draw here and take this one and I want to rotate it and paste it here and take the other part rotate it and paste here and what about the other part rotate it and paste here what happens you get one full circle so here if you know this is one full basically what's the perimeter this is the circumference of a circle now we need to know what's the radius of this circle so we can see radius is given seven centimeters so here what's the perimeter of this shaded region you can use straight away two pi so two times pi is 22 over 7 and R is 7 
,,so here 7 get cancelled out 2 times 22 is 44 centimeters that's the perimeter of the shaded region now we look at another example now look at the diagram you are asked to find out the perimeter of the shaded region so one side is given 80 centimeter and the other side 42 now look at carefully you are asked to find out the perimeter of this figure so you're asked to find the total distance of this now earlier we did an example similar to this one when you take a rectangle or whatever same side and dividing into two circles we found that you get the arc length of the same thing as on the other side so here we can apply the same theory here so here divided into three arcs but this side is one arc so if you can find out the arc length of this that's same as this side if you want you can check it out we'll see this is 
,,42 so 42 divided by three what's the first one length so 42 divided by 3 you get 14 so 14 is one diameter so we'll check that out whether you get the same length as 
,,this one so diam it is 14 me what's the arc length here this is a semicircle so hundred eighty divided by three-sixty into two pie our our race seven because diameter is 14 so our is seven so here when you simplify this is double two to get canceled out seven pi so seven five millions 22 over 7 times 7 you get 22 for this length so you have three arcs so 22 times 3 you're getting 66 will see this side if you are using the formula what you should get you should get the same answer so here 42 is the diameter divided by 2 you get 21 as the radius so here what's the formula we can use 180 divided by three-sixty into two PI is 22 over 7 re is 21 no simplify and see whether you get the same answer 180 times 2 this to get canceled out 7 with this 21 you get 3 3 times 22 you get 66 can you see so when you get a similar question like this you don't need to find out separate arc lengths so you can do one side and multiply by 2 to get the other side so here you can do now we found out this arc length is 66 so what's the perimeter of this shaded region so you can find out perimeter is equal to we found out 66 is the arc length of one side you can multiply by 2 because same arc length you are getting plus 80 plus 80 so when you simplify what you get 2 times 6 is 12 on remaining 2 times 6 12 plus 1 13 plus 160 so when you add these together you get 292 what's the unit centi meters now we look at the exercise 1.3 in your text so in the first question they asked to find out the perimeter of each of the following plain figures or denotes the center of the circle of the sector in the figure so here this is the center in this figure and here this is the center so you are asked to find the perimeter so we'll see how we can find this is a compound figure a rectangle and a semicircle so here you can straightaway find out the arc length using the formula and you just add 18 14 and 18 to the arc length together perimeter of the compound figure so we'll try to find out straightaway you can do that so the perimeter of this figure is so you can add 14 plus 18 plus 18 plus now we need to find out the arc length but we know this is a semicircle angle at the center is 180 and what's the radius 14 is the diameter so the radius is half of it so that's seven so you can write down 180 divided by three-sixty into two PI value is 22 over 7 into r r is seven now try to simplify this you get will do this side first seven seven get cancel out 180 times two is 360 this to get cancel out with this 2 what's remaining 22 so here we'll add these two together 14 plus 18 plus 18 plus 22 so what's the perimeter you get 8 plus 2 10 18 18 plus 4 22 two remaining 2 plus 1 3 4 5 6 7 so 72 centimeter for the perimeter of this compound figure now we look at the second part so here you have given a compound 
,,figure a triangle with a semicircle so here it's given these two sides I equal that means this is also four centimeter now here this is given the full 97 that means 
,,the diameter of this semicircle is 7 so what's the radius 7/2 so we'll first find the arc length and then add 4 and 4 to arc length to get the perimeter of the compound figure so here we'll do straight away perimeter is equal to 4 plus 4 plus Auklet arc length is angle angle is 180 because this is a semicircle 180 divided by three-sixty into two PI pi is 22 over 7 R is 7 over 2 now try to simplify this one 4 + 4 8 180 times 2 is 360 this 2 and this 2 get cancelled out and here 7 & 7 also get canceled out 22 divided by 2 you get 11 so 8 plus 11 what's the answer you get 19 centimeters as the perimeter of the shaded part now we'll look at the second question it says a semi circular portion of diameter 7 so here this part has been cut out from a semicircular lamina of radius 7 and welded to the lamina again as shown 
,,in the figure so this part cut out and paste it here find the arc length of the sector of the circle of radius 7 centimeter so here that means they are asking the bigger semicircle so here radius is seven and you are asked to find out the arc length so what's the arc length for the first part arc length is and Alessandra det because this is a semicircle over three-sixty into two PI is 22 over 7 into R RS 7 simplify this seven get cancel out 180 times 2 2 & 2 get cancelled out so you get 22 
,,centimeters as the arc length of the bigger semicircle then the second part find the arc length of the sector of the circle of diameter 7 diameter 7 means this smaller one so this one so diameter 7 means what's the radius 7 over 2 so how you find out the arc length L is equal to 180 because this is a semicircle into 3 6 over 3 16 to 2 pi is 22 over 7 r is 7 over 2 now here again simplify hundret need to divide by this one you get 2 2 to get cancelled out 7 7 get canceled out 22 divided by 2 you get 11 so here you get 11 centimeter further small above so what it says the third part says find the perimeter of the shaded region so perimeter of the shaded 
,,region means you have to find out this part you did that in part 1 this part using part 2 again another semicircle like this so that means double of this so how can 
,,we do the third part third-parties find the parameter that means 22 plus 11 times 2 because you get to smaller semicircles for the shaded region so 22 plus 11 times 
,,222 again you are getting 44 centimeters now we'll look at the third question in the exercise so in the third question it says the figure illustrates how an equilateral triangle of side length seven is drawn within a sector of a circle of radius the length of a side of the triangle so this is an equilateral triangle means all sides are equal and one side is 7 centimeters so here they asked find the arc length of the sector of the circle here if this is an equilateral triangle what is this angle 1 angle is equal to 60 degrees now the first part find the arc length of the sector of the circle that means you're asking to find out this link so how can we find out that length so we know angle at the center is 60 degrees so you can use straight away Clent is equal to 60 over 360 into 2 pi is 22 over 7 what's the R value so this is the center of the sector and the radius is 7 now try to simplify seven get cancelled out 60 times 6 is 362 with this you get 3 so what's the answer 22 over 3 you can simplify and write down 3 times 7 20 mile and one-third 7 and 1/3 centimeters what's the second part second part says find the perimeter of the igreja now we found this length and according to the shaded region you need this length but we know this length is same as seven because this is an equilateral triangle so here what's the perimeter of the shaded region so perimeter is you just add seven and the arc length so when you add these two you get seven and seven becomes 14 and 
,,one-third centimeters now we'll look at question number four in this figure there are two sectors of circles a be edy a B D and C DF b c d FB so this is one arc and 
,,this is the other arc if a b is 10.5 so as a B that means this is a square one side is given 10.5 find the perimeter of the shaded region using the given data so here if you take this as the center this is the arc length so here first thing you can find out the arc length you get the same arc length on the other side just multiply by 2 so here what's the arc length of one side you can take 10.5 is the radius so here what's the angle there this is a quarter of a circle angle is 90 degrees so here 90 over 360 into 2 pi is 22 over 7 what's the r-value 10.5 so better to convert to fractions so what is 10.5 ten-and-a-half or you can 20 times 2 plus 121 over 2 so you can write 21 over 2 instead of 10 points five now try to simplify 90 times for its 360 and to get cancel out with this to seven cancel out with this 21 and you get three what is so again you can divide by 2 divide by 2 again here so 11 times 3 you get 33 divided by 2 so that's one arc length so you get double of that so what's the perimeter of this figure so perimeter becomes 30 3 over 2 multiplied by 2 because there are two arcs like the same thing so here 2 to get cancel out you are getting 33 centimeter further perimeter of the shaded region now we'll look at question number five so in this question the figure shows two sectors of circles 
,,of Center a and radius ad and a are how much greater is the perimeter of the sector a PQR AP cuba so that means they are asking this is the a PQR sector a P Q R sector and and the other one is the perimeter of the shaded region so what is the perimeter of the shaded region this saw this part so you are getting this one so that's B P R T okay so they are asking what's the difference between the perimeter of these two figure so here it says this is a sector what's the angle 45 so here this is the shaded region so here and you need to find out the perimeter of the shaded region now if you want the difference we can easily see what you need now here if you're finding this one so I'll write down with a different color now can you see when you subtract these two what happens this distance is the same as this distance when you subtract this side get canceled out okay and then you get this part so here that means this part get canceled out when you take the difference and when you take this part it also get cancelled out and when you do that what happens so when you erase this part and this part what happens you are basically getting this arc length and these two lengths so here we can easily find out these two lengths and subtract with this length so we'll just find out the sum of these two lengths so here can you see this length is 3.5 so this is 3.5 this is 3.5 what's the total distance three point five plus three point five you get seven what about this one this means the arc length of this smaller sector so we can easily find out the arc length of the smaller sector using the formula angle is 45 times 2 pi is 22 over 7 and the radius is 3.5 you convert to a fraction and write down 7 over 2 so try to simplify 7 7 get canceled out 9 times 5 9 times 4 so you get 45 times 1/5 times 8 this to get cancel out with this 2 again you can divide by 2 4 and 11 so what's the answer they are 11 over 4 so when you write as a decimal value what is 11 over 4 you get 4 times 2 8 and 30 you get 4 times 7 is 28 and 420 that's fine so here you get the arc length as 2.75 and these two lengths ever so we need the difference so difference is equal to 7 minus 2 0.75 so what's the difference you get 5 5 10 one remaining so here 8 and to tell one remaining 3 with 4 so they all say is 4.25 centimeters now we will look at the miscellaneous exercise in your textbook so in the first question it says a sector of a circle as shown in the figure with angle at the center equals 220 has been cut out from a circular lamina of radius 21 showed that the perimeter of the remaining portion of the lamina is 130 so this part cut it out and you are asking what's the perimeter of the other path now outside angle is 120 so what's the inside angle trees 60 minus 120 so what's your answer you get 240 now 
,,we know in this sector the angle at the center is 240 so how you find out the perimeter of the other figure use the formula radius is 21 so double of radius and angle is now 240 over three-sixty into two PI value is 22 over 7 times r r is 21 now we'll simplify this part you get 0 get canceled out 7 be 21 you get 3 and 3 times 2 
,,6 6 with 6 36 6 times 4 24 so what's the answer there 2 times 21 is 42 plus 4 times 22 is 88 so when you add this together 8 + 2 10 one remaining 9 + 4 30 so you get 130 centimeters for the perimeter of this figure now we'll look at the second question in the second question it says the figure depicts upon having semicircular boundaries a protective fence along the boundary of the pond has been planned find the perimeter of the pot so that means we need to find out the perimeter of this figure so can you identify without finding separate paths we see that this part and this part you get one full circle and also this small part with this small part you 
,,are getting another full circle so first find out the circumference of the bigger one circumference of the smaller one and then add it together what's the diameter of the bigger one diameter of the bigger one is 35 meters what's the diameter of the smaller one 14 meters so we'll find out the circumference of these two circles and add it together so the first part it says find the perimeter perimeter is equal to what's the circumference of this one diameter is given PI D so you can straight 
,,away use PI into D what about the circumference of the other one again Heidi so pi is 22 over 7 D is 14 so here simplify 7 times 5 7 times 2 5 times 22 you get hundred 10 so what is 22 times 2 you get 44 so what's the perimeter of the pond you get hundred 54 meters now second part it says it has been estimated that the cost of constructing one meter of the fences five thousand how much will it cost to complete the whole fence so here it's given the 154 is the total perimeter so here one meter cost how much five thousand rupees so total perimeter is hundred fifty four meters so what's the cost for that so you take five thousand divided by 1 in 254 so that means basically multiplied by five and you can put three zeros for times four 22 remaining 5 times 5 25 plus 2 27 2 remaining 5 times 1 is 5 5 + 2 7 and then you 
,,can put another 3 zeroes so what's the answer say 170 thousand rupees father for the whole fence now we look at question number 3 in this question it says the figure depicts a rectangular plot of land with two semicircular flowerbeds so these are the flowerbeds at the two ends the shaded region is a lawn find the perimeter of the law so that means they're asking find the distance of this one total distance of the shaded region so how can we do that when you look at carefully we see that this arc length and this arc length makes one full circle what's the diameter diameter is 14 and you get 20 above and below 20 so here basically you need to find out the circumference of the circle and at 20 plus 20 so what's the answer for the first part perimeter is equal to 2 PI R or PI D because here diameter is given so you can use PI D so 22 over 7 times 14 PI D that's the full circle plus 20 plus 20 so what's the answer 7 times 2 22 times 2 is 44 plus 40 you get 84 meters what's the second part it has been decided to lay tires around the lawn each tire length 25 centimeters so here they are trying to lay out tiles around the lawn so something like 
,,this so you asked to find out the minimum number of tiles that are required so one tile is 25 centimeter so here we know that the total perimeter is 84 meters and this is given in centimeter so here you need to know the conversion so centimeters and meters so what's the conversion 100 centimeters is 1 meter so here we'll first convert the perimeter into centimeters so how many centimeters you multiply by 100 so that means you put 2 zeroes there so 8400 centimeters for the whole perimeter but one tile is 25 centimeters so how many tiles you need number of tiles you need is take the total perimeter divided by the length of one time so divide by five five times five five times one 534 five times six 45 times eight zero and then divide by five again five times three 15 for 18 five times three and four 35 times six so 
,,how many tiles you need to lay out around the Lord you need 336 tiles now we look at the fourth question it says a portion of a grill to be fixed to a window has been made by combining two equal sectors of circles as shown in the figure so that means equal means this sector is same as this sector the person making the grill states that based on the given data a wire of length hundred twenty eight centimeters is required for it show with reasons that his statement is correct all these with the wire so here basically we need to find out the perimeter of the whole figure so first we'll find out the arc length so this is like a sector with angle at the center is 60 and the radius is 25 so first find the arc length multiplied by two you get both are cleanse and then what you get here this is 21 this is also 21 and this is also 21 and here also 21 why because it's given same arc length so also exalt when T one's so 21 times four with this arc length so we'll try to find out the perimeter of the total figure is 21 times four plus one arc length so angle is sixty divided by three-sixty into two PI is 22 over 7 into R is 21 and you need to multiply this by two because there are two sectors and you need to arc lengths now try to simplify 60 times six seven times 21 that's three what is we can cross out this 2 and this 3 you get six cancel out with this 6 and you get 4 times 1 is 4 4 times 2 is 8 84 plus 22 times 2 that's forty-four so what's the total perimeter you get eight and twelve so 128 centimeters for the full perimeter so is this statement correct so the person making the drill mentioned that the wire of length hundred and twenty eight is required for it yes because we found out the total perimeter of this figure is 128 so you can write yes the statement is is correct because because the total length length of fire is 128 centimeters so in this lesson we covered perimeter of different shapes like rectangles squares triangles circles and mainly sectors and you can memorize these formulae and apply these in real-life applications

Perimeter,qJwecTgce6c,"Hi, Im Rob.  Welcome to Math Antics! In this lesson, were going to learn about another important geometry quantity called Volume. Specifically, were going to learn what volume is, and what kind of units we use to measure volume, and how we can calculate the volumes of a few simple geometric shapes. The first thing you need to know is that Volume is a quantity that all 3-Dimensional objects have, but to understand what it means, it will help if we back up just a little and start out with "
,,a 1-Dimensional object like this line segment. To measure a 1-Dimensional object we need a 1-Dimensional quantity which we usually call length. The length of this 
,,"line happens to be exactly one centimeter (which is a common unit for measuring length). And in the Math Antics video about area, we saw that if we move (or extend) "
,,"this 1-Dimensional line in a direction perpendicular to it by a distance of one centimeter, it forms a 2-Dimensional object called a square. 2-Dimensional objects are measured by the 2-Dimensional quantity that we call area. Because the original line was one centimeter long and we extended it a distance of one centimeter, the amount of area that this square occupies is one square centimeter (which is a common unit for measuring area.) Okay now, imagine that we take that 2-Dimensional square and move (or extend) it in a direction perpendicular to its surface by a distance of 1 centimeter. It forms a 3-Dimensional object thats called a cube. And to measure a 3-Dimensional object like this, we use the 3-Dimensional quantity called volume. Volume tells us how much 3-Dimensional space (or 3D space) an object occupies. Alright, but how much volume does this cube have? Well, since it was made by extending 1 square centimeter a distance of one centimeter in the 3rd dimension, we say that its volume is exactly one cubic centimeter (which is a common unit for measuring volume.) So square units are used to measure area, and cubic units are used to measure volume. Since square units are made by multiplying TWO 1-Dimensional units together, like centimeter times centimeter, we can abbreviate them using "
,,"the exponent notation centimeters to the 2nd power or centimeters squared. And since cubic units are made by multiplying THREE 1-Dimensional units together, like centimeter times centimeter times centimeter, we can abbreviate them using exponent notation: centimeters to the 3rd power or centimeters cubed. And, just like "
,,"there were different sizes of square units like square inches, square meters or square miles, there are also different sized cubic units like cubic inches, cubic meters or cubic miles. See how area and square units are related to volume and cubic units? And theres another similarity too. Do you remember how you can use square units to measure the area of ANY 2D shape, not just squares? Well, you can use cubic units to measure the volume of ANY 3D shape, not just cubes. To see how that works, take a look at this 2D circle and this 3D object called a sphere (which is like a ball). Just like you can uses a bunch of small squares to approximate the area of the circle, you can use a bunch of small cubes to approximate the volume of the sphere. And heres the really cool partThe smaller the squares you use, the closer their combined area will match the area of the circle. And the smaller the cubes you use, the closer their combined volume will match the volume of the sphere. Okay,  so volume is a 3D quantity for measuring 3D objects, but since weve also talked a lot about area in this video, I want to point out that 3D objects also have a type of area that you dont want to confuse with volume. You might remember from our previous videos, that 2D shapes have BOTH a 2D quantity called area and a 1D quantity called perimeter. Well, in a similar way, 3D objects have BOTH a 3D quantity called volume and a 2D quantity called called surface area. Surface area is a lot like it sounds its the area of the objects outer surface or shell. Perimeter and surface area are both outer boundaries of geometric shapes. Perimeter is the 1-Dimensional outer boundary of a 2-Dimensional shape, and surface area is the 2-Dimensional outer boundary of a 3-Dimensional shape. And to help you see the difference between surface area and volume, imagine that you have a perfectly thin box filled with ice. If you unfold the box, you can see the 2D area that surrounds the volume, while the volume itself if the amount of 3D space occupied by the ice inside the box. Alright, so now that you understand what volume is, and you wont confuse it with surface area, were going to spend the rest of the video learning how to calculate the volumes of some basic geometric shapes. But before we do that, I want to quickly mention something important about terminology (or the words we use to describe things in math). Most of the time, people agree on what to call things in math, but not aways. And thats especially true when it comes to the words that we use to describe the dimensions of geometric objects. Take the words, length, width and height for example. If I have a rectangle, I could name its two dimensions length and width like we did in the Area video. But I could also name them width and height if I wanted to. The actual names of the dimensions really arent important, so different teachers might use different names. The important thing is to be flexible and realize that the math concepts are the same, even if different words are used to explain them. For example, the area of a rectangle is always found by multiplying its two side dimensions together, no matter what theyre called. Okay back to calculating volumes A lot of 3D shapes can be formed by taking a 2D shape and then extending it along the third dimension. For example, if you start with a rectangle, and then extend it along the third dimension, you get a 3D shape "
,,"called a rectangular prism. If you start with a triangle, and then extend it along the third dimension, you get a 3D shape called a triangular prism. And if you "
,,"start with a circle, and extend it along the third dimension, you get a 3D shape called a cylinder. From the others, you might have thought it should be called a circular prism but technically prisms are shapes that are formed by extending a polygon, and since a circle is not a polygon, the resulting shape is not called a prism. Okay, so the good news is that theres a general formula for calculating the volume of these types of 3D shape. All you have to do is find the area of the original 2D shape that got extended, and then multiply that by the length (or distance) that it was extended. Usually, that original shape is called the base of the object. So lets start with this rectangular prism and calculate its volume. The base is the original rectangle, and its dimensions are 4 centimeters by 3 centimeters. "
,,"So to find the area of that base, we need to remember how to calculate the area of a rectangle. To do that, we just multiply the two side dimensions together. 4 centimeters times 3 centimeters gives us 12 centimeters squared as the area. Now to find the volume, we just need to multiply that area by the length that the base was "
,,"extended. Our diagram tells us that distance is 10 centimeters, so if we multiply 12 centimeters squared by 10 centimeters, we get 120 centimeters cubed. So this rectangular prism has a volume of 120 cubic centimeters. Okay, lets try to find the volume of the triangular prism now. Again, the first step is to calculate the area "
,,"of the base of the prism which is this triangle. The formula for finding the area of a triangle is one-half of the triangles base times its height. Be careful not to confuse the base of the triangle with the base of the prism which IS the triangle itself. Our diagram tells us that the base of the triangle is 10 inches and its height is 8 inches, so one-half the base times the height would be one-half of 10 times 8. 10 times 8 is 80, and one-half of 80 is 40, so the area of the triangle is "
,,"40 inches squared. Now all we have to do to find the volume is multiply that area by the length that it was extended. Were told that the length is 50 inches, so we "
,,"multiple 40 inches squared by 50 inches and we get 2,000 inches cubed. Thats the volume of this prism. Alright, are you ready to try finding the volume of the cylinder now? The cylinder is made by extending a circle, so first we need to calculate the area of that circle. As we learned in a previous video, the area of a circle is found by multiplying pi times its radius squared. The radius of this circle is 2 meters, so if we square that, we get 4 meters squared. Then we multiply by pi (which is approximately 3.14) and we get 12.56 meters squared. Now that we know the area of the circle, to find the volume of the cylinder, we just multiply that area by the length that the circle was extended (which happens to be 10 meters). 10 meters times 12.56 meters squared gives us 125.6 meters cubed. So the volume of this cylinder is 125.6 cubic meters. So, do you see how to find the volume of 3D shapes like these? shapes that are made by taking a 2D shape an then extending it along a third axis? You just find the area of that shape and then you multiply it by the length that it was extended, and that gives you the volume. And it works for ANY 2D shape it works for trapezoids, or pentagons, or diamonds, or stars, or hearts Man now that I know how to accurately calculate volumes, playtime is WAY more fun! "
,,"Of course, not all 3D shapes are made by extending a 2D shape along a third dimension. Some are made by rotating a shape around an axis like that sphere we saw earlier in the video for instance. One way to form a sphere is to rotate a 2D circle around one of its diameter lines. And another common 3D shape that can be formed by "
,,"rotating a 2D shape around an axis is a cone. A cone can be formed by rotating a right triangle around one of its two perpendicular edges. Since the formulas for finding the volumes of spheres and cones are more complicated to explain, we dont have time to learn how we arrive at them in this video. So for now, its best if you "
,,"just memorize the formulas so you can use them on tests if you need to. To find the volume of a sphere, you use the formula: Volume equals four-thirds times pi times radius cubed. And to find the volume of a cone, you use the formula: Volume equals one-third times height times pi times radius squared. Lets try one example of each before we wrap up. Heres a sphere with a radius of 2 centimeters. Fortunately, thats the only dimension we need to find its volume. Our formula says that the volume of a sphere is equal to: 4/3 x pi x r^3 Cubing the radius mean multiplying it by itself 3 times. So we take 2 cm x 2 cm x 2 cm which equals 8 cm cubed. Next well multiply that by our approximation for pi:  3.14 times 8 is 25.12. And last, we multiply that by four-thirds, which is the same as multiplying by 4 then dividing "
,,"by 3, which gives us a volume of 33.49 centimeters cubed. Now lets try a cone. To use our formula to find the volume of a cone, we need to know two things: the radius of the circle that forms the base of the cone, and the heigh of the cone (which is similar to the height of a triangle. Its the distance from the point at the tip of the cone, straight down to the center of the circular base.) The radius of the base of this cone is 3 feet, and its height is 9 feet. So first lets plug that radius into our equation and square it: 3 feet x 3 feet is 9 feet squared. Next we multiply that by pi (again using 3.14) and we get 28.26 feet squared. You may notice that thats just the area of the base circle. But now we need to multiply that base area by the one-third times the height of the cone. One-third times 9 feet is 3 feet, and 3 feet times 28.26 square feet gives us 84.78 cubic feet, which is the volume of the cone. Alright. so now you know a lot about volume. You know that its a 3D quantity of geometric objects, and you know that we measure volume with cubic units. You also learned how to calculate the volume of some basic 3D shapes. Of "
,,"course, theres a lot of other 3D shapes that we didnt have time to cover in this video, but now you know about some of the most common ones. The key is to put what youve learned into practice by trying some exercise problems on your own. As always, thanks for watching Math Antics and Ill see ya next time. Learn more at www.mathantics.com"

Perimeter,WqhlG3Vakw8,"Hi, Im Rob.  Welcome to Math Antics! In this lesson, were gonna learn about The Pythagorean Theorem or Pythagoras Theorem as its sometimes called. And you may be wondering, Whats a Theorem? and Who in the world is Pythagoras? Well, in math, a theorem is simply a statement that has been proven to be true from other things that are either known or accepted to be true. And Pythagoras well, he was this really smart dude who lived a long time ago in ancient Greece and he proved the theorem.  [Applause] Well historians arent completely sure it was actually Pythagoras that proved it. It could have been one of his students or followers, but he usually gets credit for it. Anyway, the main thing that you need to know is that the Pythagorean Theorem describes an important geometric relationship between the three "
,,"sides of a right triangle. Were gonna learn what that relationship is in just a minute, but first there's several things that youll need to know before you can truly understand the Pythagorean Theorem or use it to solve problems. First of all, to understand the Pythagorean Theorem you need to know about angles and triangles, and you also need to know a little bit about exponents and square roots. So if those topics are new to you, be sure to watch our videos about them first. And second, "
,,"even though the Pythagorean Theorem is about geometry, youll need to know some basic algebra to actually use it. Specifically, youll need to know about variables and how to solve basic algebraic equations that involve exponents. We cover a lot of those topics in the first five videos of our Algebra Basics series. Okay, now that youve got all that background info covered, lets see what the Pythagorean Theorem actually says. The theorem can be stated in several different ways, but the one we like best goes like this: For a right triangle with legs a and b and hypotenuse c, a squared plus b squared equals c squared. As you can see from this definition, the Pythagorean Theorem doesnt apply to ALL triangles. It ONLY applies to RIGHT triangles. As you know, right triangles always include one right angle thats usually marked with the square right-angle-symbol to help you identify it. And you need to know which angle is the right angle because it helps you identify an important side of the triangle called the hypotenuse. The hypotenuse is the longest side of a right triangle and its always the side thats opposite of the right angle. In other words, its the side that doesn't touch (or help form) the right angle itself. In order to use the Pythagorean Theorem, you need to be able to identify the hypotenuse because thats what the variable c stands for in theorem. c is the length of the hypotenuse side. The other two sides of the triangle (the ones that DO touch or form the right angle) are called its legs. Our Pythagorean Theorem definition uses the variable names a and b to represent their lengths. Oh and it doest matter which leg is called a and which leg is called b as long as you keep track of which is which after you make your initial choice. Okay, "
,,"now that we know the various parts of the Pythagorean Theorem, lets think about what the relationship or equation ('a squared' plus 'b squared' equals 'c squared') "
,,"is really telling us. Its telling us that if we take the lengths of the two legs (sides a and b) and square them, which means multiplying them by themselves, "
,,"(a squared is a times a and b squared is b times b) and then if we add those two squared amounts together, they will EQUAL the amount youd get if you square the hypotenuse side (which would be c squared or c times c) That may sound a little confusing at first. So lets take a look at a special example of a right triangle that will help the Pythagorean Theorem make a little more sense. This right triangle is called a 3, 4, 5 triangle because its sides have relative lengths of 3, 4, and 5. And by relative lengths, I mean that the units of length dont really matter. The sides could be expressed in ANY units (inches, meters, miles, whatever) So the triangle could be of any size as long as its lengths would have the proportions 3, 4, and 5 relative to each other. Starting with the side thats "
,,"3 units long, which well call side a what do we get if we square that side? Well in arithmetic, squaring 3 mean multiplying 3 times 3 which equals 9. And the geometric equivalent of squaring something actually results in a square shape. As you can see, this square contain 9 unit squares. So this red area represents the value "
,,"a squared in the Pythagorean Theorem. Next lets look at the side thats 4 units long, which well call side b. Squaring 4 means multiplying 4 times 4 which is 16. Again, the geometric equivalent of that is a literal square that is 4 units on each side and covers a total area of 16 units. So this blue area represent b squared' in the Pythagorean Theorem. And finally, lets deal with the hypotenuse, or side c, which is the longest side. Its 5 units long.  Squaring 5 means multiplying 5 times 5 which is 25, and the geometric equivalent is a 5 by 5 square that has an area of 25 units. So this green area represents c squared in the Pythagorean Theorem. Now that you can see how the arithmetic parts of the Pythagorean Theorem are related to the geometric parts of this right triangle, lets check to see if the "
,,"Pythagorean Theorem is really true (at least in this special case). On the arithmetic side, if you add up the amounts a squared and b squared, they really DO equal c squared because 9 + 16 = 25. And with a little rearranging of our unit squares, you can see that the area of the squares formed by the two legs really does equal the area of the square formed by the hypotenuse. Wow, those ancient greek dudes really were smart! Okay, but I know what some of you are thinking Thats cool "
,,"n all, but why should I even care about the Pythagorean Theorem? Whats it good for? Well, as always, thats a good question. And the answer is, like many things "
,,"in math, the Pythagorean Theorem is a useful tool that can help you use what you DO know to figure out what you DONT know. Specifically, if you have a right triangle but you only know how long two of its sides are, the Pythagorean Theorem tells you how to figure out the length of the third unknown side. For example, imagine that you have a right triangle thats 2 cm long on this side and 3 cm long on this side, but we dont know how long the hypotenuse is. No problemo! The Pythagorean Theorem tells us the relationship between all three sides of ANY right triangle, so we can figure it out. We know that 'a squared' plus 'b squared' equals 'c squared' so lets plug what we DO know into that equation and then solve it for what we DONT know. Again, it doesnt matter which of the two legs is called a or b so lets just label them like this and then substitute 2 for a and 3 for b in the Pythagorean Theorem equation. That gives us an algebraic equation that has just one unknown, c. If we solve this equation for c in other words, if we re-arrange the equation so that c is all by itself on one side of the equal sign, then well know exactly what c is. Well know the length of that side of the triangle. First, we need to simplify the left side of the equation since it contains the known "
,,"numbers. And according to the order of operations, we need to simplify the exponents first. 2 squared is 4 and 3 squared is 9. Then, we add those results (4 + 9 "
,,"= 13) and we have the equation 13 = c squared which is the same as c squared = 13. Then, to get c all by itself, we need to do the inverse of whats being done to it. Since its being squared, the inverse operation is the square root, so we need to take the square root of both sides. Taking the square root of 'c squared' just gives us c which is what we want on this side of the equation, but it gives us a little problem on the other side because its not easy to figure out what the "
,,"square root of 13 is. Its not a perfect square so its going to be a decimal, and probably an irrational number. But thats okay because its fine to just leave our answer as the square root of 13 Sure, you could use a calculator to get the decimal value if you really need one, but in math its very common to just leave square roots alone unless they're easy to simplify. So the sides of this right triangle are, 2 cm, 3 cm and the square root of 13 cm. Lets try another example. For this right triangle, we know the length of the hypotenuse (6 m), and one of the legs (4 m), but the length of the other leg is unknown. So lets use the Pythagorean Theorem to find that unknown length. As usual, we call the hypotenuse side c. And lets call the leg we know side a and the leg we dont know side b. Then we can "
,,"substitute the known values into the Pythagorean Theorem and solve for the unknown value. Replacing the c with 6 and the a with 4 gives us the equation, 4 squared plus b squared equals 6 squared, which we need to simplify and solve for b. First lets simplify the exponents. 4 squared is 16, and 6 squared is 36. Now we need to isolate the b squared and we can do that by subtracting 16 from both sides of the equation. On this side, the (+16) and the (-16) leave us with just "
,,"b squared. And on the other side we have 36 minus 16 which is 20. We can now solve this simplified equation for b by taking the square root of both sides which gives us b equals the square root of 20. Again, its fine to leave your answer as a square root like this. And some of you may know that the square root of 20 can be simplified to 2 times the square root of 5. Were not going to worry about simplifying roots in this video, but if you know how to do it, awesome! If you dont know, just leave the answer as the square root of 20 meters. Heres another interesting one. What if you have a unit square that's cut in half along a diagonal. Each side of the square is 1 unit long, but how far is it from one corner of the square to the other along the diagonal? Well, since the diagonal divides the square into two right triangles, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to tell us that unknown distance. We label the legs of the right triangle a and b and the hypotenuse c. And since we know that a and b are both 1, we can plug those values into the Pythagorean Theorem equation which gives us us 1 squared plus 1 squared equals c squared. Now we solve for c. 1 squared is just 1 so this left side of this equation simplifies to 1 plus 1 which is just 2. That means c squared equals 2 and if we take the square root of both sides, we get c equals the square root of 2. So thats how far it is across the diagonal of the unit square. Okay, "
,,"so thats how you use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of an unknown side of a right triangle, which is its most common use. But theres another way that you can use the Pythagorean Theorem that I want to mention. You can also use the Pythagorean Theorem to TEST a triangle to see if it truly is a RIGHT triangle Ya know in case youre not already sure. For example, what if someone shows you this triangle and asks, Is this a right triangle?. Well, it looks a lot like a right triangle but it doest have a right angle symbol, and it would be kinda hard to tell if this angle is exactly 90 degrees just by looking at it. Maybe its really close to 90, like 89.5 degrees. No worries, the Pythagorean Theorem can tell us for sure, if we know the lengths of all three sides of the triangle. If we know those lengths (a, b and c), then we can just plug them into the Pythagorean Theorem equation to see if it holds true. In this particular case, since the two shorter sides are each 3 cm and the longest side is 4 cm, we can plug those values in for a, b and c and simplify to see what we get. 3 squared is 9, so on this side of the equation we get 9 plus 9 which is 18. And on the other side we have 4 squared, which is 16. Uh oh that doesnt look right! Our equation simplified to 18 equals 16, which is definitely NOT a true statement. That means that the three sides of this triangle do not work in the Pythagorean Theorem they dont fit the relationship 'a squared' plus 'b squared' equals 'c squared' And since the Pythagorean Theorem tells us that ALL right triangle fit that relationship, this triangle must not be a RIGHT triangle. Alright. so now you know what the Pythagorean Theorem is and you know how to use it. You can use it to find a missing side of any right triangle, and you can also use it to test a triangle to see if it qualifies as a right triangle. But as you can see, it takes a lot of other math skills to be able to use the Pythagorean Theorem effectively, so you may need to brush up on some of those skills before youre ready to try using it on your own. And remember, you cant get good at "
,,"math just by watching videos about it. You actually need to practice solving real math problems. As always, thanks for watching Math Antics and Ill see ya next time. Learn more at www.mathantics.com"

Perimeter,LGqBQrUYua4,"Hi! Welcome to Math Antics.  In this lesson, we are gonna learn about long division. If you havent already watched our video about basic division, then be sure to go back and watch that first. It will make learning long division a lot easier. Long division is just a way of breaking up a bigger division problem into a series of "
,,"short division steps like the ones that we did in the basic division video. The nice thing about long division is that once you know the procedure, you can divide up all kinds of numbers, even if they are REALLY big. The key to long division is to think about our division problem digit-by-digit. If our dividend (the number were dividing up) has a lot of digits, then that means that there will be a lot of division steps to do. When we learned basic one-step division, all of the dividends were small enough that we could just use the multiplication table to help us find the answer. But what if we have a division problem like this?  936 divided by 4 936 is definitely NOT on our multiplication table! In fact, theres not anything even close to 936, so what do we do? Well, instead of trying to divide the entire 936 by "
,,"4 all at once, lets break this problem up into smaller steps by just trying to divide each digit by 4, one digit at a time digit-by-digit. Do you remember how with multi-digit multiplication and addition, we always start with the smallest digit (the ones place digit) and we work from right to left? Well division is backwards! "
,," We still go digit by digit, but the other way. We start by trying to divide up the digit in the biggest number place first and we work our way from left to right. So the first step in this problem is to divide the FIRST digit of our dividend by 4. Well just ignore the other digits for now, and that makes it look like we have the division problem 9 divided by 4. Great!  Thats easy!  Its just a basic division problem like in the last video. So we ask, How many 4s will it take to make 9 or almost 9? Well, two 4s would be 8, and thats almost 9. So just like before, we put the 2 in our answer spot on top of the line. But wait a minute theres a "
,,"lot of room up there. Where exactly do we put it? Well, the answer digit should always go directly above the digit were dividing. Since were dividing the digit 9, "
,,"our 2 should go right above the 9. Okay, now we multiply 2 times 4 is 8, and the 8 goes below the 9 so that we can subtract to get our remainder. 9 minus 8 is 1, so our remainder is 1. Now at this point in our basic one-step division problems, we would re-write our remainder up in our answer with a little r next to it. But we arent going to do that yet because this is long division and we still have more digits to divide (the ones weve been ignoring). Since were going digit-by-digit, "
,,"lets stop ignoring the next digit in our dividend (the 3). Now you might think that our next division step is to divide that 3 by the 4.  But its not quite that simple. We had a remainder from our last division step, and we cant just forget about that. We need to combine that remainder with our next digit and divide them both together. We do that by bringing down a COPY of the next digit (the 3) and put it right beside the remainder (which is 1). When we do that, it looks like our remainder is 13.  Its kind of like our remainder is teaming up with the next digit over. And if you think about it, that makes sense because the digits that we were ignoring during our first division step really are part of the remainder, because we still need to divide them. Okay, so bringing down that next digit makes our remainder bigger. And thats good because before, the remainder was so small that 4 couldnt divide into it. But now its 13, and 4 will divide into 13. So we ask, How many "
,,"4s will it take to make 13? Well, three 4s would be 12, and thats really close without being too big.  So lets put 3 in our answer line. Yep - it goes right over the 3 because that is the next digit we were dividing in this digit-by-digit process. And then 3 times 4 is 12 which we put right below the 13 so that we can subtract to get the next remainder which will also be 1. See how were just repeating the basic division procedure?  But were going further down the screen as we do. Alright, now that we have a new remainder, its time for our next division step. Lets stop ignoring the last digit in the dividend (the 6) and bring down a copy of it to team up with our new remainder. Together, they form a remainder of 16. Ah ha!  Thats good because its gonna be easy to divide 4 into 16 because 16 is a multiple of 4. It takes exactly fours 4s to make 16.  So we put a 4 in the last place of our answer line, and then we write the 16 below our new remainder. Now if we subtract 16 from 16, we see that our last remainder will be zero, which means theres no remainder left. Thats great!  We solved the whole division problem digit-by-digit by breaking it up into three basic division steps. And now we know that 936 divided by 4 equals 234. And we also know why they call it long division!! In fact, that was so long, I think I need a coffee break Oh man that was some looooooooooooong division! Wheew lets see Okay, so that problem had a three-digit dividend and it also had three division steps. But the number of steps isnt always the same as the number of digits we have. And thats because the number of steps also depends on how big our divisor is. To see what I mean, lets work two division problems side by side. These both look like the basic one-step division problems that you did in the last video, dont they? But as youll see, one of them is actually a two-step problem. Lets start with the first problem: 72 divided by 8. We just ask, How many 8s does it take to make 72 (or almost 72)? Well thats easy!  On our multiplication table you can see that 72 is a multiple of 8. 8  9 = 72  So we put 9 "
,,"in our answer line, and we write 72 below, and we see that we have no remainder. Now lets try the next problem: 72 divided by 3. If we ask, How many 3s will it take to make 72 (or almost 72)?, we can see that the answer is not on our multiplication chart. The biggest multiple of three listed there is 30 which isnt even close. The reason is that this should really be a two-step problem. Lets try using the new digit-by-digit method we just learned. Instead of asking, How many 3s make 72?, lets just focus on the first digit and ask, How many 3s does it take to make 7? Ah - thats easy.  Two 3s would give us 6, which is very close. So lets put a 2 in the answer line right above the 7. Then we multiply 2 times 3, and that makes 6. And we subtract 6 from 7 to get a remainder of 1. Now for the second step We bring down a copy of the next digit (the 2) and we combine it with the 1 to get a new remainder of 12. Then we ask, How many 3s does it take to make 12? "
,,"and the answer to that is exactly 4. So we write a 4 in the answer line, and 3  4 = 12. 12 ? 12 = 0  So we have no remainder! Were done!  72 divided by 3 is 24. Now heres the interesting thing about these examples. The first problem could have been a two-step problem also. If we had taken it digit-by-digit, we would have first asked, How many 8s does it take to make 7 (or almost 7)? But the answer would have been zero since 8 is too big to divide into 7. We would have put zero in our answer line and the remainder would have just been 7. So basically, we just skipped that step.  And thatll happen with digit-by-digit division sometimes. If the number is too small to divide into, you just put a zero in the answer line and you move on to the next digit. Okay, now that you know the procedure for long division, "
,,"are you ready to see a really long problem? Good - I thought so! Lets divide 315,270 by 5. Now dont worry its really not that hard if you just go digit-by-digit. Im gonna work the problem pretty fast, so dont worry if you dont follow all the math. Just focus on the repeating division process as we go along.  Are you ready? The first digit is 3.  How many times will 5 divide into 3?  Zero. 5 is too big. So lets just skip that step and combine our first digit with our next digit. So how many times does 5 divide into 31?  Six. 6 times 5 is 30.  And 31 minus 30 gives us a remainder of 1. Now on to the third digit  We bring a copy of it down to join with the remainder. And we ask how many times will 5 divide into 15?  Three. 3 times 5 is 15. And 15 minus 15 is zero. On to the next digit Now even though our previous remainder was zero, we still bring down a copy of the next digit. Now we ask how many times will 5 divide into 2?  Zero. 5 is too big, so we need to move on to the next digit and bring a copy of it down also. There, thats better. Now we ask, how many times will 5 divide into 27?  Five. 5 times 5 is 25.  And 27 minus 25 gives a remainder of 2. now for that last digit, which is a zero. And you might wonder, Why do we even have to bring a copy of a zero down?  Isnt that nothing? But the zero is an important place holder and when we bring a copy of it down, it changes our remainder of 2 into a remainder of 20.  Now thats a big difference! Now we ask, how many times will 5 divide into 20?  Four. 4 times 5 is 20. And 20 minus 20 is zero. Yes!  Were done!  Theres no more digits to divide. And you can see "
,,"that our final answer is:  63,054. Alright thats the procedure for long division. As you can see, its kinda complicated, so dont get discouraged if youre confused at first. Like almost everything, it just takes practice. So, as you get ready to practice some long division problems on your own, heres a few tips that will help you out. First: If you havent already done it, memorizing your multiplication table will really help with division. Second: When youre working problems, its really important to write neatly and stay organized. If your writing is messy, it might be hard to keep your columns lined up and that could lead to mistakes. And if thats the case, try using graph paper to help keep things lined up. Third: Start with some smaller two or three-digit dividends so you only have a few division steps to do. Then work up to the longer problems. And last of all: After each practice problem you do, check your answer with a calculator. That will let you know right away if youve made any mistakes so you can correct them, and most importantly, learn from them. And it will give you practice with a calculator, which is also important. Alright, thats all for this lesson. Thanks for watching Math Antics, and Ill see ya next time. Learn more at www.mathantics.com"

Perimeter,ZFqrL9E6u-Q,in this video we will discuss cartesian coordinate system or the rectangular coordinate system so what will be our objectives first is we're going to describe what is a cartesian coordinate system the x-axis the y-axis quadrant and the origin next is we're going to plot the given pair of coordinates in the cartesian coordinate plane and last we will determine the quadrant given a pair of coordinates so first let's go back to the concept of the number line so the number line is called a one-dimensional coordinate system so when we say coordinate it is referring to the location so therefore a number line has only one uh location there is only one location that's why it is called one dimensional coordinate system now why do we have only one location in a number line because we can only move it to the right or to the 
,,left okay so the a number line is called one dimensional coordinate system because we only have one location we can only move it to the left or to the right now in cartesian coordinate system we already have two sets of number line perpendicular to each other so therefore we can now move it up and down okay so when we have cartesian coordinate system we can now move it up and down all right so therefore our teach our cartesian coordinate system is a two dimensional coordinate system because we now have two coordinates so what is the quotation coordinate system it is a system used for graphing number pairs or ordered pairs it is also called rectangular 
,,coordinate system or mass familiar negative cartesian plane okay so let's go back to the history of cartesian coordinate system who created or proposes this so rene 
,,descartes from 19 1596 to 1650 he is the french mathematician a philosopher and a theologian he came up with many of his philosophical and mathematical ideas during 
,,his morning meditations that's why meronshang meditations for his first philosophy so the cartesian coordinate system again consists of two number lines perpendicular to each other so let's proceed to the parts of cartesian coordinate system a horizontal line horizontally so negative and positive integers at the po horizontal line that this is what we call the x-axis all right and then this one the vertical line is what we called or refers to the y-axis at the vertical line now these two axis is what we call the coordinate axis so we will have here the point so what is the intersection of your x-axis and y-axis that is what we call the origin so the origin has a coordinates of 0 0 y because the intersection of y and x axis is 0 right so magicking all right now when x axis and y and axis intersect to each other it 
,,will form four regions and that is what we call the quadrants so uh given the illustration how many quadrants do we have so how many regions and form kapagnagi intersects the x-axis at the y-axis that's that is correct we have four so we have four quadrants labeled counterclockwise okay so this is your quadrant one quadrant two 
,,quadrant three and quadrant four so remember that your x-axis capac positive um move uh if the um number is a positive you're going to move to the right if it's negative move to the left so y axis demand if it's positive you're going to move up if it's negative move down all right so we have here the ordered pair now remember that in in an ordered pair x y so since this is x your number not indito can only be found can only be found in your x axis so number can only be found in your y-axis 
,,s this number can only be found in your x-axis well this one can only be found in your y axis now focus is x values so this is what we call the x coordinate or it is also called abscissa again your x values is what we call the x-coordinate or that is also called abscissa while you're what a y is what we call the y-coordinate or 
,,that is also called ordinate okay so y coordinate or the other term for this is ordinate another name for the y coordinate so if you will be given ordered pair this 
,,is your abscissa this is your ordinate this is your x-coordinate this is your y-coordinate so when we say coordinates that is referring to the ordered pair okay let's proceed to the signs how will you know that the given ordered pair i lies on quadrant one quadrant ii quadrant iii or quadrant iv so let's focus on quadrant one so i have here etongasi quadrant one so sabina what do you think or what are the signs of quadrant one of the numbers or the ordered pairs from quadrant one quadrant first number moditos x and this one is for y-axis if this is the region for quadrant one so on x-na i positive i positive so therefore the signs of the numbers or the ordered pairs in quadrant one is positive positive now for quadrant two so ex so this is negative and then y nathan is positive so therefore the given ordered pairs for quadrant two has a sign of negative and then positive next for quadrant three we have so exponential negative and then this is also negative so therefore the pair of uh coordinates in quadrant iii has a sign of negative negative and then for quadrant four so the ex monetizing and positive and then this parts part the y-axis is also neg is negative so therefore the pair of coordinates or the ordered pair in quadrant four is positive negative so that is the sign of the coordinates of in 
,,quadrant four all right so let's have the plotting of points how are we going to plot the points in the cartesian coordinate system or cartesian plane so let's have 
,,this one now in making your own cartesian plane do not forget to put the x and the y axis okay so let's have the first one so let us plot point a which is 3 and negative 2 remember that this is your x your x coordinate this is your y coordinate this can only be found on your x axis and this one in your y-axis all right so let us try to plot this point so point a has a coordinates of positive 3 and negative 2. so positive three means moving to the right so this x-axis net n ebik sabihin start from the origin positive all right so let's try so since this is positive trees x axis moon and focus always starts from the origin so one two three because that is positive so going to the right i o and move not then and then y coordinate nothing is negative two so y axis nothing vertical so since negative tongue value nothing going down so one two so he picks a b hand point a is here all right another way is i will give you another way of uh plotting points so another way is you can also plot the points from x and y axis so hadimbawa this is positive three ipa plus a positive and then get their intersection okay so you have uh two ways of plotting 
,,points you can move right or left and then up and down or you may get there intersection okay another so i have point b negative five so negative five since it's ix

Perimeter,O-cawByg2aA,"Hi!  Welcome to Math Antics. In our last video, we learned about circles and we learned about a special ratio called Pi. In this video, were going to learn how we can use that ratio to calculate the circumference and the area of any circle. The formulas that we use to calculate circumference and area are so important that you should really memorize them. To help you do that, we're going to look at them side-by-side. That will help you see their similarities and their differences so you don't get them mixed up. The formula for finding the circumference is: Circumference equals Pi times diameter. And just like most formulas, we use abbreviation: 'C' for circumference and 'd' for diameter. That's a pretty simple formula. It tells us that if we know the diameter of a circle,"
,,"all we have to do is multiply that diameter times the number Pi and we'll get the circumference. We'll try that formula out in a few minutes. But first, let's see the formula for area. The formula for finding the area of a circle is: Area equals Pi times radius squared. Again, we can use abbreviations to make it shorter: 'A' for area and 'r' for radius. Now this is a pretty simple formula too. It tells us that if we know the radius, we just have to 'square' it and then multiply that times Pi to get the area. Okay, but what does it mean to 'square' the radius? Well, squaring a number just means multiplying it by itself. For example, 3 squared just means 3 times 3, and 5 squared just means 5 times 5 and r squared just means r times r. So our formula is really just: Area equals Pi times r times r, but we write it in "
,,the
,," 'r squared' form because it's more compact. Oh, and one really important thing to keep in mind is that r squared is NOT the same thing as 2 times r. That's a common mistake that students make when first learning how to find the area of a circle. And if we look carefully at both of our formulas, you'll see why. These two formulas have a lot in common. In each of them, you are multiplying Pi by part of a circle to find either the circumference or the area. In the case of the circumference, you are multiplying Pi times the diameter, and in the case of area, you are multiplying Pi times the radius squared. But do you remember the relationship between the "
,,"radius and the diameter? Diameter is just 2 times the radius. So we could re-write our formula for circumference like this: Circumference = Pi  2  r. Ha! Now you see why it's so easy to get confused. To find the circumference, you take the radius and double it. Then you multiply by Pi to get the final answer. But for area, you don't double the radius you square it. That's a very important difference. To help you see that difference in action, let's find both the circumference and the area of this circle using our two formulas. The only thing we know about this circle is that the radius is 8 meters. Luckily, that's all we need to know. First, we use "
,,"our formula for circumference: C = Pi  d. To get the diameter, we take the radius and we double it. that is, we multiply it by 2. 2  8 = 16, so the diameter is 16 meters. Then, we multiply that by Pi to get the circumference. Since this is decimal multiplication,"
,,"I'm going to use a calculator. 16  3.14 = 50.24 So that means that the circumference of this circle is 50.24 meters. Alright, now let's find the area using our formula:"
,,"A = Pi times r squared. Again, we start with the radius, but instead of doubling it, we 'square' it. That means we multiply it by itself. 8 m  8 m = 64 meters squared. Then we multiply that by Pi. 64  3.14 = 200.96 meters squared. That's the area of this circle. As you can see,"
,,"the result we get when we square the radius is very different from the result we get when we we double it. And one of the most important differences is with the units of our answer. Doubling the radius just gives us the diameter, which is a 1-dimensional quantity. So, the answer we get from our formula for circumference is also "
,,"a 1-dimensional quantity. But, when we square the radius, that gives us 'square units', which are 2-dimensional. That makes sense because"
,,area is always a 2-dimensional quantity. Remembering that will help you avoid getting these two formulas mixed up. The one that has the radius squared is always for 
,,"area. Alright, let's try a couple real-world examples to make sure you've got it. Here's the real world, which as you probably know is a sphere. But, if we take a slice of the world, right at the equator, that slice is a circle. Let's find the circumference of that circle. To do that, we need to know the diameter of the earth. That turns out to be about 12,750 km. Great, then to find the circumference we just need to multiply that diameter times Pi. Now I'm definitely going to use a calculator for this. And, I'm going to use a more accurate version of Pi since this is such a big distance. 12,750  3.14159 = 40,055 km (to the nearest kilometer). Wow, that's a pretty big circumference! No wonder it takes so long to go all the way around the earth! On your mark Get set Go! Whooo - Yes!  3.14 seconds quicker than last time.  Yes! Here's another real-world example with a circle. If this pizza has a diameter of 24 inches, what's its total area? Well, using our formula, we start by squaring the radius. But, the problem didnt give us the radius it gave us the diameter, so we have to calculate the radius from the diameter. Fortunately, that's really easy. The radius is just half of the diameter, so we just need to divide the diameter by 2. 24 inches divided by 2 gives us 12 inches for the radius. And now that we know the radius, we need to square it. 12 in  12 in = 144 inches squared. Next, we just multiply that by Pi. 144  3.14 is 452.16. So, the total area of the pizza is 452.16 square inches. Alright, so know you know how to find the circumference and the area of any circle. All you need to do is remember the formulas: Circumference equals Pi times diameter, and Area equals Pi times radius squared. But, it's really important to practice using these formulas for yourself, so be sure to try some of the exercises problems. That's the way to really learn math. Thanks for watching Math Antics"

Perimeter,dAgfnK528RA,"Hi and welcome to Math Antics. Today were gonna talk about an important math concept called Order of Operations. Order of Operations is just a set of math rules that tell you which math operations (like addition or multiplication) to do first. Now you might be wondering (especially if youre a teenager), Why do I need RULES to tell me which operations to do first?  Cant I just do them in any order I want? Well, thats a really good questions! And to answer it, were going to give two TOTALLY different people the SAME math problem to solve. The problem is: 2 + 5  4 Hmmm I like addition better than multiplication, so Im gonna do that first! Lets "
,,"see 2 + 5 gives us 7.  And then I just multiply that 7 by the 4 and I get 28. That was easy!  But youd better not copy my answer! Uh, dont worry Im not gonna copy your answer, cuz I want the RIGHT answer! And I prefer multiplying, so Im going to do THAT first. Lets see 4  5 = 20, and THEN Ill add the 2 which gives me 22 for a final answer. What makes you think THATS the right answer?  All my calculations were correct. I even checked it with a calculator! Pfffff - the only calculator I need is right up here! And the correct answer is boop, boop, boop boop, boop. 22! Okay, so which one of these guys do you think is right?  Neither one made any mistakes with the calculations. They just did the operations in a different order and got DIFFERENT answers! Well since there were no mistakes, in a way, they were BOTH right! But math would be a VERY confusing subject if there were different answers to the same problem. And thats where Order of Operations can help us out. "
,,"The Order of Operations Rules are a way for us all to agree on the order that you should do math operations in. And if we always do operations in the same order, then well always get the same answer. So now that you know WHY we need Order of Operations rules, lets find out what those rules are. Therere basically four of them "
,,"and they go something like this: FIRST: do operation in parentheses and brackets NEXT: do exponents THEN: do multiplication and division LAST: do addition and subtraction Lets take a closer look at each one of these rules, and see some examples where they will help us. First on the list was:  do operations in parentheses and brackets. Now in case you havent seen parentheses or brackets used in math before, let me briefly explain how they work. Parentheses are just these symbols that curve forwards and backwards, and theyre used in pairs like this. And when we put numbers and operators in between them, it forms a group. Its almost like the parentheses form a package to hold whatever math stuff we put inside them. And brackets work exactly the same way as parentheses. They just have a different shape that looks "
,,"a little more boxy, but they mean exactly the same thing. So parentheses and brackets are used to group things together, and our rules tell us to do any operations inside these groups FIRST. For example, have a look at this problem: 10  (4 + 5) It has 3 numbers and 2 operations: multiplication and addition. But 2 of the numbers and the addition symbol are inside parentheses. That means that they form a group and we need to do that part of the problem first. 4 + 5 = 9, so the part inside the parentheses can just be replaced with the simplified value 9. Oh and once you do the math thats inside parentheses and get a single number like this, you usually dont need to show the parentheses anymore. Now that the parentheses are gone, we just have one operation left to do. We multiply 10  9 and that gives us 90 as our final answer. So parentheses can really help you know what part of a problem youre supposed to do first. But what if you get a problem that has more than one set of parentheses, like this:   (5 ? 3) + (6  2) Fortunately, it doesnt matter which set of parentheses you do first. You just need to do everything thats inside the "
,,"parentheses BEFORE you do anything that's NOT inside parentheses. In other words, we need to simplify BOTH of our parentheses groups before we can do this addition IN-BETWEEN them. The first group (5 ? 3) simplifies to 2, and the second group (6  2) simplifies to 12. Now we can do the last operation and add the values that we got from simplifying: 2 + 12 = 14 Okay, now that we know we always do operation in parentheses or brackets FIRST, lets take a closer look at the second rule that says the next thing we do is exponents. Now if you havent seen exponents before, theyre just a way of writing repeated multiplication. For example, the repeated multiplication 4  4 can be written in a shorter form as 4 multiplied twice. And 4  4  4 can be written as 4 multiplied 3 times, and 4  4  4  4 can be written as 4 multiplied 4 times.  get the idea? This small number is called an exponent (or power). It just tells you how many times to multiply the bigger number together. So after we take care of any parentheses, simplifying any exponents becomes the next highest priority. For example in this problem, we have to simplify the exponent BEFORE we can do the other multiplication. The exponent is telling us to multiply 5 together twice.  So 5 times 5 is 25. And after we do that, THEN we multiply the result by 3.  So 25 times 3 is 75. Oh, and one thing I should point out sometimes youll get a problem that has exponents inside of parentheses, like this problem. And you may wonder, How can I get rid of the parentheses BEFORE I do the exponent? You might think that if you simplify the exponent first, youre breaking the rules. But the truth is that by doing whatever operations are inside the parentheses, you ARE doing the parentheses first. The parentheses really just tell you where to start. So in this problem, first we do 3 to the power of 2, which means 3  3 which is 9. Then the part inside the parentheses is 9  4, which equals 36. And once the parentheses are gone, we add 36 + 6 and get 42 as our final answer. Alright, now were gonna look at the last two rules together. These two rules are really important because they deal with the most common math operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication & division. And the rules tell us that we need to do multiplication and "
,,"division BEFORE we do addition and subtraction. To see how these rules work, lets look at a few quick examples that use those basic operations. First lett try this "
,,"one:  2 + 5 + 4  Ah Ha! Does this look familiar? Yep, its the one we gave to my two friends earlier. And now that we have our rules, we see that we have to do the "
,,"multiplication before the addition. 5  4 = 20 and THEN we add the 2, which gives us 22 so the second guy WAS right! [Sarcastically] What a surprise! Now lets try "
,,"this one:  3  5 ? 1 Our rules tell us that multiplication is higher on the list than subtraction, so we do 3  5 first. That gives us 15, and THEN we subtract the 1 which leaves 14 as our final answer. Heres one with division and subtraction: 20 ? 10  5 And since division has a higher priority, we do the 10 divided by 5 first, which equals 2. And then we subtract 2 from 20 and get 18 as our final answer. And heres another problem: 12  6 + 5 Again, our rules say to do the division before addition, so 12 divided by 6 equals 2 and then we add the 5 to get 7. And heres one last problem: 40  4  5 Which do we do first? the multiplication or the division?  Our rules dont tell us. Well, thats because multiplication and division are TIED for priority or importance.  So are addition and subtraction. And THATS "
,,"the reason we need an extra part at the end of each of these rule that says from left to right If you have a problem that has BOTH multiplication AND division, then youre supposed to work it from left to right. Thats because in some cases, you can get a different answers if you go from right to left. For example, in this problem, if you work from right to left (the wrong way) you would do the 4  5 first and get 20. And then 40 divided by 20 equals 2. But if you go from left to right, you would do 40 divided by 4 first, which is 10, and then 10 times 5 equals 50. Wow! The direction we went made a BIG difference. So whenever you have a problem that "
,,"has a mixture of multiplication and division OR a mixture of addition and subtraction, you know to do the operations in order from left to right. Alright, were just about done, but lets have one more look at all four of our rules before you start practicing with the exercises. The Order of Operations rules say: FIRST: do operation in parentheses and brackets NEXT: do exponents THEN: do multiplication and division (from left to right) LAST: do addition and subtraction (from left to right) "

Perimeter,LoaBd-sPzkU,What I want to do in this video
,,is a fairly straightforward primer on perimeter and area. And I'll do perimeter
,,"here on the left, and I'll do area"
,,here on the right. And you're probably pretty
,,"familiar with these concepts, but we'll revisit it"
,,just in case you are not. Perimeter is
,,essentially the distance to go around something
,,or if you were to put a fence around
,,something or if you were to measure-- if you were to
,,"put a tape around a figure, how long that tape would be. So for example, let's"
,,say I have a rectangle. And a rectangle is a figure that
,,has 4 sides and 4 right angles. So this is a
,,"rectangle right here. I have 1, 2, 3, 4 right angles. And it has 4 sides,"
,,and the opposite sides are equal in length. So that side is going to be
,,"equal in length to that side, and that side is equal"
,,in length to that side. And maybe I'll label the
,,"points A, B, C, and D. And let's say we"
,,know the following. And we know that
,,"AB is equal to 7, and we know that"
,,"BC is equal to 5. And we want to know, what"
,,is the perimeter of ABCD? So let me write it down. The perimeter of
,,rectangle ABCD is just going to be equal to the sum
,,"of the lengths of the sides. If I were to build a fence, if"
,,"this was like a plot of land, I would just have"
,,to measure-- how long is this side
,,"right over here? Well, we already know"
,,that's 7 in this color. So it's that side right
,,over there is of length 7. So it'll be 7 plus
,,"this length over here, which is going to be 5. They tell us that. BC is 5. Plus 5. Plus DC is going to"
,,"be the same length is AB, which is"
,,"going to be 7 again. So plus 7. And then finally, DA a or AD,"
,,"however you want to call it, is going to be the same length"
,,"as BC, which is 5 again. So plus 5 again. So you have 7 plus 5 is 12"
,,plus 7 plus 5 is 12 again. So you're going to
,,have a perimeter of 24. And you could go the
,,other way around. Let's say that you
,,"have a square, which is a special case"
,,of a rectangle. A square has 4 sides and 4 right
,,"angles, and all of the sides are equal. So let me draw a square here. My best attempt. So this is A, B, C, D. And"
,,we're going to tell ourselves that this right
,,here is a square. And let's say that this
,,"square has a perimeter. So square has a perimeter of 36. So given that, what is the"
,,"length of each of the sides? Well, all the sides are going"
,,"to have the same length. Let's call them x. If AB is x, then BC is x,"
,,"then DC is x, and AD is x. All of the sides are congruent. All of these segments"
,,are congruent. They all have the same
,,"measure, and we call that x. So if we want to figure"
,,"out the perimeter here, it'll just be x plus x"
,,"plus x plus x, or 4x. Let me write that. x"
,,"plus x plus x plus x, which is equal to 4x, which"
,,is going to be equal to 36. They gave us that
,,"in the problem. And to solve this, 4"
,,"times something is 36, you could solve that"
,,probably in your head. But we could divide
,,"both sides by 4, and you get x is equal to 9. So this is a 9 by 9 square. This width is 9. This is 9, and then the height"
,,right over here is also 9. So that is perimeter. Area is kind of a
,,measure of how much space does this thing take
,,up in two dimensions? And one way to think about area
,,"is if I have a 1-by-1 square, so this is a 1-by-1 square--"
,,"and when I say 1-by-1, it means you only have"
,,to specify two dimensions for a square or a rectangle
,,"because the other two are going to be the same. So for example, you could"
,,call this a 5 by 7 rectangle because that immediately
,,"tells you, OK, this side is 5 and that side is 5. This side is 7,"
,,"and that side is 7. And for a square, you could"
,,say it's a 1-by-1 square because that specifies
,,"all of the sides. You could really say,"
,,"for a square, a square where on one side is 1,"
,,then really all the sides are going to be 1. So this is a 1-by-1 square. And so you can view
,,the area of any figure as how many 1-by-1 squares
,,"can you fit on that figure? So for example, if we were going"
,,"back to this rectangle right here, and I wanted to find out"
,,the area of this rectangle-- and the notation
,,we can use for area is put something in brackets. So the area of rectangle
,,ABCD is equal to the number of 1-by-1 squares we can
,,fit on this rectangle. So let's try to do
,,that just manually. I think you already
,,might get a sense of how to do it a little bit quicker. But let's put a bunch of 1-by-1. So let's see. We have 5 1-by-1 squares
,,this way and 7 this way. So I'm going to try my
,,"best to draw it neatly. So that's 1, 3, 3,"
,,"4, 5, 6, and then 7. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. So going along one of the"
,,"sides, if we just go along one of the sides like"
,,"this, you could put 7 just along one side just like that. And then over here,"
,,how many can we see? We see that's 1 row. And that's 2 rows. Then we have 3 rows and
,,"then 4 rows and then 5 rows. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. And that makes sense because"
,,"this is 1, 1, 1, 1, 1. Should add up to 5. These are 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1. Should add up to 7. Yup, there's 7. So this is 5 by 7. And then you could"
,,"actually count these, and this is kind of straight"
,,forward multiplication. If you want to know the
,,"total number of cubes here, you could count it, or you can"
,,"say, well, I've got 5 rows, 7 columns. I'm going to have 35--"
,,did I say cube-- squares. I have 5 squares in this
,,"direction, 7 in this direction. So I'm going to have"
,,35 total squares. So the area of this figure
,,right over here is 35. And so the general
,,"method, you could just say, well, I'm just going to"
,,take one of the dimensions and multiply it by
,,the other dimension. So if I have a
,,"rectangle, let's say the rectangle is"
,,"1/2 by 1/2 by 2. Those are its dimensions. Well, you could"
,,"just multiply it. You say 1/2 times 2. The area here is going to be 1. And you might say, well,"
,,"what does 1/2 mean? Well, it means,"
,,"in this dimension, I could only fit 1/2"
,,of a 1-by-1 square. So if I wanted to do
,,"the whole 1-by-1 square, it's all distorted here. It would look like that. So I'm only doing half of one. I'm doing another half"
,,of one just like that. And so when you add this
,,"guy and this guy together, you are going to"
,,"get a whole one. Now what about area of a square? Well, a square is"
,,just a special case where the length and
,,the width are the same. So if I have a square--
,,let me draw a square here. And let's call that XYZ-- I
,,"don't know, let's make this S. And let's say I wanted"
,,to find the area and let's say I know
,,"one side over here is 2. So XS is equal to 2, and I"
,,"want to find the area of XYZS. So once again, I"
,,use the brackets to specify the area of this
,,"figure, of this polygon right here, this square. And we know it's a square. We know all the sides are equal. Well, it's a special"
,,case of a rectangle where we would multiply the
,,length times the width. We know that they're
,,"the same thing. If this is 2, then"
,,this is going to be 2. So you just multiply 2 times 2. Or if you want to
,,"think of it, you square it, which is"
,,"where the word comes from-- squaring something. So you multiply 2 times 2,"
,,which is equal to 2 squared. That's where the
,,"word comes from, finding the area of a"
,,"square, which is equal to 4. And you could see"
,,that you could easily fit 4 1-by-1 squares
,,on this 2-by-2 square.
,,
Perimeter,kqqmJiJez6o,I've got a square here. It's right like that. What makes it a square is
,,all of the sides are equal. I haven't gone in depth into
,,"angles yet, but these are at right angles to each other. I'll just draw it like that. That means that if this bottom"
,,"side goes straight left and right, that this left side"
,,will go straight up and down. That's all the right
,,angle really means. Let's say that the side down
,,here is equal to 8 meters. This side right here. And this is a square. And I were to ask you what
,,"is the area of the square? Well, the area is essentially"
,,"how much space the square takes up, let's say, on"
,,your screen right now. So it's essentially a way of
,,measuring how much space something takes up on kind of
,,a two-dimensional surface. A two-dimensional surface would
,,"just be this computer screen or your piece of paper, if you're"
,,also doing this problem. An analogy would be if you had
,,"an 8 meter by 8 meter room, how much carpeting would you need"
,,is kind of the size of the space you need to fill out in
,,two dimensions on some type of surface. So the area here is literally
,,"how much is this size that you're filling up, and it's"
,,very easy to figure out for a square. It's literally going to be your
,,base times your height -- and this is true for any rectangle
,,#NAME?
,,going to be the same number. It's going to be 8 meters. So your area is going to be 8
,,"meters times 8 meters, which is equal to 8 times 8 is 64, and"
,,then your meters times your meters -- you have to do the
,,"same thing with your units -- you get 64 meters squared. Or another way of saying,"
,,this is 64 square meters. You might be asking where
,,"are those 64 square meters? Well, you can actually"
,,break it out here. So let me draw it a
,,little bit bigger than I originally drew it. I probably should have drawn
,,it this big to begin with. So let's say that's
,,my same square. I'm going to draw a little
,,"bit, so let me divide it in the middle. Let me see, I have -- and"
,,we divide them again. Then we divide each side
,,"again just like that. I could probably do it neater. And let me do it one more time. Divide these just like that,"
,,and then divide these just like that. There you go. OK. Now the reason why I did this
,,"is to show you the dimensions along the base and the height. We said this is 8 meters,"
,,"and notice I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 meters. And the same thing"
,,"along this side. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 meters. So when we're talking about"
,,"64 square meters, we're literally counting each"
,,of the square meters. A square meter is a
,,"two-dimensional measurement, that's 1 meter on each side. That's 1 meter, that's 1 meter. What I'm shading here in"
,,yellow is 1 square meter. And you could imagine just
,,counting the square meters. In each row we're going to
,,"have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 square meters. And then we have 8 rows. So we're going to have 8"
,,times 8 square meters or 64 meters square. Which is essentially if you sat
,,"here and just counted each of these, you would count"
,,"64 square meters. Now, what happens if I"
,,were to ask you the perimeter of my square? The perimeter is the distance
,,"you need to go to go around the square. It's not measuring,"
,,"for example, how much carpeting you need. It's measuring, for example, if"
,,you wanted to put a fence around your carpet -- I'm kind
,,of mixing the indoor and outdoor analogies -- it would
,,be how much fencing you would need. So it would be the
,,distance around. So it would be that distance
,,plus that distance plus that distance plus that distance. But we already know this
,,"distance right here on the bottom, we already know"
,,this distance is 8 meters. Then we know that the height
,,right here is 8 meters. It's a square. This distance up here is going
,,to be the same as this distance down here -- it's going
,,to be another 8 meters. Then when you go down the
,,"left hand side it's going to be another 8 meters. We have four sides -- 1, 2, 3,"
,,"4 -- each of them are 8 meters. So you add 8 to itself 4 times,"
,,"that's the same thing as 8 times 4, you get 36 meters. Now notice, when we measured"
,,"just the amount of fencing we needed, we ended up just with"
,,"meters, just with kind of a one-dimensional measurement. That's because we're not"
,,measuring square meters here. We're not measuring how
,,much area we're taking up. We're measuring a distance
,,#NAME?
,,"can imagine straightening out this fence, and it would just"
,,"become one big fence like this, which would have the same"
,,length of 36 meters. So that's why we just have
,,meters there for perimeter. But for area we got square
,,"meters, because we're counting these two-dimensional"
,,"measurements. Now, let's make it a little"
,,bit more interesting. What happens if instead
,,of a square I have a rectangle like this? Let's say that this side
,,over here is 7 centimeters. And let's say that the height
,,right here is 4 centimeters. So what is the area of this
,,rectangle going to be? It's going to be 7
,,times 4 centimeters. 7 centimeters times
,,"4 centimeters. Remember, we could draw 7 rows,"
,,"right, and each of them is going to have 4 square"
,,centimeters -- each of those is a square centimeter. So if you were to count them
,,"all out, you'd have 7 times 4 square centimeters. It's 4 centimeters. So it's equal to 28 centimeters"
,,"square or squared centimeters. What's the perimeter? Well, it's going to be equal to"
,,"this distance down here, which is 7 centimeters, plus this"
,,"distance over here which is 4 centimeters, plus the distance"
,,"on the top -- this is a rectangle, it's going to be"
,,the same distance as this one over here. So plus another 7 centimeters. Then you're going to have this
,,distance on the left hand side. But this distance on the left
,,hand side is the same as this distance right here -- this
,,is also 4 centimeters. So plus another 4 centimeters. And what do you get? You get 7 plus 4 which is
,,"11, and then you have another 7 plus 4. You have 11 plus 11, so"
,,"you have 22 centimeters. Once again, it's not"
,,a square centimeter. Now let's divert -- let's go
,,away from our rectangle analogy or our rectangle examples. So let's see if we can do
,,the same with triangles. So let's say I have
,,a triangle here. I have a triangle like this. Let's say that this distance
,,right here -- actually let me draw it like this. I think this'll make it a
,,little bit easier for you to see how this relates
,,to a rectangle. Let me draw it like this. There you go. That's my triangle. And let's say that this
,,distance right here is 7 centimeters right down there. And let's say that the
,,height of this triangle is 4 centimeters. And I were to ask you what is
,,"the area of the triangle? Well, when we had a rectangle"
,,"like this, we just multiplied 7 times 4. But what would that give us? That would give us the area"
,,"of an entire rectangle. If we did 7 times 4, that"
,,would give us the area of this entire rectangle. You could imagine extending
,,my triangle up like this. This is a right triangle --
,,"this is going straight up and down, this is going straight"
,,"left and right on the bottom right here. It's a 90 degree angle, if"
,,you've been exposed to the idea of angles already. So you could almost view it as
,,"it's 1/2 of this rectangle. Not really almost, it is. Because if you just double this"
,,"guy, you could imagine if you flip this triangle over, you"
,,get the same triangle but it's just upside down
,,and flipped over. So if you think about when you
,,"multiply 7 times 4, you're getting the area of this entire"
,,"rectangle, which we just did up here. But we want to know the"
,,area of the triangle. We want to know just
,,"this area right here. You can see, hopefully, from"
,,this drawing that the area of this triangle is exactly 1/2
,,of the area of the entire rectangle. So the area for a triangle is
,,"equal to the base times the height -- now this so far,"
,,base times height is the area of a rectangle. So in order to get the area of
,,"the triangle, you're going to multiply that times 1/2. So 1/2 base times height. So in our example it's going"
,,to be 1/2 times 7 centimeters times 4 centimeters. We know what 7 times 4 is. We already know it's
,,28 centimeters -- we did that up there. So this right here
,,is 28 centimeters. Then we want centimeters and we
,,want to multiply that by 1/2. So that's going to be 14
,,centimeters just like that. So the area of this triangle
,,"is exactly 1/2 of the area of that rectangle. Now, the perimeter of this"
,,triangle becomes a little bit more complicated because
,,figuring out this distance isn't the easiest
,,"thing in the world. Well, it will be easy for"
,,you once you get exposed to the Pythagorean Theorem. But I'm going to skip
,,that right now. I'm going to leave that for the
,,Pythagorean Theorem video. Let me just give you one
,,more area of a triangle. Let's say I have a triangle
,,that looks like this. This was a very special case
,,that I drew to make it look like half of a rectangle. Let's say we had a triangle
,,that looks like this. It's a little bit more
,,skewed looking like this. And let's say that this
,,distance down here is 3 meters -- that distance is 3 meters. Let's say we don't know what
,,that distance is and we don't know what that distance is. But we do know that if we were
,,to kind of drop a line straight down like this -- if you
,,imagine this was a building or some type of mountain and you
,,"just drop something straight down onto the ground like that,"
,,we know that this distance is equal to -- let's say
,,it's equal to 4 meters. So what is the area of this
,,"triangle going to be? Well, we apply the"
,,same formula. Area is equal to 1/2
,,base times height. So it's equal to 1/2 -- the
,,base is literally this base right here of this triangle. So 1/2 times 3 times the
,,height of the triangle. I guess a better way
,,to think of it is an altitude of the triangle. So this thing isn't even in
,,"the triangle, but it is literally the height. If you imagine this was a"
,,"building, you say how high is the building, it would be"
,,this height right there. So 1/2 times 3 times 4. You use that distance
,,right there. Which is equal to 3 times 4 is
,,12 times 1/2 is equal to 6. We're going to be dealing
,,with square meters. I really want to highlight the
,,"idea, because if I gave you a triangle that looked like this,"
,,"where if this was 3 meters down here, and then if I were to"
,,"tell you that this side over here is 4 meters, this is not"
,,something that you can just apply this formula
,,"to and figure out. In fact, you'd have to know"
,,some of the angles and whatnot to really be able to figure out
,,"the area, or you'd have to know this other side here. So this is not easy. You have to know what the"
,,"altitude or the height of the triangle is. You need to know this distance. In this case, it was one of"
,,"the sides, but in this case it's not one of the sides. You'd have to figure out what"
,,that side right there on the right hand side is in order
,,to apply this formula.
,,
Perimeter,7S1MLJOG-5A,Find the area and
,,perimeter of the polygon. So let's start with
,,the area first. So the area of this
,,"polygon-- there's kind of two parts of this. First, you have this part"
,,"that's kind of rectangular, or it is rectangular,"
,,this part right over here. And that area is
,,pretty straightforward. It's just going to
,,be base times height. So area's going to be 8 times
,,4 for the rectangular part. And then we have this
,,"triangular part up here. So we have this area up here. And for a triangle, the area"
,,is base times height times 1/2. And that actually
,,makes a lot of sense. Because if you just
,,"multiplied base times height, you would get this entire area. You would get the area"
,,of that entire rectangle. And you see that the triangle
,,is exactly 1/2 of it. If you took this
,,"part of the triangle and you flipped it over,"
,,you'd fill up that space. If you took this
,,"part of the triangle and you flipped it over,"
,,you'd fill up that space. So the triangle's area is
,,1/2 of the triangle's base times the triangle's height. So plus 1/2 times
,,"the triangle's base, which is 8 inches, times"
,,"the triangle's height, which is 4 inches. And so let's just calculate it. This gives us 32"
,,"plus-- oh, sorry. That's not 8 times 4. I don't want to confuse you. The triangle's height is 3. 8 times 3, right there. That's the triangle's height. So once again, let's go"
,,back and calculate it. So this is going to be 32
,,plus-- 1/2 times 8 is 4. 4 times 3 is 12. And so our area for our
,,shape is going to be 44. Now let's do the perimeter. The perimeter-- we just
,,have to figure out what's the sum of the sides. How long of a
,,fence would we have to build if we wanted to make
,,"it around this shape, right along the sides of this shape? So the perimeter-- I'll"
,,just write P for perimeter. It's going to be equal to 8 plus
,,"4 plus 5 plus this 5, this edge right over here, plus--"
,,I didn't write that down. So I have two 5's plus
,,"this 4 right over here. So you have 8 plus 4 is 12. 12 plus 10-- well, I'll"
,,just go one step at a time. 12 plus 5 is 17. 17 plus 5 is 22. 22 plus 4 is 26. So the perimeter is 26 inches. And let me get the
,,"units right, too. Because over here, I'm"
,,"multiplying 8 inches by 4 inches. So you get square inches. 8 inches by 3 inches, so"
,,you get square inches again. So this is going to
,,be square inches. So area is 44 square inches. Perimeter is 26 inches. And that makes
,,sense because this is a two-dimensional
,,measurement. It's measuring something
,,"in two-dimensional space, so you get a"
,,two-dimensional unit. This is a one-dimensional
,,"measurement. It's only asking you,"
,,"essentially, how long would a string have to be to"
,,go around this thing. And so that's why you get
,,one-dimensional units.
,,
Perimeter,AAY1bsazcgM,"Hi! Welcome to Math Antics. In this lesson, were going to learn about an important concept in Geometry called Perimeter. Perimeter is just a fancy math term that "
,,means the distance (or length) around a shape. ...but
,,what exactly does the distance around a shape mean? Well... distance (or length) is a 1-dimensional quantity that we can measure with units like
,,"centimeters, inches or miles. That means that perimeter is also a 1-dimensional quantity that we can measure with units of length. For example, the perimeter of a shape wouldnt be just 10, but it could be 10 cm. Or, instead of being just 25, it could be 25 miles. The units are REALLY important"
,,"when youre talking about perimeter! Okay, but what exactly do we mean by,"
,,around a shape? It seems like there would be a lot of different ways
,,to go around a shape. Some of them would be short
,,"and some of them would be very long. Well, perimeter means the absolute shortest distance possible around a shape. That would be the distance youd get if you traced the path exactly around the border (or edge) of a shape. A good way to see what perimeter is, is to imagine that you could walk right along the edge of a shape, like this 5-sided polygon. Imagine starting at one of the polygons vertices and then walking along each side until you got all the way back to the point that you started from. The total distance you traveled would be the perimeter of that shape. In this case, if the length of each side of the polygon was 10 meters, the total length you would travel along all 5 sides would add up to 50 meters. Another good way to see what perimeter is, is to imagine that you could take a shape, like this square, and break it at one of its corners. Then, you could unfold the shape until it formed a straight line.  The length of that line is the perimeter of the shape. Doing this helps you understand why perimeter is a 1-dimensional quantity, even though it applies to 2-dimensional shapes like this square. Its 1-dimensional because its the distance of the lines that go around the 2-dimensional shape. Okay, so now that you know what perimeter is, how do we measure or calculate it for different geometric shapes? Well... that depends on the shapes. Finding the perimeter of shapes that have curves, like circles or hearts or things like that, can be tricky. In fact, well wait and talk about the perimeter of a circle in another video. In this video, were just going to focus on how to find the perimeter of polygons. Since polygons are made from only straight sides, its easy to find their perimeter. If you know the length of each side, all you have to do is add them up, and the total length you end up with is the perimeter of the polygon. Lets try doing that with a few examples so you see how it works... the first polygon well try is a triangle. "
,,"This triangle has three sides that are each a different length: 3cm, 4cm and 5cm. Now, to find the perimeter of the triangle, all we have to do is add up the lengths of those three sides. 3 + 4 + 5 = 12 But dont forget.  Its not just 12. Its 12 centimeters. Always remember to also put down the units of the perimeter. Okay, that was easy.  Lets try another one. This time our polygon is a rectangle.  And you can see that the shorter sides are each 5m long and the longer sides are each 10m long. So... lets add them all up. We can add up the sides in any order we want to, as long as we dont forget any sides or accidentally count any of them twice. And I think Ill add up the two short sides first. 5 + 5 = 10 Next, Ill add up the two longer sides. 10 + 10 = 20 And now, if I add up those two answers, Ill get the total for all 4 sides. 10 + 20 = 30 So, the perimeter of this rectangle is 30 METERS! Ha!  You thought I was going to forget my units, didnt you. Not this time! Ah, heres another good example. This is a 6-sided regular polygon. A regular polygon means that all its sides are exactly the same length. Thats good because this diagram only shows the length of ONE side. (4 cm). But since the polygon is regular, we know that all the sides must also be 4 cm long. Now, we could just add up "
,,"all the sides like we did before, but since they are all the same, we can use multiplication as a shortcut. Thats because multiplication is really just repeated addition. All we have to do is multiply the number of sides (6) by the length of the sides (4 cm). 6 x 4 = 24 so that means the total perimeter must be 24. 24 what?    "
,,"                                 . Ooo - Centimeters !!! Thats better.                            . And this formula works for ANY regular polygon, no matter how many sides there are. If the sides are ALL THE SAME LENGTH,  you can just multiply the number of sides by the side length, and you have the perimeter! Okay, let's try "
,,one more example. This polygon also has six sides but its NOT a regular polygon. The sides are different lengths and this ones really tricky because they only show us
,,the length of four of the sides. The other two are missing!
,,"So how can we figure them out? Problems like this come up all the time in math; problems where you arent quite given all the information. When you have this kind of problem, the key is to use what you DO know to figure out what you DONT know.  Heres what I mean... Look closely at the two vertical sides that we DO know the lengths of (4 inches and 6 inches) Now... imagine that those two vertical sides could be moved straight across to the other side... the side that we dont know the length of. By doing that, you can see that the missing length would just be the combination of the two vertical lengths we DO know: 4 inches and 6 inches. And since 4 + "
,,"6 = 10, the missing vertical side must be 10 inches long. Notice that we can do the same thing for the horizontal sides that we do know. If we imagine those moving down to the side that we dont know, we see that its length must equal the combination of those two lengths. 10 inches plus 5 inches equals 15 inches. There, weve used the lengths that we DID know to figure out the lengths that we DIDNT know. And now that we know the length of ALL the sides, we can just add them all up to get "

Perimeter,gL3HxBQyeg0,Let's find the volume of
,,a few more solid figures and then if we
,,"have time, we might be able to do some"
,,surface area problems. So let me draw a
,,cylinder over here. So that is the top
,,of my cylinder. And then this is the
,,height of my cylinder. This is the bottom
,,right over here. If this was
,,"transparent, maybe you could see the back"
,,side of the cylinder. So you could imagine this
,,kind of looks like a soda can. And let's say that the height of
,,"my cylinder, h, is equal to 8. I'll give it some units. 8 centimeters,"
,,that is my height. And then let's say
,,that the radius of one of the top of my
,,"cylinder of my soda can, let's say that this radius over"
,,here is equal to 4 centimeters. So what is the volume here? What is the volume going to be? And the idea here is
,,really the exact same thing that we saw in some of
,,the previous problems. If you can find the
,,surface area of one side and then figure out
,,"how deep it goes, you'll be able to"
,,figure out the volume. So what we're going to
,,do here is figure out the surface area of the
,,"top of this cylinder, or the top of the soda can. And then we're going to"
,,multiply it by its height. And that'll give us a volume. This will tell us
,,"essentially, how many square centimeters"
,,fit in this top. And then if we multiply
,,"that by how many centimeters we go down, then that'll"
,,give us the number of cubic centimeters in
,,this cylinder or soda can. So how do we figure
,,out this area up here? Well the area at the
,,"top, this is just finding the area of a circle. You could imagine"
,,drawing it like this. If we were to just
,,"look at it straight on, that's a circle with a"
,,radius of 4 centimeters. The area of a circle with a
,,"radius 4 centimeters, area is equal to pi r squared. So it's going to be pi"
,,"times the radius squared, times 4 centimeters squared,"
,,"which is equal to 4 squared, is 16, times pi. And our units now are going"
,,to be centimeters squared. Or another way to think of
,,these are square centimeters. So that's the area. The volume is going to be
,,this area times the height. So the volume is going
,,"to be equal to 16 pi centimeters squared, times the"
,,"height, times 8 centimeters. And so, when you"
,,"do multiplication, the associative"
,,"property, you can kind of rearrange these things, and"
,,the commutative property. It doesn't matter
,,what order you do it if it's all multiplication. So this is the same
,,thing as 16 times 8. Let's see. 8 times 8 is 64. 16 times 8 is twice that. So it's going to be 128 pi. Now you have centimeter
,,squared times centimeters. So that gives us
,,"centimeters cubed. Or 128 pi cubic centimeters. Remember, pi is just a number. We write it as pi,"
,,"because it's kind of a crazy, irrational number,"
,,"that if you were to write it, you could never"
,,completely write pi. 3.14159 keeps going
,,"on, never a repeat. So we just leave it as pi. But if you wanted to figure it"
,,"out, you can get a calculator. And this would be 3.14"
,,"roughly, times 128. So it would be close to"
,,"400 cubic centimeters. Now, how would we"
,,find the surface area? How would we find the surface
,,"area of this figure over here? Well, part of the surface area"
,,"of the two surfaces, the top and the bottom. So that would be part"
,,of the surface area. And then the bottom
,,over here would also be part of the surface area. So if we're trying to
,,"find the surface area, it's definitely going to have"
,,both of these areas here. So it's going to have the 16
,,pi centimeters squared twice. This is 16 pi. This is 16 pi
,,square centimeters. So it's going to have 2 times
,,16 pi centimeters squared. I'll keep the units still. So that covers the top and
,,the bottom of our soda can. And now we have to
,,figure out the surface area of this thing
,,that goes around. And the way I imagine
,,"it is, imagine if you're trying to wrap this"
,,thing with wrapping paper. So let me just draw a
,,little dotted line here. So imagine if you were
,,to cut it just like that. Cut the side of the soda can. And if you were to
,,"unwind this thing that goes around it,"
,,"what would you have. Well, you would have something. You would end up"
,,with a sheet of paper where this length
,,right over here is the same thing as
,,this length over here. And then it would be
,,completely unwound. And then these two
,,ends-- let me do it in magenta-- these two ends
,,used to touch each other. And-- I'm going to do it in a
,,"color that I haven't used yet, I'll do it in pink--"
,,these two ends used to touch each other when
,,it was all rolled together. And they used to touch each
,,other right over there. So the length of this
,,side and that side is going to be the same thing
,,as the height of my cylinder. So this is going to
,,be 8 centimeters. And then this over here is
,,also going to be 8 centimeters. And so the question
,,"we need to ask ourselves is, what is"
,,"going to be this dimension right over here. And remember, that"
,,"dimension is essentially, how far did we go"
,,"around the cylinder. Well, if you think"
,,"about it, that's going to be the exact same"
,,thing as the circumference of either the top or the
,,bottom of the cylinder. So what is the circumference? The circumference
,,"of this circle right over here, which is the same"
,,"thing as the circumference of that circle over there, it"
,,"is 2 times the radius times pi. Or 2 pi times the radius. 2 pi times 4 centimeters, which"
,,is equal to 8 pi centimeters. So this distance right over
,,here is the circumference of either the top or the
,,bottom of the cylinder. It's going to be
,,8 pi centimeters. So if you want to
,,"find the surface area of just the wrapping,"
,,"just the part that goes around the cylinder,"
,,"not the top or the bottom, when you unwind it, it's going"
,,"to look like this rectangle. And so its area, the"
,,"area of just that part, is going to be equal to"
,,8 centimeters times 8 pi centimeters. So let me do it this way. It's going to be 8 centimeters
,,times 8 pi centimeters. And that's equal to 64 pi. 8 times 8 is 64. You have your pi
,,centimeters squared. So when you want the surface
,,"area of the whole thing, you have the top,"
,,"you have the bottom, we already threw those there. And then you want to find"
,,the area of the thing around. We just figured that out. So it's going to be plus
,,64 pi centimeters squared. And now we just have
,,to calculate it. So this gives us 2 times 16
,,"pi, is going to be equal to 32. That is 32 pi centimeters"
,,"squared, plus 64 pi. Let me scroll over to"
,,the right a little bit. Plus 64 pi centimeters squared. And then 32 plus 64 is 96
,,pi centimeters squared. So it's equal to 96 pi
,,"square centimeters, which is going to be a little bit"
,,"over 300 square centimeters. And notice, when we"
,,"did surface area, we got our answer in terms"
,,"of square centimeters. That makes sense,"
,,"because surface area, it's a two-dimensional"
,,measurement. Think about how many
,,square centimeters can we fit on the surface
,,"of the cylinder. When we did the volume,"
,,"we got centimeters cubed, or cubic centimeters. And that's because we're"
,,trying to calculate how many one by one
,,by one centimeter cubes can we fit inside
,,of this structure. And so that's why it's
,,"cubic centimeters. Anyway, hopefully that clarifies"
,,things up a little bit.
,,
Perimeter,1uWZNW5PF-s,Here's an interesting
,,problem involving perimeter from the 2000 American
,,Invitational Mathematics Exam. So it says the diagram
,,shows a rectangle that has been dissected into
,,"nine overlapping squares. So one, two, three, four,"
,,"five, six, seven, eight, nine overlapping squares. Given that the width and"
,,the height of the rectangle are positive integers with
,,greatest common divisor 1-- so they're talking about
,,the width and the height of the rectangle. And the reason why they're
,,saying greatest common divisor 1 is they're saying that they
,,don't have a common divisor that you can divide them both by
,,to get a more simplified ratio. And to think about
,,"that is, we might be faced with two choices,"
,,one where maybe it's this side over here is-- let me
,,"draw it like this-- 5 and 15. But over here, our greatest"
,,common divisor isn't 1. They're both divisible
,,by 5 over here. So what you'd want
,,"to do is say, no. Instead of 5 and 15,"
,,they need to be 1 and 3. Now you have the
,,"same ratio of sides, but now their greatest"
,,common divisor is 1. You kind of have it in the
,,simplified form or the most simplified form if you divide
,,both this height and this width by 5. So that's why they're saying
,,"greatest common divisor 1. And then they say, find the"
,,perimeter of the rectangle. So let's see what
,,we can do here. And I encourage you to pause
,,it and try to do it on your own before I bumble my way
,,through this problem. So let's start in the beginning. Let's start at this square right
,,"over here, the center square. And they did tell us"
,,that they're all squares. So let's say that that square
,,"right over here has a length x and a height x. It's an x by x square. So let me write it. So this is an x,"
,,and that is an x. So this is an x by x
,,square right over there. And then you have this
,,square right over here. And we don't know
,,its measurements. So let's say that this square
,,"right over here is y by y. So it has y width, and"
,,"it also has y height. Now, what is this"
,,"square over here? Well, this is an x"
,,"plus y by an x plus y square, because the width"
,,of these two squares combined made the width of
,,this larger square. So what I'm going
,,"to do is-- actually, this might be an"
,,easier way to write it. Since these are all
,,"squares, I'm going to write the dimension of"
,,that square inside the square. So this is going to
,,be an x by x square. Kind of a
,,"non-conventional notation, but it'll help us keep"
,,things a little bit neat. This is going to
,,be a y by y square. So I'm not saying the area is y. I'm saying it's y by y. This over here is going
,,to be an x plus y times-- an x plus y is going to
,,be each of its dimensions. So it's going to be x plus
,,"y height and x plus y width. Then this one over here-- well,"
,,if this dimension is x plus y and this dimension
,,"right over here is x, then this whole side or"
,,any of the sides of the square are going to be the sum of that. So x plus x plus y is 2x plus y. You can imagine that
,,I'm just labeling the left side of each
,,of these squares. The left side of this
,,"square has length y. Left side of this one, x. This one has x plus y. And then this is 2x plus y. And then we can go"
,,"do this one up here. Well, if this distance"
,,right over here is 2x plus y and this distance right
,,"over here is x plus y, you add them together to"
,,get the entire dimension of one side of the square. So it's going to be 3x plus 2y. I've just added the 2x
,,plus the x and the y plus the y to get 3x plus 2y
,,is the length of one dimension or one side of this square. And they're all the same. Now let's go to
,,"this next square. Well, if this length is"
,,"3x plus 2y and this length is 2x plus y, then this"
,,entire length right over here is going to be 5x plus 3y. 5x plus 3y is going to be that
,,entire length right over there. And we can also go to
,,this side right over here where we have this length--
,,let me do that same color. This length is 3x plus 2y. This is x plus y. And this is y. So if you add 3x plus
,,"2y plus x plus y plus y, you get 4x plus-- what"
,,"is that-- 4y, right? 2y, 3y, 4y. And then we can express"
,,this character's dimensions in terms of x and y because
,,this is going to be 5x plus 3y. Then you're going
,,"to have 2x plus y. And then you're going to have x. So you add the x's together. 5x plus 2x is 7x, plus x is 8x. And then you add the"
,,"y's together, 3y plus y, and then you don't"
,,have a y there. So that's going to be plus 4y. That's the dimensions
,,"of this square. And then finally, we have"
,,this square right over here. Its dimensions are going to
,,be the y plus the 4x plus 4y. So that's 4x plus 5y. And then if we think
,,about the dimensions of this actual
,,"rectangle over here, if we think about its"
,,"height right over there, that's going to be 5x"
,,plus 3y plus 8x plus 4y. So 5 plus 8 is 13. So it's 13x plus 3 plus 4 is 7y. So that's its height. But we can also think
,,about its height by going on the
,,other side of it. And maybe this will give
,,us some useful constraints because this is
,,going to have to be the same length
,,as this over here. And so if we add 4x
,,"plus 4x, we get 8x. And then if we add 4y"
,,"plus 5y, we get 9y. So these are going to have"
,,"to be equal to each other, so that's an"
,,interesting constraint. So we have 13x plus 7y is going
,,to have to equal 8x plus 9y. And we can simplify this. If you subtract 8x from
,,"both sides, you get 5x. And if you subtract"
,,"7y from both sides, you get 5x is equal to 2y. Or you could say x"
,,is equal to 2/5 y. In order for these to
,,"show up as integers, we have to pick integers here. But let's see if we have any"
,,other interesting constraints if we look at the bottom
,,"and the top of this, if this gives us any"
,,more information. So if we add 5x plus 3y plus
,,"3x plus 2y plus 4x plus 4y, this top dimension-- 5"
,,plus 3 is 8 plus 4 is 12. You get 12x. And then you get
,,"3y plus 2y plus 4y. So that's 5 plus 4. That's 9y. Plus 9y. That's this top dimension. And if you go down here,"
,,you have 8 plus 4 is 12x. Let me do that same color. And then you have 4
,,"plus 5 is 9y, plus 9y. So these actually ended up to"
,,"be the same in terms of x and , so they're not giving"
,,"us any more information, no more constraints. Obviously, 12x plus 9y is going"
,,to be equal to 12x plus 9y. So our only constraint
,,on this problem is what we got by setting
,,"this left-hand side to this right-hand side, is that"
,,x needs to be equal to 2/5 y. So let's just pick
,,some numbers so that we get nice
,,integers for x and y and then we figure
,,out the perimeter. We want to make sure
,,"that the dimensions don't have any common divisors. So if we pick y to be 5, so"
,,"let's pick y to be equal to 5, then looking at this"
,,"constraint, what is x? Well, then x is 2. It's going to be 2/5 times 5. So then x is equal to 2. So let's see what we get for"
,,the dimensions of this rectangle then. So the height of
,,this rectangle is going to be 13 times 2 is
,,"26, plus 7 times 5 is 35. So 26 plus 35 gets us what. That gets us to 61. This is equal to 61. Did I do that right? You see the 55 plus 6 is 61. And then when you   "
,,"look at its width, you have 12x, which"
,,"is 24, plus 9y. y Is 5, so plus 45. 24 plus 45 is what? That is 69. And 61 and 69 do not share any"
,,common divisors other than 1. So it looks like we're
,,"done, or we're almost done. We know the dimensions"
,,of the rectangle. It is a 61 by 69 rectangle. And if you want its
,,"actual perimeter, you just add them all up. So the perimeter"
,,here is going to be-- we could have a drum roll now. The perimeter is
,,"going to be 61 plus 69 plus 61 plus 69, which is equal"
,,"to-- well, 61 plus 69 is 130. That's another 130 right there. 130 plus 130 is 260. So it actually wasn't"
,,too bad of a problem if we just started at the middle
,,"and just built up from there, built up the dimensions in terms"
,,of the dimensions of these two smallest squares. And then we were able
,,to find the perimeter.
,,
Perimeter,UKQ65tiIQ6o,Let's say that this
,,"triangle right over here is equilateral, which"
,,means all of its sides have the same length. And let's say that
,,that length is s. What I want to do in
,,this video is come up with a way of
,,figuring out the area of this equilateral
,,"triangle, as a function of s. And to do that, I'm"
,,just going to split this equilateral in two. I'm just going to drop an
,,altitude from this top vertex right over here. This is going to be
,,perpendicular to the base. And it's also going to
,,bisect this top angle. So this angle is going to
,,be equal to that angle. And we showed all
,,of this in the video where we proved
,,the relationships between the sides of
,,"a 30-60-90 triangle. Well, in a regular equilateral"
,,"triangle, all of the angles are 60 degrees. So this one right over here"
,,"is going to be 60 degrees, let me do that in"
,,a different color. This one down here is
,,going to be 60 degrees. This one down here is
,,going to be 60 degrees. And then this one up
,,"here is 60 degrees, but we just split it in two. So this angle is going"
,,to be 30 degrees. And then this angle is
,,going to be 30 degrees. And then the other
,,thing that we know is that this altitude
,,right over here also will bisect
,,this side down here. So that this length is
,,equal to that length. And we showed all of this a
,,"little bit more rigorously on that 30-60-90 triangle video. But what this tells us is well,"
,,"if this entire length was s, because all three sides"
,,"are going to be s, it's an equilateral"
,,"triangle, then each of these, so this"
,,"part right over here, is going to be s/2. And if this length"
,,"is s/2, we can use what we know about"
,,30-60-90 triangles to figure out this
,,side right over here. So to figure out what
,,the actual altitude is. And the reason why I
,,care about the altitude is because the
,,area of a triangle is 1/2 times the base times the
,,"height, or times the altitude. So this is s/2,"
,,the shortest side. The side opposite the
,,30 degree angle is s/2. Then the side opposite
,,the 60 degree angle is going to be square
,,root of 3 times that. So it's going to be
,,square root of 3 s over 2. And we know that
,,because the ratio of the sides of a 30-60-90
,,"triangle, if the side opposite the 30"
,,"degree side is 1, then the side opposite"
,,the 60 degree side is going to be square
,,root of 3 times that. And the side opposite the 90
,,"degree side, or the hypotenuse, is going to be 2 times that. So it's 1 to square"
,,root of 3 to 2. So this is the shortest
,,side right over here. That's the side opposite
,,the 30 degree side. The side opposite
,,the 60 degree side is going to be square
,,root of 3 times this. So square root of 3 s over 2. So now we just
,,need to figure out what the area of this triangle
,,"is, using area of our triangle is equal to 1/2 times the"
,,"base, times the height of the triangle. Well, what is the"
,,"base of the triangle? Well, the entire base of the"
,,triangle right over here is s. So that is going to be s. And what is the height
,,"of the triangle? Well, we just figured that out. It is the square root"
,,of 3 times s over 2. And we just multiply
,,"that out, and we get, let's see, in the numerator you"
,,get a square root of 3 times 1 times s times s. That is the square root
,,"of 3 times s squared. And the denominator,"
,,"we have a 2 times a 2. All of that over 4. So for example, if you have"
,,an equilateral triangle where each of the sides
,,"was 1, then its area would be square"
,,root of 3 over 4. If you had an equilateral
,,triangle where each of the sides
,,"were 2, then this would be 2 squared over"
,,"4, which is just 1. So it would just be"
,,square root of 3. So we just found out
,,a generalizable way to figure out the area of
,,an equilateral triangle.
,,
Perimeter,9uwLgf84p5w,When people use the
,,"word ""perimeter"" in everyday language,"
,,they're talking about the boundary of some area. And when we talk about
,,"perimeter in math, we're talking about"
,,a related idea. But now we're not just
,,talking about the boundary. We're actually talking about
,,the length of the boundary. How far do you have to
,,go around the boundary to essentially go completely
,,"around the figure, completely go around the area? So let's look at this first"
,,"triangle right over here. It has three sides. That's why it's a triangle. So what's its perimeter? Well, here, all the"
,,"sides are the same, so the perimeter"
,,for this triangle is going to be 4 plus 4 plus
,,"4, and whatever units this is. If this is 4 feet,"
,,"4 feet and 4 feet, then it would be 4 feet"
,,"plus 4 feet plus 4 feet is equal to 12 feet. Now, I encourage you"
,,to now pause the video and figure out the parameters
,,"of these three figures. Well, it's the exact same idea. We would just add the"
,,lengths of the sides. So let's say that
,,"these distances, let's say they're in meters. So let's say this is 3 meters,"
,,"and this is also 3 meters. This is a rectangle here,"
,,so this is 5 meters. This is also 5 meters. So what is the perimeter of
,,this rectangle going to be? What is the distance
,,"around the rectangle that bounds this area? Well, it's going to"
,,"be 3 plus 5 plus 3 plus 5, which is"
,,"equal to-- let's see, that's 3 plus 3 is 6,"
,,plus 5 plus 5 is 10. So that is equal to 16. And if we're saying
,,"these are all in meters, these are all in meters, then"
,,"it's going to be 16 meters. Now, what about this pentagon? Let's say that each"
,,of these sides are 2-- and I'll make up a unit here. Let's say they're 2 gnus. That's a new unit of
,,distance that I've just invented-- 2 gnus. So what is the perimeter
,,"of this pentagon in gnus? Well, it's 2 plus 2 plus"
,,2 plus 2 plus 2 gnus. Or we're essentially
,,"taking 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 sides. Each have a length of 2 gnus. So the perimeter here, we could"
,,add 2 repeatedly five times. Or you could just say this
,,"is 5 times 2 gnus, which is equal to 10 gnus,"
,,where gnu is a completely made-up unit of length
,,that I just made up. Here we have a more irregular
,,"polygon, but same exact idea. How would you figure"
,,"out its perimeter? Well, you just add up"
,,the lengths of its sides. And here I'll just
,,do it unitless. I'll just assume that this
,,is some generic units. And here the perimeter
,,will be 1 plus 4 plus 2 plus 2-- let me
,,scroll over to the right a little bit-- plus 4 plus 6. So what is this
,,"going to be equal to? 1 plus 4 is 5, plus 2 is 7,"
,,"plus 2 is 9, plus 4 is 13, plus 6 is 19. So this figure has"
,,a perimeter of 19 in whatever units these
,,distances are actually given.

Perimeter,XxPw1uieViU,hello grade 8 children today I'm here to teach you a geometry lesson with you that's chapter 2 perimeter so what is perimeter so we'll take figures like this what's 
,,this one a triangle circle a square so these are called closed plane figures when you take one place you can go round and come to the same position in this one also 
,,you can start from any place and come to the same position so we call these a plane closed figures or closed plane figures then what about these figures these are open plane figures so we are finding perimeter perimeter of closed plane figures so what is perimeter means the outer distance of a closed plane figure so when you start from here any place you can come to the same position here so you take the total distance so we'll see what are the properties in perimeter and we'll take several plane figures in this lesson so perimeter is the total length of the boundary of a closed rectilinear plane figure is called the perimeter of the figure units of perimeter what are the units so this is about a length so we use measurements as length so what are the measurements we use for length millimeter centimeter meter and 
,,kilometer so what's the relationship between these measurements so you know when you take the small ruler so one centimeter is equal to ten millimeters and when you 
,,take the meter ruler you can divide into hundred parts that means 100 centimeter is 1 meter then if you take kilometers that's thousand meters is equal to one kilometer now select the appropriate units according to the size of the figure so if you want to measure a smaller length you take some times millimeter centimeters a bigger length meters so when you take distance of a rod or something bigger ones we use kilometres so you need to know which one to choose now what's the shape a square 
,,square means all sides are equal and this is four-sided figure each angle is 90 degrees so if you want to find out the perimeter of this figure so we start from one 
,,place go round and come to the same posture so what's the perimeter of this square if the length of one side is L so it's easy we take letters for words like length 
,,we can take L letter perimeter we can take peel it so if one side is L so starting from here L plus L plus L plus L so these are like terms you can add L for times when you are adding you get full L so what's the perimeter of the square if you know one side is L for L so we can use this formula to find out the perimeter of a square we'll use that one in this question find the perimeter of a square with length 12 now we know L is 12 we need to find out P P stands for perimeter so we can use 
,,the formula for L that means 4 times L L is 12 4 times 12 you get 48 what's the unit that's centi meters look at the second question find the perimeter of a square plot of land where one side is 20 meters now L is 20 at least 20 P we need to find so you can use the formula for L 4 times 20 that's 80 what's the unit meter so we can put 80 meters this one find the perimeter of a square board with side lengths to 0.3 meters so L is 2.3 PE we need to find use the formula for L 4 times 2.3 how we multiply 4 times 3 12 one remaining and 4 times 2 8 + 1 9 that's in meters so nine point two meters the perimeter of a square shape land is 48 meters find the length of one side now the other way around giver so perimeter is given P is given 48 and you're asked to find out L so we can find length of one side that's L is the total perimeter is 48 how you find one side you have to divide by four because P equals four L if you want to find L you divide by four to get n so P divided by four 48 divided by 4 you get the length of one side four times 1/4 and here to 12 meters the perimeter of a square cardboard is 88.8 centimeters find the length of one side again how you find out length of one side I can write L equals P over 4 P is given 88.8 centimeters and you need to find out so P is 88.8 divided by 4 so you get twenty two point two centimeters for length off one side look at this one find the length of one side of a square where the perimeter is 64 point four same thing P is given 64 point four and you are asked to find out the lid so a length of one side is P 64 point four divided by four have you divide four times one for two remaining four twenty four that's four times six twenty four and four times 1/4 so you get this is in sin T meters now what's this shape this is called a rectangle so pair of opposite sides are equal so we called the longer length longer side we called along the side as left shorter man as brick so L stands for length and B stands for bread or sometimes we call wick so how we find out the perimeter of a rectangle now starting from this place L plus B plus L plus B L plus B plus L plus B you can add like terms too well plus 2b now we see that two is common so you can take it out and inside I can write L plus B so I can explain this one as if you separate these 
,,two lengths what you get yeah I want to find out the length of this part that's L plus V I get two parts like that so L plus B here and L plus B this side so twice of that twice of L plus B so you can use this formula to find out the perimeter of a rectangle look at this one find the perimeter of a rectangular plot of 18 meters 
,,long and 14 meters wide so that means L is 18 B is 14 and you're asked to find the perimeter so what's the formula two times L plus B substitute L is 18 B is 42 times at these 2 8 plus 4 12 and 32 when you multiply you get 64 meters find the perimeter of the rectangle which is 24 meters long and 18 meters wide 24 is L breakfast 
,,18 and perimeter you need to find you can use the formula now substitute 24 plus 18 add these 2 8 plus 4 12 1 remaining 3 plus 1 4 2 times 42 84 but the unit meters 
,,look at this one find the perimeter of the rectangle with the length of 12 point 7 at least 12 point 7 and a width of 9.2 so what's the formula 2 L plus b2 times L twelve point seven and nine point two just add the decimal values it's easy to write in a column and add 7 plus 2 9 9 plus 2 11 so twenty one point nine so two times 
,,twenty one point nine have you multiplied ignore the decimal and first x - 2 times 9 18 one remaining 2 times 1/2 plus 1/3 2 times 2 4 then one decimal place you have to keep so I can keep here so forty three point eight meters a rectangular flowerbed is 7.2 meters long and three point four meters wide find the parameter L is the longer side seven point two why breath with me the width three point four P is the parameter we need to find so what's the formula two times length plus breadth two times here seven point two plus three point four add it together seven point two and three point four when you add it you get ten point six ten point six times two here brackets means multiplication two times six twelve one remaining so here two times one two so put a decimal point here and you are getting twenty one point two meters as the perimeter of this rectangular flowerbed the length of a rectangular piece of land is three times its width so if it's X this should be 3x find its length and breadth if the perimeter is 88 so what we can write in this 3x B is X so we need to find out the perimeter so use the formula P equals 2 times L plus B so parameter is given 88 so I can write this is 88 so here I can substitute 88 here so 2 times L is 3 X I break this X now like terms add 2 times 3 X plus X is 4 X is 88 
,,4 times 2 8 8 X equals 88 how can we find out X you divide by 8 so X is equal to 88 divided by 8 that's in a van meters so X is 11 meter so you ask to find its length and brick so what's length length is 3 X that means 3 times 11 33 what's the breath breath is equal to X that's 11 meters the length of a rectangular piece of land is 4 times its width find its length and breadth if the perimeter is 400 meters now if breadth is X this is 4 times that means 4x what's the perimeter 400 that's given so now you can use the form in a perimeter is equal to 2 times L plus B here this side we can write because this is the unknown side X we need to find 2 times 4 
,,"X plus X is 400 for X and X you get 5 X 2 times 5x 402 times 5 is 10 X is 400 divided by 10 you can get X so x equals 40 now X is 40 means what's the length length is 4 X that means 4 times 40 that's 160 centimeters no 160 meters breath is X that's 40 meters look at this one how many square float eyes with a side length 40 centimeters are required to fit a rectangular flow that is 12 meters and 6 meters what now we'll look at the length side what's the length 12 meters now the length of one side of a tile is given in centimeters so this is in meters so what's the first thing you can convert to the same unit we'll convert meters to centimeters length is 12 meters convert to centimeters there you need to multiply by 100 100 times 12 1,200 centimeters the number of floor tiles required for the length side if you keep tires this way only lengths side how many tiles we need the length of a tile is 40 centimeters so we need to divide by 40 take the length in centimeters divided by "
,,one side of the tire for you get thirty tiles along this side you need what about with now now you need to fit this way the width is 6 meters convert to centimeters 
,,this is 600 multiplied by hundred now how many tiles along the width you need 600 divided by 40 40 is the length of one tire you get 60 divided by 4 is 15 tiles we need this way so this way we need 15 tiles now what's the total number of tiles you need you need here this side 30 this side 15 30 times 15 so multiply by 3 putting 
,,0 3 times 5 15 3 times 1/3 plus 1/4 all together 450 tiles you need now this is one method of finding number of tiles but you can use another method what's the second method by finding the area of a tile so you can find the area of the flow and area of fun tile and divide now in this case you can use this but if it's a circular 
,,tile or something you can't use the area method because that's not fitting exactly with the flow you get gaps there so make sure that this way is easy to do for any 
,,type of tile this one how many square flow tiles with a side length 20 are required to fit a rectangular flow that is 10 meters long and 4 meters wide similar question so what's the length they are 10 meters convert to centimeters because the tie length is in centimeters so multiply by 100 you get thousand centimeters so what's 
,,the number of ties required for the length side you take the limp divided by length off one tile that's 20 you get 50 tiles you need what's the width 4 meters convert to centimeters that's 400 centimeters so how many tiles required for which side take the length divided by length of one tile that's 400 so you get 20 tiles you need so this way length side how many tiles 50 tiles and here 20 tiles so altogether you need fifty times twenty so thousand tiles you need for this flow this question find the breadth of the rectangle if the perimeter is 120 and the length is 36 and you need to be what's the formula perimeter of a rectangle tone times L plus B is equal to P now substitute to 36 plus B we need to find out B P is hundred 20 so divide the whole equation by 2 you get 36 plus B is equal to 120 divided by 2 you get 60 now how you find B subtract 36 from both sides so subtract 36 60 minus 36 so what's 60 minus 36 4 and your 4 5 6 24 is the answer what's the answer with units 24 meters so that's the breadth of this rectangle look at this question if the perimeter of a rectangle with a length 48 meters is hundred forty meters find its width so length is 48 perimeter is 140 you are asked to find B so you know the formula 2 into L plus B is P now substitute to 48 is L plus B is equal 240 divide the whole equation by 2 to get cancel out you get 48 plus B equals 70 140 divided by 2 now how we find B subtract 40 8 from both sides so subtraction means you subtract 48 here so 70-48 you get 22 the unit is meters so 22 meters for breath this question find the length of a rectangular board with width of 22 now with this given 22 and the perimeter is 140 you asked to find it let's now use the formula here 140 this is 2 times L is unknown B is 22 divide the whole equation by 2 to get cancel out you 
,,get L plus 22 is equal to 70 now take away 22 from both sides l equals 70 minus 22 that's 48 48 meters is the answer for length you can write here also 48 this question a rectangular frame of Y is formed by a square as shown above find it's one side length so rectangular frame this one you can create a square from this so you asked to find out the length of one side of this square so X is the length now we need to find out the perimeter because this is a wire around this rectangle so what's the perimeter of the rectangle you can find out using the formula so we know length is 48 breadth is 12 so substitute 2 times 48 plus 12 2 times 60 so 120 is the perimeter of the rectangle so that is equal to the perimeter of the square as well so length of one side is perimeter divided by 4 because all the inside the equal 4x 
,,is the perimeter of this square so divide by 4 you and find length of one side X that's thirty hundred twenty divided by four that's thirty what's the unit centimetres equilateral triangles so we did perimeter of a square perimeter of a rectangle now this is equilateral triangle what is equilateral means all sides are equal if this is a this is also a this is also a and what's the other property in equilateral triangle each angle is 60 degrees now we will find out the perimeter of this equilateral triangle start from one place go around a plus a plus a so what's that like terms Eddie sure you get three a so what's the perimeter of an equilateral triangle you can take one side and multiply by three find the length of one side of the triangle by dividing the perimeter of an equilateral triangle by three you can get 
,,one side so a equals P divided by three look at the question here this is an equilateral triangle with length eight centimeters so you asked to find the perimeter so what's the perimeter you can use the formula 3 L 3 times 8 that's 24 centimeters this question find the perimeter of an equilateral triangle which is 11 meters in length three-year is the formula L means given 11 so 3 times 11 that's 33 meters find the perimeter of an equilateral triangle which is eleven point three centimeter 
,,in length so this is an equilateral triangle you can use P equals three times L three times eleven point three three times 3 9 3 times 1/3 3 times 1/3 that's in centimeters find the length of one side of an equilateral triangle where its perimeters 30.6 now other vira so what you have to do you have to divide by three so P is given so how do you find L P divided by 3 so substitute 30 point six divided by three one zero two so ten point two centimeters is the length of one side of an equilateral triangle find the length of one side of an equilateral triangle where its perimeter is forty eight point nine so perimeter is given 48 point now that's three L 
,,so three l equals P forty eight point nine is three L how can we find out L divide this by three so you get L equals divided by this tree if you can't divide like this you can take separately and divide three times 1/3 18 that's six nine so here you have to keep the decimal place first and 4/9 that's 3 3 times 3 9 0 so 16.3 so length of one side is sixteen point three centimeters now this is any triangle so what you call this scalene all sides are different means scalene triangle what's the other type of triangle isosceles also the isosceles means two sides are equal so this is scaling one side is a the other side is B and the other one is C so how we 
,,find out the perimeter of the scalene triangle just add the three lengths a plus B plus C now we'll take this example a scalene triangle is given and you asked to find the perimeter so just add 9 plus 12 plus 7 9 plus 2 11 11 plus 7 18 and with this 2 that's 28 centimeters is the perimeter of this scalene triangle find the perimeter of the triangle whose sides are 12 10 and 9 so perimeter is just a plus B plus C adding all three lengths 12 plus 10 plus 9 what's the answer 11 and one two three so 31 centimeters find the perimeter of the triangle in which the sides are 20 point three eighteen point four and sixteen point seven so how do you find out the 
,,perimeter just add the three values if you can't add it it's better to write in a column and at say 1 + 3 10 14 1 remaining 8 + 6 14 + 1 51 remaining 3 4 5 so fifty 
,,five point four fifty five point four centimeters is the perimeter of this scaling triangle this one parameter is given that's 90 you are asked to find out one leg we can find these two 30 plus 27 is 57 now 57 plus x equals 90 I'll write x plus 57 is 90 because the perimeter is given as 90 so X is take 57 away that means subtract 57 from both sides 90 minus 57 so you get three one remaining six and here 333 centimeters is the x value what is this triangle I told you two sides are equal isosceles triangle perimeter of the triangle below is 34 centimeters find X so make a formula X plus X plus 10 that's the total distance in this triangle that's called perimeter that's equal to 34 X onyx becomes 2x now subtract 10 from both sides 2x equals 34 minus 10 when you subtract you get 24 is 2 X divided by 2 both sides X is 
,,equal to 12 so length of X is 12 centimeters if the perimeter of the triangle below is 45 centimeters fine lengths of each side of the triangle 3 X 2 X 4 X what's the ID sure that's the perimeter that's 45 like terms at 4 plus 2 6 +3 9 X equals 45 divided by 9 you can find out X so X is equal to 5 if x equals 5 what's this one so we'll take this one as so ABC triangle so a B is 3 X B C is 4 X and C a 2 X so a B is 3 times X X is 5 that's 15 centimeters BC 4 X 4 times 5 thats 20 centimeters 
,,and this one is C a 2 X 2 times 5 10 centimeters find the perimeter of the quadrilateral below this is quadrilateral means four-sided plane figure so how do you find out the perimeter when you start from one point you can go around and take the total distance that's called the perimeter so we can find out just adding all these numbers 8 plus 7 plus 9 plus 11 11 plus 9 20 28 plus 7 you get 35 centimeters this is also a quadrilateral what you call that trapezium if the these two lines are parallel we call that's a trapezium find the perimeter of the trapezium below yeah these lengths are equal if this is 8 this is also 8 this is also 8 we'll just add all the lengths 8 plus 8 plus 8 plus 12 12 plus 8 20 20 plus 16 36 centimeter is the unit this one similar to that one this is X X X find the value of x if the perimeter of the trapezium is 53 so we can write down X plus X plus X 3 X 3 X is equal to what 3 X plus 20 all right down 3x plus 20 is the perimeter now perimeter is given 
,,as 53 so what can you do subtract 20 from both sides you get 3x so 53 minus 20 you get 33 so 3x is equal to 33 have you find X you divided by 3x is equal to 11 so what's the unit centi meters look at this question a hundred and twenty centimeter long wire was cut into two equal pieces and she arc between our cheese and sujud from there argit made an equilateral triangle and Sujit made a square find the side length of the collateral triangle and the side length of the square so what's the total length of the wire 120 so what is one piece it's equally divided into two parts so 120 divided by 2 is 1 5 thats 20 centimeters so our jig has 16 120 divided by 
,,2 that 60 centimeters so a jet has 60 centimeters and Sujit also has 60 centimeter wire so how you find out one side of the equilateral triangle we know all sides are equal you know the perimeter 60 divided by 3 you get one side of the equilateral triangle that's 20 centimeters how can we find out the length of one side of a square square you get both sides equal sides so you have to divide by four so 60 divided by four you get 15 centimeter is the length of one side of a square now we will look at perimeter of composite closed rectilinear plain figures so combination of two or more figures what are the figures we did we did square rectangle triangle equilateral scalene to find out the perimeter now we look at this one two squares with side lengths eight combined and make a rectangle shown below fine its perimeter now if you take these two separately what's the parameter perimeter this one is one side is 8 so 40 times 8 here also 4 times 8 so 4 times 8 plus 4 times 8 so 32 plus 32 64 centimeters you are getting if you take separately these two squares when combining squares one side or laps with another side what happens this side and this side or laps and it's the inside length of the rectangle now if you want the perimeter of the new figure you can't take this net so outer length means this one so when combining squares one side overlap with another side so what's the perimeter of the rectangle how many eighths are there now one two three four five six now earlier eight now two sides overlapped and it's in the tangle so you can't take those two sites so we can check it so we'll see how many eighths are there 1 2 3 4 5 6 
,,so 8 times 6 48 centimeters so that combined figure has 48 centimeter as the perimeter of that rectangle find the perimeter of joint site formed by joining three squares that are 8 centimeters in length all sides are 8 centimeters now this is the combined figure there are 4 sides in one square we know that there are 4 sides total number of sites for three squares 4 times 3 that's 12 12 sides are there number of joint sides touching each other now if you take this one that's this one 1 and here half here half here another one so 2 this one 3 4 this square and this side 4 so 4 let's overlap and these are inside the figure so you can't take four lengths number of joint sides touching each other is for now so perimeter of the composite figure now how many sides all together earlier 12 sides four sides inside now 12 minus 4 8 8 times 8 but we'll check that out with finding lengths outside starting from one place how many eighths are there 1 2 three four five six seven and this half and this half eight so we can say eight times eight 64 centimeters is the perimeter of the combined figure shown in the figure are two identical cards of six centimeters length and three centimeter with they combined and formed a large rectangle find the perimeter of the rectangle so this is the combined figure the two sides shown by the dotted lines are located inside the image so here this side overlaps with this one now find the perimeter so we'll take outer length of this one so how many threes are there 1 2 3 times 2 how many Sixers are there 1 2 3 4 6 times 4 3 times 2 6 6 times 4 24 24 plus 6 30 centimeters is the perimeter of this combined frikkin find the perimeter of the figure below 2 sides of the 3 centimeter are located inside the figure yeah this one is overlap so we can't take that length so how we find out the perimeter so we'll take outer length how many threes are there 1 2 3 4 3 times 4 how many 6 is 1 2 3 six times three now add it 3 times 4 12 6 times 3 18 you get 30 30 centimeter is the perimeter of the combined shape find the perimeter of the figure below it's given one and a half and one and a half is three so we'll start from this point how many sixes are there 1 2 3 6 times 3 how many threes are there 1 2 3 and these two another one for 3 times 4 so 6 times 3 18 3 times 4 12 when you add it together you get 30 centimeters as the perimeter of the combined figure so I can highlight this is one and a half and be a happy took as one unit that's 3 centimeter unit find the perimeter of the figures which is aligned with the square and rectangle shown below this is a square with length 4 rectangle length 8 and breadth 4 centimeters so they combine and you can't take the inside length for pairing it only outside boundary so we'll take how many sides are 4 yeah 4 1 2 3 & 4 so 4 times 4 and what about 8 1 2 8 times 2 so 4 times 4 16 8 times 2 16 you get 32 centimeters further perimeter of the combined figure look at this combined figure two sides four centimeter are located inside the figure so this side overlaps so that's inside we can't take it now we'll find out the perimeter of this figure we'll start four centimeter sides one two three four five and we'll take these two separately so four times four then eight one only one so 8 times 1 + 2 x2 + 2 you can write 2 times 2 now add it all sides are taken 2018 - 1 8 + 4 so you get 32 centimeter as the perimeter of the combined figure this one here 2 sides 4 centimeter long I located inside this one you can take it now take the outer length 4 centimeter ones 4 1 2 3 4 5 6 6 times 4 and 1 8 centimeter long length times 1/6 times 4 24 + 8 you get 32 centimeters as the perimeter of the combined figure find the perimeter of the joint triangle and the rectangle shown below so these two sides over laughs and this is inside so you can't take that length so we'll check out a length 1 2 3 3 times 4 centimeter length and 8 1 to 2 times 8 4 times 3 12 and 16 you get 28 centimeter as a parameter of the combined figure this one find the perimeter of the figure formed by combining four triangles of sight four centimeters to a 
,,square so you can't take these four sides that's inside so we check outside length all lengths are 4 centimeter so we'll count how many fours are there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 4 times 8 32 so the perimeter is 32 centimeters this one find the perimeter of the combined figure you can't take this one that's inside how many 12 are there 1 + 2 + 3 3 times 2 then how many Force 1 to 4 times then what is this slap now look at carefully this total length is 12 and this height is 4 so what's this length 12 
,,minus 4 12 minus 4 is 8 you get 8 centimeter length for this one so you need to add that length here now we took all sides did we take all sides no yeah we missed one length 1/2 yeah this is 3 so we'll multiply 4 times 3 here now it's correct so 3 times 12 36 4 times 3 12 and 8 and 12 plus 8 20 and this is 56 centimeters this one to trapeziums together find the perimeter so don't take inside land only outside length you have to take 4 perimeter so how many 6 centimeter legs are there 1 2 3 
,,4 4 times 6 how many 10 legs are there 10 centimeter length 1 2 so 6 times 4 24 plus 20 you get 44 centimeters using square and triangle the following figure is formed find the perimeter so this is the combined one so don't take the inside let so how we find out the perimeter how many fours are there 1 two three four four four and then five point six is this set four times four 16 plus five point six and it together you get point 6 and 6 plus 5 6 plus 5 11 and so twenty one point six centimeters now two rectangles and one square perimeter of the rectangle so this is length is 8 and breadth is 4 so 2 times 8 plus 4 2 times 12 24 perimeter of the square 
,,4 times 4 16 centimeters now we'll see find the perimeter of the combined figure back now combine all three shapes so you are not getting these two inside lens now so how we find out the perimeter you can find out how many fours are there 1 2 three oh five six seven eight eight four and how many eighths are there one to two times eight now add it together eight times for 32 and 16 you get 48 centimeters so 48 centimeter is the perimeter this one again same length a 10-4 so this is 8 and this is 4 now in this one we can't take this part this part the inside let's we'll find out outside length how many fours are there one two three four five six seven eight eight fours how many eighths are there one and two now we can add it two times eight 32 and 16 48 centimeter this is the perimeter of this combined figure perimeter of the rectangle here 8 is length and breadth is 3 so what's the perimeter 2 times L plus B 2 times 8 plus 3 11 so 22 centimeters is the perimeter of this rectangle de la Vega is formed using three rectangles above so same rectangles before now when you combine all together you get inside length so you can't take these ones 
,,so what's the outer length outer length will count how many threes the breadth is 3 centimeters 1 2 3 4 4 times 3 how many eighths 1 2 2 times 8 now how we find out 
,,this length total length is 8 and this is 3 8 minus 3 this is 5 and here also so 5 & 5 that's twice then we missed one length here these two get one and another two 
,,eights so altogether four so I'll erase this one and write for this one should be 4 4 times 8 4 times 3 12 32 and 10 you get 4 here and 554 centimeters is the perimeter of this combined figure what is this shape one two three four five six six sided plane figure hexagon so find the perimeter one side of this figure is four so parameter is full into 6 because 6 sides are there 24 centimeters now look at the perimeter of the combined figure so combining three hexagons but nothing happens nothing overlap so you can take 24 times 3 so 24 times 3 is the perimeter of this combined one so just attached from here only so not overlapping sides so 3 times 4 12 1 remaining 3 times 2 6 plus 1 7 so 72 centimeter is the perimeter of this combined figure now in this one how many sides come by here two sides one from this one and one from another to another to another to another - so how many sides overlap 2 4 6 8 10 sides overlap earlier how many sides were there 6 times 3 6 times 3 hexagons 6 times 3 80 now 4 if you take separately 6 times for 24 and 10 sides overlap actually you are getting 14 sites we'll check that out so it's better to always take 
,,outer lengths now we will see how many fours are there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 so 14 sides are correct so either you can use this method or this method but 
,,I think better to take outer length and find the perimeter four times for 16 and 4 times 1/4 plus 156 centimeter is their combined parameter find the perimeter here 
,,so what are the lengths given here if you take this one fourteen point one four fourteen point one four so fourteen point one four times two then what are the other 
,,lengths twenty another twenty twenty times two and here are ten and ten totus now don't take these two inside lengths you can't take four perimeter now multiply 2 times 4 8 2 times 1/2 again 8 and 2 20 times 2 42 times 10 20 so when you add it together you get fine to wait there and 8 4 plus 2 6 6 plus 2 8 so 88.2 8 centimeters 
,,look at this one now you get a circle part as well find the length of the circle if the perimeter is 40 now we know that perimeter is 50 centimeters given length of 
,,two lines 14 and 14 14 times 2 that 28 centimeters now how can we find out the circle length length of this pot we call that an arc arc length length of the circle is 50 minus 28 so here I'll write 28 here so this one is length of the circle is 50 minus 28 that's 22 centimeters now look at this one as shown in the figure above the boundary of 400 meter long flow path find the length of the two circles so the whole thing is 400 meters so this is 90 meters this is 90 meters so what's the perimeter given 400 meters so length of both sidelines this line is 90 this is also 92 times 90 that's 180 meters so length of the circular area so this one and this becomes the perimeter - the two lengths so perimeter is 400 - 180 you get 220 meters is the length of circular paths this one and this one so that's the length we are not taking these two this one the perimeter of the given figure is 70 point 4 find the length of a smaller semicircle we are lengths of bigger circle which is thirty 
,,point two so this part is thirty point two centimeters given we are asked to find the smaller one so this one is same as this one because this side is equal to this 
,,one so what's the perimeter given 70 point four and what's the length of large semicircle 30 point two lengths of small semicircle is you have to subtract the two values so seven two point four minus thirty point to do it here seventy point four thirty point to subtraction you get here forty point two this is in centimeters now 
,,the length of one of the smallest semicircle so this is two semicircles is this much so what about one semicircle you have to divide this by two you get twenty point one centimeter is the length of one semicircle find the perimeter of a smaller semicircle when the perimeter of the compound figure is ninety point six so all three sides are equal means this is equal to this one is equal to this one all lengths of semicircles are equal so perimeter is given 90 point six centimeters so what's the length of one of the smaller semicircle you have to divide this by three because parameter means three lengths we are not considering inside let's so take ninety 
,,point six divided by three it's one length thirty point two centimeters is their length off one semicircle now we will look at review exercise find the perimeter of 
,,each of the figures given below so this is an equilateral triangle one length is five centimeters so what's the perimeter perimeter is five times three that's 15 centimeters this is isosceles triangle this is six and this is six as well so what's the perimeter here 6 plus 6 plus 4 10 10 plus 6 16 centimeters this one is a scalene triangle just active since 5 plus 6 plus 7 7 plus 5 12 12 plus 6 18 centimeters this is a square one length is 6 so what's the perimeter 4 times 6 because there are 4 equal sides in a square so 24 centimeters this is the rectangle opposite sides are equal so what's the formula 2 times L plus B length and breadth so two times length is 10 breath this for 2 times 14 you get 28 centimeters what's a shape here trapezium this is 5 this is also 5 so what's the perimeter perimeter is add all the lids 5 + 6 + 5 + 8 10 18 + 6 24 centimeters question number 2 the perimeter of a square shape wall tile is 160 so the perimeter is 160 how many such tiles are needed for one lengthwise row of a wall of length 4 meters if the tires are to be fixed without any gaps between them so what's the length of the wall is equal to 4 meters multiply by 100 you get 400 centimeters now we'll find out one side of a tile one side of a tile because the perimeter is given hundred 60 divided by 4 you get one side of a child then you can find how many tiles needed you know them twice number of tiles needed length twice 400 divided by 40 so you need ten tiles for this way question number three if the perimeter of the rectangular shaped paddy field of length forty meters this is 40 meters and we don't know the breadth but the perimeter is given 130 so parameter is given 130 length is 40 and you need to find out the breath use the formula P equals 2 times L plus B perimeter is 132 times 40 plus B 
,,divide both sides by 2 let's get canceled out under 30 divided by 2 65 then subtract 40 from both sides you get B equals 65 minus 40 that's 25 meters question number 4 the length of a rectangular shaped wall tile is greater than its breadth by 10 centimeters if the breadth of the tile is 15 fine its perimeter so what's the length length is 10 centimeter more than the brick so length is 15 plus 10 that's 25 centimeters breadth is given 15 centimeters and you asked to find out that parameter 
,,so formula is 2 times L plus B 2 L is 25 B is 15 when you add it together 2 times 40 80 centimeters is the perimeter question number 5 there are two pieces of wire of length 6 two centimeters each amali makes an equilateral triangle by bending one of these pieces of wire son Domini makes a square find the length of side of equilateral triangle made by amali and find the length of the side of the square made by Sun Domini so there are two pieces of wire so the length of the wire is 60 centimeter each so if this is equilateral triangle you get three sides so what's the length of one side of an equilateral triangle 60 divided by three that is 20 centimeters now we'll look at the square square has four sides equal sides so what's the length of a square 60 divided by four so 15 centimeters question number six the length and breadth of a rectangular shape flowerbed are seven meters L three meters how many square shaped bricks of length 25 centimeter each are needed to place one row of bricks around the flower bed without any space left between the bricks so around this flowerbed seven meters and three meters now we'll see lengthwise how many bricks are needed so this is Lindt is 7 meters convert to centimeters you get 700 centimeters so number of bricks lengths twice so here one brick is 25 centimeter long so 700 divided by 25 so 25 times 254 200 so you would get 8 so 28 bricks lengthwise then how many bricks needed for this side number of bricks for bread side 300 is the length divided by 25 what's that 25 and 450 that's 2 but we know when you are taking the tiles here how many tiles on up here yeah 2 tiles overlap yeah so that means you have to take you have to subtract how many times one two three four tiles you have to subtract after you taking the total length so we'll take that so if 
,,you take number of a bread side this so actually if we take out these two how many ties are there you need 10 tiles so we'll find out the total number of trials needed twenty-eight this way and twenty-eight this way as well and here you have to subtract two from here to from there so actual one is 20 minus 2 and 20 minus 2 there what's the total so 10 10 20 30 40 50 60 60 plus 16 you get 76 all together the total number of tiles needed around this is 76 so this is one method we found using 
,,perimeter seven plus three this one but you need to subtract for a number of tiles because that's overlapping each other if you take the perimeter what's the second 
,,method you can do perimeter of this figure is 700 plus 300 into 2 2 times L plus B so what's that mm is the total length then divide by 4 divide by the length of the tire 25 so you can find number of tiles is equal to u divided by 25 and then you have to subtract again for from that let's see what you get 25 times a 80 minus 4 76 this way also you get the same of tax question number seven the length of a rectangular shape playground is twice its breadth if the perimeter of the playground is 360 meters fine its length L its breadth so we'll put X from X for bread and twice 2x for length and it's 2x and B is X now use the formula 2 times L plus B is P 2 
,,times 2x plus x equals 360 divided by 2 2 X and X becomes 3x 360 divided by 2 180 so divide this by 3 you get x equals 60 so X is the length of the size of the brick so what's the unit so this is bread 60 meters and what's the length then length is 2 times of 60 120 meters example number one calculate the perimeter of each of the figures below so these are all combined figures so rectangle and a equilateral triangle combined together and you ask to find the perimeter so when you take the perimeter you are taking only outer lengths so we'll take the first one how many sevens are there 1 to 2 times 7 how many trees are there 1 2 3 so 1 times 2 14 and 9 23 centimeters this one we take 6 6 1 only 1 6 if you take 8 1 2 2 weights then how many force 1 2 2 4 and then you get 10 6 plus 8 times 2 16 4 times 2 8 and 10 add 
,,it together 12 1 remaining so here 6 + 6 12 12 plus 8 22 remaining 2 3 4 40 centimeters part three so you need to find out the perimeter of the figure so we will find out separately gh gh is high five centimeters a B what's the length yeah total length is 5 this is 2 Phi minus 2 3 so divided equally so this is one and a half and one and a half so what's a B 1 then 1/2 or 1.5 so we can dry find out five minus two divided by two so one and a half or 1.5 will write 2 times a B this I do know now 2 times a B a B is 1 point 5 multiplied by 2 you get 3 centimeters so this is 3 centimeters so what's the perimeter 5 this one yeah we will see how many fives are there 1 2 3 3 5 so I multiply this by 3 5 3 times then 2 1 2 3 then 1 and 1/2 and one and a half we get 3 that's all so you can multiply 15 and 324 this is in centimeter so very meeting is 24 centimeters exercise to 0.1 calculate the perimeter of each of the figures given below so we'll see how many sides are there with five centimeter length 1 2 3 4 5 5 times 5 25 centimeters is the parameter this one 1 to 2 times 5 7 1 to 2 times 7 10 plus 14 that's 24 centimeters look at this figure combination of 2 rectangles so what's the perimeter you take 6 lengths 1 2 3 3 times 6 when it comes to 2 1 2 & 3 2 times 3 and then you need to find out this length so how do you find out that length 6 minus 2 you get 4 centimeters so you need to add four there 6 into 3 18 6 plus 4 10 and 18 that's 28 centimeters now look at this 
,,one this is a good question you have given this side for this one 5 so this is a rectangle and now the rectangle we don't know the lengths okay think about this one 
,,this length and this length when you add what you get the total length for so take this length and move it up so you get here this left move it there what you get this is same as a rectangle so length is five breakfast for so what's the perimeter perimeter is two times four plus five two times nine 18 centimeters this one we let all limbs yeah this is also similar to the previous question if you move this one up actually this is a rectangle and you get extra two let's but we'll add it together this is 12 this is 10 and this is 10 10 times 2 4 4 4 that's 12 and this 4 and this 4 you get another 8 when you add it 12 12 24 24 20 and 8 so you get 52 centimeters take this one here this is 11 here can you see this length is equal to this length so this is 8 now we can find out the perimeter perimeter is equal to 11 plus 8 and another 8 2 times 8 five and four now add it together eleven plus 16 plus five and four sixteen one remaining two three so 36 centimeters for the parameter this figure all lengths are given so this is given and which side not given here this is 90 degrees means this is four and this is for same length this is like a rectangle so all lengths we know this is 5 this is also hot now we'll find out the perimeter 15 and this is 15 15 times 2 how many fours are there 1 2 3 4 4 times how many fives are there 1 2 now what about this one this length this is equal to this given 6 now we'll find out the length 6 1 2 3 4 4 times 6 now add it together 30:16 10 and 24 one remaining here 4 5 6 7 8 80 centimeters this is a trapezium you have given all let's hear this is same as this one this is thirteen point four now you can find the forum Peter thirteen point four two times this is twelve thirteen and five here multiply two times four eight six and two twenty six point eight plus here this is 3 plus 2 5 5 5 10 and 30 so add it together you get point eight and six with five fifty six point eight that's in meters question number two a figure of a 
,,gate with two panels is given here calculate the perimeter of the gate so we need to find out the perimeter of the gate this is equal this is 3 this is 3 this is 4 this one is four now we'll find out 3 twice three times 2 4 twice and 2.5 and 2.5 twice so what's the perimeter six eight two point five times two you get five fourteen plus five nineteen the unit is meters look at this one a figure of an entrance structure constructed to welcome the students of grade one to a school is given with its measurements find the minimum length of the ribbon required to fix around the entrance structure so basically that means perimeter of this figure you get carefully this is one this is one so this is three so what's this 1 1 + 1 2 2 + 3 then this is 1 meter this is also 1 and what is this side this is 3 so this is 3 3 now we'll find the perimeter you can add how many ones are there 1 2 3 4 4 times 1 how many threes 1 2 3 4 5 and this is 5 this one is 5 now add 4 plus 15 plus 5 you get 
,,24 meters so the length of the ribbon required is 24 meters this question a figure offer net use to construct a solid is shown here calculate its perimeter so all sides I equals six so parameter means outer length how many sixes are there 1 2 3 4 5 6 6 into 6 that's 36 centimeters this one a section of a courtyard constructed with square shaped flow tiles of length 40 centimeter each is shown in the figure find the perimeter of this section so perimeter means outer length so one tile is 40 
,,centimeters so this one is 40 so we'll see how many forties are there so B equals very meet one two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 24 times 40 0 4 times 4 64 times 2 8 + 1 9 so this is in centimeters so perimeter of this section is 960 centimeters look at question number 6 if the perimeter of a wall hanging composed of a square shaped wooden lamina and an equilateral triangular shaped wooden lamina with base equal to a side of the square is hundred 60 centimeters so the whole parameter is Rancic's T so all these sides are equal because this base is same as the length of this square so equal sides there are how many sides 1 2 3 4 5 5 sides are there so the perimeter is hundred 60 so what's the first question calculate the length of a side of the square shape wooden lamina that means all together five sides are there so length of the square is 160 divided by five you get 32 centimeters then calculate the perimeter of the equilateral triangular shape wooden lamina so they're asking only the perimeter of this one so three times of that so perimeter of the equilateral triangle only three times one side is 32 3 times 32 96 centimeters look at this one question number seven what is the least of the parameters of the composite plane figures that can be made with two rectangles of length six and breadth for so when you take two rectangles either you can combine like this with the bread side so six six four four oh what's the other way you can combine with the Landsat now they are asking least of the Perim a parameter least of the parameter means the lowest value so we what do you think which one you need to get the lowest value breath is normally smaller than the length so here when you take length side inside you get the parameter least so this shape is the correct one but if you can't figure it out we'll calculate and see so what's the perimeter of this figure so you can't take this one parameter we can find to force two times four and one two three four four times six but you get 8 and 24 32 centimeters this one this is six four four four and six what's the perimeter here two times six and how many fours are there 4 4 times 2 times 6 12 and 16 28 so we can see that this is the least valid the lowest value out of this so this 
,,is the least parameter so least parameter parameter is 28 centimeters freshener made a composite figure form with 4 rectangles of length 8 and breadth 4 centimeters 
,,each and a square of side length 4 square of side length 4 so this one it's shown here calculate the perimeter of the figure so perimeter only the outer length it's 
,,a perimeter is equal to we'll see how many eighths are there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 8 times 8 how many Falls 1 2 3 for now edit 64 last 68 so you get 80 centimeters for the perimeter of this figure question number 9 every morning be newly walks twice around the path shown in the figure find the total distance she walks around the park 
,,each day so twice of that so find the perimeter and multiply by two now can you see this is a rectangular shape figure so when you move this length here and this length here what you get you get her rectangular shape figure so find the perimeter using two times length is 705 with these 475 two times addition of these two ten eight eleven two times zero 2 times 8 16 2 times 1/2 plus 1/3 2 so this is the perimeter of this figure but be newly box twice around so you have to multiply by 2 so total distance is 2 times this 0 12 7 and 4 so this is in meters 4720 so we covered all theory related to perimeter so we found perimeter of square rectangle triangle 
,,scalene isosceles and equilateral and then we did composite figures beining two or more figures together so when you're finding perimeter so the perimeter of the combined figure is not the same as the perimeter of separate figures and also when calculating the perimeter of a composite rectilinear plane figure only the lengths of the straight line segments by which it is bounded should be added not the inside length so make sure when you take a combined figure you add all outer length
,,
Perimeter,j3-XYLnxJDY,"So right here, we have"
,,"a four-sided figure, or a quadrilateral,"
,,"where two of the sides are parallel to each other. And so this, by"
,,"definition, is a trapezoid. And what we want to do"
,,"is, given the dimensions that they've given us, what"
,,is the area of this trapezoid. So let's just think through it. So what would we get if we
,,multiplied this long base 6 times the height 3? So what do we get if
,,"we multiply 6 times 3? Well, that would be the"
,,area of a rectangle that is 6 units wide
,,and 3 units high. So that would give us
,,the area of a figure that looked like-- let me do
,,it in this pink color. The area of a figure that looked
,,like this would be 6 times 3. So it would give us this
,,"entire area right over there. Now, the trapezoid is"
,,"clearly less than that, but let's just go with"
,,"the thought experiment. Now, what would happen if"
,,"we went with 2 times 3? Well, now we'd be finding"
,,the area of a rectangle that has a width of 2
,,and a height of 3. So you could imagine that being
,,this rectangle right over here. So that is this rectangle
,,right over here. So that's the 2
,,"times 3 rectangle. Now, it looks like the"
,,area of the trapezoid should be in between
,,these two numbers. Maybe it should be exactly
,,"halfway in between, because when you look at the"
,,area difference between the two rectangles-- and let
,,me color that in. So this is the area difference
,,on the left-hand side. And this is the area difference
,,on the right-hand side. If we focus on
,,"the trapezoid, you see that if we start with the"
,,"yellow, the smaller rectangle, it reclaims half"
,,"of the area, half of the difference between"
,,the smaller rectangle and the larger one on
,,the left-hand side. It gets exactly half of
,,it on the left-hand side. And it gets half the
,,difference between the smaller and the larger on
,,the right-hand side. So it completely makes
,,"sense that the area of the trapezoid, this"
,,"entire area right over here, should really just"
,,be the average. It should exactly be
,,halfway between the areas of the smaller rectangle
,,and the larger rectangle. So let's take the average
,,of those two numbers. It's going to be 6 times 3 plus
,,"2 times 3, all of that over 2. So when you think about"
,,"an area of a trapezoid, you look at the two bases, the"
,,long base and the short base. Multiply each of those times
,,"the height, and then you could take the average of them. Or you could also"
,,think of it as this is the same thing as 6 plus 2. And I'm just factoring
,,"out a 3 here. 6 plus 2 times 3, and"
,,"then all of that over 2, which is the same"
,,thing as-- and I'm just writing it
,,in different ways. These are all different
,,"ways to think about it-- 6 plus 2 over 2, and"
,,then that times 3. So you could view
,,it as the average of the smaller and
,,larger rectangle. So you multiply each of
,,"the bases times the height and then take the average. You could view it as-- well,"
,,"let's just add up the two base lengths, multiply that times the"
,,"height, and then divide by 2. Or you could say, hey, let's"
,,take the average of the two base lengths and
,,multiply that by 3. And that gives you
,,another interesting way to think about it. If you take the average of these
,,"two lengths, 6 plus 2 over 2 is 4. So that would be a width"
,,that looks something like-- let me do this in orange. A width of 4 would look
,,something like this. A width of 4 would look
,,"something like that, and you're multiplying"
,,"that times the height. Well, that would be a rectangle"
,,like this that is exactly halfway in between
,,the areas of the small and the large rectangle. So these are all
,,equivalent statements. Now let's actually
,,"just calculate it. So we could do any of these. 6 times 3 is 18. This is 18 plus 6, over 2. That is 24/2, or 12. You could also do it this way. 6 plus 2 is 8, times "
,,3 is
,,"24, divided by 2 is 12. 6 plus 2 divided by 2"
,,"is 4, times 3 is 12. Either way, the area of this"
,,trapezoid is 12 square units.
,,
Perimeter,nLY2bzRfQyo,"rectangle here, and we know two things"
,,about this yellow rectangle. We know that it
,,"has a length of 10, that the length of this"
,,side right over here is 10. And we also know that
,,this yellow rectangle has an area of 60
,,"square units, whatever units we're"
,,measuring this 10 in. So what I want you to do
,,"is now pause this video, and based on the"
,,information given on these other rectangles--
,,so in some of them we give you two of their
,,"dimensions, in some of them we give you something"
,,like the perimeter and one of the dimensions--
,,I want you to pause the video and think about which of these
,,"rectangles, if any of them, have either the same area"
,,"or the same perimeter as this yellow rectangle. So pause the video right now. Well, the best way to"
,,figure out which of these have the same area or perimeter
,,as this original yellow rectangle is to just figure
,,out the area and the perimeter for all of these rectangles
,,and see which ones of them are equivalent. So we already know
,,"the area for this one, but we don't know its perimeter. So how do we figure that out? Well, to figure"
,,"out perimeter, we would need to know the"
,,"lengths of all the sides. Well, if the area is 60 square"
,,"units, that means the length times the width is equal to"
,,"60, that 10 times this width right over here is"
,,"going to be equal to 60. So 10 times what is equal to 60? Well, 10 times 6 is equal to 60. 10 times 6 is equal"
,,to 60 square units. 10 units times 6 units is
,,equal to 60 square units. Fair enough. So how do we figure
,,"out the perimeter now? Well, this is a rectangle. So we know if this"
,,"length is 10, then this length must also be 10. And if this width is 6, then"
,,this width must be 6 as well. And now we can figure
,,out the perimeter. It's 10 plus 10 plus
,,"6 plus 6, which is 32. So let me write that down. The perimeter of our"
,,original yellow rectangle is equal to 32. Now let's go on to each
,,of these other rectangles and figure out what their
,,perimeters and the areas are. We already know the perimeter
,,"for this purple or mauve rectangle, but we need"
,,to figure out its area. In order to figure out
,,"its area, we can't just rely on this one dimension"
,,just on its width. We have to figure out
,,"its length as well. So how do we figure that out? Well, one way to realize"
,,it is that the perimeter is the distance all the
,,way around the rectangle. So what would be the distance
,,halfway around the rectangle? So let me see if I can draw it. What would be the distance
,,"of this side, our length, plus this side? Well, it would be"
,,half the perimeter. 5 plus something is going to
,,"be equal to half the perimeter. Remember, the perimeter"
,,is all four sides. If we just took these
,,"two sides, which would be half the perimeter. So, these two sides"
,,"must be equal to, when you take their sum,"
,,"must be equal to 17, half the perimeter. So 5 plus what is equal to 17? 5 plus this question"
,,"mark is equal to 17. Well, 5 plus 12 is equal to 17. And you can verify this. 12 plus 5 is 17, and"
,,"then that times 2 gets us the perimeter of 34. Now, given that, what is"
,,"the area of this figure? Well, the area's going to"
,,be 12 units times 5 units to get 60 square units. Area is equal to 60. So this one right over
,,"here has the same area, different perimeter. Same area as the original yellow"
,,"rectangle, different area. Now let's go over here. So this is not just a rectangle. This is also a"
,,"square, because I have the same length"
,,"and the same width. So what's the area here? Well, for the area, I"
,,just have to multiply the length times the width. 8 units times 8 units
,,"is 64 square units. And what is the perimeter here? Well, these two sides are going"
,,to make up half the perimeter. If I wanted to figure
,,"out the whole one, I know this is also"
,,"8 and this is also 8. So the perimeter is 8 times 4. 8 times 4 sides,"
,,which is equal to 32. So this square right over
,,"here has a different area, but it has the same perimeter"
,,as our original yellow square. Now let's move
,,onto this blue one. What's the area? And you're probably
,,getting used to this. 15 units times 4 units is
,,"going to be 60 square units. And what's the perimeter? What's the perimeter? Well, it's going"
,,"to be 4 plus 15, and whatever that is times 2. 4 plus 15 is 19. And then 19 times 2 is 38. So this one right here"
,,"has the same area, different perimeter"
,,"as our original. Now, finally, here in"
,,"purple, what is the area? The area is 10 times 20,"
,,"which is equal to 200. So if it's 10, say, well,"
,,"10 units times 20 units is 200 square units. And what is the perimeter? What is the perimeter? Well, 10 plus 20 is 30, but"
,,I've just considered only two of the sides right here. That's only half way around. So 10 plus 20 is
,,30 times 2 is 60. So let's see. This has a different
,,"area, and it also has a different perimeter. This one's perimeter looks"
,,"just like the same number. It's 60, as is the"
,,"area here, but that's not what we're comparing. We have a different"
,,perimeter and different area. So neither of these are the
,,same as our original rectangle.

Perimeter,mLeNaZcy-hE,"Hi! Welcome to Math Antics. In this Geometry lesson, "
,,were gonna learn all about triangles. You may remember from the lesson about polygons
,," that triangles are special polygons that always have 3 sides and 3 angles. And thats what the word triangle means. tri"" means 3 and angles means... angles. Okay, thats easy enough... 3 sides... 3 angles... but what else is there to know about triangles? Well for starters, were gonna"
,,"learn how to classify triangles. Oooo such a classy triangle! [laughter] But seriously, theres two different way"
,,to classify (or organize) triangles. They can be classified by their sides
,,and they can be classified by their angles. Lets start by classifying triangles by their angles since weve already learned a lot about angles
,, in the previous videos. You may remember from our first video about angles
,," that theres 3 types of angles: theres right angles, acute angles, and obtuse angles. Well... watch what happens if we use a third line in each of these angles to "
,,form closed shapes. Ah ha! triangles! And can you guess what these three different kinds of triangles are called? Yep - The one made from the right angle is called 
,,"a Right Triangle. The one made from the acute angle is called an Acute Triangle, and the one made from the obtuse angle is called an Obtuse Triangle. So thats simple enough."
,,"But notice that for each of our three triangles, the new angles that were formed"
,,when we closed the shapes are all acute angles. So triangles always have at least 2 acute angles... and its the other angle that determines what type it is. Thats 
,,"important to know so you dont get tricked. For any given triangle,"
,," just because you see one acute angle, that doesn't mean its an acute triangle. You have to look at ALL the angles to tell if"
,,its an acute triangle. The situation is easier with right and obtuse
,,"triangles because you can only have ONE right or obtuse angle per triangle. So as soon as you spot one of those kinds of angles, you know what type of triangle you have. Alright then classifying triangles by angles"
,,is pretty simple. But we can also classify triangles by their sides. If we pay close attention
,,"to the length of each side of a triangle, we can see that there are three possibilities. First of all, if all three sides of a triangle"
,,"are exactly the same length, then we call it an Equilateral Triangle."
,,"Its kind of  a long word, but its easy to remember because it sounds like it has the word equal in it. To see the second possibility, lets take"
,,the top vertex of our equilateral triangle and move it up like this. See what happened?
,,"Two of the triangles sides got stretched by the same amount,"
,,but the bottom side remained the same. Now we have a triangle that has only 2 equal
,,"sides, and thats called an Isosceles Triangle. Thats a long word too. The best way to"
,,"remember that is to look at an isosceles triangle and say its name 20 times as fast as you can! Is osceles, Isosceles, Isosceles, Isosceles,"
,,"Isosceles, Isosceles, Isosceles, Isosceles,... And finally, to see the third possibility,"
,,lets move that same top vertex again... but this time to the left.
,,"Now, all the sides are different lengths. This type of triangle is called a Scalene Triangle. So those are the three possibilities when"
,,classifying triangles by their sides. Equilateral Triangles have 3 equal sides. Isosceles triangles have only 2 equal sides. And scalene triangles have NO equal sides. That way was pretty easy too.
,,"The hardest part is just remembering the names. And now that you know both ways to classify triangles,"
,,"lets see how you can use them together. Yep, you can use them both at the same time. If you classify triangles both by their angles"
,,"and by their sides, it turns out that there's several possible combinations. To see what I mean, lets list the three classifications by sides:"
,,"(scalene, isosceles, and equilateral) and the three classifications by angle:"
,,"(right, acute and obtuse) A scalene triangle can also be a right triangle,"
,,like this one. And a scalene triangle can also be
,,"either an obtuse or an acute triangle. In the same way, an isosceles triangle can"
,,"also be acute, like this one, or obtuse, like this one. And in one special case, an isosceles"
,,"triangle can also be a right triangle, like so. But things are different when it comes to"
,,"an equilateral triangle. An equilateral triangle is always an acute triangle. Because all three sides are exactly the same,"
,,all three angles must also be exactly the same. And since we cant have more than one right
,,"angle in a triangle, or more than one obtuse angle, ALL the angles in an equilateral triangle must be acute. Okay, now that you know all about how"
,,"triangles are classified, lets learn one more really important thing"
,,"about triangles. In our video about angles and degrees, we"
,,learned that we can measure angles and say how big or how small they are using special
,,"units called degrees. Well, since triangles are always made up of 3 angles, each of those angles has its own"
,,measurement in degrees. And the important thing
,,"is that those three angle measurements, if you combine them, they will always"
,,"add up to 180 degrees. For example, have a look at this triangle."
,,"If we were to take a saw and cut it up into three separate angles, ...and then if we were"
,,"to take those three angles and rearrange them so that theyre right next to each other like this, you can see that the total would be the same as a straight angle... thats 180 degrees! And this will work no matter what type of"
,,triangle it is. Knowing that a triangles angles will
,,always add up to 180 degrees can really help you out when solving geometry problems. Theres a whole lot of situations where
,,"youll know what two of the angles are, but you need to figure out what the third"
,,"angle is. Like in this problem. With this triangle, were told that one"
,,"of the angles is 35 degrees, and the other is 45 degrees. But the third angle is unknown. We need to figure out what it is. Since we know that the total must be 180 "
,,"degrees, we can just add up the angles that we DO know, and then subtract that from 180 degrees to"
,,see whats left over. The leftover amount MUST be
,,"the measurement of the unknown angle. So, 35 + 45 = 80 degrees. And when we take that 80 and subtract it"
,,"from 180 we get 100 degrees left over. That means that our unknown angle is 100 degrees! And, you can always check your answer by adding"
,,up all the angles to make sure you get 180. So you can see why its so important to
,,"know that a triangles angles add up to 180 degrees! Well, thats all were going"
,,"to learn about triangle is this video. Remember, the key to really learning math"
,,"is to do it. So, be sure to practice by doing the"
,,"exercises for this section. As always, thanks for watching Math Antics! and Ill see you next time! Learn more at www.mathantic.com"

Perimeter,KlKYvbigBqs,Let's draw ourselves a triangle. Let's say this
,,side has length 6. Let's say this side right
,,over here has length 10. And let's say that this side
,,right over here has length x. And what I'm going to
,,think about is how large or how small that
,,value x can be. How large or small
,,can this side be? So the first question
,,"is how small can it get? Well, if we want"
,,"to make this small, we would just"
,,literally have to look at this angle right over here. So let me take a look at this
,,angle and make it smaller. So let's try to make that
,,"angle as small as possible. So we have our 10 side. Actually let me do it down here. So you have your 10 side,"
,,"the side of length 10, and I'm going to make this angle"
,,"really, really, really small, approaching 0. If that angle becomes 0, we end"
,,up with a degenerate triangle. It essentially
,,becomes one dimension. We lose our
,,two-dimensionality there. But as we approach
,,"0, this side starts to coincide or get closer"
,,and closer to the 10 side. And you could imagine the
,,case where it actually coincides with it and you
,,actually get the degenerate. So if want this
,,point right over here to get as close as possible
,,"to that point over there, essentially minimizing"
,,"your distance x, the closest way is if you"
,,"make the angle the way equal to 0, all the way. So let's actually-- let"
,,me draw a progression. So now the angle
,,is getting smaller. This is length 6. x is getting smaller. Then we keep making that angle
,,smaller and smaller and smaller all the way until we get
,,a degenerate triangle. So let me draw that pink side. So you have the
,,"side of length 10. Now the angle is essentially 0,"
,,this angle that we care about. So this side is length 6. And so what is the
,,"distance between this point and this point? And that distance is length x. So in the degenerate case, this"
,,length right over here is x. We know that 6 plus x is
,,"going to be equal to 10. So in this degenerate case,"
,,x is going to be equal to 4. So if you want this to be a
,,"real triangle, at x equals 4 you've got these points"
,,as close as possible. It's degenerated into a
,,"line, into a line segment. If you want this"
,,"to be a triangle, x has to be greater than 4. Now let's think about"
,,it the other way. How large can x be? Well to think about
,,"larger and larger x's, we need to make this angle bigger. So let's try to do that. So let's draw my 10 side again. So this is my 10 side. I'm going to make that     "
,,angle bigger and bigger. So now let me take my 6
,,side and put it like that. And so now our angle is getting
,,"bigger and bigger and bigger. It's approaching 180 degrees. At 180 degrees, our"
,,triangle once again will be turned into
,,a line segment. It'll become a
,,degenerate triangle. So let me draw the
,,"side of length x, try to draw it straight. So we're trying to"
,,maximize the distance between that point
,,and that point. So this is side of
,,length x and let's go all the way to
,,"the degenerate case. In the degenerate case, at 180"
,,"degrees, the side of length 6 forms a straight line with"
,,the side of length 10. And this is how you can get
,,"this point and that point as far apart as possible. Well, in this situation,"
,,what is the distance between that point
,,"and that point, which is the distance which"
,,"is going to be our x? Well in this situation, x is"
,,"going to be 6 plus 10 is 16. If x is 16, we have a"
,,degenerate triangle. If we don't want a
,,"degenerate triangle, if we want to have two"
,,"dimensions to the triangle, then x is going to have"
,,to be less than 16. Now the whole principle that
,,we're working on right over here is called the
,,triangle inequality theorem and it's a pretty basic idea. That any one side of a
,,"triangle has to be less, if you don't want a"
,,"degenerate triangle, than the sum of the"
,,other two sides. So length of a
,,side has to be less than the sum of the
,,lengths of other two sides. If you're willing to deal
,,with degenerate triangles-- where you essentially
,,"form a line segment, you lose all your"
,,"dimensionality, you turn to a"
,,one-dimensional figure-- then you could say
,,"less than or equal, but we're just going to stick"
,,to non-degenerate triangles. So the length of a
,,side has to be less than the sum of the lengths
,,of the other two sides. And just using
,,"this principle, we could have come up with"
,,"the same exact conclusion. You could say, well look,"
,,x is one of the sides. It has to be less than the sum
,,of the lengths of the other two sides. So it has to be
,,"less than 6 plus 10, or x has to be less than"
,,16-- the exact same result we got by visualizing
,,it like this. You want to say
,,"how large can x be? Well you could say, well,"
,,10 has to be less than-- Or how small can x be? You have to say 10
,,"has to be less than 6 plus x, the sum of the lengths"
,,of the other two sides. If you subtract 6 from
,,"both sides right over here, you get 4 is less than x,"
,,"or x is greater than 4. So this is a, in some level,"
,,"it's a kind of a basic idea, but it's something that you'll"
,,see definitely in geometry. And then you'll go far into
,,other types of mathematics and you'll see other versions
,,of what's essentially this triangle
,,inequality theorem.
,,
Perimeter,sJmLjUj_h68,What is the perimeter
,,of the shape? Each square in the grid is
,,a 1 by 1 centimeter square. So all we have to do
,,is add up the lengths of these blue segments
,,right over here. And they put it
,,on this nice grid. And each box here is 1 by 1. So let's say we start up here. We want to make sure that we
,,"only go to where we started and we don't double count. So this perimeter is 1, 2, 3, 4,"
,,"5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21,"
,,"22, 23, 24 centimeters long. So it is 24 centimeters. The other way we could"
,,have thought about this is you could have looked at the
,,length of each of these sides. So this is 1 plus 2
,,plus 3 plus 1 plus 3 plus 1 plus-- what is this--
,,5 plus 2 plus 4 plus 2. And you would have also
,,gotten 24 centimeters. Let's do a couple more of these. What is the perimeter
,,"of the square? So once again, it's the"
,,length of all of the segments that define the outside
,,"boundary of the square. And by definition, a square--"
,,all of its sides are equal. So you have 4 sides that
,,are all 7 meters long. So you could say it's
,,7 meters plus 7 meters plus 7 meters plus
,,"7 meters, or it's 4 times 7 meters or 28 meters. Let's do one more. What is the perimeter"
,,"of the regular pentagon? So it's a regular pentagon,"
,,which means all of its sides have the same length. And they give us a side of one. The length of one is 2. So all of the sides
,,have length 2. So it's going to be 2 plus
,,"2 plus 2 plus 2 plus 2, or essentially five 2's. Or another way of"
,,"thinking about it is it's 5 times 2, which"
,,is going to be 10. You have five sides
,,of this pentagon. Each of those sides
,,are 2 units long. So 2 units long times 5 sides
,,is going to be 10 units.
,,
Perimeter,AA6RfgP-AHU,In this video we're going
,,"to get introduced to the Pythagorean theorem,"
,,which is fun on its own. But you'll see as you learn
,,more and more mathematics it's one of those cornerstone
,,"theorems of really all of math. It's useful in geometry,"
,,it's kind of the backbone of trigonometry. You're also going to use
,,it to calculate distances between points. So it's a good thing to really
,,make sure we know well. So enough talk on my end. Let me tell you what the
,,"Pythagorean theorem is. So if we have a triangle, and"
,,"the triangle has to be a right triangle, which means that one"
,,of the three angles in the triangle have to be 90 degrees. And you specify that it's
,,90 degrees by drawing that little box right there. So that right there is-- let
,,"me do this in a different color-- a 90 degree angle. Or, we could call"
,,it a right angle. And a triangle that has
,,a right angle in it is called a right triangle. So this is called
,,"a right triangle. Now, with the Pythagorean"
,,"theorem, if we know two sides of a right triangle we can"
,,always figure out the third side. And before I show you how to
,,"do that, let me give you one more piece of terminology. The longest side of a right"
,,triangle is the side opposite the 90 degree angle-- or
,,opposite the right angle. So in this case it is
,,this side right here. This is the longest side. And the way to figure out where
,,"that right triangle is, and kind of it opens into"
,,that longest side. That longest side is
,,"called the hypotenuse. And it's good to know, because"
,,we'll keep referring to it. And just so we always are good
,,"at identifying the hypotenuse, let me draw a couple of"
,,more right triangles. So let's say I have a triangle
,,that looks like that. Let me draw it a
,,little bit nicer. So let's say I have a triangle
,,that looks like that. And I were to tell you
,,that this angle right here is 90 degrees. In this situation this is the
,,"hypotenuse, because it is opposite the 90 degree angle. It is the longest side. Let me do one more, just"
,,so that we're good at recognizing the hypotenuse. So let's say that that is my
,,"triangle, and this is the 90 degree angle right there. And I think you know how"
,,to do this already. You go right what
,,it opens into. That is the hypotenuse. That is the longest side. So once you have identified the
,,hypotenuse-- and let's say that that has length C. And now we're going to
,,learn what the Pythagorean theorem tells us. So let's say that C is equal to
,,the length of the hypotenuse. So let's call this
,,C-- that side is C. Let's call this side
,,right over here A. And let's call this
,,side over here B. So the Pythagorean theorem
,,tells us that A squared-- so the length of one of the
,,shorter sides squared-- plus the length of the other shorter
,,side squared is going to be equal to the length of
,,the hypotenuse squared. Now let's do that with an
,,"actual problem, and you'll see that it's actually not so bad. So let's say that I have a"
,,triangle that looks like this. Let me draw it. Let's say this is my triangle. It looks something like this. And let's say that they tell us
,,that this is the right angle. That this length right here--
,,let me do this in different colors-- this length right
,,"here is 3, and that this length right here is 4. And they want us to figure"
,,out that length right there. Now the first thing you want to
,,"do, before you even apply the Pythagorean theorem, is to"
,,make sure you have your hypotenuse straight. You make sure you know
,,what you're solving for. And in this circumstance we're
,,solving for the hypotenuse. And we know that because this
,,"side over here, it is the side opposite the right angle. If we look at the Pythagorean"
,,"theorem, this is C. This is the longest side. So now we're ready to apply"
,,the Pythagorean theorem. It tells us that 4 squared--
,,one of the shorter sides-- plus 3 squared-- the square of
,,another of the shorter sides-- is going to be equal to this
,,longer side squared-- the hypotenuse squared-- is going
,,to be equal to C squared. And then you just solve for C. So 4 squared is the same
,,thing as 4 times 4. That is 16. And 3 squared is the same
,,thing as 3 times 3. So that is 9. And that is going to be
,,equal to C squared. Now what is 16 plus 9? It's 25. So 25 is equal to C squared. And we could take the positive
,,"square root of both sides. I guess, just if you look at"
,,"it mathematically, it could be negative 5 as well. But we're dealing with"
,,"distances, so we only care about the positive roots. So you take the principal"
,,"root of both sides and you get 5 is equal to C. Or, the length of the"
,,"longest side is equal to 5. Now, you can use the"
,,"Pythagorean theorem, if we give you two of the sides, to figure"
,,out the third side no matter what the third side is. So let's do another
,,one right over here. Let's say that our
,,triangle looks like this. And that is our right angle. Let's say this side over here
,,"has length 12, and let's say that this side over"
,,here has length 6. And we want to figure out this
,,"length right over there. Now, like I said, the first"
,,thing you want to do is identify the hypotenuse. And that's going to be the side
,,opposite the right angle. We have the right angle here. You go opposite
,,"the right angle. The longest side, the"
,,"hypotenuse, is right there. So if we think about the"
,,Pythagorean theorem-- that A squared plus B squared is
,,equal to C squared-- 12 you could view as C. This is the hypotenuse. The C squared is the
,,hypotenuse squared. So you could say
,,12 is equal to C. And then we could say that
,,"these sides, it doesn't matter whether you call one of"
,,them A or one of them B. So let's just call
,,this side right here. Let's say A is equal to 6. And then we say B-- this
,,colored B-- is equal to question mark. And now we can apply the
,,"Pythagorean theorem. A squared, which is 6 squared,"
,,plus the unknown B squared is equal to the hypotenuse
,,squared-- is equal to C squared. Is equal to 12 squared. And now we can solve for B. And notice the difference here. Now we're not solving
,,for the hypotenuse. We're solving for one
,,of the shorter sides. In the last example we
,,solved for the hypotenuse. We solved for C. So that's why it's always
,,important to recognize that A squared plus B squared plus C
,,"squared, C is the length of the hypotenuse. So let's just solve for B here. So we get 6 squared is 36,"
,,"plus B squared, is equal to 12 squared-- this"
,,12 times 12-- is 144. Now we can subtract 36 from
,,both sides of this equation. Those cancel out. On the left-hand side we're
,,left with just a B squared is equal to-- now 144
,,minus 36 is what? 144 minus 30 is 114. And then you
,,"subtract 6, is 108. So this is going to be 108. So that's what B squared is,"
,,"and now we want to take the principal root, or the"
,,"positive root, of both sides. And you get B is equal"
,,"to the square root, the principal root, of 108. Now let's see if we can"
,,simplify this a little bit. The square root of 108. And what we could do is
,,we could take the prime factorization of 108
,,and see how we can simplify this radical. So 108 is the same thing as 2
,,"times 54, which is the same thing as 2 times 27, which is"
,,the same thing as 3 times 9. So we have the square root of
,,108 is the same thing as the square root of 2 times 2
,,"times-- well actually, I'm not done. 9 can be factorized"
,,into 3 times 3. So it's 2 times 2 times
,,"3 times 3 times 3. And so, we have a couple of"
,,perfect squares in here. Let me rewrite it a
,,little bit neater. And this is all an exercise in
,,simplifying radicals that you will bump into a lot while
,,"doing the Pythagorean theorem, so it doesn't hurt to"
,,do it right here. So this is the same thing as
,,the square root of 2 times 2 times 3 times 3 times the
,,"square root of that last 3 right over there. And this is the same thing. And, you know, you wouldn't"
,,"have to do all of this on paper. You could do it in your head. What is this? 2 times 2 is 4. 4 times 9, this is 36. So this is the square root of"
,,36 times the square root of 3. The principal root of 36 is 6. So this simplifies to
,,"6 square roots of 3. So the length of B, you could"
,,"write it as the square root of 108, or you could say it's"
,,"equal to 6 times the square root of 3. This is 12, this is 6. And the square root of 3,"
,,well this is going to be a 1 point something something. So it's going to be a
,,little bit larger than 6.
,,
Perimeter,HpdMJaKaXXc,Let's try to learn a thing
,,or two about ratios. So ratios are just expressions
,,that compare quantities. So that might just be a fancy
,,way-- let me just --of saying something that you may
,,or may not understand. So let me give you
,,actual examples. If I have 10 horses
,,and I have 5 dogs. And someone were to come to
,,"me and say Sal, what is the ratio is of horses to dogs? So I want to know how many"
,,horses do I have for some number of dogs. So I could say I have 10
,,horses for every 5 dogs. So I could say the ratio of
,,horses to dogs is 10:5. Or I could also write
,,that as a fraction. I could say the ratio of
,,horses to dogs is 10/5. Or I could just write it out. I could say it is 10 to 5. These all are saying
,,"the same thing. And the thing I write first,"
,,"or the thing that I write on top, is the number of horses. So this is the number"
,,of horses right there. That's the number of horses. And that's all the
,,number of horses. If I wanted to talk about the
,,"number of dogs, this is the number of dogs, that's the"
,,"number of dogs, or that's the number of dogs. I'm just-- These are all"
,,"just expressions that are comparing two quantities. Now, I just said I have 10"
,,horses for every 5 dogs. But what does that mean? That means I have 5
,,horses for every 1 dog. Sorry. Not 5 horses for every 1 dog. It means I have 2 horses
,,"for every 1 dog, right? If for 5 dogs I have 10, that"
,,"means that for every 1 of these dogs, there are 2 horses. For every one of-- every 2 of"
,,"these horses, there's 1 dog. I just kind of reasoned"
,,through that. So this is-- I have 2
,,horses for every 1 dog. But how do you get there? How do you get
,,from 10:5 to 2:1? Well you can think of what's
,,the biggest number that divides into both of these numbers? What's their greatest
,,common divisor? I have a whole video on that. The biggest number that divides
,,into both of these guys is 5. So you divide both of them by 5
,,"and you can kind of get this ratio into a reduced form. And if I write it here, it"
,,would be the same thing as 2/1 or 2 to 1. And so what's interesting about
,,"ratios, it isn't literally, or doesn't always have to be"
,,"literally, the number of horses and the numbers of"
,,dogs you have. What a ratio tells you
,,is how many horses do I have for every dog. Or how many dogs do I
,,"have for every horse. Now, just to make things clear,"
,,what if someone asked me what is the ratio of dogs to horses? So what's the difference
,,"in these two statements? Here I said horses to dogs. Here I'm saying dogs to horses. So, since I've switched the"
,,ratio-- What I'm looking for-- I'm looking for the ratio
,,"of dogs to horses, I switch the numbers. So dogs-- For every 5"
,,"dogs, I have 10 horses. Or if I divide both of"
,,"these by 5, for every 1 dog, I have 5 horses. So the ratio of dogs to"
,,horses is 5:10 or 1:5. Or you could write it this way. 1 to-- I can write it-- Let
,,me write it down here. 1/5. Or I could write 1 to 5. And the general convention--
,,This wouldn't be necessarily incorrect. That's not wrong. But the general convention is
,,"to get your ratio or your fraction, if you want to call"
,,"it that, into the simplest form or into this reduced"
,,form right there. Let's just do a couple
,,of other examples. Let's say I have 20 apples. Let's say I have 40 oranges. And let's say that I
,,have 60 strawberries. Now what is the ratio of apples
,,to oranges to strawberries? I could write it like this. I could write what is the ratio
,,of-- I'll write it like this --apples:oranges:strawberries? Well I can start off by
,,"literally saying, well for 60 strawberries-- for every 60"
,,"strawberries, I have 40 oranges and I have 20 apples. And this would be legitimate. You could say the ratio"
,,"of apples to oranges to strawberries are 20:40-- Sorry. 20:40:60. And that wouldn't be wrong. But we saw before, we could"
,,put into reduced form. So we think of what's the
,,largest number that divides into all three of these? We can't just do it into two of
,,these now because now my ratio has three actual quantities. Well the largest number
,,"that divides into all of these guys is 20. If we divide all of them by 20,"
,,"we can then say for every 1 apple, I now have-- you divide"
,,"this guy by 20 --I have 2 oranges, and I have"
,,3 strawberries. So the ratio of
,,"apples to oranges to strawberries is 1:2:3. And I got that, in every"
,,"case, by just dividing these guys all by 20. I divided by 20. I think you get"
,,the general idea. If someone were to ask you
,,what's the ratio of-- Let me just write it down because it
,,never hurts to have a little bit more clarification. If someone wanted to know
,,the ratio of strawberries to oranges-- Let me get
,,into my orange color. Strawberries to
,,oranges to apples. I thought I was going
,,"to do that in yellow. To apples. What is this ratio going to be? Well for every 3 strawberries,"
,,I have 2 oranges and I have 1 apple. So then it would be 3:2:1. The general idea is whatever
,,"order someone asks you for the different items, you put-- the"
,,"ratio is going to be in that same exact order. Now, in all of the examples so"
,,far I gave you the number of quantity-- the quantity of
,,things we had and I-- we figured out the ratio. What if it went the other way? What if I told you a ratio? What if I said the ratio of
,,boys to girls in a classroom is-- Let's say the ratio
,,of boys to girls is 2/3. Which I could've also written
,,"as 2:3 just like that. So for every 2 boys, I have"
,,"3 girls or for every 3 girls, I have 2 boys. And let's say that there are"
,,40 students in the classroom. And then someone were to ask
,,you how many girls are there? How many girls are
,,in the classroom? So this seems a little
,,bit more convoluted than what we did before. We know the total number of
,,students and we know the ratio. But how many girls
,,are in the room? So let's think
,,about it this way. The fact that the ratio
,,of boys to girls-- I'll write it like this. Boys-- Maybe I'll be
,,stereotypical with the colors. The ratio of boys to
,,"girls is equal to 2:3. Hate to be so stereotypical,"
,,but it doesn't hurt. 2:3. The ratio of boys
,,to girls is 2:3. So this stands for every
,,"3 girls, there's 2 boys. For every 2 boys,"
,,there's 3 girls. But what does it also say? It also says for every 5
,,"students, there are what? There are 2 boys and 3 girls. Now why is this"
,,statement helpful? Well how many groups of
,,5 students do I have? I have 40 students in my
,,"class right there, right? I have 40 students in my class. And for every 5 students,"
,,there are 2 boys and 3 girls. So how many groups of
,,5 students do I have? So I have a total
,,of 40 students. Let me do it in
,,this purple color. I have 40 students and then
,,there are 5 students per group. And I figured out that group
,,"just by looking at the ratio. For every 5 students, I"
,,have 2 boys and 3 girls. How many groups of 5
,,students do I have? So that means that I have 8
,,groups-- 40 divided by 5 --I have 8 groups of 5 students. Now we're wondering how
,,many girls there are. So each group is going
,,"to have 3 girls. So how many girls do I have? I have 8 groups, each"
,,of them have 3 girls. So I have 8 groups times 3
,,girls per group is equal to 24 girls in the classroom. And you could do the same
,,exercise with boys. How many boys are there? There's a couple of
,,ways you could do it. You could say for every
,,"group, there are 2 boys. There's 8 groups. There's 16 boys. Or you could say"
,,there's 40 students. 24 of them are girls. 40 minus 24 is 16. So either way you
,,get to 16 boys. And if you want to pick
,,"up a fast way to do it. It would be identical. You'd say look, 2 plus 3 is 5. For every 5 students,"
,,"2 boys, 3 girls. How many groups are there? You say 40 divided by 5"
,,is equal to 8 groups. Every group has 3 girls. So you do 8 times 3 is
,,equal to 24 girls. Let's do one that's a little
,,bit harder than that. Let's do one where I say that
,,the ratio of let's say-- Well let's go back
,,to the farm example. The ratio of sheep--
,,I'll do sheep in white. The ratio of sheep to--
,,I don't know --chickens to-- I don't know. What's another farm animal? --to pigs. The ratio of sheep to chicken
,,to pigs-- Maybe I should just say chicken right there. The ratio of sheep to chicken
,,to pigs-- Or chickens. I should say chickens. Is-- Let's say the
,,"ratio is 2:5:10. And notice, I can't"
,,reduce this anymore. There's no number that
,,divides into all of these. So this is the ratio if
,,sheep to chickens to pigs. And let's say that I have
,,a total of 51 animals. And I want to know how
,,"many chickens do I have. Well we do the same idea. For every 2 sheep, I have 5"
,,chickens and I have 10 pigs. That tells me for every 17
,,"animals-- So every group of 17 animals, what do I have? And where did I get 17 from? I just added 2 plus 5 plus 10. For every 17 animals,"
,,"I'm going to have-- Let me pick a new color. I'm going to have 2 sheep,"
,,"5 chickens, and 10 pigs. Now, how many groups of"
,,17 animals do I have? I have a total of 51 animals. So if there's 17 animals per
,,"group, 51 animals divided by 17 animals per group. I have 3 groups of 17 animals. Now I want to know"
,,how many chickens. Every group has 5 chickens. We already know that. And I have 3 groups. So I have 3 groups. Every group has 5 chickens. So I'm going to have 3     
,,"times 5 chickens, which is equal to 15 chickens. Not too bad. All I did is add these up and"
,,"say for every 17 animals, I've got 5 chickens. I've got 3 groups of 17. So for each of those"
,,"groups, I have 5 chickens. 3 times 5 is 15 chicken. You could use the same process"
,,to figure out the number sheep or pigs you might have.

Perimeter,hC6zx9WAiC4,Let's think a little bit
,,about the volume of a cone. So a cone would have
,,"a circular base, or I guess depends on"
,,how you want to draw it. If you think of like a
,,"conical hat of some kind, it would have a"
,,circle as a base. And it would come to some point. So it looks something like that. You could consider this to
,,"be a cone, just like that. Or you could make it"
,,upside down if you're thinking of an ice cream cone. So it might look
,,something like that. That's the top of it. And then it comes
,,down like this. This also is those
,,disposable cups of water you might see at
,,some water coolers. And the important
,,things that we need to think about when we want to
,,know what the volume of a cone is we definitely want to
,,know the radius of the base. So that's the
,,radius of the base. Or here is the radius
,,of the top part. You definitely want
,,to know that radius. And you want to know
,,the height of the cone. So let's call that h. I'll write over here. You could call this
,,distance right over here h. And the formula for the
,,"volume of a cone-- and it's interesting, because it's close"
,,to the formula for the volume of a cylinder in a
,,"very clean way, which is somewhat surprising. And that's what's"
,,neat about a lot of this three-dimensional
,,geometry is that it's not as messy as
,,"you would think it would be. It is the area of the base. Well, what's the"
,,area of the base? The area of the base is
,,going to be pi r squared. It's going to be pi r
,,squared times the height. And if you just multiplied
,,"the height times pi r squared, that would give you the volume"
,,of an entire cylinder that looks something like that. So this would give
,,you this entire volume of the figure that
,,"looks like this, where its center of the top is"
,,the tip right over here. So if I just left
,,it as pi r squared h or h times pi r
,,"squared, it's the volume of this entire can,"
,,this entire cylinder. But if you just want the
,,"cone, it's 1/3 of that. It is 1/3 of that. And that's what"
,,I mean when I say it's surprisingly clean that
,,this cone right over here is 1/3 the volume of this
,,cylinder that is essentially-- you could think of this
,,cylinder as bounding around it. Or if you wanted
,,"to rewrite this, you could write this as 1/3"
,,"times pi or pi/3 times hr squared. However you want to view it. The easy way I remember it? For me, the volume of a"
,,cylinder is very intuitive. You take the area of the base. And then you multiply
,,that times the height. And so the volume of a
,,cone is just 1/3 of that. It's just 1/3 the volume
,,of the bounding cylinder is one way to think about it. But let's just apply
,,"these numbers, just to make sure that it"
,,makes sense to us. So let's say that this is
,,"some type of a conical glass, the types that you might"
,,see at the water cooler. And let's say that
,,we're told that it holds 131 cubic
,,centimeters of water. And let's say that we're
,,told that its height right over here-- I want to do
,,that in a different color. We're told that the height of
,,"this cone is 5 centimeters. And so given that,"
,,what is roughly the radius of the
,,top of this glass? Let's just say to the
,,"nearest 10th of a centimeter. Well, we just once again"
,,"have to apply the formula. The volume, which is"
,,"131 cubic centimeters, is going to be equal"
,,"to 1/3 times pi times the height, which is 5"
,,"centimeters, times the radius squared. If we wanted to solve"
,,"for the radius squared, we could just divide both"
,,sides by all of this business. And we would get
,,radius squared is equal to 131 centimeters
,,"to the third-- or 131 cubic centimeters,"
,,I should say. You divide by 1/3. That's the same thing
,,"as multiplying by 3. And then, of course, you're"
,,going to divide by pi. And you're going to
,,divide by 5 centimeters. Now let's see if we
,,can clean this up. Centimeters will cancel out
,,with one of these centimeters. So you'll just be left
,,with square centimeters only in the numerator. And then to solve
,,"for r, we could take the square"
,,root of both sides. So we could say that
,,r is going to be equal to the square root of--
,,3 times 131 is 393 over 5 pi. So that's this part
,,"right over here. Once again, remember"
,,we can treat units just like algebraic quantities. The square root of
,,"centimeters squared-- well, that's just going to be"
,,"centimeters, which is nice, because we want our"
,,units in centimeters. So let's get our calculator
,,out to actually calculate this messy expression. Turn it on. Let's see. Square root of 393 divided by 5
,,"times pi is equal to 5-- well, it's pretty close. So to the nearest, it's"
,,pretty much 5 centimeters. So our radius is approximately
,,"equal to 5 centimeters, at least in this example."

,5ZCKr4wTQvI,Find the perimeter
,,of the parallelogram. And we have a parallelogram
,,right over here. Opposite sides are parallel. That side is parallel to
,,that side right over here. This side is parallel
,,"to that side over here. And also in a parallelogram,"
,,"opposite sides have the same length. Now, we have to worry about"
,,"the perimeter here, which essentially just says that"
,,if we had a field the size or the shape of
,,"this parallelogram, and we wanted to make a"
,,fence around the field that was the shape of this
,,"parallelogram, how long would that fence have to be? And obviously, it"
,,would be the sum of the lengths of the sides. So we wouldn't
,,even have to worry about this thing
,,right over here. We could ignore it for
,,the sake of that problem. We don't care about
,,"the actual height, or this altitude"
,,right over here. We just care about the
,,lengths of its sides. So the perimeter of
,,this parallelogram is going to be 12
,,inches plus 8 inches plus 12 inches plus 8 inches. 12 plus 8 is 20. 12 plus 8 is 20. So this is all going
,,to add up to 40 inches. And we're done. I guess this is a
,,"very small field, because it's only 8 inches. I guess it would be a"
,,"little plot of land, a little parallelogram"
,,"plot of land. Anyway, we're done. Its perimeter is 40 inches"

,ZyOhRgnFmIY,- [Teacher] A candy machine
,,"creates small chocolate wafers in the shape of circular discs. The diameter, the diameter of"
,,"each wafer is 16 millimeters. What is the area of each candy? So, the candy, they say it's"
,,"the shape of circular discs. And they tell us that the diameter of each wafer is 16 millimeters. So if I draw a line across the circle that goes through the center, "
,,"the length of that line all the way across the circle through the center is 16 millimeters. So let me write that, so"
,,"diameter, the diameter here is 16 millimeters and"
,,"they want us to figure out the area, the area of the"
,,"surface of this candy. Or essentially the area of this circle. And so when we think about area, we know that the area of a"
,,"circle, the area of a circle is equal to pi times the"
,,"radius of the circle squared. Times the radius of the circle squared, and you say, well they"
,,"gave us the diameter, what is the radius? Well, you might remember the radius is half of diameter, so"
,,"distance from the center of the circle to the outside,"
,,to the boundary of the circle. So it would be this
,,"distance right over here, which is exactly half of the diameter. So, it would be eight millimeters. So, where we see the radius,"
,,"we could put eight millimeters. So the area is going to be equal to pi times eight millimeters squared, which would be 64, 64 square,"
,,"64 square millimeters. And typically, this is"
,,"written with pi after the 64, so you might often see it as this is equal to 64 pi, 64 pi millimeters squared, millimeters squared, millimeters squared. Now, this is "
,,"the answer,"
,,"64 pi millimeters squared, but sometimes it's not so satisfying to just leave this pi, you might say, ""Well, I wanna get a"
,,"estimate of what number ""this is close to, I wanna"
,,"decimal representation of this."" And so we can start to use"
,,"approximate values of pi. So, the most rough"
,,"approximate value that tends to be used is saying that pi, a very rough approximation"
,,"is equal to 3.14. So in that case, we could"
,,"say that this is going to be equal to 64, 64"
,,"times 3.14 millimeters, millimeters squared and"
,,we can get our calculator to figure out what this
,,will be in decimal form. So we have 64 times 3.14 gives us 200.96. So we could say that the area
,,"is approximately equal to, approximately equal to"
,,"200.96 square millimeters. Now, if we wanna get a more"
,,"accurate representation of this, pi actually just keeps going on and on and on forever, we"
,,could use the calculator's internal representation of pi. In which case we'll say 64 times and then we have to look for
,,"the pi in the calculator, it's up here in this yellow so I'll do this little second"
,,"function, get the pi there, every calculator will"
,,"be a little different. But 64 times pi, now we're going to use the calculator's internal"
,,"approximation of pi, which is going to be"
,,"more precise than what I had in the last one and you get 201, so let me put it over"
,,"here so I can write it down, so a more precise is 201,"
,,"and I'll round, I'll round to the nearest, I'll round"
,,"to the nearest hundredth so you get 201.06, so 201, so more precise is 201.06 square millimeters. So this is closer to the actual answer 'cause a calculator's       "
,,representation is more precise than this very rough
,,approximation of what pi is.

Perimeter,XxPw1uieViU,hello grade 8 children today I'm here to teach you a geometry lesson with you that's chapter 2 perimeter so what is perimeter so we'll take figures like this what's 
,,this one a triangle circle a square so these are called closed plane figures when you take one place you can go round and come to the same position in this one also 
,,you can start from any place and come to the same position so we call these a plane closed figures or closed plane figures then what about these figures these are open plane figures so we are finding perimeter perimeter of closed plane figures so what is perimeter means the outer distance of a closed plane figure so when you start from here any place you can come to the same position here so you take the total distance so we'll see what are the properties in perimeter and we'll take several plane figures in this lesson so perimeter is the total length of the boundary of a closed rectilinear plane figure is called the perimeter of the figure units of perimeter what are the units so this is about a length so we use measurements as length so what are the measurements we use for length millimeter centimeter meter and 
,,kilometer so what's the relationship between these measurements so you know when you take the small ruler so one centimeter is equal to ten millimeters and when you 
,,take the meter ruler you can divide into hundred parts that means 100 centimeter is 1 meter then if you take kilometers that's thousand meters is equal to one kilometer now select the appropriate units according to the size of the figure so if you want to measure a smaller length you take some times millimeter centimeters a bigger length meters so when you take distance of a rod or something bigger ones we use kilometres so you need to know which one to choose now what's the shape a square 
,,square means all sides are equal and this is four-sided figure each angle is 90 degrees so if you want to find out the perimeter of this figure so we start from one 
,,place go round and come to the same posture so what's the perimeter of this square if the length of one side is L so it's easy we take letters for words like length 
,,we can take L letter perimeter we can take peel it so if one side is L so starting from here L plus L plus L plus L so these are like terms you can add L for times when you are adding you get full L so what's the perimeter of the square if you know one side is L for L so we can use this formula to find out the perimeter of a square we'll use that one in this question find the perimeter of a square with length 12 now we know L is 12 we need to find out P P stands for perimeter so we can use 
,,the formula for L that means 4 times L L is 12 4 times 12 you get 48 what's the unit that's centi meters look at the second question find the perimeter of a square plot of land where one side is 20 meters now L is 20 at least 20 P we need to find so you can use the formula for L 4 times 20 that's 80 what's the unit meter so we can put 80 meters this one find the perimeter of a square board with side lengths to 0.3 meters so L is 2.3 PE we need to find use the formula for L 4 times 2.3 how we multiply 4 times 3 12 one remaining and 4 times 2 8 + 1 9 that's in meters so nine point two meters the perimeter of a square shape land is 48 meters find the length of one side now the other way around giver so perimeter is given P is given 48 and you're asked to find out L so we can find length of one side that's L is the total perimeter is 48 how you find one side you have to divide by four because P equals four L if you want to find L you divide by four to get n so P divided by four 48 divided by 4 you get the length of one side four times 1/4 and here to 12 meters the perimeter of a square cardboard is 88.8 centimeters find the length of one side again how you find out length of one side I can write L equals P over 4 P is given 88.8 centimeters and you need to find out so P is 88.8 divided by 4 so you get twenty two point two centimeters for length off one side look at this one find the length of one side of a square where the perimeter is 64 point four same thing P is given 64 point four and you are asked to find out the lid so a length of one side is P 64 point four divided by four have you divide four times one for two remaining four twenty four that's four times six twenty four and four times 1/4 so you get this is in sin T meters now what's this shape this is called a rectangle so pair of opposite sides are equal so we called the longer length longer side we called along the side as left shorter man as brick so L stands for length and B stands for bread or sometimes we call wick so how we find out the perimeter of a rectangle now starting from this place L plus B plus L plus B L plus B plus L plus B you can add like terms too well plus 2b now we see that two is common so you can take it out and inside I can write L plus B so I can explain this one as if you separate these 
,,two lengths what you get yeah I want to find out the length of this part that's L plus V I get two parts like that so L plus B here and L plus B this side so twice of that twice of L plus B so you can use this formula to find out the perimeter of a rectangle look at this one find the perimeter of a rectangular plot of 18 meters 
,,long and 14 meters wide so that means L is 18 B is 14 and you're asked to find the perimeter so what's the formula two times L plus B substitute L is 18 B is 42 times at these 2 8 plus 4 12 and 32 when you multiply you get 64 meters find the perimeter of the rectangle which is 24 meters long and 18 meters wide 24 is L breakfast 
,,18 and perimeter you need to find you can use the formula now substitute 24 plus 18 add these 2 8 plus 4 12 1 remaining 3 plus 1 4 2 times 42 84 but the unit meters 
,,look at this one find the perimeter of the rectangle with the length of 12 point 7 at least 12 point 7 and a width of 9.2 so what's the formula 2 L plus b2 times L twelve point seven and nine point two just add the decimal values it's easy to write in a column and add 7 plus 2 9 9 plus 2 11 so twenty one point nine so two times 
,,twenty one point nine have you multiplied ignore the decimal and first x - 2 times 9 18 one remaining 2 times 1/2 plus 1/3 2 times 2 4 then one decimal place you have to keep so I can keep here so forty three point eight meters a rectangular flowerbed is 7.2 meters long and three point four meters wide find the parameter L is the longer side seven point two why breath with me the width three point four P is the parameter we need to find so what's the formula two times length plus breadth two times here seven point two plus three point four add it together seven point two and three point four when you add it you get ten point six ten point six times two here brackets means multiplication two times six twelve one remaining so here two times one two so put a decimal point here and you are getting twenty one point two meters as the perimeter of this rectangular flowerbed the length of a rectangular piece of land is three times its width so if it's X this should be 3x find its length and breadth if the perimeter is 88 so what we can write in this 3x B is X so we need to find out the perimeter so use the formula P equals 2 times L plus B so parameter is given 88 so I can write this is 88 so here I can substitute 88 here so 2 times L is 3 X I break this X now like terms add 2 times 3 X plus X is 4 X is 88 
,,4 times 2 8 8 X equals 88 how can we find out X you divide by 8 so X is equal to 88 divided by 8 that's in a van meters so X is 11 meter so you ask to find its length and brick so what's length length is 3 X that means 3 times 11 33 what's the breath breath is equal to X that's 11 meters the length of a rectangular piece of land is 4 times its width find its length and breadth if the perimeter is 400 meters now if breadth is X this is 4 times that means 4x what's the perimeter 400 that's given so now you can use the form in a perimeter is equal to 2 times L plus B here this side we can write because this is the unknown side X we need to find 2 times 4 
,,"X plus X is 400 for X and X you get 5 X 2 times 5x 402 times 5 is 10 X is 400 divided by 10 you can get X so x equals 40 now X is 40 means what's the length length is 4 X that means 4 times 40 that's 160 centimeters no 160 meters breath is X that's 40 meters look at this one how many square float eyes with a side length 40 centimeters are required to fit a rectangular flow that is 12 meters and 6 meters what now we'll look at the length side what's the length 12 meters now the length of one side of a tile is given in centimeters so this is in meters so what's the first thing you can convert to the same unit we'll convert meters to centimeters length is 12 meters convert to centimeters there you need to multiply by 100 100 times 12 1,200 centimeters the number of floor tiles required for the length side if you keep tires this way only lengths side how many tiles we need the length of a tile is 40 centimeters so we need to divide by 40 take the length in centimeters divided by "
,,one side of the tire for you get thirty tiles along this side you need what about with now now you need to fit this way the width is 6 meters convert to centimeters 
,,this is 600 multiplied by hundred now how many tiles along the width you need 600 divided by 40 40 is the length of one tire you get 60 divided by 4 is 15 tiles we need this way so this way we need 15 tiles now what's the total number of tiles you need you need here this side 30 this side 15 30 times 15 so multiply by 3 putting 
,,0 3 times 5 15 3 times 1/3 plus 1/4 all together 450 tiles you need now this is one method of finding number of tiles but you can use another method what's the second method by finding the area of a tile so you can find the area of the flow and area of fun tile and divide now in this case you can use this but if it's a circular 
,,tile or something you can't use the area method because that's not fitting exactly with the flow you get gaps there so make sure that this way is easy to do for any 
,,type of tile this one how many square flow tiles with a side length 20 are required to fit a rectangular flow that is 10 meters long and 4 meters wide similar question so what's the length they are 10 meters convert to centimeters because the tie length is in centimeters so multiply by 100 you get thousand centimeters so what's 
,,the number of ties required for the length side you take the limp divided by length off one tile that's 20 you get 50 tiles you need what's the width 4 meters convert to centimeters that's 400 centimeters so how many tiles required for which side take the length divided by length of one tile that's 400 so you get 20 tiles you need so this way length side how many tiles 50 tiles and here 20 tiles so altogether you need fifty times twenty so thousand tiles you need for this flow this question find the breadth of the rectangle if the perimeter is 120 and the length is 36 and you need to be what's the formula perimeter of a rectangle tone times L plus B is equal to P now substitute to 36 plus B we need to find out B P is hundred 20 so divide the whole equation by 2 you get 36 plus B is equal to 120 divided by 2 you get 60 now how you find B subtract 36 from both sides so subtract 36 60 minus 36 so what's 60 minus 36 4 and your 4 5 6 24 is the answer what's the answer with units 24 meters so that's the breadth of this rectangle look at this question if the perimeter of a rectangle with a length 48 meters is hundred forty meters find its width so length is 48 perimeter is 140 you are asked to find B so you know the formula 2 into L plus B is P now substitute to 48 is L plus B is equal 240 divide the whole equation by 2 to get cancel out you get 48 plus B equals 70 140 divided by 2 now how we find B subtract 40 8 from both sides so subtraction means you subtract 48 here so 70-48 you get 22 the unit is meters so 22 meters for breath this question find the length of a rectangular board with width of 22 now with this given 22 and the perimeter is 140 you asked to find it let's now use the formula here 140 this is 2 times L is unknown B is 22 divide the whole equation by 2 to get cancel out you 
,,get L plus 22 is equal to 70 now take away 22 from both sides l equals 70 minus 22 that's 48 48 meters is the answer for length you can write here also 48 this question a rectangular frame of Y is formed by a square as shown above find it's one side length so rectangular frame this one you can create a square from this so you asked to find out the length of one side of this square so X is the length now we need to find out the perimeter because this is a wire around this rectangle so what's the perimeter of the rectangle you can find out using the formula so we know length is 48 breadth is 12 so substitute 2 times 48 plus 12 2 times 60 so 120 is the perimeter of the rectangle so that is equal to the perimeter of the square as well so length of one side is perimeter divided by 4 because all the inside the equal 4x 
,,is the perimeter of this square so divide by 4 you and find length of one side X that's thirty hundred twenty divided by four that's thirty what's the unit centimetres equilateral triangles so we did perimeter of a square perimeter of a rectangle now this is equilateral triangle what is equilateral means all sides are equal if this is a this is also a this is also a and what's the other property in equilateral triangle each angle is 60 degrees now we will find out the perimeter of this equilateral triangle start from one place go around a plus a plus a so what's that like terms Eddie sure you get three a so what's the perimeter of an equilateral triangle you can take one side and multiply by three find the length of one side of the triangle by dividing the perimeter of an equilateral triangle by three you can get 
,,one side so a equals P divided by three look at the question here this is an equilateral triangle with length eight centimeters so you asked to find the perimeter so what's the perimeter you can use the formula 3 L 3 times 8 that's 24 centimeters this question find the perimeter of an equilateral triangle which is 11 meters in length three-year is the formula L means given 11 so 3 times 11 that's 33 meters find the perimeter of an equilateral triangle which is eleven point three centimeter 
,,in length so this is an equilateral triangle you can use P equals three times L three times eleven point three three times 3 9 3 times 1/3 3 times 1/3 that's in centimeters find the length of one side of an equilateral triangle where its perimeters 30.6 now other vira so what you have to do you have to divide by three so P is given so how do you find L P divided by 3 so substitute 30 point six divided by three one zero two so ten point two centimeters is the length of one side of an equilateral triangle find the length of one side of an equilateral triangle where its perimeter is forty eight point nine so perimeter is given 48 point now that's three L 
,,so three l equals P forty eight point nine is three L how can we find out L divide this by three so you get L equals divided by this tree if you can't divide like this you can take separately and divide three times 1/3 18 that's six nine so here you have to keep the decimal place first and 4/9 that's 3 3 times 3 9 0 so 16.3 so length of one side is sixteen point three centimeters now this is any triangle so what you call this scalene all sides are different means scalene triangle what's the other type of triangle isosceles also the isosceles means two sides are equal so this is scaling one side is a the other side is B and the other one is C so how we 
,,find out the perimeter of the scalene triangle just add the three lengths a plus B plus C now we'll take this example a scalene triangle is given and you asked to find the perimeter so just add 9 plus 12 plus 7 9 plus 2 11 11 plus 7 18 and with this 2 that's 28 centimeters is the perimeter of this scalene triangle find the perimeter of the triangle whose sides are 12 10 and 9 so perimeter is just a plus B plus C adding all three lengths 12 plus 10 plus 9 what's the answer 11 and one two three so 31 centimeters find the perimeter of the triangle in which the sides are 20 point three eighteen point four and sixteen point seven so how do you find out the 
,,perimeter just add the three values if you can't add it it's better to write in a column and at say 1 + 3 10 14 1 remaining 8 + 6 14 + 1 51 remaining 3 4 5 so fifty 
,,five point four fifty five point four centimeters is the perimeter of this scaling triangle this one parameter is given that's 90 you are asked to find out one leg we can find these two 30 plus 27 is 57 now 57 plus x equals 90 I'll write x plus 57 is 90 because the perimeter is given as 90 so X is take 57 away that means subtract 57 from both sides 90 minus 57 so you get three one remaining six and here 333 centimeters is the x value what is this triangle I told you two sides are equal isosceles triangle perimeter of the triangle below is 34 centimeters find X so make a formula X plus X plus 10 that's the total distance in this triangle that's called perimeter that's equal to 34 X onyx becomes 2x now subtract 10 from both sides 2x equals 34 minus 10 when you subtract you get 24 is 2 X divided by 2 both sides X is 
,,equal to 12 so length of X is 12 centimeters if the perimeter of the triangle below is 45 centimeters fine lengths of each side of the triangle 3 X 2 X 4 X what's the ID sure that's the perimeter that's 45 like terms at 4 plus 2 6 +3 9 X equals 45 divided by 9 you can find out X so X is equal to 5 if x equals 5 what's this one so we'll take this one as so ABC triangle so a B is 3 X B C is 4 X and C a 2 X so a B is 3 times X X is 5 that's 15 centimeters BC 4 X 4 times 5 thats 20 centimeters 
,,and this one is C a 2 X 2 times 5 10 centimeters find the perimeter of the quadrilateral below this is quadrilateral means four-sided plane figure so how do you find out the perimeter when you start from one point you can go around and take the total distance that's called the perimeter so we can find out just adding all these numbers 8 plus 7 plus 9 plus 11 11 plus 9 20 28 plus 7 you get 35 centimeters this is also a quadrilateral what you call that trapezium if the these two lines are parallel we call that's a trapezium find the perimeter of the trapezium below yeah these lengths are equal if this is 8 this is also 8 this is also 8 we'll just add all the lengths 8 plus 8 plus 8 plus 12 12 plus 8 20 20 plus 16 36 centimeter is the unit this one similar to that one this is X X X find the value of x if the perimeter of the trapezium is 53 so we can write down X plus X plus X 3 X 3 X is equal to what 3 X plus 20 all right down 3x plus 20 is the perimeter now perimeter is given 
,,as 53 so what can you do subtract 20 from both sides you get 3x so 53 minus 20 you get 33 so 3x is equal to 33 have you find X you divided by 3x is equal to 11 so what's the unit centi meters look at this question a hundred and twenty centimeter long wire was cut into two equal pieces and she arc between our cheese and sujud from there argit made an equilateral triangle and Sujit made a square find the side length of the collateral triangle and the side length of the square so what's the total length of the wire 120 so what is one piece it's equally divided into two parts so 120 divided by 2 is 1 5 thats 20 centimeters so our jig has 16 120 divided by 
,,2 that 60 centimeters so a jet has 60 centimeters and Sujit also has 60 centimeter wire so how you find out one side of the equilateral triangle we know all sides are equal you know the perimeter 60 divided by 3 you get one side of the equilateral triangle that's 20 centimeters how can we find out the length of one side of a square square you get both sides equal sides so you have to divide by four so 60 divided by four you get 15 centimeter is the length of one side of a square now we will look at perimeter of composite closed rectilinear plain figures so combination of two or more figures what are the figures we did we did square rectangle triangle equilateral scalene to find out the perimeter now we look at this one two squares with side lengths eight combined and make a rectangle shown below fine its perimeter now if you take these two separately what's the parameter perimeter this one is one side is 8 so 40 times 8 here also 4 times 8 so 4 times 8 plus 4 times 8 so 32 plus 32 64 centimeters you are getting if you take separately these two squares when combining squares one side or laps with another side what happens this side and this side or laps and it's the inside length of the rectangle now if you want the perimeter of the new figure you can't take this net so outer length means this one so when combining squares one side overlap with another side so what's the perimeter of the rectangle how many eighths are there now one two three four five six now earlier eight now two sides overlapped and it's in the tangle so you can't take those two sites so we can check it so we'll see how many eighths are there 1 2 3 4 5 6 
,,so 8 times 6 48 centimeters so that combined figure has 48 centimeter as the perimeter of that rectangle find the perimeter of joint site formed by joining three squares that are 8 centimeters in length all sides are 8 centimeters now this is the combined figure there are 4 sides in one square we know that there are 4 sides total number of sites for three squares 4 times 3 that's 12 12 sides are there number of joint sides touching each other now if you take this one that's this one 1 and here half here half here another one so 2 this one 3 4 this square and this side 4 so 4 let's overlap and these are inside the figure so you can't take four lengths number of joint sides touching each other is for now so perimeter of the composite figure now how many sides all together earlier 12 sides four sides inside now 12 minus 4 8 8 times 8 but we'll check that out with finding lengths outside starting from one place how many eighths are there 1 2 three four five six seven and this half and this half eight so we can say eight times eight 64 centimeters is the perimeter of the combined figure shown in the figure are two identical cards of six centimeters length and three centimeter with they combined and formed a large rectangle find the perimeter of the rectangle so this is the combined figure the two sides shown by the dotted lines are located inside the image so here this side overlaps with this one now find the perimeter so we'll take outer length of this one so how many threes are there 1 2 3 times 2 how many Sixers are there 1 2 3 4 6 times 4 3 times 2 6 6 times 4 24 24 plus 6 30 centimeters is the perimeter of this combined frikkin find the perimeter of the figure below 2 sides of the 3 centimeter are located inside the figure yeah this one is overlap so we can't take that length so how we find out the perimeter so we'll take outer length how many threes are there 1 2 3 4 3 times 4 how many 6 is 1 2 3 six times three now add it 3 times 4 12 6 times 3 18 you get 30 30 centimeter is the perimeter of the combined shape find the perimeter of the figure below it's given one and a half and one and a half is three so we'll start from this point how many sixes are there 1 2 3 6 times 3 how many threes are there 1 2 3 and these two another one for 3 times 4 so 6 times 3 18 3 times 4 12 when you add it together you get 30 centimeters as the perimeter of the combined figure so I can highlight this is one and a half and be a happy took as one unit that's 3 centimeter unit find the perimeter of the figures which is aligned with the square and rectangle shown below this is a square with length 4 rectangle length 8 and breadth 4 centimeters so they combine and you can't take the inside length for pairing it only outside boundary so we'll take how many sides are 4 yeah 4 1 2 3 & 4 so 4 times 4 and what about 8 1 2 8 times 2 so 4 times 4 16 8 times 2 16 you get 32 centimeters further perimeter of the combined figure look at this combined figure two sides four centimeter are located inside the figure so this side overlaps so that's inside we can't take it now we'll find out the perimeter of this figure we'll start four centimeter sides one two three four five and we'll take these two separately so four times four then eight one only one so 8 times 1 + 2 x2 + 2 you can write 2 times 2 now add it all sides are taken 2018 - 1 8 + 4 so you get 32 centimeter as the perimeter of the combined figure this one here 2 sides 4 centimeter long I located inside this one you can take it now take the outer length 4 centimeter ones 4 1 2 3 4 5 6 6 times 4 and 1 8 centimeter long length times 1/6 times 4 24 + 8 you get 32 centimeters as the perimeter of the combined figure find the perimeter of the joint triangle and the rectangle shown below so these two sides over laughs and this is inside so you can't take that length so we'll check out a length 1 2 3 3 times 4 centimeter length and 8 1 to 2 times 8 4 times 3 12 and 16 you get 28 centimeter as a parameter of the combined figure this one find the perimeter of the figure formed by combining four triangles of sight four centimeters to a 
,,square so you can't take these four sides that's inside so we check outside length all lengths are 4 centimeter so we'll count how many fours are there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 4 times 8 32 so the perimeter is 32 centimeters this one find the perimeter of the combined figure you can't take this one that's inside how many 12 are there 1 + 2 + 3 3 times 2 then how many Force 1 to 4 times then what is this slap now look at carefully this total length is 12 and this height is 4 so what's this length 12 
,,minus 4 12 minus 4 is 8 you get 8 centimeter length for this one so you need to add that length here now we took all sides did we take all sides no yeah we missed one length 1/2 yeah this is 3 so we'll multiply 4 times 3 here now it's correct so 3 times 12 36 4 times 3 12 and 8 and 12 plus 8 20 and this is 56 centimeters this one to trapeziums together find the perimeter so don't take inside land only outside length you have to take 4 perimeter so how many 6 centimeter legs are there 1 2 3 
,,4 4 times 6 how many 10 legs are there 10 centimeter length 1 2 so 6 times 4 24 plus 20 you get 44 centimeters using square and triangle the following figure is formed find the perimeter so this is the combined one so don't take the inside let so how we find out the perimeter how many fours are there 1 two three four four four and then five point six is this set four times four 16 plus five point six and it together you get point 6 and 6 plus 5 6 plus 5 11 and so twenty one point six centimeters now two rectangles and one square perimeter of the rectangle so this is length is 8 and breadth is 4 so 2 times 8 plus 4 2 times 12 24 perimeter of the square 
,,4 times 4 16 centimeters now we'll see find the perimeter of the combined figure back now combine all three shapes so you are not getting these two inside lens now so how we find out the perimeter you can find out how many fours are there 1 2 three oh five six seven eight eight four and how many eighths are there one to two times eight now add it together eight times for 32 and 16 you get 48 centimeters so 48 centimeter is the perimeter this one again same length a 10-4 so this is 8 and this is 4 now in this one we can't take this part this part the inside let's we'll find out outside length how many fours are there one two three four five six seven eight eight fours how many eighths are there one and two now we can add it two times eight 32 and 16 48 centimeter this is the perimeter of this combined figure perimeter of the rectangle here 8 is length and breadth is 3 so what's the perimeter 2 times L plus B 2 times 8 plus 3 11 so 22 centimeters is the perimeter of this rectangle de la Vega is formed using three rectangles above so same rectangles before now when you combine all together you get inside length so you can't take these ones 
,,so what's the outer length outer length will count how many threes the breadth is 3 centimeters 1 2 3 4 4 times 3 how many eighths 1 2 2 times 8 now how we find out 
,,this length total length is 8 and this is 3 8 minus 3 this is 5 and here also so 5 & 5 that's twice then we missed one length here these two get one and another two 
,,eights so altogether four so I'll erase this one and write for this one should be 4 4 times 8 4 times 3 12 32 and 10 you get 4 here and 554 centimeters is the perimeter of this combined figure what is this shape one two three four five six six sided plane figure hexagon so find the perimeter one side of this figure is four so parameter is full into 6 because 6 sides are there 24 centimeters now look at the perimeter of the combined figure so combining three hexagons but nothing happens nothing overlap so you can take 24 times 3 so 24 times 3 is the perimeter of this combined one so just attached from here only so not overlapping sides so 3 times 4 12 1 remaining 3 times 2 6 plus 1 7 so 72 centimeter is the perimeter of this combined figure now in this one how many sides come by here two sides one from this one and one from another to another to another to another - so how many sides overlap 2 4 6 8 10 sides overlap earlier how many sides were there 6 times 3 6 times 3 hexagons 6 times 3 80 now 4 if you take separately 6 times for 24 and 10 sides overlap actually you are getting 14 sites we'll check that out so it's better to always take 
,,outer lengths now we will see how many fours are there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 so 14 sides are correct so either you can use this method or this method but 
,,I think better to take outer length and find the perimeter four times for 16 and 4 times 1/4 plus 156 centimeter is their combined parameter find the perimeter here 
,,so what are the lengths given here if you take this one fourteen point one four fourteen point one four so fourteen point one four times two then what are the other 
,,lengths twenty another twenty twenty times two and here are ten and ten totus now don't take these two inside lengths you can't take four perimeter now multiply 2 times 4 8 2 times 1/2 again 8 and 2 20 times 2 42 times 10 20 so when you add it together you get fine to wait there and 8 4 plus 2 6 6 plus 2 8 so 88.2 8 centimeters 
,,look at this one now you get a circle part as well find the length of the circle if the perimeter is 40 now we know that perimeter is 50 centimeters given length of 
,,two lines 14 and 14 14 times 2 that 28 centimeters now how can we find out the circle length length of this pot we call that an arc arc length length of the circle is 50 minus 28 so here I'll write 28 here so this one is length of the circle is 50 minus 28 that's 22 centimeters now look at this one as shown in the figure above the boundary of 400 meter long flow path find the length of the two circles so the whole thing is 400 meters so this is 90 meters this is 90 meters so what's the perimeter given 400 meters so length of both sidelines this line is 90 this is also 92 times 90 that's 180 meters so length of the circular area so this one and this becomes the perimeter - the two lengths so perimeter is 400 - 180 you get 220 meters is the length of circular paths this one and this one so that's the length we are not taking these two this one the perimeter of the given figure is 70 point 4 find the length of a smaller semicircle we are lengths of bigger circle which is thirty 
,,point two so this part is thirty point two centimeters given we are asked to find the smaller one so this one is same as this one because this side is equal to this 
,,one so what's the perimeter given 70 point four and what's the length of large semicircle 30 point two lengths of small semicircle is you have to subtract the two values so seven two point four minus thirty point to do it here seventy point four thirty point to subtraction you get here forty point two this is in centimeters now 
,,the length of one of the smallest semicircle so this is two semicircles is this much so what about one semicircle you have to divide this by two you get twenty point one centimeter is the length of one semicircle find the perimeter of a smaller semicircle when the perimeter of the compound figure is ninety point six so all three sides are equal means this is equal to this one is equal to this one all lengths of semicircles are equal so perimeter is given 90 point six centimeters so what's the length of one of the smaller semicircle you have to divide this by three because parameter means three lengths we are not considering inside let's so take ninety 
,,point six divided by three it's one length thirty point two centimeters is their length off one semicircle now we will look at review exercise find the perimeter of 
,,each of the figures given below so this is an equilateral triangle one length is five centimeters so what's the perimeter perimeter is five times three that's 15 centimeters this is isosceles triangle this is six and this is six as well so what's the perimeter here 6 plus 6 plus 4 10 10 plus 6 16 centimeters this one is a scalene triangle just active since 5 plus 6 plus 7 7 plus 5 12 12 plus 6 18 centimeters this is a square one length is 6 so what's the perimeter 4 times 6 because there are 4 equal sides in a square so 24 centimeters this is the rectangle opposite sides are equal so what's the formula 2 times L plus B length and breadth so two times length is 10 breath this for 2 times 14 you get 28 centimeters what's a shape here trapezium this is 5 this is also 5 so what's the perimeter perimeter is add all the lids 5 + 6 + 5 + 8 10 18 + 6 24 centimeters question number 2 the perimeter of a square shape wall tile is 160 so the perimeter is 160 how many such tiles are needed for one lengthwise row of a wall of length 4 meters if the tires are to be fixed without any gaps between them so what's the length of the wall is equal to 4 meters multiply by 100 you get 400 centimeters now we'll find out one side of a tile one side of a tile because the perimeter is given hundred 60 divided by 4 you get one side of a child then you can find how many tiles needed you know them twice number of tiles needed length twice 400 divided by 40 so you need ten tiles for this way question number three if the perimeter of the rectangular shaped paddy field of length forty meters this is 40 meters and we don't know the breadth but the perimeter is given 130 so parameter is given 130 length is 40 and you need to find out the breath use the formula P equals 2 times L plus B perimeter is 132 times 40 plus B 
,,divide both sides by 2 let's get canceled out under 30 divided by 2 65 then subtract 40 from both sides you get B equals 65 minus 40 that's 25 meters question number 4 the length of a rectangular shaped wall tile is greater than its breadth by 10 centimeters if the breadth of the tile is 15 fine its perimeter so what's the length length is 10 centimeter more than the brick so length is 15 plus 10 that's 25 centimeters breadth is given 15 centimeters and you asked to find out that parameter 
,,so formula is 2 times L plus B 2 L is 25 B is 15 when you add it together 2 times 40 80 centimeters is the perimeter question number 5 there are two pieces of wire of length 6 two centimeters each amali makes an equilateral triangle by bending one of these pieces of wire son Domini makes a square find the length of side of equilateral triangle made by amali and find the length of the side of the square made by Sun Domini so there are two pieces of wire so the length of the wire is 60 centimeter each so if this is equilateral triangle you get three sides so what's the length of one side of an equilateral triangle 60 divided by three that is 20 centimeters now we'll look at the square square has four sides equal sides so what's the length of a square 60 divided by four so 15 centimeters question number six the length and breadth of a rectangular shape flowerbed are seven meters L three meters how many square shaped bricks of length 25 centimeter each are needed to place one row of bricks around the flower bed without any space left between the bricks so around this flowerbed seven meters and three meters now we'll see lengthwise how many bricks are needed so this is Lindt is 7 meters convert to centimeters you get 700 centimeters so number of bricks lengths twice so here one brick is 25 centimeter long so 700 divided by 25 so 25 times 254 200 so you would get 8 so 28 bricks lengthwise then how many bricks needed for this side number of bricks for bread side 300 is the length divided by 25 what's that 25 and 450 that's 2 but we know when you are taking the tiles here how many tiles on up here yeah 2 tiles overlap yeah so that means you have to take you have to subtract how many times one two three four tiles you have to subtract after you taking the total length so we'll take that so if 
,,you take number of a bread side this so actually if we take out these two how many ties are there you need 10 tiles so we'll find out the total number of trials needed twenty-eight this way and twenty-eight this way as well and here you have to subtract two from here to from there so actual one is 20 minus 2 and 20 minus 2 there what's the total so 10 10 20 30 40 50 60 60 plus 16 you get 76 all together the total number of tiles needed around this is 76 so this is one method we found using 
,,perimeter seven plus three this one but you need to subtract for a number of tiles because that's overlapping each other if you take the perimeter what's the second 
,,method you can do perimeter of this figure is 700 plus 300 into 2 2 times L plus B so what's that mm is the total length then divide by 4 divide by the length of the tire 25 so you can find number of tiles is equal to u divided by 25 and then you have to subtract again for from that let's see what you get 25 times a 80 minus 4 76 this way also you get the same of tax question number seven the length of a rectangular shape playground is twice its breadth if the perimeter of the playground is 360 meters fine its length L its breadth so we'll put X from X for bread and twice 2x for length and it's 2x and B is X now use the formula 2 times L plus B is P 2 
,,times 2x plus x equals 360 divided by 2 2 X and X becomes 3x 360 divided by 2 180 so divide this by 3 you get x equals 60 so X is the length of the size of the brick so what's the unit so this is bread 60 meters and what's the length then length is 2 times of 60 120 meters example number one calculate the perimeter of each of the figures below so these are all combined figures so rectangle and a equilateral triangle combined together and you ask to find the perimeter so when you take the perimeter you are taking only outer lengths so we'll take the first one how many sevens are there 1 to 2 times 7 how many trees are there 1 2 3 so 1 times 2 14 and 9 23 centimeters this one we take 6 6 1 only 1 6 if you take 8 1 2 2 weights then how many force 1 2 2 4 and then you get 10 6 plus 8 times 2 16 4 times 2 8 and 10 add 
,,it together 12 1 remaining so here 6 + 6 12 12 plus 8 22 remaining 2 3 4 40 centimeters part three so you need to find out the perimeter of the figure so we will find out separately gh gh is high five centimeters a B what's the length yeah total length is 5 this is 2 Phi minus 2 3 so divided equally so this is one and a half and one and a half so what's a B 1 then 1/2 or 1.5 so we can dry find out five minus two divided by two so one and a half or 1.5 will write 2 times a B this I do know now 2 times a B a B is 1 point 5 multiplied by 2 you get 3 centimeters so this is 3 centimeters so what's the perimeter 5 this one yeah we will see how many fives are there 1 2 3 3 5 so I multiply this by 3 5 3 times then 2 1 2 3 then 1 and 1/2 and one and a half we get 3 that's all so you can multiply 15 and 324 this is in centimeter so very meeting is 24 centimeters exercise to 0.1 calculate the perimeter of each of the figures given below so we'll see how many sides are there with five centimeter length 1 2 3 4 5 5 times 5 25 centimeters is the parameter this one 1 to 2 times 5 7 1 to 2 times 7 10 plus 14 that's 24 centimeters look at this figure combination of 2 rectangles so what's the perimeter you take 6 lengths 1 2 3 3 times 6 when it comes to 2 1 2 & 3 2 times 3 and then you need to find out this length so how do you find out that length 6 minus 2 you get 4 centimeters so you need to add four there 6 into 3 18 6 plus 4 10 and 18 that's 28 centimeters now look at this 
,,one this is a good question you have given this side for this one 5 so this is a rectangle and now the rectangle we don't know the lengths okay think about this one 
,,this length and this length when you add what you get the total length for so take this length and move it up so you get here this left move it there what you get this is same as a rectangle so length is five breakfast for so what's the perimeter perimeter is two times four plus five two times nine 18 centimeters this one we let all limbs yeah this is also similar to the previous question if you move this one up actually this is a rectangle and you get extra two let's but we'll add it together this is 12 this is 10 and this is 10 10 times 2 4 4 4 that's 12 and this 4 and this 4 you get another 8 when you add it 12 12 24 24 20 and 8 so you get 52 centimeters take this one here this is 11 here can you see this length is equal to this length so this is 8 now we can find out the perimeter perimeter is equal to 11 plus 8 and another 8 2 times 8 five and four now add it together eleven plus 16 plus five and four sixteen one remaining two three so 36 centimeters for the parameter this figure all lengths are given so this is given and which side not given here this is 90 degrees means this is four and this is for same length this is like a rectangle so all lengths we know this is 5 this is also hot now we'll find out the perimeter 15 and this is 15 15 times 2 how many fours are there 1 2 3 4 4 times how many fives are there 1 2 now what about this one this length this is equal to this given 6 now we'll find out the length 6 1 2 3 4 4 times 6 now add it together 30:16 10 and 24 one remaining here 4 5 6 7 8 80 centimeters this is a trapezium you have given all let's hear this is same as this one this is thirteen point four now you can find the forum Peter thirteen point four two times this is twelve thirteen and five here multiply two times four eight six and two twenty six point eight plus here this is 3 plus 2 5 5 5 10 and 30 so add it together you get point eight and six with five fifty six point eight that's in meters question number two a figure of a

Perimeter,AAY1bsazcgM,"Hi! Welcome to Math Antics. In this lesson, were going to learn about an important concept in Geometry called Perimeter. Perimeter is just a fancy math term that "
,,means the distance (or length) around a shape. ...but
,,what exactly does the distance around a shape mean? Well... distance (or length) is a 1-dimensional quantity that we can measure with units like
,,"centimeters, inches or miles. That means that perimeter is also a 1-dimensional quantity that we can measure with units of length. For example, the perimeter of a shape wouldnt be just 10, but it could be 10 cm. Or, instead of being just 25, it could be 25 miles. The units are REALLY important"
,,"when youre talking about perimeter! Okay, but what exactly do we mean by,"
,,around a shape? It seems like there would be a lot of different ways
,,to go around a shape. Some of them would be short
,,"and some of them would be very long. Well, perimeter means the absolute shortest distance possible around a shape. That would be the distance youd get if you traced the path exactly around the border (or edge) of a shape. A good way to see what perimeter is, is to imagine that you could walk right along the edge of a shape, like this 5-sided polygon. Imagine starting at one of the polygons vertices and then walking along each side until you got all the way back to the point that you started from. The total distance you traveled would be the perimeter of that shape. In this case, if the length of each side of the polygon was 10 meters, the total length you would travel along all 5 sides would add up to 50 meters. Another good way to see what perimeter is, is to imagine that you could take a shape, like this square, and break it at one of its corners. Then, you could unfold the shape until it formed a straight line.  The length of that line is the perimeter of the shape. Doing this helps you understand why perimeter is a 1-dimensional quantity, even though it applies to 2-dimensional shapes like this square. Its 1-dimensional because its the distance of the lines that go around the 2-dimensional shape. Okay, so now that you know what perimeter is, how do we measure or calculate it for different geometric shapes? Well... that depends on the shapes. Finding the perimeter of shapes that have curves, like circles or hearts or things like that, can be tricky. In fact, well wait and talk about the perimeter of a circle in another video. In this video, were just going to focus on how to find the perimeter of polygons. Since polygons are made from only straight sides, its easy to find their perimeter. If you know the length of each side, all you have to do is add them up, and the total length you end up with is the perimeter of the polygon. Lets try doing that with a few examples so you see how it works... the first polygon well try is a triangle. "
,,"This triangle has three sides that are each a different length: 3cm, 4cm and 5cm. Now, to find the perimeter of the triangle, all we have to do is add up the lengths of those three sides. 3 + 4 + 5 = 12 But dont forget.  Its not just 12. Its 12 centimeters. Always remember to also put down the units of the perimeter. Okay, that was easy.  Lets try another one. This time our polygon is a rectangle.  And you can see that the shorter sides are each 5m long and the longer sides are each 10m long. So... lets add them all up. We can add up the sides in any order we want to, as long as we dont forget any sides or accidentally count any of them twice. And I think Ill add up the two short sides first. 5 + 5 = 10 Next, Ill add up the two longer sides. 10 + 10 = 20 And now, if I add up those two answers, Ill get the total for all 4 sides. 10 + 20 = 30 So, the perimeter of this rectangle is 30 METERS! Ha!  You thought I was going to forget my units, didnt you. Not this time! Ah, heres another good example. This is a 6-sided regular polygon. A regular polygon means that all its sides are exactly the same length. Thats good because this diagram only shows the length of ONE side. (4 cm). But since the polygon is regular, we know that all the sides must also be 4 cm long. Now, we could just add up "
,,"all the sides like we did before, but since they are all the same, we can use multiplication as a shortcut. Thats because multiplication is really just repeated addition. All we have to do is multiply the number of sides (6) by the length of the sides (4 cm). 6 x 4 = 24 so that means the total perimeter must be 24. 24 what?    "
,,"                                 . Ooo - Centimeters !!! Thats better.                            . And this formula works for ANY regular polygon, no matter how many sides there are. If the sides are ALL THE SAME LENGTH,  you can just multiply the number of sides by the side length, and you have the perimeter! Okay, let's try "
,,one more example. This polygon also has six sides but its NOT a regular polygon. The sides are different lengths and this ones really tricky because they only show us
,,the length of four of the sides. The other two are missing!
,,"So how can we figure them out? Problems like this come up all the time in math; problems where you arent quite given all the information. When you have this kind of problem, the key is to use what you DO know to figure out what you DONT know.  Heres what I mean... Look closely at the two vertical sides that we DO know the lengths of (4 inches and 6 inches) Now... imagine that those two vertical sides could be moved straight across to the other side... the side that we dont know the length of. By doing that, you can see that the missing length would just be the combination of the two vertical lengths we DO know: 4 inches and 6 inches. And since 4 + "
,,"6 = 10, the missing vertical side must be 10 inches long. Notice that we can do the same thing for the horizontal sides that we do know. If we imagine those moving down to the side that we dont know, we see that its length must equal the combination of those two lengths. 10 inches plus 5 inches equals 15 inches. There, weve used the lengths that we DID know to figure out the lengths that we DIDNT know. And now that we know the length of ALL the sides, we can just add them all up to get "
,,"the perimeter. 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 And then 15 + 15 = 30 30 + 10 = 40 and last of all, 40 + 10 = 50 So, the sum of all the sides is 50 inches."
,,"Thats the perimeter of this shape. And thats the end of this lesson. Weve learned that Perimeter is the distance (or length) around a geometric shape, and weve learned how to calculate it for any polygon. You just add up the lengths of all the sides and the total length is the perimeter. Oh... and dont forget your units! Also, dont forget that to get good at math takes practice!

Perimeter,cl24nzYi57Q,vol area and perimeter okay we are going to mainly focus this period on working with the perimeter and the area of these basic shapes please copy the following into 
,,your books we want to know what is the parameter and what is the area let's have a look again okay please remember the perimeter is the total distance around the outside of a shape okay the perimeter of a circle we refer to as the circumference so please take note of that we don't say the perimeter of a circle we refer to it as 
,,the circumference of a circle and the area that is the amount of surface area a certain shape covers let's have a look at the formula that you need to know of these 
,,following basic shapes the first one a square or a rectangle they both sort of share the same formulas just maybe applied a little bit differently so we uh put them 
,,all into one slide together let's have a look you all right the perimeter of a rectangle is square as we just add all the four sides together okay with a square you 
,,can also say side times four and with a rectangle you can say length times 2 + breathe comes - but the easiest way just to remember it is you add all the sides together you and for the area its length times breath let's have a look at the triangle please take note of the base and the height the height is always perpendicular to 
,,the base so what that means is the height is always it meets the base at a 90 degree angle okay and those two form the base and the height please take note that sometimes the height lies outside of the triangle in your textbook there's a very good example of that where the triangles a little bit skewed so the base is still meets the height at a 90 degree angle but the height sometimes lie outside the triangle it's not always on top of or on the triangle the perimeter of a triangle again is 
,,just where you add all the sides together you and the area is 1/2 times base times height or you can use base times height divided by 2 and then the circle please take note the diameter it always is a straight line that crosses through the the middle and the mid center or the center of the circle the midpoint it has to cross through there and that if it goes from the one side of the circle the circles edge all the way to the other side that is the diameter if I cut it in two so it goes from the midpoint all the way to the edge of the circle then we refer to it as the radius you the perimeter of a circle or sorry I should have put it there the circumference of the circle is two times pi times radius or squash together standing together 2 pi R 2 pi radius the perimeter also referred to as their circumference you and the area is pi times radius squared PI R squared

Perimeter,xCdxURXMdFY,"Hi, welcome to Math Antics. In our last geometry video, we learned that "
,,"all 2-dimensional shapes have a 1-dimensional quantity called Perimeter which is basically the outline of the shape. In this video, we're going to learn that these shapes also have a 2-dimensional quantity called Area. To help you understand what Area is, let's start by imagining a line that's 1 cm long. Now, let's imagine moving that line in a perpendicular direction a distance of 1 cm. But while we move it, it leaves a trail almost like the end of a paint brush. By moving the 1-dimensional line that way, we formed a 2-dimensional shape, and all of the space (or surface) that we covered along the way is the Area of that shape. which as you can see here is just a square. Ok, but how much area does this square have? Well, our original line was 1 cm long, and we moved it a distance of 1 cm, so we could say that this shape is a square centimeter. Just like a centimeter is a basic unit for measuring length, a square centimeter is a basic unit for measurement for area. But there are other units for area too. For example, instead of a centimeter, what if our line had been a meter long, and then we moved it 1 meter? The area we'd have gotten "
,,"would be 1 square meter! Or, what if it was a mile long, and we moved it a mile!?  We'd have a square mile of area. So, just like with perimeter, the units of measurement are very important when we're talking about area! Alright, so that gives you a good idea of what area is, but how do we calculate area mathematically? Well, there's some special math formulas (or equations) that we can use to find the area of different shapes. In this video, we're going to learn the formula for squares and rectangles and the formula for triangles. To find the area of any square or rectangle, all we have to do is multiply its two side dimensions together. They're usually called the length and the width, so the formula looks like this: Area equals length times width. But it's often written with just the first letters of each word as abbreviations: A for Area, L for Length and W for Width. So let's see if that formula works for our original square centimeter. If we multiply the length (1 "
,,"cm) times the width (1 cm), what do we get? Well, 1 x 1 is just 1, but what about cm x cm? Cm x cm just gives us square centimeters, which we can write like this using a '2' as an exponent. We read this as ""centimeters squared""  and it's just a shorter way of writing cm x cm. So whenever you see units like centimeters squared, or inches squared, or meters squared, or miles squared, you know it's a measurement of the 2-dimensional quantity area. Ok, our formula (area equals length times width) worked for our square. Now let's see if it works for a rectangle. Here's a rectangle that's 4 cm wide"
,,"and 2 cm long (or tall) First, we plug the length and width into our formula (2 cm and 4 cm) Then we just multiply 2 x 4 equals 8 and cm x cm is cm squared. So, according to our formula, the area of this rectangle is 8 centimeters squared. And we can see that's correct if we bring back our original square centimeter. If we make copies of it, you can see that exactly 8 of those square centimeters would be the same area as this rectangle. Great, let's try our formula on one more rectangle. This rectangle is 2 cm long but only half a centimeter wide. And our formula (area equals length times width) tells us that we just need to multiply those two sides together to get our area. Two times one-half equals one. So this rectangle is also 1 square centimeter. How can it be a square centimeter?"
,,"It's not even a square! Ah - but just because a shape takes up 1 square centimeter of area, that doesnt mean it has to be a square shape. It just means that the total area would be equal (or the same) as a square centimeter. You can see that if we break the rectangle in half and rearrange it, then it would form a square. In fact, we can use square units (like square centimeters) to measure ANY area, no matter what the shape is. It could be a rectangle, a triangle, a circle"
,,"or ANY other 2-dimensional shape. Okay, now that you know how to find the area of any square or rectangle using our formula, we're going to learn the formula for finding the area of any triangle. But to do that, we're going to start with a rectangle again. The dimensions of this rectangle are 3 m by 4 m. So what's it's area? Well, using our formula,  we know that the area would be 3 m x 4 m which is 12 meters squared. But now, what if we were to cut this rectangle exactly in half along a diagonal line from opposite corners? It forms two triangles! And because each of these triangles is exactly half of the rectangle, that means that the area of either "
,,"triangle must be exactly half of the area of the rectangle. We already calculated that the area of the entire rectangle is 12 meters squared, so the area of this triangle must be 6 meters squared, and the area of this triangle must be 6 meters squared, since 6 is half of 12. Ah ha!  So the formula for the area of a triangle should just be half of the rectangle. So does that mean that instead of, ""Area equals length times width"" , it should be, ""Area equals one-half of length times width"" ? "
,,"Yep!  That's basically it, but with one important difference. Instead of 'L' for Length and 'W' for Width, we're going to use two different names for our triangle's "
,,"dimensions. We're going to call them ""Base"" and ""Height"""
,,"and here's why. The names ""Length"" and ""Width"" worked okay for this right triangle because a right triangle is exactly half of a rectangle. But those names don't really work for other kinds of triangles like acute triangles or obtuse triangles. Because how do you tell which side should be which? So for triangles, we do something different. First we choose one of the three sides to be the ""Base"". It doesn't really matter which side you choose, and in a lot of math problems, the base will already be chosen for you. Once we decide which side the base is, we imagine setting the triangle down on the ground so that its base is flat on the ground, like this "
,,"Next, we find the highest point of the triangle, which is the vertex that's not touching the ground. From that point, we draw a line straight down to the ground. The line we draw must be perpendicular with the ground. The length of that line (from the tip of the triangle to the ground) is called the ""height"" of the triangle. Oh, and some people call the height of a triangle the ""altitude"" which makes a lot of sense if you pretend that your triangle is a tiny little mountain. Sometimes the height line is inside the triangle, like with an acute triangle. And sometimes it's outside the triangle, like with a obtuse triangle. And sometimes,"
,,"it lines up exactly with one of the triangle's sides, like with right triangles. But no matter where it is, the formula for finding the area of ANY triangle is the same: Area equals one-half base times height. So, if we know those two measurements (base and height), we can just plug them into the formula to calculate the area. At first, you might not see how the same formula could work for all three types of triangles, but watch this Here's an acute triangle and this box is one-half its base times its height. If we cut our triangle up, you can see that it fits perfectly inside that area. But wait, there's more! Here's an obtuse triangle with a box that's one-half its base times its height. Again, if we cut up the triangle, . it fits perfectly inside the box Now you can see how the formula, area equals one-half base times height, works for ANY kind of triangle. Okay, we already figured out that the area of this right triangle was 6 square meters, so let's practice using our new formula to calculate the area of these last two triangles. Our diagram shows that the base of this acute triangle is 5 m and it's height is 8 m. So we plug those "
,,"values into our formula for area and we get area equals one-half of 5 times 8. 5 times 8 is forty and one-half of 40 is 20, so the area of this triangle is 20 meters squared. Don't forget that the units of measurement for area will always be square units! Okay, that was pretty simple.  Let's try our last example. The diagram of "
,,"this obtuse triangle tells us that the base is 4 inches, and the height is 7 inches, so let's plug those values into our formula. We end up with the equation: area equals one-half of 4 times 7. 4 times 7 would be 28, and then we can calculate what one-half of 28 would be by dividing by 2. 28 divided by 2 is 14, so the area of this obtuse triangle must be 14 square inches. Okay, now you know all the basics of area. You know that area is a 2-dimensional quantity that we measure in square units. You've learned the formula for calculating the area of any square or rectangle: ""Area equals length times width"". And, you've learned the formula for calculating "
,,"the area of any triangle: ""Area equals one-half of the base times height"". But don't forget to practice what you've learned by working some problems on your own. That's how you really get good at math! As always, thanks for watching Math Antics,"

,,sides are smaller than other two sides here we have a rectangle with its length and breadth mention let's find its parameter here the length of this rectangle is 7 centimeters and the breadth of this rectangle is 3 centimeters now let's find it parameter formula to find the parameter in case of a rectangle is 2 times length plus breadth that is 2 multiplied with the sum of length of breath here length is 7 centimeters breadth is 3 centimeters playing the values we get 2 x 7 plus 3 2 x 10 2 
,,x 10 equals 20 centimeters so perimeter of this rectangle is 20 centimeters now let's take another example here we have another rectangle with its length and breadth mentioned length is 5 centimeters breadth is 4 centimeters now let's find it parameter we no parameter is two multiplied by the sum of length and breadth so putting the values of length and breadth in formula parameter equals two x five plus four parameter equals two x nine so parameter equals 18 centimeters now let's learn how to find the area of rectangle here we have a rectangle let's find its area formula to find the area of a rectangle is very simple just multiply length with breadth 
,,length x Brett so area of rectangle is a product of its length and breadth so putting the value we get area equals 7 x 3 area equals 21 centimeters squared remember 
,,area is always mentioned in square units now let's solve a few questions on based of what we learned 1 will be the area of rectangle with breadth 5 centimeters and length 9 centimeters we know area of rectangle is length x breadth and length and breadth are 9 x 5 centimeters so area equals 45 centimeters square now let's solve another question find the length of a given rectangle having area as 195 meters square and breadth 13 meters we know length x breath equals area putting the values we will get length x 13 equals 195 breath is teen meters and area is 195 meters square so we have this in the form of a mathematical equation solving this mathematical equation we get length equals 195 divided by 13 195 divided by 13 is 15 so like this 15 centimeters now let's solve another question how would you find the difference between the parameter and area of the rectangle measuring 8 meters by 4 meters we have to find the difference between parameter and area so first we have to find 
,,the parameter and area of this rectangle so putting the values we get parameter equals 2 multiplied with the sum of 8 and 4 so we get 2 multiplied with 12 that is 24 centimeters so we got the parameter now let's find the area we know area of a rectangle is length multiplied with breath putting the values we get 8 multiplied with 4 equals 32 centimeters square so we got the area 2 now we have to find the difference between the area and the parameter and we know we subtract the smaller thing 
,,from the bigger thing here the bigger one is area so let's subtract the parameter from area area is 32 centimeters square and parameter is 24 centimeters 32 minus 24 equals 8 centimeters so difference between area and perimeter of this rectangle is 8 centimeters now let's solve another question here we have a grid where each cell is of measure 1 centimeter by 1 centimeter or each small square has side 1 centimeter we have to find how many cells in rows and columns together would make a square of parameter 20 centimeters first let's try to understand the question we have to find how many cells in rows and columns will make a square of parameter 20 centimeters parameter 20 centimeters means side x 4 equals 20 centimeters first of all find the side of the square whose parameter is 20 centimeters so side of square would be 20 divided by 4 equals 5 centimeters so a square with side 5 centimeters will have parameter 20 centimeters so we have to find the square with side 5 centimeters this is the grid with side 5 centimeters as each square has side 1 centimeter so 5 squares will make a side 5 centimeters this square is made up of 25 squares so 
,,our answer is 25 squares let's answer another question the length and breadth of the rectangle is given below in the figure find the cost of fencing on the boundary 
,,at the rate of $12 per centimeter we have to find the cost of fencing on boundary so first we need to find the parameter of this rectangle and we know parameter is 2 times the sum of length plus breadth 2 multiplied by 7 plus 4 equals 2 multiplied by 11 equals 22 centimeters so the parameter of this rectangle is 22 centimeters and we are given cost of fencing the boundary is 12 dollars per centimeter and we have to find the cost of fencing 22 centimeters we will multiply 22 with 12 to get the cost of fencing 22 centimeters as the boundary is 22 centimeters long cost of fencing 1 centimeter is $12 so cost of fencing 22 centimeters will be 12 x 22 equals 264 dollars so kids let's revise what we have learned we have learned parameter of square is 4 times the side parameter of rectangle is 2 times length plus breadth 
,,area of square is side square or side x side area of rectangle is length times the prep that is and in case of a rhombus and square it's same as a square so kids now you may go ahead take a quiz to learn more toot way has thousands of animated videos on math English and science to clear the core basics of these subject

Perimeter,NwO363dyeOg,Barry meter today let's learn how to find the perimeter of a polygon the word parameter comes from two Greek words Perry and Metron Perry means around and Metron means measure thus parameter is the total distance of all the sides of a closed plane bigger hence it is found by adding the length of all the sides of a closed clean bigger today we will learn how to find the perimeter of the polygons triangle rectangle and square using formulas let's start with the triangle a triangle has three sides side a side B and side C to find the perimeter of a triangle we add the lengths of all its sides thus perimeter of a triangle is equal to a plus B plus C let's 
,,find the perimeter of a triangle having the dimensions P is equal to 7 meters Q is equal to 8 meters and R is equal to 10 meters we know that perimeter of a triangle is equal to the sum of the lengths of all its sides which is equal to P plus Q plus R that is 7 plus 8 plus 10 which is equal to 25 meters thus perimeter of the triangle is equal to 25 meters now let us look at the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle we have already learned that a rectangle has both sides where in its opposite sides are equal in length thus the perimeter of rectangle is equal to length plus length plus dred plus bread therefore perimeter is equal to 2 into L plus 2 into B where L is the length and B is the breadth which is equal to twice or length plus spread now let's find the perimeter of a rectangle having the dimensions length is equal to 18 kilometers and Brett is equal to 12 kilometers using the formula perimeter of the rectangle is equal to 2 into in brackets 18 plus 12 is equal to 2 
,,into 30 which is 60 kilometers thus the perimeter of the rectangle is 60 kilometers finally let's look at the parameter of the square we know that the lens of the both sides of a square are the same thus the perimeter of a square can be calculated by adding all the four sides of a square thus parameter of the square is equal to 
,,s plus s plus s plus s which is equal to four times the length of a side now let's find the perimeter of a square having sides or ten centimeters using the formula perimeter of the square is equal to AU into 10 which is equal to 40 centimeters thus parameter of the square is 40 centimeters wasn't it easy to find the parameters of these polygons you

Perimeter,LoaBd-sPzkU,What I want to do in this video
,,is a fairly straightforward primer on perimeter and area. And I'll do perimeter
,,"here on the left, and I'll do area"
,,here on the right. And you're probably pretty
,,"familiar with these concepts, but we'll revisit it"
,,just in case you are not. Perimeter is
,,essentially the distance to go around something
,,or if you were to put a fence around
,,something or if you were to measure-- if you were to
,,"put a tape around a figure, how long that tape would be. So for example, let's"
,,say I have a rectangle. And a rectangle is a figure that
,,has 4 sides and 4 right angles. So this is a
,,"rectangle right here. I have 1, 2, 3, 4 right angles. And it has 4 sides,"
,,and the opposite sides are equal in length. So that side is going to be
,,"equal in length to that side, and that side is equal"
,,in length to that side. And maybe I'll label the
,,"points A, B, C, and D. And let's say we"
,,know the following. And we know that
,,"AB is equal to 7, and we know that"
,,"BC is equal to 5. And we want to know, what"
,,is the perimeter of ABCD? So let me write it down. The perimeter of
,,rectangle ABCD is just going to be equal to the sum
,,"of the lengths of the sides. If I were to build a fence, if"
,,"this was like a plot of land, I would just have"
,,to measure-- how long is this side
,,"right over here? Well, we already know"
,,that's 7 in this color. So it's that side right
,,over there is of length 7. So it'll be 7 plus
,,"this length over here, which is going to be 5. They tell us that. BC is 5. Plus 5. Plus DC is going to"
,,"be the same length is AB, which is"
,,"going to be 7 again. So plus 7. And then finally, DA a or AD,"
,,"however you want to call it, is going to be the same length"
,,"as BC, which is 5 again. So plus 5 again. So you have 7 plus 5 is 12"
,,plus 7 plus 5 is 12 again. So you're going to
,,have a perimeter of 24. And you could go the
,,other way around. Let's say that you
,,"have a square, which is a special case"
,,of a rectangle. A square has 4 sides and 4 right
,,"angles, and all of the sides are equal. So let me draw a square here. My best attempt. So this is A, B, C, D. And"
,,we're going to tell ourselves that this right
,,here is a square. And let's say that this
,,"square has a perimeter. So square has a perimeter of 36. So given that, what is the"
,,"length of each of the sides? Well, all the sides are going"
,,"to have the same length. Let's call them x. If AB is x, then BC is x,"
,,"then DC is x, and AD is x. All of the sides are congruent. All of these segments"
,,are congruent. They all have the same
,,"measure, and we call that x. So if we want to figure"
,,"out the perimeter here, it'll just be x plus x"
,,"plus x plus x, or 4x. Let me write that. x"
,,"plus x plus x plus x, which is equal to 4x, which"
,,is going to be equal to 36. They gave us that
,,"in the problem. And to solve this, 4"
,,"times something is 36, you could solve that"
,,probably in your head. But we could divide
,,"both sides by 4, and you get x is equal to 9. So this is a 9 by 9 square. This width is 9. This is 9, and then the height"
,,right over here is also 9. So that is perimeter. Area is kind of a
,,measure of how much space does this thing take
,,up in two dimensions? And one way to think about area
,,"is if I have a 1-by-1 square, so this is a 1-by-1 square--"
,,"and when I say 1-by-1, it means you only have"
,,to specify two dimensions for a square or a rectangle
,,"because the other two are going to be the same. So for example, you could"
,,call this a 5 by 7 rectangle because that immediately
,,"tells you, OK, this side is 5 and that side is 5. This side is 7,"
,,"and that side is 7. And for a square, you could"
,,say it's a 1-by-1 square because that specifies
,,"all of the sides. You could really say,"
,,"for a square, a square where on one side is 1,"
,,then really all the sides are going to be 1. So this is a 1-by-1 square. And so you can view
,,the area of any figure as how many 1-by-1 squares
,,"can you fit on that figure? So for example, if we were going"
,,"back to this rectangle right here, and I wanted to find out"
,,the area of this rectangle-- and the notation
,,we can use for area is put something in brackets. So the area of rectangle
,,ABCD is equal to the number of 1-by-1 squares we can
,,fit on this rectangle. So let's try to do
,,that just manually. I think you already
,,might get a sense of how to do it a little bit quicker. But let's put a bunch of 1-by-1. So let's see. We have 5 1-by-1 squares
,,this way and 7 this way. So I'm going to try my
,,"best to draw it neatly. So that's 1, 3, 3,"
,,"4, 5, 6, and then 7. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. So going along one of the"
,,"sides, if we just go along one of the sides like"
,,"this, you could put 7 just along one side just like that. And then over here,"
,,how many can we see? We see that's 1 row. And that's 2 rows. Then we have 3 rows and
,,"then 4 rows and then 5 rows. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. And that makes sense because"
,,"this is 1, 1, 1, 1, 1. Should add up to 5. These are 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1. Should add up to 7. Yup, there's 7. So this is 5 by 7. And then you could"
,,"actually count these, and this is kind of straight"
,,forward multiplication. If you want to know the
,,"total number of cubes here, you could count it, or you can"
,,"say, well, I've got 5 rows, 7 columns. I'm going to have 35--"
,,did I say cube-- squares. I have 5 squares in this
,,"direction, 7 in this direction. So I'm going to have"
,,35 total squares. So the area of this figure
,,right over here is 35. And so the general
,,"method, you could just say, well, I'm just going to"
,,take one of the dimensions and multiply it by
,,the other dimension. So if I have a
,,"rectangle, let's say the rectangle is"
,,"1/2 by 1/2 by 2. Those are its dimensions. Well, you could"
,,"just multiply it. You say 1/2 times 2. The area here is going to be 1. And you might say, well,"
,,"what does 1/2 mean? Well, it means,"
,,"in this dimension, I could only fit 1/2"
,,of a 1-by-1 square. So if I wanted to do
,,"the whole 1-by-1 square, it's all distorted here. It would look like that. So I'm only doing half of one. I'm doing another half"
,,of one just like that. And so when you add this
,,"guy and this guy together, you are going to"
,,"get a whole one. Now what about area of a square? Well, a square is"
,,just a special case where the length and
,,the width are the same. So if I have a square--
,,let me draw a square here. And let's call that XYZ-- I
,,"don't know, let's make this S. And let's say I wanted"
,,to find the area and let's say I know
,,"one side over here is 2. So XS is equal to 2, and I"
,,"want to find the area of XYZS. So once again, I"
,,use the brackets to specify the area of this
,,"figure, of this polygon right here, this square. And we know it's a square. We know all the sides are equal. Well, it's a special"
,,case of a rectangle where we would multiply the
,,length times the width. We know that they're
,,"the same thing. If this is 2, then"
,,this is going to be 2. So you just multiply 2 times 2. Or if you want to
,,"think of it, you square it, which is"
,,"where the word comes from-- squaring something. So you multiply 2 times 2,"
,,which is equal to 2 squared. That's where the
,,"word comes from, finding the area of a"
,,"square, which is equal to 4. And you could see"
,,that you could easily fit 4 1-by-1 squares
,,on this 2-by-2 square.

Perimeter,C8ywY61EDGQ,here we have an angle what is the name of the angle one way to name it is angle ABC the letter B is in the middle of the name because the angle is at B we can also name it angle B because there is only one angle at B but what happens if we have the line BD to the diagram we now have two angles at B angle abd and angle DBC in this case we cannot just use B for the name there is however another option if we number the angles angle abd we can now name angle b1 and angle DBC we can name angle B to please pause to study this notation whenever we have angles next to each other we call them adjacent angles here is another example of adjacent angles and here is another example adjacent angles always share a common vertex here the vertex is Ed B and they also share one side or arm of the angles please pause to study this here we have two lines a B and C D which intersect at 90 degrees we know that it is 90 degrees because this is the symbol we use for a right angle whenever lines intersect at 90 degrees we call them perpendicular lines in maths we can write this in shorthand as follows this means that a B is perpendicular to C D please pause if you need to here we again have a right angle if I now add a line to the sketch and I tell you that angle q1 is 30 degrees of angle q2b it will be 90 degrees minus 30 
,,degrees why because we are told that the whole like you is 90 degrees angle q2 is therefore equal to 60 degrees this means that if we add these two angles the answer will be 90 degrees whenever angles add up to 90 degrees we say that they are complementary angles so remember complementary angles add up to 90 degrees please pause if you need to here we are asked to find the complement of 42 degrees in other words we need to find a second angle so that 42 degrees and the second angle are complementary angles to find this compliment we simply subtract 42 degrees from 90 degrees the complement of 42 is therefore 48 degrees please pause and find the complement of 28 to find it we again subtract the given angle from 90 degrees the compliment is therefore 62 were you correct what do you think the complement of X will 
,,be it is simply 90 degrees minus X is this what you said what do you think the compliment of 90 degrees minus a will be as before we subtract the given angle from 90 degrees I use brackets in the step to show that we are subtracting the whole given angle next we need to multiply the minus into the bracket this is equal to 90 degrees minus 90 degrees plus a the compliment is therefore a please pause to check my working here is the next question please pause to read it we are given that this 
,,whole angle is 90 degrees we can therefore say that the sum of these angles is 90 degrees and the reason is they are complementary angles we then add 12 degrees and 
,,28 degrees to get X plus 40 degrees on the left X is therefore equal to 50 degrees please pause to check my working here is a similar question please pause and try it on your own first we can again state the two given angles add up to 90 degrees and the reason is there are complementary angles next we add like terms on the left 
,,we then isolate the term with X by subtracting 15 degrees from both sides and to isolate X we divide both sides by 3 please pause to check my working do you remember what the size of a straight angle or straight line is it is 180 degrees this is a very important fact to remember in mathematics if I now add the line Q s to the sketch we get to adjacent angles angle Q 1 and angle Q 2 if angle q1 equals 125 degrees what will the sizeof angle q2 be to find this angle we subtract 125 degrees from 180 degrees angle q2 is therefore equal to 55 degrees this means that if we add these two angles we will get an answer of 180 degrees whenever angles add up to 180 degrees we say that they are supplementary angles so remember supplementary angles add up to 180 degrees please pause if you need to here we are asked to find the supplement of 42 degrees in other words we need to find a second angle so that 42 degrees and the second angle are supplementary angles to answer this we need to subtract the given angle from 180 degrees the supplement of 42 is therefore 138 next we are asked to find the supplement of 128 degrees please pause to do it we again 
,,subtract the given angle from 180 degrees the supplement is there 452 degrees how did you do what do you think the supplement of X will be as before we subtract the 
,,given angle from 180 degrees were you correct and what about the supplement 90 degrees minus a to find it we again subtract the given angle from 180 degrees and we need to use brackets to show that we are subtracting the whole given angle next we need to multiply the minus into the bracket this is equal to 180 degrees minus 90 degrees plus a the supplement is there for 90 degrees plus a please pause to check my working here is the next question please pause to read it because PQR is a straight line we can state that the sum of the angles is 180 degrees and the reason is straight line or we can now also use the reason supplementary angles both are correct - 30 degrees plus 70 degrees equals 40 degrees giving us X plus 40 degrees on the left X is therefore equal to 140 degrees please pause to check my working here is a similar question please pause to try it on your own first because we have adjacent angles on a straight line we can write the following and the reason is supplementary angles next we add like terms on left giving us 6x equals 180 degrees we then divide both side by 6:00 to get the answer please pause to check my working here is the next question please pause to read it this right angle symbol tells us that we have a 90-degree angle in the middle and because we again have adjacent angles on a straight line we can write the following and the reason is supplementary angles we then add like terms on the left giving us 3x plus 81 degrees equals 180 degrees to isolate the term with X we subtract 81 degrees from both sides and to isolate X we divide both sides by 3 please force to check my working let's end with this question please pause to read it we are asked to find X which is this angle in the triangle but where do we start we need to start with a straight line can you see 
,,how we can say that the three adjacent angles add up to 180 degrees why because they are supplementary angles 58 degrees plus 71 degrees equals 129 degrees so on the Left we have angle c2 plus 129 degrees Anglesey - is therefore equal to 51 degrees we are now ready to work inside the triangle can you see how it is an isosceles triangle so this angle is also 51 degrees we can therefore state that X plus 51 degrees plus 51 degrees equals 180 degrees why because the angles of a triangle always add up to 180 degrees fifty-one degrees plus 51 degrees equals 102 degrees so on the Left we have X plus 102 degrees we then isolate X by subtracting 102 degrees from both sides this completes the lesson good luck with the test

Perimeter,gtMKsFXjLHw,in this video we're gonna talk about how to determine the area and the perimeter of a figure so let's start with our rectangle just to keep things simple now let's say that this rectangle has a length of 8 inches and a width of 5 inches so what is the area and what is the perimeter of this rectangle so let's start by calculating the area the area is left times width it's basically the two dimensional space inside of this rectangle and so using that formula we have a length of eight inches and a width of five inches and so eight times five is forty and inches times inches is square inches and so the answer is going to be forty square inches the unit of 
,,area is always units squared so you can have square feet square centimeters square yards but it's always unit square and so that's how you can calculate the area of 
,,a rectangle now what about the perimeter of the rectangle how can we calculate that in order to calculate a perimeter you need to determine a total distance around the rectangle now if this side is eight inches the side across it must be eight inches and if the right side is five inches the left side must also be five inches and so the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle its 2l plus 2w it's twice the value of the left which is going to be two times eight plus two times the width and so we're going to get sixteen plus ten and so this is going to be 26 inches it's not 26 square inches so if you add up 8 inches plus 5 inches that's going to be 13 plus another 8 inches that's 21 inches plus 5 again you're going to get a total of 26 inches and so the perimeter is simply the distance around a figure whereas the area is basically the two-dimensional space inside of a figure so keep that in mind now for the next example let's focus on the square so let's say if we have a square 
,,with a side length of 7 inches what is the area and the perimeter of the square now you need to know that all four sides of a square are the same and so it's 7 inches all around now the area of a square is similar to that of a rectangle for a rectangle is left times width for a square all sides of the same so let's call the side length s so it would be s times s or simply s square so in this case the area of this square is going to be 7 times 7 or 7 squared which is 49 square inches and so 
,,that's the first part for this problem now for the second part we need to calculate the perimeter and intuitively we could see that it's going to be the sum of all four sides don't forget that the perimeter is the distance around the figure so it's gonna be 7 plus 7 plus 7 plus 7 which is 28 inches or you could say s plus s plus s plus s which is 4 s so it's 4 times 7 which will give us 28 and so that's how you can find the perimeter of its square now let's work on some word problems the diameter of a circle is 8 centimeters what is the area and perimeter of the circle so let's draw a picture and so this is the diameter it's 8 centimeters how can we determine the area and the perimeter the first thing I would recommend doing is finding the radius the radius is one half of the diameter so this is the radius is the 
,,distance between the center of the circle and any point on a circle so 1/2 of 8 is 4 therefore the radius is 4 now to calculate the area of the circle we could use this formula area is PI R squared so it's going to be pi times 4 squared which is going to be 16 PI square centimeters and so this is the area of the circle now if you want to get the decimal value of that I'm gonna use the exact value for pi 3.14159265 4 times 16 and so you should get 50 point 2 6 5 square centimeters for the area of the circle now what about the perimeter of the circle so how can we determine a distance around the circle and is a formula for that it's basically the circumference which is 2 pi R so it's gonna be 2 pi times 4 centimeters and so that comes out to be 8 pi centimeters which if we convert that to a decimal number that's gonna be 25 point 1 3 3 centimeters and so that's how you could find the area and the perimeter of the circle the perimeter of the circle is simply called the circumference of the circle now here is another problem the perimeter of a square is 60 centimeters what is the area of the square so how can we find the area if we're given 
,,the perimeter so first we remember that the perimeter is 4 times the sidelines so if the perimeter is 60 we could easily solve for the side left we just got a divide both sides by 4 and so 60 divided by 4 is 15 so therefore the side length of the square is 15 centimeters all around so now that we have the side length we can calculate the area so the area of this square is going to be s square or basically 15 times 15 which is 15 squared and so that comes out to be 225 square centimeters and so that's it for this problem that's the area of this particular square now let's try this problem the left of the diagonal in a square is 12 feet what is the area 
,,and perimeter of the square so if we're given the left of the diagonal let's call it out how can we find the side left s notice that this forms a right triangle and 
,,so we could use the Pythagorean theorem a squared plus B squared equals C squared where C is hypotenuse a and B they're both equal to s so we have s squared plus s squared is equal to l squared and so one s squared + and what s squared is 2x squared now if we take the square root of both sides on the Left we have the square root of 2 times the square root of s squared and on the right the square root of l squared is just L and the square root of s squared we could just make that s then we could divide by the square root of two so the side length is basically the left of the diagonal divided by the square root of two when dealing with the square now the area of a square is s square and so what we could do is replace s with this expression so the area is going to be L over the square root of two times I mean to the 
,,second power and so here we have l squared and then the square root of two squared the square and the square root will cancel and so you're just going to get two on 
,,the bottom therefore the area of a square given the left of the diagonal is one-half L square and so let's use that formula to get the area of this square so the length of the diagonal is 12 and 12 squared is 144 1/2 of 144 well half of 14 is 7 and then half of the other force 2 so half of 144 is 72 so it's gonna be 72 square feet and that's the area of this particular square now let's calculate the perimeter of the square so the perimeter of the square we know it's 4s and in this problem s is out over the square root of 2 so now I'm gonna rationalize this expression I'm going to multiply the top and the bottom by the square root of 2 so on top I have 
,,4 L times the square root of 2 and on the bottom the square root of 2 times the square root of 2 that's the square root of 4 which is 2 and now 4 divided by 2 is 2 so you could simplify these replace that with 4 2 so in terms of the left of the diagonal the perimeter of the square is going to be 2 out or rather 2 square root 2 times out so in this case it's going to be 2 square root 2 times 12 well basically 24 square root 2 and the unit for this is feet so that's the perimeter of this particular square so this problem is gonna be the last problem for this video so it goes like this the left of a rectangle is 3 more than twice its width if the area of 
,,the rectangle is 9 T squared centimeters what is the perimeter of the rectangle so let's draw a picture and so this is the left and this is the whiff now what we need to do is we need to write some equations we're told that the length of the rectangle is three more than twice its width how can we convert that sentence into an equation so the left is is means equal three more so three plus twice the width 2w now we're also told that the area is ninety square centimeters and we know that the 
,,area is left times width so ninety is L times W so we have two equations and two variables so let's solve by substitution so let's replace out there were three plus 
,,2w so this is gonna be 90 is equal to three plus 2w times W so now we have an equation with only one variable so we can solve it but how should we go about solving it well the first thing we should do is distribute W to three plus 2w and so it's gonna be 90 is equal to three times W which is three W and then two W times W that's 2w squared and so I'm gonna take this ninety and move it to that side and I'm gonna rewrite it putting it in standard water so it's 2w squared plus three W and then when you take the ninety which is positive on the left side and move it to the right side it's gonna switch from positive to negative now in order to solve for W we either need to factor or use the quadratic formula because right now this is a quadratic equation let's see if we can factor so first we need to multiply the leading coefficient by the constant term 2 times negative 90 is negative 180 and now we need to find two numbers that multiply to negative one but adds a theory so we could try negative 18 negative 180 divided by negative 18 is 10 but these two numbers they don't differ by 3 so we could try let's say 6 goes into 18 negative 180 divided by 6 or negative 6 that's 30 but they don't differ by 3 we could try negative 12 negative 180 divided by negative 12 that's 15 so these two they differ by 3 so what we're gonna do is we're gonna replace the middle term 3w with negative 12 W + 15 W because as you can see these two numbers they add up to 3w and now let's factor 
,,by grouping so in the first two terms let's take out the GCF the greatest common factor which is 2w and so now we have 2 W squared divided by 2 W which is W and then negative 12 W divided by 2 W that's gonna be negative 6 in the last two terms let's factor out the greatest common factor which is going to be 15 and so 15 W divided by 15 that's gonna be just W negative 90 divided by 15 that's negative 6 and so at this point you could see we have a common factor and so if we take out W minus six we will be left over with 2w plus fifteen and so at this point we can now calculate the value of W and so let me just set each factor equal to 0 so W minus 6 equal to 0 and 2w plus 15 is equal to 0 here we need to add 6 to both sides so we had this answer W is equal to 6 and for the other one first we need to subtract both sides by 15 so 2w is negative is equal to negative 15 and then we could divide by 2 so we get a negative answer for W which we're not going to use real life objects tend to have positive silence so now that we have W we can calculate out recall that the area is left times W and the area is 90 the left is we don't know but the width is 6 so dividing both sides by 6 90 divided by 6 is 15 so that gives us the left of the rectangle so now that we have the left and the width of the rectangle we can now calculate the perimeter using this formula it's going to be 2 L plus 2w so it's 2 times 15 plus 2 times 6 and so that's gonna be 30 plus 12 and so we're gonna 
,,get 42 and since the area was in square centimeters the perimeter it's just gonna be centimeters and so that's going to be the final answer of this problem so that is the perimeter of this rectangle thanks for watching

Perimeter,MTSlKifo4js,ha here we go this is gonna be pretty cool today we are going to talk about the concept of perimeter you're gonna learn what perimeter is pretty cool but before we begin we got some new kids comments Marya who's five years old from Felton London left us a comment and said hello I want to share a joke what do you call a sleeping 
,,bull a bulldozer also I liked your Fox and Penguin videos Marya thank you so much for your awesome comment we appreciate you commenting and we're so glad you enjoyed the Fox and penguin videos and thanks for the joke our next comment is from Dakota who's from Maryland who also has a joke said thank you for teaching me the Roman 
,,numerals here's a joke what did one shirt say to the other nothing shirts don't talk like that is a good trick you little joke that's great they keep Dakota we appreciate you commenting and we're so glad that you enjoyed the Roman numerals video and learn so much that was pretty cool be sure and watch to the end of this video to learn how you too could be featured on one of our videos through the kids comments great so as we mentioned today we're going to talk about the concept of perimeter all right let's show you how fun this is imagine I'm a racecar driver right and don't make fun of my car okay this is this is a perfectly good car to do a racin right it's very fast it's it's got the bells it's got the whistles it's a great race car okay AB laughing at okay now imagine this is the race car course that I'm driving on right it's going around and oval it's going around a shape if I was wondering how far is it around the track what's the distance around the shape then I would 
,,need to know the perimeter the perimeter is the distance around a shape wait wait wait what is the perimeter the perimeter of a shape is the distance around a shape 
,,and it's easy to find you can find the perimeter of a shape by adding all of the sides that will tell you what the distance around the shape is great now let's practice finding the perimeter look at this triangle what is the perimeter of this triangle okay first we need to know how long all of the sides are then we can figure out the perimeter with this triangle all three sides are the same length so how long are they let's pretend we measured it and each side is 10 centimeters now remember to find the perimeter of a shape we need to know the distance around the whole shape so we just add the sides together what's 10 plus 10 plus 10 that's three tens what is that equal yeah 30 awesome the perimeter of this triangle is 30 centimeters remember cm is an abbreviation for centimeters 30 centimeters is the perimeter of 
,,this triangle okay let's try this one what is the perimeter of this square first we need to know how long all the sides of the square are then we can figure out the 
,,perimeter of the square okay so this is a square it has four sides and all four sides are the same size let's pretend we measured it and each side is one yard remember yd is an abbreviation for the distance of a yard each side is one yard remember the perimeter is the distance around a shape so we'll need to add all of these sides up okay what's one plus one plus one plus one yeah for the perimeter of this square is four yards the perimeter remember is the distance around a shape if you were to go around this entire square it would be four yards okay this is the final one what is the perimeter of this rectangle well first we need to know how long all the sides of the rectangle are then we can figure out the perimeter remember a rectangle has four sides and two of the sides are shorter than the other two sides with this rectangle let's pretend we measured it at one meter on the short side and three meters on the longer sides okay remember to get the perimeter we have to add all of the sides together so we're going to be adding four numbers together again to make it easier we're going to group the smaller numbers together and then put the 
,,larger numbers in our equation what's one plus one plus three plus three those are all the sides what's one plus one plus three plus three yeah eight that means the 
,,perimeter of this rectangle is eight meters Wow we told you is going to be fine oh it's such a blast finding the perimeter the perimeter is so much fun to find it's 
,,like a game remember you can find the perimeter of a shape by adding all of the sides and the perimeter of a shape is the distance around a shape I'm so brother I'm 
,,so proud now you know how to find the perimeter of something the perimeter is the distance around a shape I can find the perimeter of this tablet right all I would need to do is measure each side and add them together and I would find the perimeter but right now I got to find an internet connection there's no Wi-Fi out here there's no reason to be in the desert I need water there's not this doesn't make any sense okay so I'm gonna go you go ahead and find perimeter enjoy the perimeter is the distance around the shape go have fun thanks for watching for people who want to join team pop teen pop enables us to accomplish our mission well is our mission our mission yeah we understand whoa - one more and he's dead - ha ha ha join our team we could use your help well I have a question to ask a really interesting question I hope you don't mind me asking this but would you like to be on one of our videos well now you can ask a parent or an adult to help you leave a comment right here under our YouTube video and what's fun is here a quick little story and quick joke you can say hello to friends or family you can say whatever you want and you may

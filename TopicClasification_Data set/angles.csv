angles,hy95VyPet-M,well welcome back the title of this lesson is called angles and degree measure this is part one so we're embarking on a completely new set of topics here which are actually incredibly crucial to your future education and math going into calculus going into engineering and more advanced topics here in math because we're going to 
,,be talking about angles we'll want to be talking about trigonometric functions sine cosine tangent we'll be talking about a lot of triangle trigonometry we'll be graphing trigonometric functions and all of this stuff boils into and kind of feeds into talking about wave motion because wave motion can be described using angles and and trigonometry concepts like this which has applications in every branch of engineering that you're going to study so I'm not exaggerating when I say what we're learning here is absolutely critical now the beginning of this journey starts with talking about what is an angle okay so what we're gonna do now is go over that right now in general when you're talking about angles there are two main ways there are others but there are two main ways that we measure angles we measure them in degrees that's what we're gonna be talking about here and then later on we're gonna be talking about another measure of angles called radians so I know you might want to might have confusion or be thinking about radians in the back of your mind but put the Radian questions off to the backburner I want to teach you how to do all the 
,,stuff in degrees first because it makes more sense then we're going to jump back in and talk about Radian angle measure in just a little bit okay so let's talk about what we all know and that is that a circle probably learn this you know back in geometry or even in earlier math the math has what we call 360 degrees so the question mark is what is a degree right well really what it is is if you take a circle and you chop going around that circle into 360 equal pieces then one of those little pie wedges of a circle after you chop it up like that is what we call a degree now why is it 360 degrees why isn't it 380 degrees or why is it you know not 270 degrees well that goes into the history of math and map making and other things and why that is the case we're not going to talk about the why we're gonna talk about what it is but ultimately the 300 sixty degrees is just the measure that we have landed on here it doesn't make a lot of intuitive sense why it's 360 degrees later on we talk about radians that will make a lot more sense why Radian measure is defying the way that it is but for now we're only talking about degrees and so we're just 
,,going to take it as a fact that the people that you know figured out geometry and map making and surveying and things like that in the past set on 360 degrees for a 
,,very good historical reason we're not going to talk about the historical reason here but what it basically means is if ice if I have a circle like this if I start at one point in the circle like this and if I travel all the way around like this all the way around back to my starting position so my arrowhead is right here and what I mean by that is if I kind of take from the radius here of the circle and start at this location and sweep out all the way like a clock all the way back to where 
,,I started with this is what we call 360 full divisions of that going around the circle we call that a degree and obviously we can talk about Radian measure which splits the circle into its gonna end up being two pi radians you see pi is involved when we have radians so we're gonna save radians for later because I want to get through the fundamental concepts first all right so this is a full circle right but angles in general like in triangles are not a full circle so what we have here for in general is if we have an acute angle or something then we might have an angle that goes up like this it's not a complete circle because this angle measure that we're gonna ultimately be talking about is only a portion of a circle you see the entire circle goes all the way around to 360 degrees and then this amount that this thing is open if you can imagine like a circle kind of going like the boundary of the circle kind of going like this this is just a fraction of going all the way around the circle so it's not 360 full degrees in this particular case it might be something like 45 degrees let's say and the angle measure is measured from you know this line up to this line right so you need to kind of start getting used to measuring these angles opening and closing in the following way we have two sides of this angle side right here it's called the initial side and then over here when we get up to where we're kind of going this part is called the terminal side initial and terminal now in this part of math when we kind of get out of basic geometry and we're starting to talk about really weird angle measures that go all the way around the circle we generally have to start measuring the angle from some known location so from here on out we're going to be measuring angles from the positive x-axis we have to have a starting point so we measured from the positive x-axis what I mean by that is this imagine that this is an XY plane and the x axis actually continues on here so this is the x axis right and so you can imagine this part right here this would be the y axis something like this so this going from the x axis to the y axis this is 90 degrees and about half way through there we stopped roughly halfway I'm a I'm not exact am i drawing here right halfway so this is half of 90 which makes this about 45 degrees and then of course you can continue past 90 and kind of go all the way around in which case you get back to 360 degrees so these are little angles that we've used and looked at in the past for instance in triangles but here when we get into the trigonometry and kind of more advanced learning we have even 
,,larger angles that we deal with and that can look a little weird at first so here we have this initial side instead of opening up and stopping somewhere here let's continue on and measure that angle all the way down let's just talk about an example coming down here so let's call this the terminal side now you might be tempted to talk about the angle measure in here and you of course can take a look at that angle right here but in general you want to start at the terminal of the initial side and when you want to go in a counterclockwise direction remember clocks go like this right so counterclockwise goes the other way so we want to take a look at the angle measure that goes through this so if over here is 90 degrees then over here would be 180 degrees that makes sense 180 degrees over here and this is just a little bit bigger than 180 degrees so in this example this is 225 degrees so it is perfectly valid to have an angle larger than 90 degrees and angle larger than 180 degrees now it's a little weird the first time you see that because usually in geometry you're only talking about little angles inside of a triangle and they're always these are often these little acute angles but in trigonometry and precalculus and calculus we have angles that go way beyond 90 degrees way beyond 180 degrees all the 
,,time so it is true that you do have a smaller angle in here we could define that by the way it would be 360 degrees minus 225 that would be what this angle is because going all the way around is 360 so if we subtract that away that would be that angle of course we could take a look at that but in general we're measuring counterclockwise from the initial to the terminal side and it's they could be large numbers like this which leads me to the next thing that I want to write down that's important okay so when you're measuring angles when you have something like clockwise measurement clockwise which means going the other way like this these are what we call negative angles that's the other weird thing when you get out of geometry and you start getting into trig and precalculus like this you can have negative angles and positive angles now in all of these example we start up here and we're going counterclockwise counterclockwise counterclockwise so the other direction like this is counterclockwise this is the direction we've been measuring for these guys right here so counter them put a C clockwise okay these guys are always going to be positive angles it's extremely important you understand that you know the basic ideas of algebra you learn what a positive number was that's going along the to the right going on the number line towards the right and negative values those are going the other direction pass zero on the number line same thing for Y positive is up negative is down you had to learn all that in the beginning so here we're talking about something similar it's extremely important for you to understand if I start at some initial side and I measure angles in the counterclockwise direction in this way I'm measuring by definition by convention positive angles that's why this is positive 45 and positive 225 but if I start at this initial side and I measure an angle below the axis like this and then I'm going the other direction in the clockwise direction I'm going to by definition define and be looking at negative angles so let me give you an example of that so if for instance you have the initial side right here so I'm going to call this initial remember they're always measured relative to the x-axis like this so the initial side and then I have an angle that comes down something like this but for whatever reason I do not take and look at this angle over here that's a positive angle instead I start here and I go and look at the angle below I start sweeping down below like this in a clockwise fashion this means this is a negative angle so it's negative 60 degrees in this case so when you see negative angles it just means angles that are measured below the x-axis and these angles of course you can measure negative angles all the way around right but if you start here and you go in the counterclockwise direction you're measuring positive angles so one direction you're measuring positive angles the other direction measuring negative angles you're never going to get away from this idea in Matt so you have to remember that okay so let's take a look at what this actual angle is we just said it's about negative 60 degrees that makes sense because if you imagine this vertical line being here this is about 90 degrees negative 90 degrees and so it's 
,,not quite there so it's a negative 60 degrees okay now what to describe something to you and that is the idea that we are measuring the angle from here to here and so it's a negative and this is if you get a protractor it's about negative 60 degrees but we're perfectly free to measure this angle in the other direction going the 
,,other way it's perfectly fine to define angles measured to different directions okay when you measure going below the x-axis it's negative measurement of angles when you measure one the other way it's a positive so how would you figure out what this positive angle is if I were to start here and measure in the positive direction 
,,okay how would I do that well you know that this that this line right here is the zero spot right and you know that you can go all the way around the circle and get 
,,back to 360 degrees right and you also know that this angle is negative 60 degrees so what I can do if I want to define this angle I'm gonna call it theta I can say 
,,that it's the angle I started with negative 60 and I can add 360 degrees to it because any angle this is important any angle that I add 360 degrees to it just brings me back to the exact same location because remember if I start anywhere on this circle like if I start here and add 360 degrees to that position I'm gonna end up exactly where I started if I start down here and add 360 degrees I'm going to end up exactly where I started if I have an angle of negative 60 degrees and I add 360 degrees to it I'm gonna get exactly where I am this arrow will be the same but the angle measure will actually be a positive number what will this angle B so negative 
,,360 plus 60 you might have guessed is 300 positive 300 degrees so this angle here can actually be measure two ways I can measure it as a positive 300 degrees makes sense right because this is 90 degrees this is 180 this is 270 degrees going down and just a little bit past that is gonna be 300 degrees so that's 300 degrees but it's exactly the same angle measure as negative 60 degrees so to kind of bring that home let me shorten this this little leg right here just because the actual length 
,,of it doesn't matter and I'm gonna put kind of a nice conclusion down under here that's really important what we're basically saying is that 300 positive 300 degrees is the same angle that this little symbol means angle the same angle as a negative 60 degree angle in other words if I go to the grocery store and tell somebody hey I have a 300 degree angle or if I tell somebody hey I have a negative 60 degree angle I'm talking about exactly the same angle right just like five tenths is a fraction and it means exactly the same thing is one half but that also means exact Klee the same thing is 50 100 s but that means the same thing as 500 1000 so you see the pattern here or for 8 or 3 6 I can go on and on all day they all mean 1/2 so angle is the same way I can have multiple ways of representing the position of this terminal line right here someone positive someone negative angles in fact I'll take this opportunity to tell you then of course I started here I added 360 degrees to 
,,it might not this angle what if I add 360 degrees again I could add 360 degrees to the 300 degree angle what am I going to get 660 degrees so 360 plus the 300 is 660 so this angle also can be negative 60 degrees it could be 300 degrees or if I add 360 again it could be 660 degrees I can add another 360 and another 360 you know I can keep doing this forever and I can come up with many many many an infinite number of nut of angles measurements that actually correspond to exactly the same thing okay you have to kind of get used to that when we talk about this alright so we talked about angles how they're measured positive angles negative angles now we need to talk about quadrants quadrants of the XY plane all right because you're gonna be asked to be a giving or talking about the quadrants where these angles kind of 
,,exist in the XY plane okay so we'll talk about a couple right here so this is the x-axis this is the y-axis right so let's take a look at an angle that exists let's 
,,say right here now every angle has to have an initial side and a terminal side the initial side from now on unless I tell you otherwise the initial side is always going to be the x-axis the initial side is the x-axis and the initial side is the x-axis even here I kind of didn't draw it but the initial side was the x-axis right there so the angle that defines this guy right here starts from here and ends right here so you could say that that angle goes up something like this I can draw it really close if I want to or I could draw it far away it doesn't matter as long as I start somewhere and in somewhere that angle can be defined like this what is this 
,,angle well I'm going to tell you that this angle is 6 degrees okay now you have to go back and think about quadrants we talked about quadrants a long time ago this is quadrant number one this one over here is quadrant number two this one over here is quadrant three and then this one over here is quadrant four so it goes the same measurement the same direction of positive angle measures goes quadrant one quadrant two quadrant three quadrant four like this so if I asked you what quadrant is this angle in then it would be a simple answer you would say well the quality a terminal line here this is the initial and this is the terminal the terminal part of the angle is in quadrant one so we say this is quadrant one angle because you're gonna have some problems that'll basically say let me know what quadrant this angle is in all you do is look and see where the line the terminal line of the angle Falls that's the quadrant it's in okay but we've said that all angles can be measured positively or they could be negative measures how would you measure this angle in the negative fashion if I were to measure this angle in a negative fashion then I get the right color let's use this one if I measure this angle in a negative fashion I would have to start again at the x-axis but I would have to go the other direction all the way back to here like this and this angle would not be a positive angle it will be a negative angle because it's measured down going below in a clockwise 
,,fashion like that how can I figure out what this angle measure is well this is negative 90 degrees this is negative 180 degrees this is negative 270 degrees and this is just a little bit more than that and since you know that this is 60 and you know that this is another 90 you could probably guess what this angle is this angle is negative 300 degrees negative 300 degrees how do you know it's negative 300 because this is negative 90 negative 180 negative 270 and this has to be 30 more because this is 60 and 30 and 60s 90 hasn't been 30 more from 270 so it has to be a negative 300 so another way to say that I mean we kind of talked through it and that's 
,,all great how do we figure this out mathematically well if I take the angle that I think that it is negative 300 right and I add 360 degrees to it I think it's negative 300 I'm gonna add 360 degrees to it so I'm gonna spin all the way back around to where I started then what I'm gonna get is positive 60 degrees so another way of saying this is I know that this angle measure is also negative 300 because if it is negative 300 then that tells me where this is and if I add 360 degrees to it and I'm gonna spin all the way back around to where I start and I'm gonna get a positive 60 degree angle so this angle is 60 degrees positive or negative 300 degrees negative those are just two of infinite number of ways to write this angle because again if I know that this angle can be expressed to 60 I can add 360 again what am I gonna get 360 plus 360 plus 360 that would be another 360 plus 60 degrees would be another angle measure and then I can add another 360 and another 360 or whatever 
,,in other words I can add and subtract 360 degrees two angles all I want and continue to get new angle measurements that are telling me the exact same information where is the terminal end of that angle that's all that's all I care about okay but the point is is no matter if this is a positive 60 degree angle measure or if it's a negative 300 degree measure the terminal side here is still in quadrant one so it's a quadrant one angle oh that's all it matters to these kinds of problems okay so to bring that point home a little bit more let's do another one let's say I'm gonna have an angle measure that's a little bit easier to understand let's say x + y let's go ahead and draw another angle measure in here and let's draw it over something like this and let's say that this angle starting here measured in a positive direction is 120 and by the way I keep using this angle theta angle theta used it here angle theta I've probably wrote it down somewhere over here this variable this Greek letter theta right it just means angle so in generally we use X&Y and algebra we start getting into angles and trigonometry and precalculus we use theta for angles we also have other variables we use for angles but theta is the one that's used the most so if you see theta it just means heads-up there's an angle measurement 
,,coming all right so this is 120 degrees measured from here that makes sense because this is positive 90 and just 30 more is going to be of me 120 so what quadrant is this angle and this is the second quadrant okay if I take this and I add or subtract 360 degrees to it I will get different angle measures some positive some negative but it's still expressing where this is in quadrant two so it's a second quadrant angle okay let's take a look at another one this one's actually a little bit more interesting what if x and y like this what if my angle is what I want to draw it here down here what if the angle is not exactly over here or over here or over here over here but what if the angle is basically right on top of one of the axis like this so the angle measure going all the way around here this is 90 this is 180 this is 270 so this angle is 270 degrees what quadrant doesn't fall into well it's not the first quadrant it's not the second quadrant and it's not in the third or in 
,,the fourth quadrant it's right in the middle if one of the angle measures falls right on one of these lines right here it's not in any of those quadrants it's just called a quad rental angle quadrantal angle okay so the bottom line is you'll be asked some questions here's an angle tell me what quadrant it's in and you just have 
,,to look and see where it falls if the angle falls over here it's in the third quadrant if the angle falls over here it's in the fourth quadrant if the angles over here it's the second quadrant like this one angles over here are in the first quadrant if the angle falls on this line or on this line or on this line or on this line 
,,in other words 0 90 180 270 or even back around to 360 degrees then it's not in any of those quadrants we just say it's a quadrantal angle that's all that we say alright now we have gotten at least about halfway through this lesson we've learned the most important concepts but we have one more thing to talk about we have to talk about coterminal angle as a fancy sounding name but I've actually already taught you kind of what Kotex terminal angles really are coterminal angle just means that 
,,I can add and subtract 360 degrees to any angle I want and I'm going to get another angle that is exactly kind of in the same position and so those angles are kind of equivalent as far as like where they're at they have the same terminal point so we call them coterminal that's all it is and so let's talk about that it's a definition you'll need to know coterminal coterminal angle these are two angles where terminal side coincide all right and we've kind of done a lot of these over here so it's not going to be a huge surprise what we have here but let's take it one step at a time we're going to draw four pictures I'm gonna try to keep them all on the same board and try not to keep them too too large so I can make sure that you can see them all so let's say we have the first angle goes off like this and the angle here is 150 degrees okay first of all what quadrant is that angle at well this is quadrant one this is quadrant two so this is a second quadrant angle it's a positive 
,,angle measure because we're measuring counterclockwise like this this is 90 this is 180 so we're not quite to 180 so this is 150 it makes sense okay now what's gonna happen if we add 360 degrees to this angle we just said if this angle measure is here we can add 360 by just sweeping around a full circle from that in landing exactly where we start it's going to express the same location of that terminal side that's why it's called coterminal but the angle measure will be bigger than 150 because we're adding 360 to it so this is what it looks like okay the coterminal side is exactly in the same position so I'm going to do my best to draw more or less the same exact thing but here is that here's the weird thing what we do is we start at the the same initial side we go all the way to 150 but then we go right through and continue another 360 degrees landing on that terminal side so if you think about it from here to here is the 150 but then we add remember the line continued on around and it's kind of in a spiral the way we drew it another 360 degrees so what is this angle measure this is five hundred and ten degrees how do I know it's five hundred and ten because it's 150 plus 360 degrees and I'm gonna put a parenthesis one here I'm just adding one circle so it's one times 360 and so what I get is five 
,,ten now you might say why would I ever measure the angle is 510 degrees why wouldn't I just say 150 great question you're almost always gonna say 150 almost always we're kind of building the foundation here we we know that we're not gonna express 510 two degree angles very often but you need to know that it is exactly the same thing because sometimes when you're solving equations you get large angles but then you don't want it it's like a fraction you want to simplify it to the to the kind 
,,of the smallest number and you can and so you would need to know if I got 510 I'm just gonna subtract 360 from it and I'm gonna get the smaller angle that still expresses the exact same thing okay now we don't have to stop there we can of course add 360 degrees again if we want to and of course we want to because we're learning 
,,right so we're gonna take and say well the terminal side of this guy is the same physical location but now we're not going to go around one time we're gonna go around two times so what we do is we say well here's the 150 and then we go around one full circle again then we go a one full circle again back here so we had 150 then we went another full circle and added 360 then we have another full circle added another 360 what is that angle measure that is 870 degrees how do I know because they could take 150 degrees the initial angle and I can add two at two circles which is two times 360 so if you do this on a calculator 360 times two plus the 150 you're going to get 870 right so what we're trying to say is 870 degrees positive is the same thing as five hundred and ten degrees positive is the same thing as 150 degrees positive it always expresses exactly the same angle you're gonna have to get used to adding or subtracting 360 the angles because you end up having to do it a lot as you study this kind of math right now we've added 362 times and that was all wonderful but we can also subtract 360 degrees there's no there's absolutely no reason why we are Inuk we're not allowed to do that so we're going to show an example of that here same exact terminal angle as before but now instead of adding 360 when you add an angle you go in the positive direction of that angle measure okay here what I'm going to do is I'm going to say let's instead of taking a look at this as a hundred and fifty degrees positive let's measure the negative angle going down below here okay what would that angle measure be if I start here and I go this direction how would I get to that angle what would that thing will actually be well I know that this is 150 degrees positive right and instead of adding 360 what I'll do is I'll go the other direction and I'll subtract 360 so I'll subtract 360 degrees from it in fact just to make it a hundred percent clear what's going to happen here I'm going to subtract one full circle one times 360 and when you get that do that you get negative 210 degrees so this angle is a negative angle 210 degrees it's negative again because it goes down below the x-axis as a measurement in a clockwise fashion and it makes sense this is negative 90 this is negative 180 and this is just 30 degrees up from that from negative 180 going in that direction to give me this and I know that this other direction was 150 and so if I add the 150 plus the 210 I'm gonna get 360 so there's many ways of looking at it another way of looking at it is if you know this angle is 150 degrees like this instead of adding 360 to get a bigger number I'll start at 150 and I'll subtract 360 and when I subtract an angle I'm gonna have to go the other way remember negative angles are measured going clockwise and positive angles are measured counterclockwise so if I add 360 I'm gonna go this way but if I subtract 360 I'm gonna go in the negative direction down here and so when I subtract 360 that's why the ankle turns out to be negative because it's measured below the x-axis like that but wait there's more I can actually 
,,do one more time I don't need to just subtract 360 one time I can do it again okay and I'm getting to a punchline we're almost done but this kind of stuff is really 
,,important this foundational stuff so here's the terminal side right here and we went down and we said it was negative 210 degrees so I can say well I can go to negative 210 degrees but I don't have to stop there I'll just go another negative 360 degrees and stop where I be on the terminal angle here again so again I could say well I started at 150 degrees positive and instead instead of subtracting one circle of 360 to get this I'll just subtract two full circles of 360 degrees and what am 
,,I going to get 150 minus two times 360 I'll get negative 570 degrees so this angle measure is negative 570 degrees so let's take a minute to really understand what we've done here what we're basically saying is that when you look at angles and triangles that can geometry a more basic math or all these little bitty angles that are inside triangles acute angles mostly okay but when you get and grow out of that and start talking about trigonometry and precalculus and calculus the angles become much larger and in general you start at a initial position and you define the angle opening positive when you measure this way up to some final terminal position or you can measure the other direction going negative angles to the same terminal position whatever position the angle is in I can add 360 and get a larger angle I can add 360 again to get yet another larger angle but these three numbers represent the same physical location of the terminal side the angle which means these are coterminal angles likewise I can start at the same location instead of adding 360 going this way I can start this location and I can subtract which means I go the other 
,,way subtract 360 going here when I do that subtraction I get a negative angle which also again represents the same physical thing but I don't have to stop there I can subtract another 360 if I want to so I can start here and I can say well okay I'm going to subtract 360 and then I'm going to subtract 360 again from this angle again subtracting two full circles I get negative five seventy so I can add as many 360 degree cycles as I want and get the same coterminal angle or I can subtract as 
,,many 360 degree cycles as I want and get exactly the same coterminal angle this angle is exactly the same thing as this angle is the same as this this this they're all the same that's all I'm trying to say so to summarize the whole thing what we can really say is that all angles coterminal with 150 degrees can be written as follows 150 plus in times 360 degrees where n can be negative 2 let me do it this way dot dot dot negative 2 negative 1 0 1 2 dot dot dot so what it means as all integers in mathematical terms what it's saying is you start with some kind of baseline angle and I can add is meaning 360 degrees to it as I want if I add 0 360s to it then I just have my original angle if I add 1 360 to it then that we did those on the board if I add 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 we're gonna get bigger and bigger numbers or I could 
,,subtract 360 going the other way negative 1 negative 2 negative 3 and so on so there's an infinite number of ways I can express this angle measure in trigonometry and precalculus and calculus okay in general we don't care about all the other ones but it is important for you know they exist it's important for you know how this works so that you can solve more advanced problems so what we're going to do is wrap it up go into the next couple of lessons we're gonna solve real problems and we're gonna get a lot of practice it's very important for you to solve all of these yourself make sure you have confidence follow me into the next lesson we're going to continue on with angles and degree measure in trig precalculus and algebra

angles,DGKwdHMiqCg," Hi! Welcome to Math Antics. We're continuing our series on Geometry   and today we're going to learn about angles. In our last video, we learned about points and lines, and that's good because"
,,we are going to need lines to make angles. So let's start with a couple of lines
,,that are in the same plane. We're only going to be dealing with
,, two-dimensional geometry in this video.  These lines are conveniently called
,," Line AB and Line CD. Now the important thing to notice about these two lines is that they're pointing in exactly the same direction.  So, even if we extended  them "
,,"forever, they would never cross or even get closer together. When two lines are arranged like this,"
,,we call them 'parallel'. You've probably heard the term 'parallel' before…
,,"like parallel parking, or a parallel universe, or parallel bars. Okay, so parallel lines are lines that will"
,,"never cross, even if they go on forever... but what if I take one of our lines and"
,,give it a little nudge? Now the lines aren't parallel anymore.
,,"In fact, they cross at this point right here. Let's name it Point P.  When lines cross at a point like this,"
,,"we say that they intersect, and we call the point an 'intersection'. And when lines intersect, they form 'angles'. You can think of the angles as the spaces, or shapes, that are formed between the intersecting lines.  These intersecting lines form four angles: 1, 2, 3, 4. But instead of calling them angle 1, 2, 3 and 4,  in Geometry,"
,,"we name them by the points used to make them. For example, this angle here can be called Angle DPB  because if you trace along those points"
,,"(like connect the dots) they outline that angle. And this angle here... we can call that Angle APD, because connecting those dots forms angle. Now when naming angles,"
,,"there's a nice shorthand we can use.  Instead of writing the word 'angle' over and over again, we can just use the angle symbol instead,"
,,"which looks like this. But there's an even simpler way to name angles. To learn that way,"
,,let's erase all the points and letters on our lines except for the intersection point and this one point here. Now let's imagine that the line-segment between these 
,,"two points can rotate around the point of intersection, just like a clock hand rotates"
,,"around the center of a clock.  Let's also imagine that as we rotate the line segment, the point out at the end leaves a trail,"
,,"like if a pencil was attached to it. The trail (or path) that is left when we rotate the line-segment all the way around forms a circle. But if we only go part way around,"
,,then it forms part of a circle that we call an 'arc'. This arc can represent the angle
,,"that is formed when we rotate the segment from one position to another,"
,,"like from this line to that line. And now, if we shrink down that arc so that"
,,"it's close to the intersection point, and then put a letter by it, like the letter 'A',"
,,"we have another way of showing an angle... Angle A. And we can do this with any angle,"
,,"so the angle up here... we can also draw an arc and call it Angle B. So whenever you see a letter next to a little arc like this, it means that it's the name of the "
,,angle
,,"formed by that arc. Alright then, so now we have a diagram that shows Angle A and Angle B, and you might notice that those angles"
,,aren't the same size.  B seems to be bigger than A. But what if we rotate one of our lines until
,,the angles do look like they're the same size? Now our angles look kind of like a plus sign.
,,Lines arranged like this are called 'perpendicular'. Perpendicular lines are lines that form square corners when they intersect. And these square corner angles have 
,,"a special name in Geometry because they are really important. We call them 'right angles'. There is even a special symbol that we use to show when an angle is a right angle.  Because they form square corners,  we use a little square instead of"
,,"the arc that we use for the other angles. So whenever you see this symbol,"
,,"you know the angle you are looking at is a right angle, and that the lines that form it are perpendicular. Okay, now that you know what a right angle is, let's look "
,,"at a simple one that's made from just two rays. What will happen if we take the ray pointing up and rotate it like the hand of a clock a little to the right… a little bit clockwise? Well, we don't have a right angle any more"
,,"because the rays are no longer perpendicular. Instead, we have an angle that is smaller"
,,(or less) than a right angle. Angles that are less than right angles
,,"are called 'acute angles'. On the other hand, if we rotated our ray to"
,,"the left instead of the right, we would get an angle that's bigger"
,,or greater than a right angle.  Angles that are greater than right angles
,,"are called 'obtuse angles'. So, there are three main kinds of angles"
,,"that you need to know about.  Right Angles, acute angles and obtuse angles. Well actually, there's one more type of"
,,"angle that's pretty important, but it's kind of a strange one."
,,"It's called a 'straight angle'. A straight angle is just what we get when we rotate our rays so that they point in exactly opposite directions. The result looks just like a straight line,"
,,"which is why it's called a straight angle. Alright then, there's just a few more important geometry terms that we need to learn in this video.  Let's look at our simple right angle"
,,"again that's made from two rays. But this time, let's draw a third ray that"
,,"cuts that right angle into two smaller parts. Now, because the angle that we divided up"
,,"was a right angle,  we know that the two new smaller angles"
,,"combine to form a right angle. And in geometry, any two angles that to form a right angle are called 'complementary angles'. And we can do the same thing with a straight angle.  If we take a straight angle (made from two rays)  and divide it with a third ray,"
,,two new smaller angles are formed. And those two angles combine to form a straight angle.
,,"We call these angles 'supplementary angles'. So, complementary angles"
,,"combine to form a right angle,  and supplementary angles"
,,"combine to form a straight angle. Alright, that's all were going to learn about angles"
,,"in this video. And if you are new to Geometry,"
,,"it might seem like a lot, so let's do a quick review of"
,,"all the new geometry words we've learned. Lines that point in exactly the same direction will never cross and are called 'parallel' lines. When lines do cross, they "
,,cross at a point
,,called an 'intersection'. Lines that intersect form 'angles'. You can
,,think of angles as the spaces between the lines. Angles can be named by the points that
,,"form them... just like connect the dots. An 'arc' is a part of a circle. Arcs can be used to represent an angle between two intersecting lines. When intersecting lines form all exactly equal angles, the lines are 'perpendicular'. Perpendicular lines form 'right angles'."
,,"Right angles are square corners,  and we use a special square symbol"
,,"to show that an angle is a right angle. An angle that's smaller, or less than a right"
,,"angle is called an 'acute angle'. An angle that's bigger, or greater than a"
,,right angle is called an 'obtuse angle'. A 'straight angle' is formed by two rays pointing
,,in exactly opposite directions.  A straight angle is really just a straight line. Two angles that combine to form a right angle
,,are called 'complementary angles'. Two angles that combine to form a straight
,,"angle are called 'supplementary angles'. In our next geometry video, we're going to"
,,"learn more about angles and how to measure them. Thanks for watching Math Antics, and I'll"

angles,C8ywY61EDGQ,here we have an angle what is the name of the angle one way to name it is angle ABC the letter B is in the middle of the name because the angle is at B we can also name it angle B because there is only one angle at B but what happens if we have the line BD to the diagram we now have two angles at B angle abd and angle DBC in this case we cannot just use B for the name there is however another option if we number the angles angle abd we can now name angle b1 and angle DBC we can name angle B to please pause to study this notation whenever we have angles next to each other we call them adjacent angles here is another example of adjacent angles and here is another example adjacent angles always share a common vertex here the vertex is Ed B and they also share one side or arm of the angles please pause to study this here we have two lines a B and C D which intersect at 90 degrees we know that it is 90 degrees because this is the symbol we use for a right angle whenever lines intersect at 90 degrees we call them perpendicular lines in maths we can write this in shorthand as follows this means that a B is perpendicular to C D please pause if you need to here we again have a right angle if I now add a line to the sketch and I tell you that angle q1 is 30 degrees of angle q2b it will be 90 degrees minus 30 
,,degrees why because we are told that the whole like you is 90 degrees angle q2 is therefore equal to 60 degrees this means that if we add these two angles the answer will be 90 degrees whenever angles add up to 90 degrees we say that they are complementary angles so remember complementary angles add up to 90 degrees please pause if you need to here we are asked to find the complement of 42 degrees in other words we need to find a second angle so that 42 degrees and the second angle are complementary angles to find this compliment we simply subtract 42 degrees from 90 degrees the complement of 42° is therefore 48 degrees please pause and find the complement of 28° to find it we again subtract the given angle from 90 degrees the compliment is therefore 62° were you correct what do you think the complement of X will 
,,be it is simply 90 degrees minus X is this what you said what do you think the compliment of 90 degrees minus a will be as before we subtract the given angle from 90 degrees I use brackets in the step to show that we are subtracting the whole given angle next we need to multiply the minus into the bracket this is equal to 90 degrees minus 90 degrees plus a the compliment is therefore a please pause to check my working here is the next question please pause to read it we are given that this 
,,whole angle is 90 degrees we can therefore say that the sum of these angles is 90 degrees and the reason is they are complementary angles we then add 12 degrees and 
,,28 degrees to get X plus 40 degrees on the left X is therefore equal to 50 degrees please pause to check my working here is a similar question please pause and try it on your own first we can again state the two given angles add up to 90 degrees and the reason is there are complementary angles next we add like terms on the left 
,,we then isolate the term with X by subtracting 15 degrees from both sides and to isolate X we divide both sides by 3 please pause to check my working do you remember what the size of a straight angle or straight line is it is 180 degrees this is a very important fact to remember in mathematics if I now add the line Q s to the sketch we get to adjacent angles angle Q 1 and angle Q 2 if angle q1 equals 125 degrees what will the sizeof angle q2 be to find this angle we subtract 125 degrees from 180 degrees angle q2 is therefore equal to 55 degrees this means that if we add these two angles we will get an answer of 180 degrees whenever angles add up to 180 degrees we say that they are supplementary angles so remember supplementary angles add up to 180 degrees please pause if you need to here we are asked to find the supplement of 42 degrees in other words we need to find a second angle so that 42 degrees and the second angle are supplementary angles to answer this we need to subtract the given angle from 180 degrees the supplement of 42° is therefore 138° next we are asked to find the supplement of 128 degrees please pause to do it we again 
,,subtract the given angle from 180 degrees the supplement is there 452 degrees how did you do what do you think the supplement of X will be as before we subtract the

,,how we can say that the three adjacent angles add up to 180 degrees why because they are supplementary angles 58 degrees plus 71 degrees equals 129 degrees so on the Left we have angle c2 plus 129 degrees Anglesey - is therefore equal to 51 degrees we are now ready to work inside the triangle can you see how it is an isosceles triangle so this angle is also 51 degrees we can therefore state that X plus 51 degrees plus 51 degrees equals 180 degrees why because the angles of a triangle always add up to 180 degrees fifty-one degrees plus 51 degrees equals 102 degrees so on the Left we have X plus 102 degrees we then isolate X by subtracting 102 degrees from both sides this completes the lesson good luck with the test

angles,MEFlB5zSgdM,today our lesson in eighth grade is going to be on angles and some special angle pairs let's start off by just reviewing what we know about basic angles acute obtuse and right are the three main types of angles and we also will add what straight angles are acute angles are angles that have a degree measure of less than 90 degrees obtuse are greater than 90 degrees and right angles are 90 degrees oftentimes you see a little box in the corner to show that they are 90 degrees or a right angle 
,,how you can check if you don't have a protractor to measure and see if they are acute or obtuse is to do what we call the paper test place the corner of your paper in to the vertex and this is the vertex or the where the two rays connect on your angle and if you cannot see one of the other rays then it's going to be an acute angle if you can see one of the rays of your angle then it's going to be obtuse we use protractors in order to measure angles here is an acute angle you always line up 
,,your protractor with one of the Rays along the zero since I've lined it up here on the zero that I'm counting using the bottom numbers 10 20 30 40 50 60 and then you can't help me little Mark's pass the 60 one two three four so this looks like it is 64 degrees and it is an acute angle okay now let's talk about some special angle pairs part of this is review I know we had this last year complementary angles complementary angles are two angles that have a sum of 90 degrees then they can be what we call adjacent where they share a ray or a side this one's a 40 degree angle then this one's a 50 degree angle if they're complementary because together they add up to be 90 degrees they can also be just two separate angles let's say this is angle a and this is angle B we can say that angle a and angle B or complementary because they're two measurements together add up to be 90 degrees supplementary angles supplementary angles are two angles that have a sum of 180 degrees again they can share a sine 140 and 40 equals 180 degrees or if they can be totally separate angles the right way I remember is complementary C comes first in the alphabet therefore it's a smaller measurement of 90 degrees supplementary think of straight supplementary angles make a straight angle or 180 degrees okay then what is the supplement of a 75 degree angle well supplementary angles add up to be how much okay 180 so I'm thinking to myself 180 minus 75 and what do you get 105 degrees okay so 105 degrees plus 75 degrees is that out to be 180 it sure does what is the complement of a night at 75 degree angle excuse me I'll take 90 minus 75 and what do you come up with good 15 degrees because together 15 and 75 add up to be 90 degrees okay term that you need to be familiar with is adjacent adjacent angles are two angles that share a common side I can say that angle a and angle B are adjacent they share a common side and this is the little angle symbol angle a and angle B are adjacent because they share a common side and the next type of very special angle pairs are called vertical angles vertical angles are formed from two intersecting lines any lines that cross or intersect just like an intersection in the street opposite angles are congruent or they have the same measure and this is your congruence symbol so that we can say that angle a and angle C are congruent they're exactly the same we can say that the measure of angle B and angle D are congruent okay so vertical angles are opposite and congruent angles formed by two intersecting lines so for instance let's say that said that that measure of angle a was 120 degrees can you tell me then the measure of angle C okay it's going to be the same it's also 120 degrees what's going to be the measure of angle B well C and B or what kind of angles who they form a straight angle so they're called supplementary so that if C is 120 degrees what will be okay measure of angle B will be 60 degrees because together they add up to be 180 okay if I know B is 60 degrees what then is the measure of angle D it is 60 degrees any questions on vertical angles okay now this is a set of we're talking about corresponding angles angles formed from two parallel lines parallel lines or lines that will never touch but they are cut by another line we call that the transversal parallel lines cut by a transversal they give us some really special characteristics of angles now if you look at it very carefully if I looked at those two lines they just look like what we just looked at vertical angles two and three are opposite so they're going to be the same one in four are opposite so they're going to be the same and I can say the same for these two lines they look like two intersecting lines therefore opposite angles are congruent in the same six and seven are the same five and eight are the same or pairs okay when we talk about corresponding we're going to look at some other angle pairs as well we're going to say that angle one corresponds with angle five angle three corresponds with angle seven angle two corresponds with angle six and angle 4 corresponds with angle eight and they're the same now from a parallel lines cut by transversal we have some other special angle pairs the first one is going to be the alternate interior angles can we think of interior think of inside the parallel lines alternate means kind of opposites opposite sides so the alternate interior angles would be 3 & 6 and we 
,,know that those two look like they're both up two so they're going to have the same measure and we call them congruent and measures 4 & 5 okay those both are two alternate interior pairs angles 3 & 6 are going to be the same and 4 & 5 are going to be the same okay then the next term is alternate exterior angles which those low lie on the outside of the parallel lines so which one's going to be the alternate exterior angle to angle 1 do you think yes good it's going to be 8 see how they're both acute they're going to be the same measure and which one matches or corresponds and B karu at angle 2 you got it angle 7 and we already talked about the corresponding angles 1 & 5 3 & 7 2 & 6 4 & 8 and you can write those down okay now here comes the fun part I can give you the measure of just one of those angles and you can find the measurement of all the rest all the seven remaining angles let's give it a try let's say the measure of angle 2 is 110 degrees okay I want you and your partner to think what are the remaining measures of angles 1 3 4 5 6 7 & 8 when you think you have them raise your hand I'll come around and check you and then we'll go over okay some of you chose to go with the vertical angle in other words 2 & 3 are the same so you knew that 3 had to be 110 degrees some of you chose to do supplementary angles 1 & 2 or supplementary so if I know that 2 is 110 degrees what degree measure would add it to be 180 and it would be a 70 degree angle I know that 1 in 4 are vertical angles so they are the same so 4 is a 70 degree angle we know that 5 is going to be also 70 degrees we know it two different ways because 4 & 5 are congruent because of alternate interior angles and one in five are congruent because their corresponding angles ok what's the measure of angle 6 it's going to be 110 
,,we know that a couple different ways 3 & 6 are alternate into your angles and we know that 2 & 6 will be the same because they are corresponding angles are melinda was 7 is 110 degrees and then 8 is 70 degrees again you can choose by vertical angles you know that or by corresponding angles 3 & 7 4 & 8 or by alternate exterior angles 2 & 7 1 & 8 alright then that concludes our lesson on special angle pairs okay we have one more little note one other set of special angles are formed from perpendicular lines perpendicular lines I'm assuming you kind of already remember this but just in case you haven't had this this is really an important term that perpendicular lines are formed from intersecting lines and they form writing angles or 90-degree angles perpendicular lines intersect to form 90-degree angles

angles,xCdxURXMdFY,"Hi, welcome to Math Antics. In our last geometry video, we learned that "
,,"all 2-dimensional shapes have a 1-dimensional quantity called Perimeter which is basically the outline of the shape. In this video, we're going to learn that these shapes also have a 2-dimensional quantity called Area. To help you understand what Area is, let's start by imagining a line that's 1 cm long. Now, let's imagine moving that line in a perpendicular direction a distance of 1 cm. But while we move it, it leaves a trail… almost like the end of a paint brush. By moving the 1-dimensional line that way, we formed a 2-dimensional shape, and all of the space (or surface) that we covered along the way is the Area of that shape. …which as you can see here is just a square. Ok, but how much area does this square have? Well, our original line was 1 cm long, and we moved it a distance of 1 cm, so we could say that this shape is a square centimeter. Just like a centimeter is a basic unit for measuring length, a square centimeter is a basic unit for measurement for area. But there are other units for area too. For example, instead of a centimeter, what if our line had been a meter long, and then we moved it 1 meter? The area we'd have gotten "
,,"would be 1 square meter! Or, what if it was a mile long, and we moved it a mile!?  We'd have a square mile of area. So, just like with perimeter, the units of measurement are very important when we're talking about area! Alright, so that gives you a good idea of what area is, but how do we calculate area mathematically? Well, there's some special math formulas (or equations) that we can use to find the area of different shapes. In this video, we're going to learn the formula for squares and rectangles and the formula for triangles. To find the area of any square or rectangle, all we have to do is multiply its two side dimensions together. They're usually called the length and the width, so the formula looks like this: Area equals length times width. But it's often written with just the first letters of each word as abbreviations: ‘A’ for Area, ‘L’ for Length and ‘W’ for Width. So let's see if that formula works for our original square centimeter. If we multiply the length (1 "
,,"cm) times the width (1 cm), what do we get? Well, 1 x 1 is just 1, but what about cm x cm? Cm x cm just gives us square centimeters, which we can write like this using a '2' as an exponent. We read this as ""centimeters squared""  and it's just a shorter way of writing cm x cm. So whenever you see units like centimeters squared, or inches squared, or meters squared, or miles squared, you know it's a measurement of the 2-dimensional quantity area. Ok, our formula (area equals length times width) worked for our square. Now let's see if it works for a rectangle. Here's a rectangle that's 4 cm wide"
,,"and 2 cm long (or tall) First, we plug the length and width into our formula (2 cm and 4 cm) Then we just multiply… 2 x 4 equals 8 and cm x cm is cm squared. So, according to our formula, the area of this rectangle is 8 centimeters squared. And we can see that's correct if we bring back our original square centimeter. If we make copies of it, you can see that exactly 8 of those square centimeters would be the same area as this rectangle. Great, let's try our formula on one more rectangle. This rectangle is 2 cm long but only half a centimeter wide. And our formula (area equals length times width) tells us that we just need to multiply those two sides together to get our area. Two times one-half equals one. So this rectangle is also 1 square centimeter. How can it be a square centimeter?"
,,"It's not even a square! Ah - but just because a shape takes up 1 square centimeter of area, that doesn’t mean it has to be a square shape. It just means that the total area would be equal (or the same) as a square centimeter. You can see that if we break the rectangle in half and rearrange it, then it would form a square. In fact, we can use square units (like square centimeters) to measure ANY area, no matter what the shape is. It could be a rectangle, a triangle, a circle"
,,"or ANY other 2-dimensional shape. Okay, now that you know how to find the area of any square or rectangle using our formula, we're going to learn the formula for finding the area of any triangle. But to do that, we're going to start with a rectangle again. The dimensions of this rectangle are 3 m by 4 m. So… what's it's area? Well, using our formula,  we know that the area would be 3 m x 4 m which is 12 meters squared. But now, what if we were to cut this rectangle exactly in half along a diagonal line from opposite corners? It forms two triangles! And because each of these triangles is exactly half of the rectangle, that means that the area of either "
,,"triangle must be exactly half of the area of the rectangle. We already calculated that the area of the entire rectangle is 12 meters squared, so the area of this triangle must be 6 meters squared, and the area of this triangle must be 6 meters squared, since 6 is half of 12. Ah ha!  So the formula for the area of a triangle should just be half of the rectangle. So does that mean that instead of, ""Area equals length times width"" , it should be, ""Area equals one-half of length times width"" ? "
,,"Yep!  That's basically it, but with one important difference. Instead of 'L' for Length and 'W' for Width, we're going to use two different names for our triangle's "
,,"dimensions. We're going to call them ""Base"" and ""Height"""
,,"and here's why. The names ""Length"" and ""Width"" worked okay for this right triangle because a right triangle is exactly half of a rectangle. But those names don't really work for other kinds of triangles like acute triangles or obtuse triangles. Because how do you tell which side should be which? So for triangles, we do something different. First we choose one of the three sides to be the ""Base"". It doesn't really matter which side you choose, and in a lot of math problems, the base will already be chosen for you. Once we decide which side the base is, we imagine setting the triangle down on the ground so that its base is flat on the ground, like this… "
,,"Next, we find the highest point of the triangle, which is the vertex that's not touching the ground. From that point, we draw a line straight down to the ground. The line we draw must be perpendicular with the ground. The length of that line (from the tip of the triangle to the ground) is called the ""height"" of the triangle. Oh, and some people call the height of a triangle the ""altitude"" which makes a lot of sense if you pretend that your triangle is a tiny little mountain. Sometimes the height line is inside the triangle, like with an acute triangle. And sometimes it's outside the triangle, like with a obtuse triangle. And sometimes,"
,,"it lines up exactly with one of the triangle's sides, like with right triangles. But no matter where it is, the formula for finding the area of ANY triangle is the same: Area equals one-half base times height. So, if we know those two measurements (base and height), we can just plug them into the formula to calculate the area. At first, you might not see how the same formula could work for all three types of triangles, but watch this… Here's an acute triangle and this box is one-half its base times its height. If we cut our triangle up, you can see that it fits perfectly inside that area. But wait, there's more! Here's an obtuse triangle with a box that's one-half its base times its height. Again, if we cut up the triangle, . it fits perfectly inside the box Now you can see how the formula, area equals one-half base times height, works for ANY kind of triangle. Okay, we already figured out that the area of this right triangle was 6 square meters, so let's practice using our new formula to calculate the area of these last two triangles. Our diagram shows that the base of this acute triangle is 5 m and it's height is 8 m. So we plug those "
,,"values into our formula for area and we get area equals one-half of 5 times 8. 5 times 8 is forty and one-half of 40 is 20, so the area of this triangle is 20 meters squared. Don't forget that the units of measurement for area will always be square units! Okay, that was pretty simple.  Let's try our last example. The diagram of "
,,"this obtuse triangle tells us that the base is 4 inches, and the height is 7 inches, so let's plug those values into our formula. We end up with the equation: area equals one-half of 4 times 7. 4 times 7 would be 28, and then we can calculate what one-half of 28 would be by dividing by 2. 28 divided by 2 is 14, so the area of this obtuse triangle must be 14 square inches. Okay, now you know all the basics of area. You know that area is a 2-dimensional quantity that we measure in square units. You've learned the formula for calculating the area of any square or rectangle: ""Area equals length times width"". And, you've learned the formula for calculating "
,,"the area of any triangle: ""Area equals one-half of the base times height"". But… don't forget to practice what you've learned by working some problems on your own. That's how you really get good at math! As always, thanks for watching Math Antics,"

angles,k5etrWdIY6o,  Hi there! Today on Math Antics we're starting a new subject where we're going to learn the basics of a special kind of math called Geometry. Geometry is the study 
,,"of things like lines, shapes, angles, distances and things like that. In this video, we're going to focus on"
,,"three of the most basic elements (or parts) of Geometry. They are points, lines and planes. Alright, we're gonna start with points because they're about the simplest thing you can imagine in Geometry.  What's a point? Let me draw some for you.  So these are points. They're just little tiny dots in space. But they do a really important job in Geometry... They help us describe specific locations in space, like the end of the line, or the corner of a square, or the center of a circle. But they won't really help that much"
,,"unless we name them because if I say, ""Hey look at that point"
,,"over there!"" It's kind of hard to tell which one I'm talking about. I mean, they all look the same. So what names should we give these points? Well let's see… hmm… How about Archimedes, and... uh… Beauregard, that'd be good. Umm… maybe Charlemagne? How about Daphne and Einstein… let's see... Fred… and… Gwynevere, Hiawatha and… Icarus! Perfect! You know, on second thought, those names are kind of long and complicated. Why don't we just use the first letters"
,,"a each name instead? There, now if I say...  ""Look at point A"" or ""Look at point B"", you"
,,"know exactly what I'm talking about. In fact, let's do that.  Let's just talk"
,,"about 'point A' and 'point B' for a minute. If you start at point A and go to point B, taking the shortest distance possible, you'd have gone in a straight line. A line is the next most basic element of Geometry. We name a line by the points that it goes"
,,"through. For example, we would call this 'line AB', because its end-points (where it starts and stops) are points A and B But, technically, this isn't really a 'line'…"
,,"it's a 'line-segment'. ""What's the difference?"" you ask. That's a good question. A line-segment has a beginning and an end.  It starts at one point in space, and it "
,,"ends at another. A line, on the other hand, just keeps on going... ...in either direction forever.  just like the number-line keeps on going forever. Well, at least "
,,we imagine that it goes on forever. We can actually draw a line that goes on
,,"forever, so here's what we do instead. To draw a line instead of a line-segment, you just go past the end points a little bit,  and you put an arrow on both ends of "
,,the line to show that keeps on going. So this is line-segment AB  and this is line CD. Now there's one more special type of
,,"line that we need to talk about, and it's basically a combination of a"
,,"line-segment and a line. We call it a 'ray'. Rays have beginning points, but no ending points. They just keep on going forever... but only in one direction."
,,"So we only put an arrow on the end that keeps going. There, we call this one, ray EF In Geometry, each of these three types of lines has a shorthand way of writing it. Instead of writing ""line-segment AB""  you can just write ""AB"" with a line over the top. And instead of writing ""line CD"",  you can write ""CD"" with a double arrow "
,,"line over them,"
,,"like this. And finally, instead of writing ""ray EF"", you can just write ""EF"","
,,"with a single arrow line over them, like so. Okay, so now you know about points. And you know that you can"
,,form a line between any two points. The next thing we're
,,gonna learn about is planes. No!  Not the kind of planes that you fly in. Now to help you understand
,,"how planes in Geometry work, Let's go back and look at all those points we had at the beginning of the video. It looks like all the points are the"
,,"same depth on your computer screen, right? and if they were,"
,,"we'd say that they're all in the same 'plane'. That's because your computer screen is a plane. It's a flat surface like a window,"
,,"or sheet of paper, or a tabletop. A plane (or flat surface) is what we call a"
,,two-dimensional object because there's two dimensions that you
,,"can move in. You can go up and down, or you can go left and right. A line, on the other hand, is a one-dimensional object. If you're on a line, like 'line AB', there's only"
,,"one dimension that you can travel in.  Sure, you can go forwards or backwards along that line, but it still has only one dimension.  You can't get to point C without going off of line AB But if you're on a plane (a two-dimensional object),  then you can get to point C, because point C is on the same plane  as points A and B. All three of them are on that flat two-dimensional surface which is your computer screen. Cool! So that means that if I want to get to point D, I can do that too because it's on the"
,,"same plane as A, B and C. Right? Alright, I have a confession to make. I tricked you. Point D really isn't in the same plane"
,,as a computer screen. It just looks like it from the position
,,you're viewing it from. Watch what happens if I start rotating the screen space a little bit. Ah ha! Now you can see that the points
,,are actually scattered all over the place in space. Point D is actually in front of the plane
,,"that A, B and C were in. along with some of the other points.  and the rest of the points are actually behind the plane that A, B and C are in. What we have here is "
,,"a three-dimensional space or ""3D"" space for short.  In a three-dimensional space,"
,,"there's three dimensions you can move in. left to right, up and down, and in and out If we're on the plane that contains points A, B and C, we can't get to point D unless we leave that plane by traveling in that third dimension. A three-dimensional space like this is"
,,"often called a 'volume', but we'll talk all about 3D volumes in another video. For now, let's get back to talking about planes. Earlier in the video, we learned that you can make a line by connecting any two points, right? Well, in order to make a plane, it turns"
,,"out that you need to have three points. Like our three points A,B and C. If you just connect A and B, you get a line. But if you connect A, B and C, you get a…. a…. "
,,"...a triangle?! Now you're probably thinking, ""Wait! I thought we were supposed to get a plane, not a triangle."" Well, because it is a flat surface,"
,,"a triangle is a lot like a plane, but it has three edges. It stops and doesn't keep on going forever. When we were talking about lines, do you remember how a line segment had end points, but a true line kept on going forever? Well, it's kind of the same way with triangles and planes. You can't think of a triangle as"
,,"a smaller part (or a segment) of a plane. but the plane itself keeps on going forever.  So, three points is all it takes to define a plane. and in a space we've been looking at, we"
,,already have plane ABC. So let's try making some other planes
,,with the rest of the points. We can choose any three point that we want to.
,,"Let's join D, E and F. We can see the triangle they form. And if we extend that flat triangle,"
,,we can see the plane that it defines. Let's try one more so the rest of the
,,"points don't feel left out. Let's join G, H and I.  There, they form this triangle. ...a flat surface that forms this plane if we extend it in every direction. So, now you know about 'planes', 'lines' and 'points'. ...three basic elements of Geometry.  There's a lot more geometry ahead in upcoming videos, so stay tuned. And, you can check out the exercises for the section. They're pretty easy, and they'll help you"

angles,"""_n3KZR1DSEo","Hi and welcome to Math Antics. In our last geometry video, "
,,we learned some important things about angles. One of the things we
,,"learned was than angles come in different sizes. Some are big and some are small. Well in this video, we're gonna learn how"
,,"we can tell exactly how big or small an angle is. We're gonna learn how angles are measured. You probably already know a lot about measurement, like you know how to "
,,"measure how long something is with a ruler or a tape measure. And the units you'd use would be inches, or centimeters, or something like that, right? But when it comes to angles, we can't use"
,,"a ruler to measure them, or use units like centimeters. And that's because angles aren't"
,,"about length, angles are about rotation. And to measure how much something is rotated,"
,,"we use a special unit called degrees. Now hold on a second, I thought degrees were used"
,,"to measure how hot or cold something is. Ya know, like, ""it's 100 degrees outside today!"" Ah, that's a good point you smart looking"
,,"fellow. The word degree is actually used for a lot of different things, so it can be a"
,,little confusing sometimes. It makes more sense if you just think of a
,,"degree as a small amount of something.  For temperature, a degree is a small amount of heat. But for angles, a degree is a"
,,small amount of rotation. And there's a special math symbol for degrees that we can use instead of writing
,,the word 'degrees' over an over again. It's this little circle that you put after the number
,,"and up near the top. To see how we use degrees to measure angles, let's get two rays that point in exactly the"
,,"same direction. Then, let's put one ray"
,,"directly on top of the other one, so it looks like there is only one ray there,"
,,"even though there's really two. Now, let's take the ray on top and rotate it"
,,just a tiny amount counter-clockwise. This point on the ray will be our axis
,,(or center) of rotation. It is like the point at the center
,,of a clock that stays stationary
,,"while the hands rotate around it. Our rays now form an angle that measures 1 degree, and as you can see, 1 degree is a really small angle. We need to zoom in on     "
,,"it to see that it really is an angle. In fact, you might wonder if there could be any angle"
,,"smaller than 1 degree. Yep, there sure are. And we saw one just a"
,,"second ago. Before we rotated our top ray,"
,,"when our rays were exactly on top of each other, that is a zero degree angle. And there's a whole range of tiny fraction"
,,"angles between 0 and 1 degree, but we aren't going to learn about them in this video. Instead, we are going to keep on rotating"
,,our top ray and watch the angle get bigger and bigger. This special readout here will
,,"tell us how many degrees our angle measures. Now let's start out slow. 1 degree, 2, 3, 4, 5,"
,,"6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, now let's hold it there for a second. So this is what 10 degrees looks like. 10 degrees?! That's f-f-freezing! Huh. Guess you're not as smart as "
,,I thought
,,after all. So we can see that a 10 degree angle is still
,,"a very small angle. So let's keep going, but a little bit faster this time. That's 15 degrees, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 and 45. Now 45 degrees is a special angle because it's exactly half of a right angle. If we draw a right angle in the same spot, you can see that our ray cuts it into two equal parts. So, if 45 is half of a right angle, can you"
,,"guess how many degrees a right angle is?  Let's keep on rotating to see if you're right. 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90. Yep, a right angle is exactly 90 degrees,  and that "
,,is super important to memorize because
,,"right angles are used all the time in geometry. Okay, do you remember from our last video that all angles less than a right angle are called"
,,acute angles? So that means that all
,,"the angles we've seen so far that are between 0 and 90 degrees (like 10, 30, 45, 60 and"
,,"so on) are acute angles. But, if we keep on rotating our ray past"
,,"90 degrees, we'll start forming obtuse angles,"
,,"because they are greater than a right angle. Ready? Here we go. 100 degrees, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170 and 180. Ah ha, does this look familiar? Yep. It's a straight angle, like we learned about in the last video. The rays point in exactly"
,,opposite directions and the angle they form is 180 degrees.  And that's also a really important
,,"angle measurement to memorize. Now before we go on, let's quickly review"
,,the important angles and regions we've looked so far. Our angle measurement is zero degrees when
,,"the rays point in the same direction. It's 90 degrees when they are perpendicular,"
,,and form a right angle. And it's 180 degrees when they point in
,,"opposite directions, and form a straight angle. In this region (between 90 and 180)"
,,we find obtuse angles. And in this region (between 0 and 90)
,,we find acute angles. One important acute angle is 45 degrees since
,,"it's half of a right angle. Alright then, let's continue rotating past"
,,"180 degrees. Our angle readout keeps getting higher, and the next important angle we come to is this one, 270 degrees. It also forms a right angle,"
,,but it points down instead of up. Let's keep on going because another really
,,important angle is just around the corner. And it's coming up right about now! We've rotated our ray all the way around the axis
,,"and now it's back to where we started. Now you might be wondering, ""If we're back"
,,"where we started, then why is our counter reading 360 degrees instead of 0 degrees like before?"" The answer is that, even though our rays are back to the same place,  we had to rotate our top ray 360 degree to get it there. And you can see that our angle arc"
,,now forms a complete circle. So 360 degrees is the angle that represents
,,a full circle! Rotating 360 degrees brings you all the way around the circle to the point
,,"where you started from. Okay, now that you know what degrees are and"
,,"have seen how they relate to the size of an angle, we need to learn how to actually measure"
,,an angle without this fancy readout that we have here. Just like a ruler can be used to measure the
,,"length of a line, a special tool called a protractor"
,,"can be used to measure angles. A protractor is similar to a ruler, but it's"
,,curved into a half-circle so that it can measure rotation around an axis point. A protractor
,,"also has a straight edge with a hole or dot in the middle that represents the axis, or"
,,"center of rotation. So, if you are given a mystery angle"
,,"(like this one) and you want to measure how many degrees it is, you just put your protractor"
,,"on top of it so that the axis point lines up with the intersection of your rays, like this. Then you make sure that one of the rays lines"
,,"up with the straight line on the protractor. And last of all, you look to see where the other"
,,"ray crosses the curved part and read off what angle measurement it lines up with. As you can see, this angle is 50 degrees. Alright, there's one more thing I want to"
,,teach you in this video because you will probably see this kind of geometry problem on your
,,"homework or tests. Do you remember what complementary and supplementary angles are from the last video? Complementary angles combine to form a right angle,  and supplementary angles combine to form"
,,"a straight angle. Well, now that we know a right angle is 90"
,,"degrees, and a straight angle is 180 degrees, we can use that information to solve problems"
,,"that have unknown angles, like this one. It shows two angles (A & B)"
,,"that combine to form a right angle. The problem tells us that angle A is 30 degrees,"
,,"and it wants us to figure out what angle B is. Fortunately, it's easy to figure that out now because we know that a right angle is 90 degrees, so we know what the total of both angles must be. That means that to find angle B, all we do is take"
,,the total (which is 90 degrees) and subtract angle A (Which is 30 degrees)
,,"and whatever is left over will be angle B.  So, 90 - 30 = 60. Angle B is 60 degrees. Now let's try this problem. It uses the same"
,,"idea, but with a straight angle this time. The straight angle is divided into two smaller"
,,"angles. (again, angle A & angle B) And again, the problem tells us that angle A is 70 degrees, and it wants us to figure out what angle B is. Well, we know that the "
,,total of both angles
,,must be 180 degrees because we just learned
,,"that's how big a straight angle is. So if we take that total (180 degrees) and subtract angle A (which is 70 degrees), whatever is"
,,"left after subtracting must be angle B. So 180 - 70 = 110. Pretty cool, huh? And now you can see why"
,,it's important to know how degrees work in geometry. They can tell us how big angles
,,"are or how much something is rotated. Well, that's all I've got for you in this video.  But don't worry, there's a lot more geometry"
,,"where that came from.  So I'll get going on my next video, and you get going on practicing what you've learned. Thanks for watching Math Antics,"

angles,LGqBQrUYua4,"Hi! Welcome to Math Antics.  In this lesson, we are gonna learn about long division. If you haven’t already watched our video about basic division, then be sure to go back and watch that first. It will make learning long division a lot easier. Long division is just a way of breaking up a bigger division problem into a series of "
,,"short division steps like the ones that we did in the basic division video. The nice thing about long division is that once you know the procedure, you can divide up all kinds of numbers, even if they are REALLY big. The key to long division is to think about our division problem digit-by-digit. If our dividend (the number we’re dividing up) has a lot of digits, then that means that there will be a lot of division steps to do. When we learned basic one-step division, all of the dividends were small enough that we could just use the multiplication table to help us find the answer. But what if we have a division problem like this?  936 divided by 4 936 is definitely NOT on our multiplication table! In fact, there’s not anything even close to 936, so what do we do? Well, instead of trying to divide the entire 936 by "
,,"4 all at once, let’s break this problem up into smaller steps by just trying to divide each digit by 4, one digit at a time …digit-by-digit. Do you remember how with multi-digit multiplication and addition, we always start with the smallest digit (the ones place digit) and we work from right to left? Well division is backwards! "
,," We still go digit by digit, but the other way. We start by trying to divide up the digit in the biggest number place first and we work our way from left to right. So the first step in this problem is to divide the FIRST digit of our dividend by 4. We’ll just ignore the other digits for now, and that makes it look like we have the division problem 9 divided by 4. Great!  That’s easy!  It’s just a basic division problem like in the last video. So we ask, “How many ‘4’s will it take to make 9 or almost 9?” Well, two ‘4’s would be 8, and that’s almost 9. So just like before, we put the 2 in our answer spot on top of the line. But wait a minute… there’s a "
,,"lot of room up there. Where exactly do we put it? Well, the answer digit should always go directly above the digit we’re dividing. Since we’re dividing the digit 9, "
,,"our 2 should go right above the 9. Okay, now we multiply… 2 times 4 is 8, and the 8 goes below the 9 so that we can subtract to get our remainder. 9 minus 8 is 1, so our remainder is 1. Now at this point in our basic one-step division problems, we would re-write our remainder up in our answer with a little ‘r’ next to it. But we aren’t going to do that yet because this is long division and we still have more digits to divide (the ones we’ve been ignoring). Since we’re going digit-by-digit, "
,,"let’s stop ignoring the next digit in our dividend (the 3). Now you might think that our next division step is to divide that 3 by the 4.  But it’s not quite that simple. We had a remainder from our last division step, and we can’t just forget about that. We need to combine that remainder with our next digit and divide them both together. We do that by bringing down a COPY of the next digit (the 3) and put it right beside the remainder (which is 1). When we do that, it looks like our remainder is 13.  It’s kind of like our remainder is teaming up with the next digit over. And if you think about it, that makes sense because the digits that we were ignoring during our first division step really are part of the remainder, because we still need to divide them. Okay, so bringing down that next digit makes our remainder bigger. And that’s good because before, the remainder was so small that 4 couldn’t divide into it. But now it’s 13, and 4 will divide into 13. So we ask, “How many "
,,"‘4’s will it take to make 13?” Well, three ‘4’s would be 12, and that’s really close without being too big.  So let’s put 3 in our answer line. Yep - it goes right over the 3 because that is the next digit we were dividing in this digit-by-digit process. And then 3 times 4 is 12 which we put right below the 13 so that we can subtract to get the next remainder which will also be 1. See how we’re just repeating the basic division procedure?  But we’re going further down the screen as we do. Alright, now that we have a new remainder, it’s time for our next division step. Let’s stop ignoring the last digit in the dividend (the 6) and bring down a copy of it to team up with our new remainder. Together, they form a remainder of 16. Ah ha!  That’s good because it’s gonna be easy to divide 4 into 16 because 16 is a multiple of 4. It takes exactly fours ‘4’s to make 16.  So we put a 4 in the last place of our answer line, and then we write the 16 below our new remainder. Now if we subtract 16 from 16, we see that our last remainder will be zero, which means there’s no remainder left. That’s great!  We solved the whole division problem digit-by-digit by breaking it up into three basic division steps. And now we know that 936 divided by 4 equals 234. And we also know why they call it long division!! In fact, that was so long, I think I need a coffee break… Oh man… that was some looooooooooooong division! Wheew… let’s see… Okay, so that problem had a three-digit dividend and it also had three division steps. But the number of steps isn’t always the same as the number of digits we have. And that’s because the number of steps also depends on how big our divisor is. To see what I mean, let’s work two division problems side by side. These both look like the basic one-step division problems that you did in the last video, don’t they? But as you‘ll see, one of them is actually a two-step problem. Let’s start with the first problem: 72 divided by 8. We just ask, “How many ‘8’s does it take to make 72 (or almost 72)?” Well that’s easy!  On our multiplication table you can see that 72 is a multiple of 8. 8 × 9 = 72  So we put 9 "
,,"in our answer line, and we write 72 below, and we see that we have no remainder. Now let’s try the next problem: 72 divided by 3. If we ask, “How many ‘3’s will it take to make 72 (or almost 72)?”, we can see that the answer is not on our multiplication chart. The biggest multiple of three listed there is 30 which isn’t even close. The reason is that this should really be a two-step problem. Let’s try using the new digit-by-digit method we just learned. Instead of asking, “How many ‘3’s make 72?”, let’s just focus on the first digit and ask, “How many ‘3’s does it take to make 7?” Ah - that’s easy.  Two ‘3’s would give us 6, which is very close. So let’s put a 2 in the answer line right above the 7. Then we multiply 2 times 3, and that makes 6. And we subtract 6 from 7 to get a remainder of 1. Now for the second step… We bring down a copy of the next digit (the 2) and we combine it with the 1 to get a new remainder of 12. Then we ask, “How many ‘3’s does it take to make 12?” "
,,"and the answer to that is exactly 4. So we write a 4 in the answer line, and 3 × 4 = 12. 12 ? 12 = 0  So we have no remainder! We’re done!  72 divided by 3 is 24. Now here’s the interesting thing about these examples. The first problem could have been a two-step problem also. If we had taken it digit-by-digit, we would have first asked, “How many ‘8’s does it take to make 7 (or almost 7)?” But the answer would have been zero since 8 is too big to divide into 7. We would have put zero in our answer line and the remainder would have just been 7. So basically, we just skipped that step.  And that’ll happen with digit-by-digit division sometimes. If the number is too small to divide into, you just put a zero in the answer line and you move on to the next digit. Okay, now that you know the procedure for long division, "
,,"are you ready to see a really long problem? Good - I thought so! Let’s divide 315,270 by 5. Now don’t worry… it’s really not that hard if you just go digit-by-digit. I’m gonna work the problem pretty fast, so don’t worry if you don’t follow all the math. Just focus on the repeating division process as we go along.  Are you ready? The first digit is 3.  How many times will 5 divide into 3?  Zero. 5 is too big. So let’s just skip that step and combine our first digit with our next digit. So how many times does 5 divide into 31?  Six. 6 times 5 is 30.  And 31 minus 30 gives us a remainder of 1. Now on to the third digit…  We bring a copy of it down to join with the remainder. And we ask how many times will 5 divide into 15?  Three. 3 times 5 is 15. And 15 minus 15 is zero. On to the next digit… Now even though our previous remainder was zero, we still bring down a copy of the next digit. Now we ask how many times will 5 divide into 2?  Zero. 5 is too big, so we need to move on to the next digit and bring a copy of it down also. There, that’s better. Now we ask, how many times will 5 divide into 27?  Five. 5 times 5 is 25.  And 27 minus 25 gives a remainder of 2. …now for that last digit, which is a zero. And you might wonder, “Why do we even have to bring a copy of a zero down?  Isn’t that nothing?” But the zero is an important place holder… and when we bring a copy of it down, it changes our remainder of 2 into a remainder of 20.  Now that’s a big difference! Now we ask, how many times will 5 divide into 20?  Four. 4 times 5 is 20. And 20 minus 20 is zero. Yes!  We’re done!  There’s no more digits to divide. And you can see "
,,"that our final answer is:  63,054. Alright… that’s the procedure for long division. As you can see, it’s kinda complicated, so don’t get discouraged if you’re confused at first. Like almost everything, it just takes practice. So, as you get ready to practice some long division problems on your own, here’s a few tips that will help you out. First: If you haven’t already done it, memorizing your multiplication table will really help with division. Second: When you’re working problems, it’s really important to write neatly and stay organized. If your writing is messy, it might be hard to keep your columns lined up and that could lead to mistakes. And if that’s the case, try using graph paper to help keep things lined up. Third: Start with some smaller two or three-digit dividends so you only have a few division steps to do. Then work up to the longer problems. And last of all: After each practice problem you do, check your answer with a calculator. That will let you know right away if you’ve made any mistakes so you can correct them, and most importantly, learn from them. And it will give you practice with a calculator, which is also important. Alright, that’s all for this lesson. Thanks for watching Math Antics, and I’ll see ya next time. Learn more at www.mathantics.com"

angles,AeioiOxigu4,hello welcome back the title of this lesson is called points lines rays segments and angles this is part one you might say that's a lot of different concepts why are we covering them all in one place well we're starting to talk a little more seriously about geometry and so it makes sense to put all these together because they're very closely related so before we get started let's just talk big picture geometry is all around us we really use it all the time anytime you build a house or a bridge or you know construct anything you're using geometry even when you launch spaceships or talk about like physics in terms of gravity and all kinds of things we use geometry constantly to calculate things so here we're starting the the very first steps on that journey so we have to talk about these terms and so we have lots of figures and diagrams and we're going to learn about what these are the first one is very simple a point what is a point what does it mean to you a point is a place 
,,in space that's what it means a point doesn't have any width it doesn't it's not fat or skinny or anything it's just a place in space if you could get a tiny microscopic needle and point in one location that would be the closest thing to a point it's just a location right everything else in geometry is built upon the concept of 
,,a point so let's start by talking about the point what a line is what array is and so on so let's start talking about it by looking at an actual diagram so here we have a point b the point is represented in geometry by a dot right we have a point a and we have a point c and then these are obviously joined together by these arrows so notice though that the arrow is only on one side and over here there's no arrow over here there's an arrow on one side but there's no arrow here so if you cover up this half of the diagram and just look at what's going on over here this thing here from b to c is called a ray array is just like what you think of a ray of light it shoots out from one place and it goes on and on forever so this ray going from b to c starts at b and it goes on and on and ever through the point c going this way and the arrow means it goes forever the ray does not go forever this way it starts at point b so this array is called bc and the way that we write it and we know it's array is because we put an arrow on the top that means it only goes one way from b to c and it starts from b and it goes through c forever now we have another ray on this diagram it starts at b and it travels through the point a and goes on and on forever so this array is called ba notice the first letter you put is where the starting point is and then the arrow travels over the the other point it goes through so ba goes this way bc goes this way we would talk about the ray ba we would talk about the ray bc we would talk about the point a the point b the point c but the ray has to have at least two points it has to go somewhere so you have to have two letters to form a ray one starting point and then it goes through uh the other uh the other point as well all right now we have another word that we have used in the past we call it the vertex so we have this angle here and the angle is measured uh as the kind of the how much spread is between this ray and this ray an angle can be measured between lines or between rays when they come to a common point like this this is the angle measure like this how do we write names of angles well 
,,the middle letter here is called the vertex so the vertex is b and when we write down the angle the vertex b must be in the middle so we call this angle a b c we could also i don't have it on the page here but we can also name it angle c b a it doesn't matter which way you write the angle name down but you do have to have the middle point here the vertex in the middle that's how we always name angles so we call it angle abc this little symbol the little slant thing is called the angle symbol so this means angle abc you could also call it angle cb a ray ba goes this way ray bc goes this way vertex the vertex just means the center of the angle where the 
,,two rays come together that's what a vertex is a vertex is a corner essentially a vertex is basically a corner so we've talked about these concepts now let's move on to the next diagram we have we can talk about some other concepts here we talked about the concept of a point we've talked about a concept of an angle we talked about the vertex which is the center of the angle where the two rays come together now we're going to talk about angles again let's see how many angles do we have here 
,,in this rectangle here notice we have a 90 degree angle symbol here this symbol means 90 degrees 90 degrees 90 degrees to form a rectangle you have to have four 90 degree angles that's what a rectangle is right so we know that we have these angles and they're 90 degrees how would we name this angle right here the angle measure how would we name it well the angle is measured from here to here so the way we name it is the same way we did here a b c the vertex has to be in the center x is the 
,,vertex we're going to name it w x y this is going to tell us this is the angle we're talking about w x y this angle measure because the x vertex is in the center now we can also call it angle y x w that's fine too because it doesn't matter the way that you you name the angles you just have to have the vertex the corner of the angle in the middle that's all that matters now vertex we said was x for this angle now we have to talk about the concept of a line segment a line segment is exactly what it says a line goes on and on and on forever if i point a line in this way then the line is really going in both directions with a double-headed arrow forever for the end of the universe a line never ever ever stops array goes forever ever but remember array starts at a point but a line doesn't start at one location a line goes both directions forever ever ever right but a line segment is when you take a line and you cut it and you say well i only have a segment of that line so for instance take a look at this right here this is a line segment because it is a straight line but of course it's not going forever it starts at w and it ends at x this is a line segment this is a line segment this is a line segment why are these not rays because array remember goes on and on and on this arrow means it goes on and on 
,,and on forever but a segment does not do that a segment stops so this is a line segment this is a line segment this is a line segment this is a line segment now how 
,,do we name them just like you might think this line segment is named wx wx with a bar on the top or you can flip it around and call it xw xw with a bar on the top this means either name is okay when you're naming a line segment what about this line segment we can call it line segment x y which means we put x y with a bar on top 
,,or we can call it line segment y x with a bar on top so when you're naming segments it doesn't matter the order in which you write the letters because well it just doesn't really matter because it's it's a like a mirror image it doesn't matter what side you talk neither side is more important than the other neither endpoint is more important but with a ray notice the ray we have to start at the point b and call it ray bc or ray ba because b is the starting point of the ray and the ray goes 
,,on and on forever in the other direction so we have to name it in the right way here for a segment we just use the letters and put a bar on top notice there is no arrow in this bar because it is not array it doesn't go forever it stops so a line segment has a bar on top a ray has an arrow on top and that is a really important difference so before we solve our problems which are all going to be very simple i promise you let's review a point is just a location in space you could say this is point w point y point z point c point b point a those are all called points then we have something called rays which are just when we start at a point and we go on and on forever in one direction this is array this is array we call it ray ba this way re b c this way we start at the vertex or the starting point and we go right we 
,,can have instead of array we can have segments line segments right where we don't have an arrow but we know that we're going between w and x and it's a line segment 
,,so we put the letters and stick a bar on top x y same thing just put the letters put a bar on top no arrow heads because we just have a segment right then we can of 
,,course form angles with our line segment w x y y x w for instance we can also form angles with rays a b c or c b a the symbol for an angle is a kind of a slanted kind of like little angle symbol like a mouth here and the same symbol right here and then of course we have the concept of a line which i didn't draw on the board but 
,,a line is when it goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on both directions never stopping in either direction so now that we have all of that we finally know enough to solve a couple of problems here is an angle we have some points here this is the vertex of the angle and we want to answer a couple of questions the first question is what are the two rays in this angle how do we write down the two rays well the rays that we have we see an arrow here so we have a ray going up like this and we have an arrowhead here which means a ray going off like this the other side is not an arrowhead so it does not go on and on this way it starts at u and it 
,,goes through v and it starts at u and it goes through t so we have two rays here what are they called we call them ray u v and we put an arrow head this direction and we put a comma here and we call re u t with an arrow head this direction this is how we write it u v and u t the u comes first because that's the starting point and then we have the second point u v and then u t and the arrow head points from u to v points from u to t so it tells us how the diagram's laid out just by writing the name down all right the second question is what is the vertex of this angle here the vertex is just a corner which is the kind of the inside kind of the middle point where the two rays join up so the vertex is just the point u that's just a point in space now how do we name this angle you can name it actually two ways but we're gonna name it for this location we're gonna call it angle t u v t u v right now you could name it angl v u t v u t so t u v v u t same exact thing notice u is in 
,,the center in both cases so either of these names is fine for the angle but going forward i'm just going to write one name down so i'm not going to write every single name you can name these things multiple ways so let me take these off the board and we're going to solve some more problems to give you more practice all right welcome back to problem two we have this triangle here and each of the uh points are we call vertices the plural of vertex is vertices we label them j h and i and we want to ask ourselves a few questions this is the angle that we're talking about here with the red arc right here the first question is what are the segments the line 
,,segments that make up this angle here on the board so in other words we have an angle here what segments form this angle well they're joined together here so it's this line segment and it's also this line segment so we have to write these segments down now there's multiple ways that you can name this but i'm going to call this segment j h we're going to put a line segment symbol over jh and we're going to call this segment we're going to have to call it something here we're going to call it h i h i now i just want you to realize that when you name these line segments you can you can flip the order of the letters right because it doesn't there's no arrow here there's no preference to what corner makes more sense in other words this is j h we could call it h j with a bar on top this one is h i but i could call it i 
,,h with a bar on top and it would mean the same thing all right next question what is the vertex of this angle well the vertex is just the point where the the segments come together so the vertex is just the point h very simple and then the next question is the last question here what is the name of this angle how do we name this angle now there's a couple of different ways i'm going to call it angle j h i j h i now i'm trying to emphasize that there's more than one way to write this the angle could be called i h j but h has to be in the center all right so that was problem number two let's take a look now at problem number three now we have a regular old angle here that is formed from this ray and this ray we know that they're rays because they have arrowheads okay and so the first question is what are the rays that form this angle what are the names of the rays well this ray starts at point q and it goes through point r so we have to call this ray q r and the arrow head goes like this what is the other ray starts at point q goes through point p q p arrow head like this and we have to use these names we cannot flip them around because for array there is a starting point and then it goes on forever the starting point is q so q comes first qr and then qp for the segments we can flip the names of the letters because there's no arrowhead anywhere but for these there's an arrowhead so there is a starting point that's why we have to write this qr and qp what is the vertex of this angle the vertex are where the rays come together vertex is essentially the corner and so the vertex is the point q how do we name this angle well there's multiple different ways to name it but we're going to call it uh p q r p q r q has to be in the center bonus points if you can tell me another name of this angle well instead of p q r we can call it r q p as long as q is in the center you can name angles multiple ways all right p q r next problem we have what appears to be a square it looks like the lengths of these sides are all the same but maybe they're not quite but anyway we have four right angles so we know for sure it's a rectangle and it might be a square if we have the lengths of these sides all the same so the question is for this guy what are the names of the line segments that make up the angle x down here right this angle here that we're looking at what are the segments that make that up well here is a segment here and here's a segment here these 
,,are the two segments that make this angle so we're going to call it segment wx with a line segment bar and we're going to call it segment x y now because these are line segments we can flip the order instead of w x we could call it line segment x w instead of x y we could call it line segment y x because there's a bar on top and there's no arrow head then we can flip the order of the letters if you want to all right what is the vertex of this angle of course it's what these two segments are joined at point x so the vertex is point x and how do we name this angle here's the angle it goes from w x y so we're going to call it angle symbol w x y now of course bonus points if you tell me the other angle it could be called angle y x w that's fine too i'm not going to write every name for every one of these guys but that is the idea all right next problem we have a nice angle formed here at point f and we have a ray going through g and we have a ray starting at f and going through e so what are the two rays we've already kind of said the rays all start at f and this one goes through g so we have an arrowhead on top and then we have another ray 
,,that starts at f and it goes through e now for the rays you cannot flip the order of the letters because they have a starting point at f and so you have to put the arrow on top and you have to start at f and like we have done here what is the vertex of this angle it's where the two rays come together it's point f and the angle here how would i name it the angle there's two ways to name the angle we're going to call it e f g e f g you can also name this angle angle g f e so e f g or g f e same thing all right last problem in this lesson here we have a uh one two three four five segment figure here or five sided figure here what are the segments that make up the angle over here as indicated by the arrow this is angle m with a vertex of m here so what segments do we have we have this segment and we have this segment 
,,how do we name this well we can name it different ways but this segment goes from l to m so we're going to call it segment lm and then we have also a segment from m 
,,going to n so we're going to call it segment m n notice there is no arrowhead on top because this is a segment these are segments not rays we call it lm we could call it segment ml this is mn we could call the segment in m so we can flip the order of the letters if we want when we're naming the segments what is the vertex of this angle it's where the segments come together the vertex is point m that's just a point and then how do you name this angle what is the name of this angle and there's a couple of ways to do it we're going to call it lmn so we're going to call it angle l m n angle l m n but of course you know by now that you can also name it n m 
,,l as long as m is in the center which it is so we actually covered a lot of material in this lesson and i hope now you can see why we lumped it all together because 
,,we talk about points but we have to understand what a point is in order to talk about array because array starts at a point and it goes through another point right and then we have to talk about line segments and those can be used to form angles and so on so we have to kind of talk about it all together what i'd like you to do is go back through this lesson draw these figures yourself and try to name the different things that we named in this lesson even if you just saw it that's okay i want you to get practice and when you feel like you understand what's happening follow me on the part two we'll give you a little more practice to wrap up the concept understanding points lines rays angles and vertices

angles,6RMN5Pf1fHU,"Consider line 'p' and line 'q' which are on a plane. The lines are also parallel to each other, which would mean that they do not intersect or ever meet. And this is transversal 'R' , which cuts the lines 'p' and 'q' at two distinct points. In this video we will try to understand the different types of angles formed by the transversal with two parallel lines. The transversal forms four angles with line 'p', angles 1, 2, 3 & 4. And four angles with line 'q', angles 5, 6, 7 & 8. Let's move on to the first type of angles. If lines p and q are parallel, then angle 1 will always equal angle 5. This angle here will be equal to this one. They are called corresponding angles. It doesn't matter how the transversal is placed. These angles will always be equal. On a new page let us try moving the transversal around. Assume line 'a', and line 'b' are parallel to each other. And here is a transversal 'c'. You can see that these two angles look equal. Now let's rotate the transversal towards the right. These two angles again seem to be equal. Now let's rotate the transversal towards the left . The angles become obtuse and are still equal. This tells us that the corresponding angles are always equal. Now let's go back to the previous page. Now let me ask you an interesting question. Look at the figure closely. Is "
,,"this the only pair of corresponding angles? No! It isn't. We have three more pairs of corresponding angles. When a transversal intersects a pair of Parallel lines. Four pairs of corresponding angles are formed. Two and six form a corresponding angles pair. So angle two will always equal angle six. You can even look at the figure and observe that they are equal. Similarly, angle three will equal angle seven, and angle four will equal angle eight. These are the four pairs of corresponding angles that are formed. 1 & 5, 2 & 6, 3 & 7, 4 & 8. Angles 3, 4, 5 & 6 are interior angles, because they are between the two parallel lines. And they are classified into two types. Let's understand the first type. Angle 3 and Angle 5 form a pair of alternate interior angles. We know why they are called interior, but why exactly are they called alternate? If we have a round table with numbers 3, 4, 5 & 6 around it, then 5 is alternate to 3. That's because after 3 you skip 1 position and take the next. Similarly, 6 will be alternate to 4. In this diagram as well to find alternate of 3 we skip 1 position and take the next which is 5 . And similarly, angle 4 "
,,"and angle 6 are also called alternate interior angles. This was the first type of interior angles. The second type is a pair in which the angles are next to each other on the same side of the transversal. Like angle 3 and angle 6. They are called consecutive interior angles. Look at the figure now. Do you see any other pair of consecutive interior angles? Yes! With the same logic even angles 4 & 5 are consecutive interior Angles. Remember, there are two types of interior angles. Alternate and Consecutive. For alternate we skip one and move to the next. For consecutive, we take the one that's immediately next to it. And the last types of angles that are formed are vertically opposite angles. Angles 1 & 3 are called vertically opposite angles. In all there are 4 pairs of vertically opposite angles, Apart from angles 1 & 3, we have angles 2 & 4, angles 5 & 7 and angles 6 & 8 as the other 3 pairs. And vertically opposite angles are always equal. These were the different types of "
,,"angles that were formed when a transversal meets two parallel lines. On a new page let's look at the beauty of these angles. Assume we have lines 'a' and 'b' which are parallel. And transversal 'c' which intersects them at two distinct points. As we already know the transversal forms eight angles. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven and eight. Let us quickly analyze the relation between various angles formed. It's pretty simple actually. Angle two will be equal to angle six as their corresponding angles. An angle eight equals angle six as it is vertically opposite to it . And angle four equals angle eight because they are corresponding angles. Similarly, angle one equals angle five as their corresponding angles. Angle seven equals angle five because they are vertically opposite. And angle three equals angle seven because they are corresponding angles. So if lines 'a' and 'b' are parallel, we can see that angles one, three, five and seven are equal. And angles two, four, six and eight are equal."

angles,xzAGoErwAxg,smile and learn hey hello how are you doing I was just about to start my daily exercise routine to keep my nuts and screws in shape what I like most is doing yoga I 
,,am pretty good at it thanks to my body I can bend myself easily to every angle do you know what an angle is you don't I'll tell you about it an angle is the space between two straight lines that start at the same point for example right now I am tracing an angle with my body the straight lines of an angle are called segments and the point where both lines meet is called the vertex in my body the vertex would be my hips and the segment's the upper and lower parts of my body we measure angles in degrees degrees indicate how open each angle is depending on the angle opening we classify angles in acute angles are those angles that measure less than 90 degrees right angles are those angles that measure 90 degrees obtuse angles are those angles that measure more than 90 degrees in less than 180 degrees flat angles are those angles that measure exactly 180 degrees this is my favorite pose it's easy-peasy whoo reflex angles measure more than 180 degrees and less than 360 degrees see 
,,how good I am at this pose look I could stretch even more ouch I think I overdid it a little well that's a full rotation ankle these angles measure 360 degrees I think that's the last time I'm trying this pose it hurts have you seen how many angles I can bend my body into even though today is not my day let's recap what we've learned an angle is the space between two straight lines that we call segments and the point where both lines meet is called the vertex to classify angles we measure their opening this is measured in degrees depending on the angle opening angles can be acute they measure less than 90 degrees right they measure exactly 90 degrees obtuse they measure between 90 and 180 degrees flat they measure exactly 180 degrees reflux they measure more than 180 degrees full rotation they measured 360 degrees and that is all about angles I hope you've learned a lot friends I think I'm going to call an ambulance do you want to keep on learning try for free our smile and learn platform for a month and enjoy all of our games videos and interactive stories go for it download smile and learn on your mobile tablet or PC

angles,e4o7X6LyX-I,in this video we're going to talk about lines and angles the first type of line that you need to be familiar with are parallel lines parallel lines do not intersect 
,,so let's call the first line a and the second line B so we could say that a is parallel to line B so these two lines are also parallel they share the same slope so if the first line has a slope of 3 over 4 the second line has the same exact slope perpendicular lines are different whenever you have two perpendicular lines intersecting each other they will form a right angle so they meet at 90 degrees let's call this line a and line B so the way you can describe it you could say line a is perpendicular to line B so this symbol represents that those two lines are perpendicular so let's say that line c has a slope of 3 over 4 what do you think the slope will be for line D to find the slope of the perpendicular line you need to flip the fraction so instead of 3 over 4 it's going to be 4 over 3 now I need to change the 
,,sign from positive to negative so has the slope negative 4 over 3 when you have a third line that intersects two parallel lines that third line is the transversal so let's say this is line a and B so if a is parallel to B then C is going to be the transversal we'll call this angle one two three four five six seven eight angles three four five and six are known as interior angles when you think of the word interior what do you think of interior means on the inside so those four angles three 
,,four five six there in between or any inside of the two parallel lines angles one two seven and eight are known as exterior angles because they're outside of the two parallel lines now what Shane goals are alternate interior angles need to be able to identify those so the fact that they're on the interior has to be between three four and five six three and six are alternate interior angles they're on the inside of the two parallel lines but they're opposite of the transversal three is on the left side of the transversal and six is on the right side of the transversal so that's why they called alternate interior angles now alternate interior angles are 
,,congruent so angle three is equal to angle six they have the same exact measure assuming if a and B are parallel angle four and five are also alternate interior angles they're congruent now what about alternate exterior angles angle 1 & 8 are alternate exterior angles it turns out also angle 2 & 7 are alternate exterior angles alternate exterior angles are congruent they're the same and if you're wondering why they're called alternate exterior angles well first the word exterior they're on 
,,the outside or an exterior of the two parallel lines and they alternate with reference to the transversal so angle 1 is on the left side of the transversal or line C angle a is on the right side so they're on alternate sides and 2 & 7 are alternate exterior angles now the next term that you need to be familiar with are corresponding angles angle 2 and angle 6 are corresponding angles corresponding angles are congruent angles 1 & 5 are corresponding angles angles 4 & 8 or correspondent and 3 & 7 correspond to each other so angle 4 is congruent to angle a and angle 3 is congruent to angle 7 so those are corresponding angles they're on the same position on the parallel lines in relation to the transversal so if you look at t16 they're both on the right side of the transversal and they're both above the two parallel lines if you look at a three and seven that will on the left side of the transversal and I both below the parallel lines so they're in the same position on the crowded lines in this case they're both below it and they're both on the left side of the transversal now there's some other terms that you need to be familiar with as well the next term is consecutive interior angles so 4 & 6 are consecutive interior angles they're on the inside of the transversal and consecutive means then basically the next one after so for example consecutive integers 2 3 4 5 6 3 is consecutive stitute because it comes right after so if you look at this angle the next one is 
,,6 so those are consecutive interior angles consecutive interior angles they add up to 180 so basically there is supplementary so angle 4 plus angle 6 adds up to 180 
,,angle 3 and angle 5 adds up to 180 so there's supplementary now the last time you need to be familiar with our vertical angles so whenever you have two lines that intersect each other they will form vertical angles let's save this angles fifty this angle is also fifty vertical angles are congruent one in four are vertical angles so one in four congruent Q and three are vertical angles seven and six are vertical angles so they equal each other and five and eight are congruent to each other so those are vertical angles so anytime we have a transversal or third line that intersects two parallel lines you're going to have a lot of congruent angles so just 
,,make sure you're familiar with those terms now the next time that you need to be familiar with are complementary angles so let's say that line a and line B are perpendicular to each other let me just go ahead and extend those two lines so that means that this angle between a and B is 90 degrees let's draw a line let's say this angle is 30 now let's call this line C and let's call this vertex V so angle C the B is 30 degrees what is angle a V C so you know they have to add up to 90 because angle a ZB is 90 so 90 minus 30 is 60 so therefore these two angles are complementary they add up to 90 so angle a VC plus angle C VB has to add up to angle a ZB so that's an example of complementary angles they add up to 90 the nest excuse me the next one I need to be familiar with are supplementary angles which we briefly talked about before supplementary angles add up to 180 so let's say if you have a straight line and there's another line that passes through it the total angle of the straight line will always be 180 a full circle is 360 so half a circle that's 180 so if this angle is 60 the other angle has to be 120 so let's call this a B C and D so angle abd that's basically 120 plus DBC which is 60 is equal to basically the straight-line ABC which is 180 so whenever you have a straight line all the angles that are part of that straight line has to add up to 180 so here's an example let's say this is 40 and this is 70 what is the missing angle and this is a straight line 
,,so 70 plus 40 plus X has to add up to 180 70 plus 40 is 110 so to find the value of x we need to subtract 110 from both sides so X is 180 minus 110 so X is also 70 degrees so now you familiar with the terms supplementary and complementary so keep in mind if Q angles are complementary that means that they add up to 90 degrees if 
,,two angles are supplementary they add up to 180 degrees so now let's go over a few practice problems and solving certain things so I'm going to give you a few questions and I want you to find the value of X so in the first example what is the value of x now these two angles are congruent their vertical angles so therefore X is simply 70 in the second example these two form a linear pair the supplementary because they form a straight line when you add it together so therefore 80 plus X is equal to 180 so X is going to be 180 minus 80 so X is 100 degrees so some of these problems are not going to be very difficult so let's say if this is 30 and this is 2x plus 5 and this is y find the value of x and y actually let's say this is y plus 8 feel free to pause the video and work on our problem so we know that 30 and y plus eight are vertical angles so therefore they're congruent so we can set 30 equal to y plus 8 therefore Y is going to be 30 minus 8 so Y is 22 now what is the value of x now these two they form a linear pair so there's supplementary so 30 plus 2x plus 5 has to add up to 180 so now we can find the value of x 30 plus 5 that's 35 
,,so if we subtract both sides by 35 2 X is 180 minus 35 which is 145 and then we need to divide by 2 so half of 140 is 70 half of 5 is 2.5 so half of 145 is going to 
,,be 72 point 5 so that's the value of X let's say this angle is 35 what is the value of X let's call this a B C and D so let's say that angle ABC is a right angle what is the value of angle DBC or basically what is the value of X so because this is the right angle of represents 90 degrees therefore angle abd which is 35 must add 
,,up to or angle abd plus angle DBC which is X they have to add up to angle ABC which is 90 so basically these two angles are complementary so X is simply 90 minus 35 
,,which is 55 is another example it's a very similar problem but slightly different so let's say this is 7x and this is 11 X now let's say angle ABC is once again a right angle what is the value of angle abd so feel free to pause the video and try this problem angle abd which is represented by 7x plus angle DBC which is represented by 11x they have to add up to 90 so we can say that 7x plus 11x is 90 so now let's find the value of x so 7 plus 11 is 18 and 90 divided by 18 is 5 so X is equal to 5 but our goal is to find a measure of angle abd not simply the value of X angle abd keep in mind its 7x so our goal is to find the value of 7x so that's seven times five which turns out to be 35 degrees if we wanted to find the angle of angle DBC that's 11 X 11 times five is 55 now let's say if we have a straight line now let's say this is a B C and D now let's say that angle DBC is 7x minus 6 and angle abd is 13 X plus 26 go ahead and find the angle DBC finest measure feel free to pause the video so we said ABC is a straight line that means that it has an angle of 180 so angle a BD plus angle DBC has to add up to angle ABC ABD and DBC they're basically adjacent angles so this is abd and it's angle is 13 X plus 26 angle DBC is 7 X minus 6 so those two have to add up to ABC which is basically a straight line and the angle of a straight line is always 180 so therefore these two angles are supplementary since they add up to 180 so now our goal is to find the value of X 13 X plus 7x adds up to 20 X and then 26-6 that's 20 so 20 X plus 20 is equal to 180 so now let's subtract both sides by 20 180 minus 20 that's 160 and now let's divide both sides by 20 we can cancel a 0 so this becomes 16 divided by 2 which is 8 so that's the value of X now that we have the value of x we can find angle DBC which is 7x minus 6 so we got to take this answer plug it in into 7x minus 6 so it's going to be 7 times 8 minus 6 7 times 8 that's basically 56 and 56 minus 6 is 50 so therefore angle DBC is 50 degrees which means that abd has to be 180 minus 50 or 130 since these two are supplementary let's call this line C and line D let's say that C is parallel to D and we have a transversal which we'll call line a now if this angle would say is 50 find all the other angles formed by this transversal so go ahead 
,,and find angles 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 angle 2 is a vertical angle with respect to that angle so therefore they are congruent so this is 50 angle 1 is supplementary to angle 
,,50 so they have to add up to 180 so when 80 minus 50 is 130 angle 3 is the vertical angle with respect to 130 so angle 3 is also 130 now what about angle 4 notice that angle 1 and angle for our correspondent angles so they're congruent angle 5 is an alternate interior angle with respect to angle 2 alternate interior angles are congruent so angle 5 is also 50 degrees I think we call this angle 6 which is a vertical angle with respect to angle 5 so that's 50 an angle 7 is the vertical angle with respect to 130 so that's also 130 and so that's basically how you can solve that here's another example so let's say that these two lines are parallel we'll call it line a and line B and C is the transversal so if this is 70 go ahead and find all the other angles so this must be 70 as well and these two angles are supplementary 180 minus 70 is 110 so this is a vertical angle so these are congruent this angle corresponds to this angle so that's 110 which means this is 110 and this is 70 
,,and that is 70 so you can quickly find all the angles for a problem like this now here's another problem let's say line a and line B are parallel to each other and there's going to be two transversals so this is one transversal we can call it line C and it intersects with another transversal which we'll call Lime D and let's say that this angle is 50 degrees and let's say this angle is 40 go ahead and find all other angles that can be formed by this figure so this angle is 40 we know this has to be 40 their vertical angles and therefore 180 minus 40 is 140 now this is 50 this must be 50 as well their vertical angles and these two are supplementary 180 
,,minus 50 is 130 which means this is 130 now these two angles are consecutive interior angles they add up to 180 which means this is 130 now these two angles are alternate interior angles so therefore this is 50 and this angle and that angle their alternate exterior angles so they're congruent which means this must be 130 and so 
,,this angle on the inside is 50 now let's call this X what is the value of angle X what would you say now keep in mind this figure is not drawn to scale I just made this problem and put some numbers to it so if that is X you need to know that the three angles of a triangle must always add up to 180 so that's 14 s is 15 and this is X 40 plus 50 plus X has to be 180 so if you take 180 and subtract it by 40 and then by 50 you should get let's see 180 minus 40 is 141 40 minus 50 is 90 therefore 
,,X is 90 which means this has to be 92 even though it's not drawn is gone so these are complimentary so basically all of these angles will be 90 right angles but the 
,,not trying to scale let's try another similar problem but one that hopefully is not 90 so this time we're going to make this angle 60 and this angle is going to be 110 so go ahead and find all other angles if that's 110 these two angles are supplementary which means this angle must be 70 and this has to be 70 as well which means this is 110 so now let's find the missing angle angle X so sixty plus seventy plus X has to add up to 180 60 and 70 is 130 and 180 minus 130 is 50 so therefore this angle is 50 now that we have all three angles of that triangle we could find everything else now those two a supplementary which means this must be 120 120 plus 60 
,,adds it's 180 so that's 60 that's 120 now these two are corresponding angles so therefore this is 60 these two are alternate exterior angles so they're congruent this is 120 and these two are alternate interior angles so that's 60 and this is going to be 120 since these two are vertical angles now these two are vertical angles as well so this is 50 and then 180 minus 50 is 130 so this is 130 as well now these two are alternate interior angles so this must be 50 and those two are also entering gel's so that's 130 and then these two are corresponding angles so corresponding angles are congruent and these two are alternate exterior angles which are also convert now notice that we have a quadrilateral in the middle a quadrilateral is a four-sided figure a three-sided figure like a triangle has an interior angle all the internal angles of a triangle adds up to 180 so any three-sided figure will always have the sum of their angles which is 180 if you have a four-sided figure like this quadrilateral highlighted in red the sum of those four angles will be 360 so if you add 60 and 50 that's 110 plus 120 that's 230 plus 130 230 plus 130 that's going to be 360 so there's a rule where you find the sum of the interior angles it's n minus 2 times 180 so for three-sided figure like a triangle n is 3 3 minus 2 is 1 180 minus 180 times 1 is 180 now if you have a four-sided figure like a quadrilateral n is 4 4 minus 2 is 2 2 times 180 that's 360 so the sum of all the interior angles is 360 now let's say if you have a five sided figure in this case the Pentagon using the formula n minus 2 times 180 this time n is going to be 5 since there are five sides 5 minus 2 is 3 3 times 180 is 540 so the sum of all five angles let's say angle a b c d and e the sum of all five of these angles has to add up to 540 now let's work on some word problems feel free to pause the video and try these problems yourself number one if angle a and angle B are complementary what is the value of angle B if angle a is 32 now if you recall whenever you hear the word complimentary that means that the two angles add up to 90 so angle A plus angle B equals 90 now we're given the value of angle a it's 32 so 32 plus angle B is 90 so define angle B we need to subtract both sides by 32 so angle B is going to be 90 minus 32 
,,90 minus 30 is 60 and then 60 minus 2 is 58 so that's going to be the value of angle B number 2 if angle a and angle B are supplementary what is the value of angle a if angle B is 74 degrees so keep in mind the word supplementary means that the two angles add up to 180 degrees so angle A plus angle B is equal to 180 degrees now 
,,this time we have the value of angle B which is 74 degrees so let's go ahead and find the value of angle 8 so let's begin by subtracting both sides by 74 so angle a 
,,is going to be 180 minus 74 180 minus 70 is 110 and 110 minus 4 is 106 so this is going to be the answer number three angles R and s are complementary if angle R is 
,,3 X plus 1 and angle s is 9 X minus 7 what is the measure of angle s so go ahead and take a minute and work on its problem so these two angles are complementary so we know that R plus s has to add up to 90 angle R is 3 X plus 1 and angle s is 9 X minus 7 so now all we need to do is find the value of x and then we can find the measure of angle s 3 x + 9 X that's 12 X 1 plus negative 7 is negative 6 so 12 X minus 6 is 90 now let's go ahead and add 6 to both sides so 12 X is equal to 96 and now let's divide both sides by 12 96 divided by 12 is 8 so X is equal to 8 now that we have the value of X we could find the measure of angle s angle s is 9 X minus 7 
,,so all we gotta do is take this value plug it into that expression so it's 9 times 8 minus 7 9 times 8 is 72 and 72 minus 7 is 65 so that's the measure of angle s it's 65 degrees number for angles X and y are supplementary if angle X is 11 X minus 22 and angle Y is 5 X plus 10 what is the value of angle Y so the angles are supplementary which means that they add up to 180 so X plus y equals 180 now angle X is 11x minus 22 let's not confuse these two letters with each other angle y is 5 X plus 10 so now let's go ahead and find a value of X 11 X + 5 X adds up to 16 X negative 22 plus 10 adds up to negative 12 so now let's solve let's add 12 to both sides so 16 X is equal to 192 now let's divide both sides by 16 192 divided by 16 that's about 12 so now we can find the measure of angle line angle Y is 5x plus 10 so let's insert this value into that expression so it's going to be 5 times 12 plus 10 five times 12 is 60 60 plus 10 is 70 so angle Y is 70 degrees which means that angle X must be 110 degrees so let's say that these two lines line a and B are parallel to each other and we have a transversal line C and once again we're going to say 
,,that this is angle 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 so in this example let's say that angle 2 is equal to 5 X and angle 3 is equal to 3 X plus 24 your goal is to find the value of x 
,,so feel free to pause the video and go ahead and try that problem so what is the relationship between angles 2 & 3 angles 2 & 3 are vertical angles and as we know vertical angles are congruent so we could say that angle 2 is equal to angle 3 now angle 2 is 5x angle 3 is 3 X plus 24 so now all we need to do is find the value of x so let's begin by subtracting both sides by 3 X 5x minus 3x is 2x so 2x is equal to 24 and 24 divided by 2 is 12 so that's the answer to the first problem X is equal to 12 now let's move on to our second example so let's say that angle 4 is equal to 5x plus 5 and angle 6 is equal to 10 X minus 50 your task is to find the measure of angle 6 so go ahead and take a minute and do that the first thing we need to do is identify the relationship between angles four and six angles four and six are consecutive interior angles consecutive interior angles are supplementary they add up to 140 I mean up what 40 but 180 so angle 4 plus angle 6 equals 180 angle 4 is 5x plus 5 angle 6 is 10 X minus 50 so now all we need to do is find the value of x and then we can use that to find the measure of angle 6 5 X plus 10 X is 15 X 5 plus negative 50 is negative 45 so let's add 45 to both sides 180 plus 40 is 220 and then if you add 5 to it this is going to be 225 225 divided by 15 is 15 so X is equal to 15 so now we define the measure of angle 6 angle 6 is 10 X minus 50 so let's replace X with 15 so we're going to have 10 times 15 minus 50 15 times 10 is 150 and 150 minus 50 is 100 so 100 is the measure of angle 6 let's try one more problem let's say that angle 1 is equal to 9x plus 16 and angle 2 I mean not 2 but angle 8 is 12 X minus 2 using this information go ahead and find a measure of angle 1 so what is the relationship between angles 1 & 8 1 & 8 are alternate exterior angles and they're congruent so because they're congruent angles 1 & 8 are equal to each other which means that 9x plus 16 is equal to 12x minus 2 so let's go ahead and find a value of x let's begin by subtracting both sides by 9x and at the same time let's add 2 to both sides 16 plus 2 is 18 12x minus 9x is 3x 18 divided by 3 is 6 so X is equal to 6 now that we have the value of x we could find a measure of angle 1 angle 1 is 9x plus 16 so now let's replace X with 6 so angle 1 is going to be 9 times 6 plus 16 9 times 6 is 54 54 plus 16 is 70 so the measure of angle 1 is 70 degrees so that is it for this video so hopefully it gave you a good understanding of parallel lines perpendicular lines transversals and now you know how to identify corresponding angles alternate interior and exterior angles consecutive interior angles and basically everything else that we went over this video so that's it and have a nice day

angles,9Uc62CuQjc4,"Hi, I’m Rob.  Welcome to Math Antics! In this lesson, we’re gonna learn something that’s an important foundation for tons of math problems, including those you’ll encounter while learning basic Algebra. We’re gonna learn about graphing, which basically means taking mathematical relationships and turning them into pictures. Hey Friends, welcome back to The Joy of Graphing. We’re gonna pick up right where we left off. We already have this nice, beautiful function right here. But it needs a friend. And we’re gonna do that by adding some points. So let’s put the next point right here. Now all we need to do is connect those points…cuz they’re all friends. And what to friends do? They stay connected. Oh and look at that… That’s beautiful. Well, not the kind of picture that you’d hang on your wall. Graphing just means making a visual representation of an equation or data set so you can understand it better. It’s a way of helping you literally SEE how math works. When math is just a "
,,"bunch of numbers and symbols on a page, it can be pretty abstract and hard to relate to. But graphing is like a window into the abstract world of math that helps us "
,,"see it more clearly. In fact, the focus of our lesson today actually looks a bit like a window. …and it’s called “The Coordinate Plane”. The coordinate plane is the "
,,"platform or stage that our graphing will take place on. But to understand how it works, we first need to start with its closest relative; The Number Line. You remember how a number line works, right? A number line starts at zero, and represents positive numbers as you move to the right and negative numbers as you more to the left. And there’s usually marks showing where each integer is along the way. Now imagine cloning that number line and rotating the copy counter-clockwise by 90 degrees "
,,"so that the second number line is perpendicular to the first and they intersect at their zero points. What we have now is a “number plane”.  It’s basically like a 2-Dimensional version of a number line, but that second dimension makes it much more useful. With a simple 1-Dimensional number line, we could show where various numbers were located along that line by drawing (or plotting) points. But no matter how many points we plot, they’re always on the same line. But with a 2-Dimensional number plane, we can plot points anywhere in that 2D area, and that opens up a whole new world of possibilities. With a 1-Dimensional number line, plotting points was easy. You just needed one number to tell you where to plot a point. But with a 2-Dimensional number plane, you actually need TWO numbers to plot each point. These two numbers are called “coordinates” because they’re the same ‘rank’ or ‘order’ and they work together to specify the locations of a point on the number plane. In fact, that’s why the number plane is often referred to as the “coordinate plane”. It’s the stage for plotting coordinates. Coordinates use a special format to help you recognize them. The two numbers are put inside parentheses with a comma between them as a separator. So when you see 2 comma 5 or negative 7 comma 3 or 0 comma 1.5 you know you’re dealing with coordinates. Okay, to understand how coordinates work, remember that our number plane is formed by combining two perpendicular number lines. From now on, we’re going to refer to each one of these number lines as an “axis”. One of the axes is horizontal (like the horizon) which means the other axis is vertical (or straight up and down). And they’re often called the “horizontal” and “vertical” axes because of that. But even more often, the axes are referred to by variable-based names. The horizontal axis is called “the X-axis” and the vertical axis is called “the Y-Axis”. Why use variable names? Well there’s two good reasons. The first is that variable names are more flexible than horizontal and vertical, which relate to a specific orientation in space that may not always be relevant. And the second reason is that each of the two coordinate numbers is actually a variable that relates to a specific position along one of the two axes of the coordinate plane. And since those variables are usually called ‘X’ and ‘Y’, it makes sense to name the two axes the same way. The first coordinate number listed will be called ‘X’ and the second coordinate number listed will be called ‘Y’. And we’re always going to list the numbers in that same order, ’X’ first and then ‘Y’, so that we never get confused about which is which. In fact, coordinates are often called “ordered pairs” because they’re a pair of numbers that are always listed in the same order: ‘X’ value first… ‘Y’ value second. So if you have the coordinates, (3, 5) that means X = 3 and Y = 5. Pretty easy, right? But now how do we actually plot these coordinates (or ordered pairs) on the coordinate plane? Well, the first number in the ordered pair tells you where along the X-Axis the point is located, and the second "
,,"number in the ordered pair tells you where along the Y-Axis the point is located. The two numbers in an ordered pair work together to define a single point, and each one of the numbers only gives you half of the information about where that point is. To see how this works, let’s plot the coordinates (3, 2) First, we locate the X value along the X-axis, which is at 3 in this case. But instead of putting a point there, we draw (or just imagine) a line perpendicular to the X-axis that goes through the 3. We do that because the first number in the ordered pair only tells us where along the X-axis the point is, but it could be ANYWHERE along the Y-axis. We "
,,"won’t know that until we plot the second number. So temporarily, we just draw a line there to represent every possible point that could have an X value of 3. Next, we locate the Y value along the Y-axis, which is at 2 in this case. But again, instead of putting a point there, we draw (or just imagine) a line perpendicular to the Y-axis that goes through the 2. We do that because the second number in the ordered pair only tells us where along the Y-axis the point is, but it could be ANYWHERE along the X-axis. So we just draw a line there to represent every possible point that could have a Y value of ‘2’ Ah, but look what we’ve got now. The first line represents all the possible locations where X equals 3. And the second line represents all the possible locations where Y equals 2. And the exact point where the two lines intersect represents the only point in the entire coordinate plane where both X = 3 and Y = 2. That intersections is the location of our point. Pretty cool, huh?  And that’s a really good way to understand how the coordinate plane works. But I want to show you an even easier (and more intuitive) way to actually plot points. This more intuitive way involves starting with a point at the origin of the coordinate plane and then treating the coordinates like a set of simple instructions that tell you how far to move your point in the X and Y directions. For example, to plot the coordinates (3, 2) like before, we start by imagining a point at the origin (0, 0) Then, we look at the first number in our ordered pair to see how far we need to move our point in the X direction. Since X is positive 3, we move our point a distance of 3 units in the positive X direction. And then from there, since Y is positive 2, we move our point a distance of 2 units in the positive Y direction. So that’s a pretty easy method for plotting points! Let’s try it a few more times so you get the idea. Let’s plot the coordinates (-4, 3). Again, we start by imagining a point at the origin and then let the coordinates tell us how far to move it along the X and Y axes. Since X is negative 4, we move the point a distance of 4 units, but this time in the negative X direction which is to the left. And then, since Y is positive 3, we move the point a distance of 3 units in the positive Y direction. Now let’s plot the coordinates (-3, -3). In this case, X and Y are both negative, so starting with a point at  (0, 0) we move it 3 units in the negative X direction, and then 3 units in the negative Y direction. And last, let’s plot the coordinates (4, -2.5). Starting at (0, 0) we move the point 4 units in the positive X direction and then 2 and 1/2 units in the negative Y direction. Okay, so we’ve plotted four ordered pairs the easy way, and did you notice that each of these points is located in a different region of the coordinate place. These four regions are called “Quadrants” and their boundaries are defined by the two axes of the coordinate plane. The quadrants are named 1 through 4 so we can easily refer to them in conversations if we need to. Quadrant 1 is the upper right quadrant, and it contains all of the points where both the X and Y values are positive. Quadrant 2 is the upper left, and it contains all of the points that have a negative X value and a positive "
,,"Y value. Quadrant 3 is the lower left, and it contains all of the points that have both a negative X and a negative Y value. And Quadrant 4 is the lower right, and it contains all of the points that have a positive X value and a negative Y value. Roman Numerals are usually used to label the four quadrants and they’re in that order because that’s the order you would encounter the quadrants if you started with a line segment from the origin to the coordinate (1,0) and then rotated that line counter-clockwise around the origin. Doing this sweeps out a shape called a “unit circle” which is divided into four quadrants just like the coordinate plane. Alright, so now you know what the coordinate plane is, and you know how to plot points on it. But you might be wondering, “What has this got to do with basic Algebra?” Well, Algebra involves many different types of equations and functions that are a lot easier to understand if we graph their solutions on the coordinate plane. And as you know, the way to really get good at math is to practice what you’ve learned by doing some exercise problems. Thanks for watching Math Antics, and I’ll see ya next "

angles,i_CijGuk7fw,hello welcome to the physics 1 course unit 1 this lesson I'm gonna title it introduction to physics so what I want to do in this lesson really is spend the next 15 20 25 minutes however long it takes to give you number 1 a motivation for why you even should care about learning physics I mean some of you may have to learn it but 
,,why should you care to learn it but secondly and what we're mostly gonna be doing here is giving an overview a broad overview of almost every topic in physics which 
,,seems to be an insurmountable task but we're gonna take kind of a tour of the main concepts and the main ideas in physics to give you kind of a roadmap of what we're gonna learn in this entire class alright so at the end of this lesson you should know not only why you should care but you should also understand some basic ideas about what is physics what do we care about and why do we learn it and what main topics are inside of the the class that we call physics so the first thing is physics is all around you it's one of the sciences the sciences that you can walk outside get bathed in sunlight drive down the road in a car whatever and you are experiencing physics and almost everything you do things like light hitting you on the skin heat radiation from the Sun electricity magnetism radio waves motion the work that that is done by the car from the gasoline and the engine pushing the car all of that stuff is physics so one of the main reasons why you really should care about learning it is because literally everything you do every second of the day is impacted by physics but I personally want to convey to you the big picture of why you should learn physics and why why maybe you should take an interest in it and that is because for hundreds of years really thousands of years humans have been trying to 
,,understand the world we live in we don't have all the answers even even in this physics class we don't have all the answers but we have amassed a great deal of knowledge about how things work so I want you to kind of think about two or three hundred years ago when there was really no electricity and you're in your lab or in your house and your was candles burning and you were just struggling as some person and through 200 years ago did you understand what magnetism was or to understand what a chemical reaction was that's more in the realm of chemistry but you know chemistry and physics are like peanut butter and jelly or if you were trying to understand what heat really was and how what work really was and what energy really was and you spent your whole life trying to understand those things and scribbling down equations and going down one dead-end and coming back to try to try a new path right so you would for lack of a better word you would do almost anything back then to understand what you now have the opportunity to understand because of all of those people that came before you and devoted their lives to try to figure this stuff out one example would be Isaac Newton I know you've heard of Isaac Newton we're gonna talk about Isaac Newton for a long time in this class well you know that he has is his famous laws of motion what you may or may not know is is Newton is the guy that invented something we call calculus today which is an advanced branch of math right so this is a person that was trying to solve a problem and instead of just giving up because he didn't know how to solve the problem he invented the entire concept of calculus the thing that everybody learns takes many years to learn he invented that himself for the purpose of solving a problem he was working on right but even Newton as smart as the man was as brilliant as the man was would probably do almost anything in his day to have the knowledge that you have today because of everything that Newton did and everybody that came after him contributing to this knowledge he probably would just dream that you could watch a video or take a class or solve some problems and learn all of this stuff in all of these topics that I talked about magnetism heat you know and then the more modern things like relativity and quantum mechanics so what are my expectations in this class what do we want to get out of it I want you to be able to solve problems I'm definitely going to lecture and I'm going to tell you the concepts concepts are probably the most important thing but equally important with that or maybe even more important than that in my opinion is to be able to solve a problem like you can understand the concept behind something but if you can't get your pencil out and you can't solve a problem then 
,,you really don't understand anything really in my opinion so this this whole class is going to be problem-based we're going to lecture we're gonna get concepts on ideas but we're gonna put pencil to paper and we're going to solve problems so my advice to you is to keep in the back of your mind everyone these concepts are easy to understand I can explain every concept in physics to probably a third grader as a basic overview but solving problems tends to give students a lot of prop a lot of 
,,problems because their math skills might be okay their concepts they might understand the concept but putting the two together reading a word problem figuring out what is important in the problem writing down whatever equation you're trying to use and applying it correctly and is is very hard and the reason it's hard is because 
,,it takes practice just like you know running a marathon takes practice or learning how to you know play basketball or football takes practice solving physics problems really just takes a lot of practice but once you do it you will definitely get better at it so my advice is as we solve our problems here please watch me solve it 
,,make sure you understand it but then pause the lesson and get your own paper out and solve it yourself even if you've just seen me solve it just a minute ago you going through the motions of solving the problems is definitely gonna help you and the final thing I want to get to before we get into the overview of physics is that anybody can learn this stuff anybody okay the only thing required is the willingness to learn and some basic math skills and when I say basic I mean you're gonna have to know some basic algebra which I will review along the way for the most part but you'll need to know some basic algebra some basic trigonometry we'll talk about angles and triangles I'll try to review as much as I can but you really should have some basic skills in those areas and ultimately you need to be able to put in the 
,,effort to solve problems yourself even after you've seen me solve them the final thing I want to talk about before we get into the overview is that we don't have all the answers we're gonna present all of this stuff as if humanity has figured everything out but I want you to know that we haven't figured it all out I'm telling you right now people are doing research in advanced physics trying to figure out what masses you know this marker has some mass right we say it has mass you all have an idea about what masses but people are doing research today trying to figure out what really is mass right why is it harder to push something that has a lot of mass why does that happen how does the universe know to kind of resist your pushing whenever it's a big heavy ball or a boulder and I can push something that has less massaman we take those things for granted but the physical mechanisms that underlie all of the stuff in reality is not trivial it's not something we all know the answers to so as you learn on this stuff learn it but keep in mind that as you kind of get older and you study more there's always going to be more stuff to learn and more stuff to contribute all right physics in general can be broken up I'm going to break it up into three main things there there's physics typically you take physics 
,,one and then there's physics - and that's physics three right so what do we cover in physics one I'm gonna expand on this stuff you know over the next several minutes but in sensually physics one or all of the concepts associated with motion motion force and energy now everybody watching this has some idea of what motion is things that move right and what a force is when you push on something right and energy might have an idea of energy but that's usually a little bit sketchy or people aren't quite sure what energy is but we know it has something to do with motion or with doing something that kind of thing and that's typically true but the idea here is we're gonna drill down into these areas and we are going to a hundred and ten percent go into every one of these topics and define them to understand what we mean 
,,in physics by force motion and energy so that when we solve our problems we know what we're doing with each of our equations with each concept now typically after you finish all of this up which is quite a bit of material we're gonna get into more detail about that second you talk about physics - and these are arbitrary definitions but typically in physics - you learn about a big word that scares a lot of people it's called thermo what do you think thermo means it's like a thermos it means 
,,heat right or temperature thermo dynamics woops I can't spell dynamics dynamics right thermodynamics and waves so when the broadest sense physics - is going to be about dynamics means changing thermo means heat or temperature so it's all about things that are changing temperature changing heat and also what kind of work can we get out of that so you think about a car engine you combust gasoline in the piston right or in the piston chamber that explosion releases heat and it pushes that piston so the concept of heat which is coming from that explosion right and the concept of the piston moving which is doing work which is doing work able to push the car those are interrelated things so thermodynamics is all about heat energy how do we transfer that into work that we can do in the environment how can we build a machine that somehow uses heat energy and get it to do some work and there's a lot of details there that we'll get to that's what it basically is and we talk about waves you know we have waterways we have sound waves we have energy that we can transmit via a wave you know if I get a jump rope and I kind of oscillate it I can send energy down the rope to impact a wall or whatever it's tied to so we're gonna talk quite a bit about waves and then we break up the class into physics three physics threes actually my favorite part physics but I like them all but physics three is my favorite part and that is electricity and magnetism so electricity and magnetism there's some other topics in here now when I say electricity we are gonna learn a little bit about electric circuits you know batteries circuits voltages you know current electric current things like that we're gonna talk about that but really the the main part of electricity and magnetism we're gonna learn about magnets we're gonna learn about the magnetic field that surrounds a magnet we're gonna learn about the electric field that surrounds an electric charge like an electron or a proton 
,,or some other charge particle so we have this thing called electricity electric fields and magnetic fields and they're kind of like peanut butter and jelly they're not exactly the same thing but they're definitely related and the equations that govern both are very similar to one another so really in modern physics we've unified electricity and magnetism into one thing called electromagnetism and it turns out if you take an electric field on a magnetic field and you oscillate them so that they're kind of a combined oscillation what you end up getting is an electromagnetic wave so it's a wave that travels that has an electric component and a magnetic component and it travels and guess what that is that's light so I have lights here they're hitting me they're bouncing off of me they're going into the camera those are all electric magnetic fields that are oscillating hitting me and bouncing off so we're gonna talk about the wave aspect of light after we talk about electric fields and magnetic fields right and then this is kind of you could call it physics for but I'm gonna call it modern physics which is something you typically see also modern physics and this is actually one of my favorite parts also because I just find it mind-blowing the first part of this typically is relativity I'm sure you've probably heard about this and I know that you also probably heard about something called quantum mechanics what is all this about relativity deals with the fact that's 
,,just mind-blowing but the fact that clocks you know things that we think are constant tick tick tick tick of a clock time is not constant for all people when they're moving near the speed of light so if I if I have one clock stationary and one clock stationary next to it they're ticking and synchrony right and then I take one of those other clocks and i zoom him off near the speed of light when that clock is traveling near the speed of light time doesn't flow the same for that clock or that person in the spaceship it flows differently though in other words the reason it's called relativity is because things happen differently to different people or different experiments depending on how you're moving how fast you're moving now we don't notice clock's ticking differently because we're not traveling anywhere near the speed of light we're traveling at a snail's pace but that's the way the universe works everything's relative including the ticking of clocks and then we have the idea of quantum mechanics which we're going to get into a whole lot of detail later but quantum mechanics is all about the fact that I told you electromagnetism was a wave right but we also have figured out in the 20th century that it it does behave like a wave light does behave like a wave but it also kind of behaves like a particle like a like an object instead of it has characteristics of wave but it also has characteristics of being a little particle so is it a particle or is it a wave it turns out it's both we don't have a word for it but real photons real electrons real protons real tiny particles of anything have wave-like characteristics and they also have particle like characteristics so it kind of messes with your mind because it doesn't make sense but it is the way the world works because we have over a 
,,hundred years of experiments showing that both of these things relativity and quantum mechanics are both as far as we can tell absolutely true now what we want to do is jump a little bit more detail we're gonna get in the entire course into so much detail solving tons of problems but I want to give you a road map to show you a little bit more about these topics and we're gonna get in and get a nice overview of that so when we talk about motion first thing we're gonna actually talk about in 
,,physics are the equations the equations of motion and to simplify it further we're gonna actually talk about motion only along one direction one dimension we call it so we're not going up and down we're only going left and right because it makes things simpler first so you'll see 1d motion you'll see have 2d motion when you have like a like a throwing the ball up in the air and also horizontally and then of course we have 3d motion which is the real world you know when things can move left 
,,right up down backwards and forwards but really the equations are all very similar so we start out by talking about what happens in one direction only one that the object can only move basically backwards or forwards and I'll tell you this thing called equations of motion scares a lot of people but you already know a simple equation of motion and that is what what do you know about velocity I know we haven't really talked about velocity in this class we're gonna talk a whole lot about velocity but you already know that in a car when you're driving it's it's miles per hour right or kilometers per hour right so the velocity that you're traveling is the distance over the time how far did you go how long did it take you divide those numbers you get something call a velocity now if you remember a little bit of algebra 
,,this is a fraction so I can actually get rid of the time on the bottom by multiplying left and right hand side of the equation by time so on the left hand side I can get velocity multiplied by time and on the right hand side that will be just distance which is left over now if you don't totally understand how I got there this is just a little bit of algebra I multiply the right-hand side by time which cancels time to time leaving distance I multiply the left-hand side by the same thing time so I have velocity times time this equation makes sense also because when you think about it if I know that I'm traveling down the road at 45 whoops 45 miles per hour we don't typically use miles in physics we're gonna learn about meters and all that but if we're going a speed or a velocity of 45 miles an hour and I'm traveling down the road for two hours how far did I go think about it I'm going 45 miles every hour and I'm multiplying by the two hours because you know every hour I go another 45 miles so that should be clear that this is 90 miles that I've traveled this thing here distance is equal to velocity times time that's just a very simple equation of motion so don't let these words confuse you or scare you equations of motion and sounds really difficult but you already have experience with basic equations of motion you know that the distance you go is going to be how fast you go in times how long you're traveling at that speed how's the time involved so what we're gonna do is we go on is we'll just have more complicated cases we're gonna figure out well what's gonna happen when I have gravity involved from dropping something what's gonna happen if I throw something what's gonna happen if I have friction right then the equations of motion are a little more complicated but it's the basic same idea so for instance in 2d motion in 2d motion I might actually throw something like a baseball or something I might throw something up here at like 39 meters per second so I'm using the same thing it's a velocity but it's meters instead of miles meters per second so you all know that if I take a ball and I throw it at an angle right so let's say I'm throwing it at some angle here I'm gonna call that angle theta that's just a variable that's talking about the angle or I can just take out the variable itself and just say well I'm tossing it 25 degrees from the ground right what's this thing gonna do I mean you all know that if I do that it's gonna continue up it's gonna hit some maximum and then it's gonna come down and it's gonna hit the ground again so the question is if I throw a ball at 39 meters per second at a certain angle what do I want to know typically I want to know how high did it go that's what I want to know how high did it go and I want to know generally how far did it go and I'm not gonna write it on the board but I also probably want to know how long was it in the air so that's called projectile motion or 2d motion and it's just gonna be basically an equation of equations of motion applied to that situation right now what we're gonna actually do to solve these kinds of problems is we're going to take this 39 meters per second I'm gonna blow it up for you down here if I throw something at an angle of 39 meters per second right and I'm throwing it at some angle relative to the ground 25 degrees let's say right here it actually is kind of complicated to deal with 39 meters per second at an angle right at all 
,,at once so what we typically do is we actually break a 39 meters per second at that angle we break it up into two parts we break it up into how fast is it going horizontally right the horizontal part of the motion and how fast is it going up and down the up and down the vertical part of the motion so I might have as a result of 
,,this I might have a vertical part see it kind of comes over to where the tips of the tip of the arrow is so this is going to be a vertical part of that motion and this is going to be a horizontal part of the motion so what I'll do is I'll apply the equations of motion which we'll learn later to the up and down motion by itself and then to the horizontal motion by itself because anytime you throw anything if you throw it steep if you throw it shallow you can always break the motion into horizontal motion and vertical motion so it's easier to solve these problems by solving the horizontal parts separate from the vertical part so we're gonna learn about that in this concept here splitting it up like that that's called a vector and we're going to learn about vectors in great detail because they're gonna be one of the 
,,big tools that we use in our tool bag to solve problems now the next thing we learn in physics typically is the concept of energy and I know that most everybody here has an idea of energy but we're going to talk just to just a brief minute about energy so the best way I can describe energy is or at least one type of energy is a 
,,rollercoaster so here's a rollercoaster a very high hill and then comes down to the bottom and then a little bit like this and then maybe it just kind of does something like this so there's a Kharak cling cling cling cling cling gets to the top very very very high right at the very top of this very high mountain right we say that it has a high potential energy high potential energy I don't have room to write out potential energy but the reason it has potential energy at the top is because we're in a gravity field so if you bake something very high off the ground if you were to drop it it has a high potential to to accelerate down to the ground and to hit the ground right so to do to do something they hit the ground they have to do some impart some energy into the ground so we say has a high potential energy here so what happens is the roller-coaster goes to the very bottom and all of that potential energy you have because you're accelerating when you get to the very bottom here when the roller-coaster starts to round the bottom down there we say that we have a high kinetic energy so we're going to learn a lot about potential energy and kinetic energy kinetic energy is how fast you're moving it's the energy of motion so you know when you get to the bottom of the hit of the of the trough here in the roller coaster going fastest up here you're going slow so you have very low potential energy here I mean it's our high potential energy here and it's all converted into kinetic energy and then here over at this part what do you have when you have medium potential energy because you are a little higher off the ground but not as high as here and you have medium kinetic energy because you're not going quite as fast as you were down here you bleed off some of the speed so one of the big big big 
,,big big big big things we're gonna do in physics is we're gonna talk about the total energy of a system and the total energy of a system of that moves like this any 
,,way you the potential energy plus the kinetic energy and the total energy of the system actually doesn't change because whatever I start the system out up here at the top is how much energy I have it's just all in potential energy form so at the very top of the hill I have a very high potential energy that's what the up arrow means and I have a very low kinetic energy up at the top here but then when I get to the bottom here I have a very low potential energy because I'm basically a ground 
,,level and I have a very high kinetic energy because I'm going really fast so you see what's happening every time the potential energy gets high my kinetic energy must get low and every time the potential energy gets low the kinetic energy must be high so it's like a trade-off I'm basically it's like two cups of water I'm pouring the water in here now the energy is over in the potential energy cup then I pour some of the water back in over here now the energy is all in this cup and if I pour half in half I have half of my energy in the potential energy Cup and then the kinetic energy cut that's basically here so the trade-off between potential and kinetic energy can be used to solve tons of problems and we're gonna spend many many hours solving lots of problems involving potential energy and kinetic energy okay it's one of the big central core topics of physics then we're going to talk about the concept that I know you've heard about Newton's laws whoops let me go to spell Newton correct Newton's laws Newton's laws of motion so what Newton's law says basically is well there's a few laws of motion we'll talk about all of them but the big fame the one that we're gonna use to solve tons of problems is F is equal to Ma so this is the force on something is equal to the mass times the acceleration what this thing says in layman's terms is that if I push something with a force like if I push something then it every has mass obviously because it's made of matter if I push something then it must accelerate that's all it says it's common sense you know this stuff I mean physics seems really difficult but you know this you know that if you push something it's going to accelerate if I have a bowling ball and I'm forcing it I'm using my hand to him part of force then it's going to leave my hand in 
,,motion and as I push it from rest it's going to have to accelerate which means it's gonna speed up from some non moving velocity up to some speed right so this F equals MA I'm going to be used to solve a great-great-great too many problems and then after we talk about Newton's laws for a while and solve tons of different types of problems we're going to talk about Newton's law of gravitation which is a really big deal obviously because we live on earth and there's gravity here what does this mean though if we have a planet we're gonna call it earth and we have a moon here we call M so the earth has some mass we call it m1 and the moon has some mass and we call it m2 what Newton figured out is there's a force that exists between any two pieces of matter it exists between you and your pencil it exists between a lamp and television it exists between the Earth and the moon any two pieces of matter pull on each other with some force of gravity and that force if the distance between these two things we call our that force of gravity is equal to some constant number G which we'll talk about it's called the gravitational constant time mats one times mass 2 through multiplying all the masses together times G this number and on the bottom it's the distance between them but squared so you might hear this called the inverse square law or something like this so if the Earth's mass gets bigger m1 then the force is bigger if the moon's mass gets bigger the force is bigger but if we increase the distance between them like if we stretch out the earth and moon even bigger than since it's in the bottom we're dividing by a bigger number so the force actually goes down as we make things get farther and farther apart so this is called the universal law of gravitation now we all actually know now that Einstein 100 couple hundred years later released and invented his theory of gravitation and his theory of gravitation is actually more correct than this one but still this is a really good starting point to understand gravity and we're gonna solve lots of problems using Newton form of gravity because it's a whole lot simpler than Einstein's theory of gravity which is beyond the scope of this class but just keep in mind that you know this was accepted fact for 250 years or so and now we know that it's not quite right in some cysts in some instances and in the early 1900's Einstein published a theory which totally reinvented how we look at gravity completely 
,,but you might ask yourself if if I push on something it's gonna accelerate then if there's a force between the Earth and the moon here shouldn't the moon come crashing in to the earth shouldn't it come crashing into the earth well of course it should absolutely and that's the famous thing you know Einstein Newton sitting sitting under the tree and watching the Apple fall and having it who knows if it's true or not that's the story right he realized that the earth is pulling on the Apple and the Apple falls down he realized maybe the earth is pulling on the moon with the same force well then why is the moon not crashing down like the Apple that's the real question but he thought well maybe it's possible that gravity is extending all the way to the moon and pulling on that and the answer to the question is it is pulling on the moon and if the moon were not moving it would crash into the earth however the moon is actually moving it's moving sideways with some very high velocity 
,,V so it's going around and around and around it is being pulled in but it's going so fast in that horizontal direction for lack of a better word tint that it's called the tangental direction then it never really hits the ground and you think how is that possible well I have a little prop here it's not a great prop but it's a little prop so this is like this is like the moon here on the end of my little wire well if I take this guy and start spinning it around what happens here well you see 
,,it's going round and round and round around just like the moon is but what am I doing with my hand in the center look carefully I am actually pulling on this thing so what I do is when you start it off you have to give you have to start swinging it right like I'm swinging and then I get it to go around once and then I go it go twice and then I then once it's going horizontal like this I'm pulling on it I'm pulling it straight into my hand but it never hits my hand because I've given it a very fast speed horizontally like this and that's basically the exact same thing happening with the moon if the moon weren't moving at all if it just stopped then it would accelerate straight down and hit the earth but only because it's moving so fast horizontally can we escape that okay now we talked about gravitation right Newton's law of gravity and then after we talk about gravity we talk about collisions collisions and physics and what do I mean about it could by collision I'm saying what happens when you smash two things into each other like let's say I have some mass M sub one and I have another mass over here M sub two I don't know what the masses are but this could be five and this could be 25 or something could be different right and then this thing is going this direction at some velocity v1 it could be like 100 meters per second or something and this guy's going in the opposite direction v2 and it's a different velocity so different masses and different velocities they smash into each other well what's gonna happen when they bounce off what is the velocity of this guy gonna be when it bounces off what's the velocity of the other one gonna be and which direction are they gonna go and what if I don't smash them head-on what if I smash them at an angle so that they fly off at an angle you know like billiards or a pool table so all of this stuff has to do with collisions which involves the concept of momentum so we're gonna learn how to calculate the momentum of this ball and the momentum of this mall and we're gonna use a law of momentum to figure out what's going to happen after the collision so that's basically wrapping up what we generally talk about in what we call physics one now I told you physics two was what we call thermodynamics and waves thermodynamics and waves and 
,,so what we're gonna do is talk about that briefly next
,,
angles,fd-E18EqSVk,"Hi and welcome to Math Antics. In this video, we’re going to learn about an important math concept called rounding. To help you understand what rounding is, let’s think about how numbers are usually used. Most of the time, numbers are used to represent amounts of things, like how many miles it is to the super market, or how many days until your birthday, or how many students went to your high school. How many students went to my high school?  Oh, about 2,000. Okay…. Um…  But it wasn’t exactly 2,000 was it? Well, no… it was more like 1,900. Ah, but it probably wasn’t exactly 1,900 either, was it. Well noooo… it was more like…. 1,860 Alright, fine!  …1,863! See what I did there?  At first, the number used to represent the students at high school was a ‘round’ number. It was a good estimate of how many students there were, but it wasn’t exact. The next two numbers were a little closer to the truth, but they were still estimates. Only the final number represented the exact amount of students at the school. All three of the estimate are ‘rounded versions’ of the exact count, but they have different levels of precision. 1,860 was the most precise estimate, and 2,000 was the least precise estimate. So rounding a number basically means making a less precise version of it. And as you can see, there’s usually multiple ways to round a number depending on the level of precision that you need. A really good way to understand what’s going on when you round a number is to look at a number line. Here’s 1,863.  If we want to round it to the nearest 10, we need to decide if it goes up to 1,870 or down to 1,860. But if we want to round it to the nearest 100, we need to decide if it goes up to 1,900 or down to 1,800. And if we want to round it to the nearest 1,000, we need to decide if it goes up to 2,000 or down to 1,000. And in each case, the decision was based on which round number was closer to the original exact number. But you might be wondering, “Why would we ever want to make a number less precise in the first place? What is rounding good for?” Well, rounding numbers can often make them a lot easier to do calculations with. Like, it would be a lot easier to quickly add 300 and 500 than it would be to add 312 and 498. Or, sometimes you just don’t need very much precision. Like, you "
,,"might not need to know that your dog weighs 55.83297 kilograms. 55.8 kg might be precise enough! And some numbers, like repeating decimals or irrational numbers HAVE to be rounded off, because we can’t just keep on writing decimal digits forever! Okay, now that you know what rounding is and why we do it, for the rest of this video, we’re going to focus on learning the procedure we follow to round off a number. Do you remember how our number system is based on digits and number places? Each "
,,"digit of a number occupies a particular number place. And each number place is named according to the amount it represents (or counts). And it’s important to know those names whenever you’re rounding a number, because you’ll usually be asked to round to a specific number place. For example, you may be asked to round a number the nearest 10 or the nearest 100. Or, you might be asked to round a number off to the nearest tenth or hundredth. You may even be asked to round  to the nearest “whole number”, which is another way of asking you to round to the ones place. Okay, so when you’re asked to round a number, the first step is to pay very close attention "
,,"to which number place you need to round to. That number place is important because it represents the smallest unit of counting that you’re going to keep in your rounded version of the number. In fact, that number place (and the digit inside of it) is so important that I’m going to give it a special name just for this video. Let’s call it the ‘target’. As I mentioned, rounding a number means making a new (less precise) version of it. In that new number, any digits that are in number places smaller than the ‘target’ will automatically get replaced with zeros. And in most cases, any digits that are in number places larger than the ‘target’ will automatically be kept the same in the new rounded version. There are some exceptions as we’ll see later in this video. So that seems pretty simple. All the bigger digits you keep and the smaller digits you zero. But what about that ‘target’ digit itself? What do we do with that? Well, we’re going to do one of two things: We are either going to keep that digit the same, OR we are going to increase it by one. If we keep that ‘target’ digit the same, that’s called “rounding down”, which might seem strange at first. I mean, how can leaving the digit the same be rounding “down”? But remember, we’re going to automatically replace all of the smaller places with zero. And doing that makes the rounded number smaller, even if the ‘target’ digit stays the same. On the other hand, increasing the ‘target’ digit by one is called “rounding up”, since the new rounded number will be larger than the original number. Alright… but how do we decide which to do?  How do we know if we keep the ‘target’ digit the same or increase it by one? The key is to look at the digit in the next smaller number place; the digit that’s just to the right of the ‘target’ digit. If that "
,,"digit is less than ‘5’ (in other words, if it’s a 0,1,2,3,4) then we’ll leave the ‘target’ digit the same in the rounded version. But, if that digit is a ‘5’ or greater (5,6,7,8,or 9) then we will increase the ‘target’ digit by one. Okay, so now that you know the basic procedure for rounding numbers.  Lets’ try a few specific examples. Here’s the first one: Round 24,623 to the nearest hundred. Since we need to round to the nearest hundred, we first need to identify the digit in the hundreds place. That digit is a ‘6’, so that’s our ‘target’. And we know that any digits to the right of the ‘target’ will be replaced with zeros in our rounded version. Next let’s decide what to do with the ‘target’ digit.  We either keep it the same OR we increase it by one. To decide, we look at the value of the next digit to the right. Since that digit is only a '2' (which is less than 5), we “round down” which means that we’ll keep the ‘target’ digit the same in the rounded number. Last, we just keep all the digits in bigger number places the same in the rounded version. There… we’ve rounded the original number to the nearest hundred and the answer is 24,600. Let’s try another problem. This one has some decimal digits: 32.725 and we’re asked to round it to the nearest whole number. That means our ‘target’ digit is in the ones place… we need to round it to the nearest one. So any digits to the right of the ones place will just be replaced with zeros in the rounded version. Now, to decide what to do with the ‘target’ digit, we look at the next digit to the right. Since that digit is a ‘7’ we’ll “round up” this time.  That means we’ll increase our ‘target’ digit by one. And finally, we keep any digits to the left of the ‘target’ digit the same. In this case, that’s just the ‘3’.  So, we’ve rounded this number off to 33.000. or just 33 since we don’t really need those extra zeros after the decimal point. …ready for one more?  Let’s round 65.7991 to the nearest hundredth. The first step is to identify the hundredths place as our ‘target’. That place contains the digit '9'. All the digits in smaller number places will just be replaced with zero in the rounded version. Next, we need to decide if we will leave the ‘target’ digit the same or increase it by one, so we look at the digit to the right of the ‘target’. It’s a ‘9’ also, so we’ll definitely be “rounding up”. But since the ‘target’ digit is already a ‘9’, raising it by ‘1’ is a little more complicated. When you add ‘1’ to a digit that is already ‘9’, you need change it to ‘0’ and increase the digit in the NEXT bigger number place by one. So that means that our "
,,"‘target’ digit will become zero and we need to increase the digit in the next bigger number place. That digit is a ‘7’ so we’ll increase it to an ‘8’. The rest of the digits in the original number will be kept the same in the rounded version. So our rounded version will be 65.80. As you can see, in some cases, rounding can actually change the digits to the left of the ‘target’ digit also. It’s sort of a ‘domino effect’ that can happen when rounding numbers. If you have a lot of ‘9’s, rounding can bump them all up like a chain reaction. Like, what if you need to round 1,999,999 to the nearest 10? The ‘9’ in the ones place tells us that we need to round "
,,"our ‘target’ digit up by one, but it’s already a ‘9’ so we need to zero it and increase the next number place, but that’s already a ‘9’ so we need to zero it and increase the NEXT number place, but that’s already a ‘9’, and that pattern continues until we end up with 2,000,000 as our final rounded number. So sometimes rounding a number is pretty simple, and other times it’s a little more involved. The key is to remember the rule that if the digit to the right of the ‘target’ is less than 5, we leave the ‘target’ digit the same, but if it’s 5 or more, we increase the ‘target’ digit by one, even if that causes a ‘chain reaction’ with the bigger number places. Alright, so now you know a lot about rounding numbers.  You know why we round numbers and you’ve seen the basic procedure in action. But just watching a video "
,,"about rounding isn’t enough to get really good at it. The only way to do that is to practice, so be sure to try rounding some numbers on your own. In fact, rounding "
,,"is such an important math skill that you should probably practice it a lot until you’ve really got it mastered. As always, thanks for watching Math Antics and I’ll see ya next time. Learn more at www.mathantics.com"

angles,nT6nSlZ0FIQ,hi friends if you stand in front of a plain mirror do you know exactly where your image will be formed that's right it's going to be behind the mirror the distance between the image in the mirror will be exactly same as the distance between you and the mirror we also know the properties of the image it's going to be virtual and 
,,upright and the image will be the same height as you but now if I replace the plane mirror with a concave mirror can we predict where the image will be formed it's not so easy now or if I replace it with a convex mirror where will the image be formed what will its properties be in this video I am going to make the topic of image formation for spherical mirrors that is the concave and convex mirrors really easy for you and as usual we'll finish off with our top three questions on this topic 
,,before we look at spherical mirrors let's do a quick recap on how to draw the ray diagram for a plane mirror as we discussed we know all the properties of the image 
,,formed by a plane mirror image height equals object height and image distance equals the object distance so we can cheat here we first draw the image and then we draw the light rays and produce them backwards to match the image we take two rays from each point on the object because you need a minimum of two rays to obtain a point on the image so for a plane mirror the image is drawn first and then the light rays but we can't do this for a concave or a convex mirror because we are not sure of the properties of the image we must use the light rays and the light ray rules for obtaining an image for spherical mirrors let's start with the concave mirror the concave mirror is a converging mirror for image formation we need to draw the concave mirror accurately let me show you a simple trick for that draw a line representing the principal axis using a ruler mark three points where C is at zero centimeter F is at 3 centimeter and P is at 6 centimeter you can take any convenient distance F should be exactly in the middle such that CF equal to FB C is the center of curvature f is the focus and P is the pole of the mirror now use your compass to draw an arc for the concave mirror the compass point should be placed at C the center of curvature and the radius of the arc will be C P which is equal to 6 centimeters in this case mark the backside of the mirror with these dashes now let's talk about the rules for image formation of a concave mirror light is a very visual topic 
,,so I suggest you to keep pausing the video and drawing the ray diagrams for these rules in your notebook then you'll get a better feel of what is going on there are 
,,four rules for a concave mirror so let's take a look at them rule 1 a ray of light which is parallel to the principal axis after reflection passes through the focus 
,,rule 2 a ray of light passing through the center of curvature is reflected back along the same path do you know why that's right the ray of light falls normally perpendicular to the mirror that's why it's reflected back along the same path rule 3 a ray of light passing through the focus after reflection becomes parallel to the principal axis can you see that rule 3 is exactly opposite of rule 1 it's due to reversibility of light rule 4 ray of light which is incident at the pole of a concave mirror is reflected back making the same angle with the principal axis it looks like a plain mirror type of diagram since the principal axis is like the normal here and the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection let's place the four rules that we have learned for concave mirrors on our concept board remember when drawing an image you need to raise from a point on the object so for concave mirrors you need to select two rules that are convenient for the diagram now an important note here is avoid using the fourth rule unless really necessary because it's hard to measure angles accurately with your protractor so it can lead to inaccuracies in the diagram so basically you need to use two out of the first three rules for concave mirrors now I'm going to be the object and I'll go and stand in front of 
,,the concave mirror and you need to find my image so are you ready let's try it out Here I am on the principal axis I'm far away from the concave mirror I'm going to 
,,walk towards the mirror and stand on different places on the principal axis and you'll see that the image will change based on my location so let's start with case one and beyond see the center of curvature you need to consider the Rays from the top of the object so from my head and remember we need to take two out of the first 
,,three rules so let's use rule one for the ray that is parallel to the principal axis after reflection it passes through the focus and for the secondary we can use rule 2 so the Ray passing through the center of curvature gets reflected back al on the same path now what does the intersection of these two reflected rays represent 
,,that's right it's the image and it's the image of my head because we started with the race from the top of the object now where is the feet in my image you don't need to draw the Rays for that the feet lie on the principle axis so we can simply extend the image to the principal axis and find the bottom of the image so as you can see here using the ray diagram we have found the position of my image what are the properties of the image there are three points here is the image real and inverted or is it virtual and upright is the image magnified diminished or is it the same size as the object and what is the position of the image so let's see what are the properties of the image for case one as you can see here the image is real and inverted it's real because it's formed by the real intersection of light rays and it's upside-down so it's an inverted image as you can see the images diminished because it's smaller than the size of the object and the position of the images it's located between the center of curvature and the focus you will find similar diagrams in your textbook of course I won't be the object there usually we use an up arrow to represent the object and its marked as a B and the image is also going to be an arrow and not as a - B - here the arrow of the image is inverted since it's an inverted image now let me walk closer to the mirror I am going to stand at C the center of curvature for our case - once again let's draw the race from the top of the object we need to use two rules from the first three rules so for our first ray let's use rule 1 the ray that is parallel to the principal axis after reflection passes through the focus now I can't use rule 2 since I am standing on the center of curvature so let's go ahead and use rule 3 the Ray that is passing through the focus after reflection is parallel to the principal axis so this is our second ray here where is my image as you can see here it's exactly below me what is the nature or properties of the image it's real and it's inverted it's the same size as the object so the same height as me and its position is at the center of curvature if you try drawing the ray diagram for this case to where the object is at the center of curvature you might find that you're not getting the image exactly at the center of curvature now this can happen if the focus F is not exactly between P and C or if the Rays are not drawn very accurately so to avoid such errors an important exam tip 
,,is to use the cheating trick just like we did in plane mirrors so you first draw the inverted image at the center of curvature and the image height is equal to the object height and then you draw the Rays so then you will get the image accurately now I am going to move closer to the mirror so this is our case 3 where the object 
,,is between the center of curvature and the focus I would like you to pause the video here and find the image yourself using a ray diagram also write down the properties of image formed so what is the nature of the image you got that's right the correct answer is it's a real and inverted image that's magnified so this is the ray 
,,diagram and as you can see the position of the image is beyond the center of curvature now I'll move ahead and I am going to stand at the focus of the concave mirror again let's use two rules out of three as you can see this is an interesting case because the reflected rays are parallel the reflected rays never meet so our image is formed really really far away at infinity the image is real and inverted and it's highly magnified now let's look at the last case where I move really close to the mirror the object that is me is between the pole and the focus here now let's use rule 1 and rule 2 to draw the light rays from the top of the object and as you can see here the reflected rays are divergent so let's produce them backwards to obtain our image Wow can you see I'm magnified here so what are the properties of the image the image is virtual and erect it's magnified and as you can see it's formed behind the mirror do you know how the concave mirror is used in this case that's 
,,right it's used as a shaving mirror since you appear magnified it's much easier to shave now that we are done with the topic of concave mirrors let's take a look at 
,,the other type of spherical mirrors the convex mirrors the convex mirror is a diverging mirror for image formation we need to draw the convex mirror accurately similar to the concave mirror draw a line representing the principal axis using a ruler mark three points where P is at zero centimeter F is at three centimeter and C is 
,,at six centimeter you can take any convenient distance as long as F is exactly in the middle between P and C so the distance CF is equal to FB pees the pole of the mirror F is the focus and sees the center of curvature of the mirror here note that in a convex mirror the F and C are on the opposite side compared to a concave mirror now use your compass to draw an arc for the convex mirror the compass point should be placed at C the center of curvature the radius of the arc will be C P equal 
,,to six centimeters in this case mark the backside of the mirror with these dashed lines now let's talk about the rules for image formation of a convex mirror just like concave mirrors there are four rules for a convex mirror rule one a ray of light which is parallel to the principal axis after reflection it appears to be coming 
,,from the focus can you see that the real rays are shown in solid lines and those behind the mirror are shown with a dashed line rule two a ray of light going towards the center of curvature of a convex mirror is reflected back along the same path Rule three a ray of light going towards the focus after reflection becomes parallel to the principal axis can you see that rule three is exactly opposite of rule one it's due to reversibility of light Rule four a ray of light which is incident at the pole of a convex mirror is reflected back making the same angle with the principal axis here the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection let's place the four rules that we have learned for convex mirrors on our concept board similar to concave mirrors avoid using the fourth rule unless really necessary because 
,,measuring angles accurately with your protractor is hard and it can lead to inaccuracies in your diagram so basically you need to select two out of the first three rules for convex mirrors once again I'm going to be the object and I'll go and stand in front of the convex mirror and you need to find my image so are you ready let's go ahead and try it out Here I am on the principal axis at a certain distance from the convex mirror again we need to take the light rays from the top of the object so my head remember we need to use two rules from the first three rules so for the first ray let's use rule 1 the light ray that is parallel to the principal axis 
,,after reflection appears to be coming from the focus and for the secondary let's use rule 2 the light ray which is going towards the center of curvature gets reflected back along the same path now where do these two reflected rays meet the reflected rays are divergent here so we need to produce them backwards and the point where they meet is the position of the image of my head since we considered the Rays from the top of the object now where are the feet in my image that's right on the principal axis so we simply need to extend the image down to the principal axis and we get the bottom of the image so you don't need to draw rays for that and as you can see from this ray diagram we have found the position of my image what are the properties of the image formed here the image is virtual and upright its virtual because it's formed by the reflected rays extended backwards the images diminished and as you can see it's formed behind the mirror now let me walk closer to the convex 
,,mirror again we are going to use two out of the three rules to obtain our image and as you can see the image formed has similar properties it's virtual and erect it's diminished and it's formed behind the mirror remember the concave mirror had so many different cases but the convex mirror is the easy one in the syllabus because 
,,it doesn't matter where you stand in front of the mirror the image properties are always going to be the same it's going to be virtual indirect diminished and the image will be formed behind the mirror have you noticed the convex mirrors used at the intersection of roads what is the nature of the image produced in the convex mirror that's right it's always virtual upright and diminished imagine if that convex mirror give an inverted image then the driver would get all confused and an accident may happen so the convex mirror always produces a virtual upright and diminished image I hope the image formation for concave and convex mirrors is super clear to you now light is a very visual chapter so I would suggest you to practice by drawing Ray diagrams and trying to predict where the image is formed then you'll feel more confident about these light ray rules and do remember to subscribe to my youtube channel follow my facebook page and do check out my website monitor academy.com

angles,mLeNaZcy-hE,"Hi! Welcome to Math Antics. In this Geometry lesson, "
,,we’re gonna learn all about triangles. You may remember from the lesson about polygons
,," that triangles are special polygons that always have 3 sides and 3 angles. And that’s what the word ‘triangle’ means. “tri"" means 3 and “angles” means... angles. Okay, that’s easy enough... 3 sides... 3 angles... but what else is there to know about triangles? Well for starters, we’re gonna"
,,"learn how to classify triangles. Oooo… such a classy triangle! [laughter] But seriously, there’s two different way"
,,to classify (or organize) triangles. They can be classified by their sides
,,and they can be classified by their angles. Let’s start by classifying triangles by their angles since we’ve already learned a lot about angles
,, in the previous videos. You may remember from our first video about angles
,," that there’s 3 types of angles: there’s right angles, acute angles, and obtuse angles. Well... watch what happens if we use a third line in each of these angles to "
,,form closed shapes. Ah ha!… triangles! And can you guess what these three different kinds of triangles are called? Yep - The one made from the right angle is called 
,,"a Right Triangle. The one made from the acute angle is called an Acute Triangle, and the one made from the obtuse angle is called an Obtuse Triangle. So that’s simple enough."
,,"But notice that for each of our three triangles, the new angles that were formed"
,,when we closed the shapes are all acute angles. So triangles always have at least 2 acute angles... and it’s the other angle that determines what type it is. That’s 
,,"important to know so you don’t get tricked. For any given triangle,"
,," just because you see one acute angle, that doesn't mean it’s an acute triangle. You have to look at ALL the angles to tell if"
,,it’s an acute triangle. The situation is easier with right and obtuse
,,"triangles because you can only have ONE right or obtuse angle per triangle. So as soon as you spot one of those kinds of angles, you know what type of triangle you have. Alright then… classifying triangles by angles"
,,is pretty simple. But we can also classify triangles by their sides. If we pay close attention
,,"to the length of each side of a triangle, we can see that there are three possibilities. First of all, if all three sides of a triangle"
,,"are exactly the same length, then we call it an Equilateral Triangle."
,,"It’s kind of  a long word, but it’s easy to remember because it sounds like it has the word “equal” in it. To see the second possibility, let’s take"
,,the top vertex of our equilateral triangle and move it up like this. See what happened?
,,"Two of the triangle’s sides got stretched by the same amount,"
,,but the bottom side remained the same. Now we have a triangle that has only 2 equal
,,"sides, and that’s called an Isosceles Triangle. That’s a long word too. The best way to"
,,"remember that is to look at an isosceles triangle and say it’s name 20 times as fast as you can! Is osceles, Isosceles, Isosceles, Isosceles,"
,,"Isosceles, Isosceles, Isosceles, Isosceles,... And finally, to see the third possibility,"
,,let’s move that same top vertex again... but this time to the left.
,,"Now, all the sides are different lengths. This type of triangle is called a Scalene Triangle. So those are the three possibilities when"
,,classifying triangles by their sides. Equilateral Triangles have 3 equal sides. Isosceles triangles have only 2 equal sides. And scalene triangles have NO equal sides. That way was pretty easy too.
,,"The hardest part is just remembering the names. And now that you know both ways to classify triangles,"
,,"let’s see how you can use them together. Yep, you can use them both at the same time. If you classify triangles both by their angles"
,,"and by their sides, it turns out that there's several possible combinations. To see what I mean, let’s list the three classifications by sides:"
,,"(scalene, isosceles, and equilateral) …and the three classifications by angle:"
,,"(right, acute and obtuse) A scalene triangle can also be a right triangle,"
,,like this one. And a scalene triangle can also be
,,"either an obtuse or an acute triangle. In the same way, an isosceles triangle can"
,,"also be acute, like this one, or obtuse, like this one. And in one special case, an isosceles"
,,"triangle can also be a right triangle, like so. But things are different when it comes to"
,,"an equilateral triangle. An equilateral triangle is always an acute triangle. Because all three sides are exactly the same,"
,,all three angles must also be exactly the same. And since we can’t have more than one right
,,"angle in a triangle, or more than one obtuse angle, ALL the angles in an equilateral triangle must be acute. Okay, now that you know all about how"
,,"triangles are classified, let’s learn one more really important thing"
,,"about triangles. In our video about angles and degrees, we"
,,learned that we can measure angles and say how big or how small they are using special
,,"units called degrees. Well, since triangles are always made up of 3 angles, each of those angles has its own"
,,measurement in degrees. And the important thing
,,"is that those three angle measurements, if you combine them, they will always"
,,"add up to 180 degrees. For example, have a look at this triangle."
,,"If we were to take a saw and cut it up into three separate angles, ...and then if we were"
,,"to take those three angles and rearrange them so that they’re right next to each other like this, you can see that the total would be the same as a straight angle... that’s 180 degrees! And this will work no matter what type of"
,,triangle it is. Knowing that a triangle’s angles will
,,always add up to 180 degrees can really help you out when solving geometry problems. There’s a whole lot of situations where
,,"you’ll know what two of the angles are, but you need to figure out what the third"
,,"angle is. Like in this problem. With this triangle, we’re told that one"
,,"of the angles is 35 degrees, and the other is 45 degrees. But the third angle is unknown. We need to figure out what it is. Since we know that the total must be 180 "
,,"degrees, we can just add up the angles that we DO know, and then subtract that from 180 degrees to"
,,see what’s left over. The leftover amount MUST be
,,"the measurement of the unknown angle. So, 35 + 45 = 80 degrees. And when we take that 80 and subtract it"
,,"from 180 we get 100 degrees left over. That means that our unknown angle is 100 degrees! And, you can always check your answer by adding"
,,up all the angles to make sure you get 180. So you can see why it’s so important to
,,"know that a triangle’s angles add up to 180 degrees! Well, that’s all we’re going"
,,"to learn about triangle is this video. Remember, the key to really learning math"
,,"is to do it. So, be sure to practice by doing the"
,,"exercises for this section. As always, thanks for watching Math Antics! and I’ll see you next time! Learn more at www.mathantic.com"

angles,9RTM418qfdI,hello friends welcome to new happy learning video look at these images do you know what we're looking at exactly they are bangles and today we are going to learn many things about them an angle is space between two intersecting lines all surfaces that emerge from the same point called vertex if you look around we are surrounded 
,,by angles like the ones this clock handles or an ice cream cone makes the unit of measure of angles is the degree and the most important angle of all is this one it's called a right angle and it measures 90 degrees the tiny zero you can see on the bright upper part of the number 90 is a symbol that represents all angles we say that the right angle is the most important one because it is the one that is used to compare all of the other angles the angles are smaller than of right angle a called acute angles and they measure less than 90 degrees like all of these and angles that are bigger than a right angle are called obtuse angles and measure more than 
,,90 degrees like all of these to neighbor degrees at an angle measures we need to use this instruments which is called app attractor so we need to place the straight 
,,part of the Picatta over one of the sides of the angle making the vertex and the central point of the Petrak to meet after this we need to look at the trap to line on the other side of the angle and look at what number it says these are the degrees that an angle measures easy peasy huh let's practice we said that a right angle is 90 degrees let's see we'll get the protractor and indeed a right angle is 90 degrees we haven't fooled you huh now let's measure this angle let's see how much it measures 45 degrees it's an acute angle because it is smaller than a right angle and now we're going to check out how much this other angle measures a hundred and twenty degrees of course it's an obtuse angle because it measures more than 90 degrees imagine that instead of being 120 it measures a hundred and eighty do you know what this angle is called we call it a straight angle hey and what about if it messes 360 degrees well that's a complete all full angle it's complete as can be the conferen

angles,J-kLTQPNnPc,hello children we know that all geometric figures are built by basic figures like points lines line segments rays and planes let us revise these basic figures and also learn about intersecting lines parallel lines and perpendicular lines lene a plane is a flat surface it extends infinitely in all directions it has no boundaries 
,,point a point indicates a position in space it has no length red or thickness B and this are all points in space we read them as point B point R and point s line a line contains an infinite number of points the arrows at the ends of a given line indicate that it has no beginning or n that is a line extends in both directions look at this line we represent it with letters and the symbol of the line about them like this we read it as line PQ or line QP look at this line two points on a line can be used to name it such as line a B line BC line AC line C B line c a.o line ba now look at this line we can also name and read the line by a single small letter 
,,for example line L line segment a line segment contains a finite number of points it is a fixed distance between two points on a line it has two endpoints here de is a line segment it is written as de or Edie now let us see how to measure a line segment the distance between two points is called the length of the segment to measure a line segment we use a ruler a ruler is marked with centimeters each centimeter is divided into ten parts each part is one millimeter now let's solve an example 
,,measure the line segment XY thus we say the length of line segment XY is equal to five point three centimeters next is REE arrey contains an infinite number of points arrey has one endpoint the other end of the Ray is extended indefinitely XY is a ray it can be read only as Ray XY as we always start from the end point do not read it as real YX it is written as shown this ray can be read as ray a be Ray AC now let us learn about intersecting lines when two lines meet at one point they are called intersecting lines here line a B and C D meet at point P hence line a B and line C D are called intersecting lines coming two parallel lines two lines that are 
,,at the same distance and do not meet are called parallel lines here line a B and line CD are parallel lines we read it as line a B is parallel to line C D we write it as shown kids look here two lines drawn on either side of a ruler are parallel lines lastly perpendicular lines two intersecting lines make a right angle at the point of intersection then they are called perpendicular lines here line a B and line C D intersect at Point P here angle a PC is equal to 90 degrees hence these two lines are perpendicular lines it is read as a B is perpendicular to CD it is written as shown look here all four angles at the point of intersection P ah right angles kids remember a point as only position and no dimension a line extends indefinitely in both directions a segment is a part of a line with two end points arrey has one endpoint two lines intersect only at one point many lines can pass through a single point perpendicular lines intersect at a point making a 90 degrees angle battlin lines never meet you

,,complementary angle this one let's start with the supplementary angle since we
,,know that this forms a straight line we know that the sum of the angles is equal
,,to 180 degrees so we can say X degrees my missing degree plus 35 degrees is

angles,2JSk0DC5q4g,"You're watching FreeSchool! Hi everyone! Today we're going to talk about angles. An angle is the amount of turn, or space,"
,,"between two lines that meet each other. When two lines meet at a point, or vertex,"
,,"an angle is formed. The two lines are called the arms of the angle. Angles are measured in degrees, which is shown"
,,"by this symbol. A complete turn, also known as a full rotation,"
,,"all the way back to the place it started, is 360 degrees. One half of a turn, which forms a straight"
,,"line, is 180 degrees. One quarter of a turn is 90 degrees. This is called a right angle. There are three other types of angles: acute,"
,,"obtuse, and reflex angles. An acute angle is one that is less than 90"
,,degrees. An obtuse angle is one that is more than 90
,,"degrees, but less than 180 degrees. A reflex angle is one that is greater than"
,,180 degrees. Some angles may be added together to get one
,,of the important angles we talked about earlier. Complementary angles are two angles that add
,,up to a 90 degree angle. Supplementary angles are two angles that add
,,up to a 180 degree angle. Two angles that add up to make a full circle
,,or 360 degree angle can be called either explementary or conjugate angles. Some other fun facts about how angles add
,,"up include that all the angles inside a triangle will always add up to 180 degrees, and all"
,,"the angles around the point where lines intersect will always add up to 360 degrees. Angles are usually measured using protractors. Protractors have markings on them, similar"
,,"to rulers, but instead of inches or centimeters it measures in degrees. If you don't have a protractor to measure"
,,"with, you can estimate how big it is as long as you remember what a 90 degree angle, 180"
,,"degree angle, and 360 degree angle look like. I hope this helped you understand all about"
,,angles today. Good-bye till next time!

angles,MTY1Kje0yLg,tivity the explanation for gravity is that matter bends space and so you put mass in a place of space at warp space-time and objects are not feeling a force of gravity they're just following the natural curvature and so this is a sheet of lycra where do you get this is my old bike shorts no there's literally a spandex calm you can get a sheet like this if you buy the sales stuff so you don't care what it looks like right for like 20 bucks maybe less depending on the sale and so you put matter and it warps space-time and so if I have another object it also warps space-time they feel that and they're attracted to each other and so that's that's Einstein's picture of gravity objects warp space-time feel that curvature and move accordingly and if you have more mass you have more mass is going to bend space-time more respond and so you put something there now it's attracted now in reality that big mass would feel the warping of space-time by the marble - right it would move a little bit but we usually usually ignore that you know the earth makes the Sun move a little bit but it's so small we can ignore it the moon makes the earth kind of wobble around two point three quarters of the way from the center of the earth we usually don't account for that when we're looking at satellite motion well instead of just letting go of one what if I give it a sideways push now it orbits now it's losing energy which wouldn't happen in the solar system right not noticeably there's some perturbations from other planets and things but this one does lose energy and spirals in if I don't push it as hard it will do the lips when you study the solar 
,,system all the planets are going around the Sun the same way why is that did God decide the only life clockwise or as I'm whether he's above or below the solar system right why is everything going in the same direction well the answer is it wasn't different directions but there was a preferred direction the distant form from had a slight preference one way versus another and things go in the opposite way got eliminated and when it's all said and done everything is going the same way that usually that works 90% of the time and so I had slightly more in one hand and another but I don't consciously do that and you want to give them something spread out a 
,,little yeah the wrong way get eliminated right now there also would have been you know this is where this analogy breaks down there's you know another dimension right but those things are out of the plane also that weren't near the preferred plane also got eliminated and so that's kind of cool now my students use a pH et Phet simulation called my solar system and so they've seen all this on the computer and when we do this during our special relativity unit they're like he is just like the 
,,computer that's kind of cool that a stretch see the Micra model sings suicide just like it learn to the computer now some things we've discovered using this I'll say it's just some larger marbles my friends with them out but they've been space time too right and so maybe you can get one thing so the earth-moon system maybe and so you see that this seemed you know you can't buy micro this big you get it in rolls and you have to sew it together I've been told to use a stretchy string the stretchy thread to sew it together and so the next time I do it I'll do that because it pulls and so you just a little bit of thread fixes it and so in the morning when 
,,I first set this up look at leaning against the table will be underneath fixing holes from last year one time my principal walked in and I hear somebody in the room 
,,and I'm underneath on the middle sewing in a little paws yet and then he's looking around for me and he kind of knows some of these in the room buddies oh there you 
,,are because what are you doing there and I go I'm repairing a rip in the fabric of space-time you've probably seen plastic ones of these right the Discovery Center Children's Discovery Museum in San Jose has won the Exploratorium has won sometimes they have MIT's shopping malls you put money in it but one thing you can't do with those is put two masses in and so when we went to the moon when we first started we set our spaceship so I'm going to call free return trajectory x' so they would go to the moon and this is hard to get down and they would come back and like a figure eight and so that lets you show now of course the moon is smaller but if you look at the plots of the free return trajectory back from the Apollo program you'll see it has a figure eight sort of shape and so this takes a little bit of practice 
,,to be able to do the figure eight these clamps around here you can adjust it to make it tighter if it's not working so Steve and I when we set this up in the morning we played around with it and actually I think it was working better than usually is it's so not easy and so I go through that's one year a kid who read some stuff about the dark energy energy have extra oh and so I'm just energy what does that makes everything come apart right and so dark energy would be that stuff goes apart rather than toward it so if you work in dark energy anytime right and so I go through that spiel maybe it takes me ten fifteen minutes talking with the kids you stuff they're not familiar with and then I just let them play and so that's where we discovered the earth-moon thing is I just let it play and they're like mr. Barth career-low and they're all excited cos they discovered that so so if you want to try it out what we do but we want to play mr. burns so I see the whole thing if you buy 
,,all the parts and everything is about a hundred dollars but one of my favorite days so you're gonna do it Monday right Steve don't do it but just do it once and you'll be hooked it will take a little bit of cooling to put it together but I'll post the plans it takes it comes apart all the PVC pipe wrap it with a bungee cord stuff the biker in that box and I can carry the whole thing myself this is about the right size you can get your whole class around it pretty much smaller what one problem is reaching some of you I think would have trouble with that so you get a student to do it right one thing you got to watch though is some students will think to 
,,go underneath to push up and then while they're underneath somebody decides to put the big mass out and you know they get their space-time warped and so just tell me can't go under and so is general relativity in the state standards no probably the the crowning achievement of science not in the state standards can you fit it in 
,,after the star test you bet you can find some videos like you know I show a thing on gravity waves and then we do this and that's you know a day almost a day but since I don't understand it myself that's plenty so let's go back into the room

angles,KO_p_MkXMJM,hangers good morning kids today let's revise what we already know about angles some basic points about angles are and anger is formed by two rays that have a common 
,,endpoint so here Q is the common endpoint of Rea QP and 3qr here the common endpoint cue is called the vertex of the angle the to raise Q P and Q R are called the arms of the angle when naming the angle the vertex is always written in the middle for example angle PQR and angle rqp denote the same angle q we measure and draw an angle with the help of a protractor we express the measurement of an angle in degrees let's revise how to measure an angle measure the angle LMN step one place the central point of the protractor on the vertex M such that the zero degrees line coincides with 3mn step two note that the protractor has two sets of readings we read from whichever side the array of the angle is pointing towards here we read the scale from the zero on the right as Ray MN points to the right step 3 read the degree 
,,measure that coincides with three ml ray ml coincides with 75 degrees step four right the measure of angle which is equal to 75 degrees now let's measure one more angle look at the figure you on measuring we get the measure of the angle P IV as 135 degrees now construct an angle construct an angle ABC of 110 degrees step one rape PC step two place the central point of the protractor on be such that the zero degrees line coincides with Ray BC mark point a at 110 degrees counting from zero degrees step 3 remove the protractor and join BA to get angle a PC now let's construct one more angle construct an angle m NP of 85 degrees you thus angle MNP of 85 degrees has been constructed wasn't it on revising angles

angles,sBb5WUw2_2I,hi friends I'm sure you've all heard that light travels in a straight line it's called the rectilinear propagation of light but are you ready to try your magic trick with me where we are going to bend light for the magic trick I just need you to get a transparent glass like this filled with water so pause the video here and go and get a glass of water are you ready with your glass of water next I'll be showing in our on the screen and you pause the video when you see the arrow and hold up your glass of water in front of the screen something like this and look at the arrow again and tell me what do you see this time did you see the magic did you see the arrow changing its direction it's happening due to bending of light this is called refraction of light and it's going to be the topic of this video and then as usual we'll finish off with our top three questions on this topic I have this torch here with me when I switch on the torch it gives out a beam of light a beam is composed of many rays of light as you can see each rays traveling in a straight line now for simplicity let's consider a single ray of light now how do I bend this ray of 
,,light I can't just grab the ray of light and bend it right so what do you think I need to do to bend the light you might be thinking of using a mirror so a mirror certainly changes the angle by reflecting back the light but what if I ask you I want the light to continue downwards and still bend it then what do we need to do so you need a transparent material like glass or plastic here let's imagine there's a large glass block kept here and I'm going to shine this torch on the glass block again we'll consider a single ray of light for simplicity can you see the ray of light bending as it enters the glass block this is known as refraction of light there 
,,is also a partial reflection when the light hits the glass surface but we'll ignore that for this video and our focus will only be on refraction of light so what have we learnt till now light travels in a straight line as long as it's traveling only in one material so as we saw here as long as it's traveling only in air it's traveling in a straight line and then if you look only at the glass part light is traveling in a straight line but when light travels from one material to another so here from air to glass it bends and this bending of light is called refraction of light so here's the fancy definition of refraction of light refraction of light is defined as the change in direction of light when it's traveling obliquely from one medium to another medium so what does this all mean let's break it down here so change in direction means bending of light obliquely means the light is incident at an angle and the word medium means material for example air glass water these are all materials you may also see the term optical material because optical refers to light and for refraction remember that the material needs to be transparent let's place the definition of refraction of light on our concept board have you seen any simple everyday examples of refraction one thing that you might have noticed or you can try yourself is take a pencil and put it in a glass of water the pencil will appear bent it's due to refraction of light another example is if you go and stand near a swimming pool it actually appears shallower than it really is and of course the magic trick that we saw at the beginning of the video so do go ahead and show it to your friends but don't tell them the secret and there are many many other examples of refraction but we look at those in detail in a separate video now that we know what is refraction let's take a look why refraction happens so what is the magic this glass block is doing to bend the light the answer is it changes the speed of light so let's say the speed of light in air is approximately 3 into 10 to the power 8 meter per second and since glass is denser than air it slows down the light 
,,when it enters the glass block and let's say the speed here is 2 into 10 to the power 8 meter per second so this change in speed of light when it's traveling from air to glass causes the light to bend and greater the change in speed greater will be the bending of light we've seen what is refraction why refraction takes place now let's take a look how light bends during refraction in this case we saw light bends this way but is it possible for light to bend the other way also let's go ahead 
,,and take a closer look let's look at some terms first this ray of light is called the incident ray do you know where is the point of incidence that's right it's here the point where the incident ray hits the second medium is called the point of incidence now let's draw an imaginary line perpendicular to this boundary between the two materials this perpendicular line is called the normal the light ray in the second medium is called the refracted ray can you see the incident light instead of 
,,going straight is bending towards the normal the angle the incident ray makes with the normal is called the angle of incidence and the angle the refracted ray makes 
,,with the normal is called the angle of refraction when light is traveling from air to glass like here how are these angles related that's right angle of incidence is greater than the angle of refraction here air is the rarer medium or to be more precise optically rarer medium and glass is the optically denser medium we use the term optical density because it's different from normal density normal density is the heaviness or lightness of a material and is measured as mass by volume but optical density measures how much a material is able to slow down light and note that a material that is denser than another one need not be more optically denser than the other material so this was our case one when light travels from a rarer to a denser medium the speed of light decreases the light bends towards the normal and as you can see angle of incidence is greater than the angle of refraction now can we make the light Bend away from the normal the answers yes we just need to switch the 
,,two materials so as you can see this is our case - when light travels from a denser to a rarer medium the speed of light increases and as you can see the light bends away from the normal and the angle of incidence is less than the angle of refraction here let's spin these two cases of refraction on our concept board there is another interesting case where the light is incident normally on the second medium as you can see the incident rays along the normal here but even though the light is traveling from air to glass can you see that there is no bending taking place so we say there is no refraction happening here but does the speed of light change when 
,,it enters the glass block the answer's yes as expected the light will slow down when it goes from air to glass but in this interesting case there is no bending of light happening here what is the angle of incidence here that's right it's zero the angle between the incident ray and the normal is zero what is the angle of refraction in this case correct it's zero the angle between the refracted ray and the normal here is zero let's place this special case of normal incidence on our concept board now that we are done with the topic of refraction are you ready for the top three questions on this topic coming up for you right now friends try solving these questions and let me know your answers and doubts by putting it in the comments below I promise to reply to all your comments as soon as possible so I'm going to bend away like light and you pause the video here and get these questions a shot as we discussed in this video refraction is the bending of light when light travels from one medium to another refraction is caused by the change in speed of light and do remember to subscribe to my YouTube channel and follow my facebook page and do check out my website manoj academy.com thanks for watching you

angles,17l2LrjZi9o,"3 Types of Rocks. My Study. About my study. On the bases of their formation, rocks are broadly divided into three types, namely igneous rocks, sedimentary rocks and "
,,"metamorphic rocks. Igneous rocks. Igneous rocks are found in volcanic regions. Volcanic region. This is an igneous rock. Yes, it is. You can find it over there. Be careful, it is very hot. Don't worry. I have super bikes and protective suits. Igneous rocks are formed from magma, which is a molten material found deep inside the earth. This molten magma comes upwards or even erupts from a volcano in the form of lava. When this lava cools, it leads to the formation of igneous rocks. Igneous rocks. Now i know about igneous rocks. What is that? Pumice and Granite. These are also some types of igneous rocks. What type of rock is this? This is a sedimentary rock. How does it form? Don't worry. I will show you. Natural processes like wind, rain, flowing rivers carry soil particles, sand, dead plants. Over time, sand, soil, dead plants, etc. get deposited on top of each other. They are called layers of sediment. Over time, these layers press over one another to form sedimentary rocks. These rocks take thousands of years to form. Have a look at these rocks. Sandstone, coal and limestone. These are some types of sedimentary rocks. What type of rock is this? This is a metamorphic rock. Let me show you. These are sedimentary rocks. Heat from magma. Pressure from upper layers. Over a period of time. Formation of "
,,"metamorphic rocks. Look at limestone. It is sedimentary rock. When limestone is subjected to pressure and heat. It forms marble, a type of metamorphic rock. Quartzite and slate. These are also some types of metamorphic rocks. Now, I know about the types of rocks. Thank you for your great help."

angles,DGKwdHMiqCg," Hi! Welcome to Math Antics. We're continuing our series on Geometry   and today we're going to learn about angles. In our last video, we learned about points and lines, and that's good because"
,,we are going to need lines to make angles. So let's start with a couple of lines
,,that are in the same plane. We're only going to be dealing with
,, two-dimensional geometry in this video.  These lines are conveniently called
,," Line AB and Line CD. Now the important thing to notice about these two lines is that they're pointing in exactly the same direction.  So, even if we extended  them "
,,"forever, they would never cross or even get closer together. When two lines are arranged like this,"
,,we call them 'parallel'. You've probably heard the term 'parallel' before…
,,"like parallel parking, or a parallel universe, or parallel bars. Okay, so parallel lines are lines that will"
,,"never cross, even if they go on forever... but what if I take one of our lines and"
,,give it a little nudge? Now the lines aren't parallel anymore.
,,"In fact, they cross at this point right here. Let's name it Point P.  When lines cross at a point like this,"
,,"we say that they intersect, and we call the point an 'intersection'. And when lines intersect, they form 'angles'. You can think of the angles as the spaces, or shapes, that are formed between the intersecting lines.  These intersecting lines form four angles: 1, 2, 3, 4. But instead of calling them angle 1, 2, 3 and 4,  in Geometry,"
,,"we name them by the points used to make them. For example, this angle here can be called Angle DPB  because if you trace along those points"
,,"(like connect the dots) they outline that angle. And this angle here... we can call that Angle APD, because connecting those dots forms angle. Now when naming angles,"
,,"there's a nice shorthand we can use.  Instead of writing the word 'angle' over and over again, we can just use the angle symbol instead,"
,,"which looks like this. But there's an even simpler way to name angles. To learn that way,"
,,let's erase all the points and letters on our lines except for the intersection point and this one point here. Now let's imagine that the line-segment between these 
,,"two points can rotate around the point of intersection, just like a clock hand rotates"
,,"around the center of a clock.  Let's also imagine that as we rotate the line segment, the point out at the end leaves a trail,"
,,"like if a pencil was attached to it. The trail (or path) that is left when we rotate the line-segment all the way around forms a circle. But if we only go part way around,"
,,then it forms part of a circle that we call an 'arc'. This arc can represent the angle
,,"that is formed when we rotate the segment from one position to another,"
,,"like from this line to that line. And now, if we shrink down that arc so that"
,,"it's close to the intersection point, and then put a letter by it, like the letter 'A',"
,,"we have another way of showing an angle... Angle A. And we can do this with any angle,"
,,"so the angle up here... we can also draw an arc and call it Angle B. So whenever you see a letter next to a little arc like this, it means that it's the name of the "
,,angle
,,"formed by that arc. Alright then, so now we have a diagram that shows Angle A and Angle B, and you might notice that those angles"
,,aren't the same size.  B seems to be bigger than A. But what if we rotate one of our lines until
,,the angles do look like they're the same size? Now our angles look kind of like a plus sign.
,,Lines arranged like this are called 'perpendicular'. Perpendicular lines are lines that form square corners when they intersect. And these square corner angles have 
,,"a special name in Geometry because they are really important. We call them 'right angles'. There is even a special symbol that we use to show when an angle is a right angle.  Because they form square corners,  we use a little square instead of"
,,"the arc that we use for the other angles. So whenever you see this symbol,"
,,"you know the angle you are looking at is a right angle, and that the lines that form it are perpendicular. Okay, now that you know what a right angle is, let's look "
,,"at a simple one that's made from just two rays. What will happen if we take the ray pointing up and rotate it like the hand of a clock a little to the right… a little bit clockwise? Well, we don't have a right angle any more"
,,"because the rays are no longer perpendicular. Instead, we have an angle that is smaller"
,,(or less) than a right angle. Angles that are less than right angles
,,"are called 'acute angles'. On the other hand, if we rotated our ray to"
,,"the left instead of the right, we would get an angle that's bigger"
,,or greater than a right angle.  Angles that are greater than right angles
,,"are called 'obtuse angles'. So, there are three main kinds of angles"
,,"that you need to know about.  Right Angles, acute angles and obtuse angles. Well actually, there's one more type of"
,,"angle that's pretty important, but it's kind of a strange one."
,,"It's called a 'straight angle'. A straight angle is just what we get when we rotate our rays so that they point in exactly opposite directions. The result looks just like a straight line,"
,,"which is why it's called a straight angle. Alright then, there's just a few more important geometry terms that we need to learn in this video.  Let's look at our simple right angle"
,,"again that's made from two rays. But this time, let's draw a third ray that"
,,"cuts that right angle into two smaller parts. Now, because the angle that we divided up"
,,"was a right angle,  we know that the two new smaller angles"
,,"combine to form a right angle. And in geometry, any two angles that to form a right angle are called 'complementary angles'. And we can do the same thing with a straight angle.  If we take a straight angle (made from two rays)  and divide it with a third ray,"
,,two new smaller angles are formed. And those two angles combine to form a straight angle.
,,"We call these angles 'supplementary angles'. So, complementary angles"
,,"combine to form a right angle,  and supplementary angles"
,,"combine to form a straight angle. Alright, that's all were going to learn about angles"
,,"in this video. And if you are new to Geometry,"
,,"it might seem like a lot, so let's do a quick review of"
,,"all the new geometry words we've learned. Lines that point in exactly the same direction will never cross and are called 'parallel' lines. When lines do cross, they "
,,cross at a point
,,called an 'intersection'. Lines that intersect form 'angles'. You can
,,think of angles as the spaces between the lines. Angles can be named by the points that
,,"form them... just like connect the dots. An 'arc' is a part of a circle. Arcs can be used to represent an angle between two intersecting lines. When intersecting lines form all exactly equal angles, the lines are 'perpendicular'. Perpendicular lines form 'right angles'."
,,"Right angles are square corners,  and we use a special square symbol"
,,"to show that an angle is a right angle. An angle that's smaller, or less than a right"
,,"angle is called an 'acute angle'. An angle that's bigger, or greater than a"
,,right angle is called an 'obtuse angle'. A 'straight angle' is formed by two rays pointing
,,in exactly opposite directions.  A straight angle is really just a straight line. Two angles that combine to form a right angle
,,are called 'complementary angles'. Two angles that combine to form a straight
,,"angle are called 'supplementary angles'. In our next geometry video, we're going to"
,,"learn more about angles and how to measure them. Thanks for watching Math Antics, and I'll"

angles,_n3KZR1DSEo,we learned some important things about angles. One of the things we
,,"learned was than angles come in different sizes. Some are big and some are small. Well in this video, we're gonna learn how"
,,"we can tell exactly how big or small an angle is. We're gonna learn how angles are measured. You probably already know a lot about measurement, like you know how to "
,,"measure how long something is with a ruler or a tape measure. And the units you'd use would be inches, or centimeters, or something like that, right? But when it comes to angles, we can't use"
,,"a ruler to measure them, or use units like centimeters. And that's because angles aren't"
,,"about length, angles are about rotation. And to measure how much something is rotated,"
,,"we use a special unit called degrees. Now hold on a second, I thought degrees were used"
,,"to measure how hot or cold something is. Ya know, like, ""it's 100 degrees outside today!"" Ah, that's a good point you smart looking"
,,"fellow. The word degree is actually used for a lot of different things, so it can be a"
,,little confusing sometimes. It makes more sense if you just think of a
,,"degree as a small amount of something.  For temperature, a degree is a small amount of heat. But for angles, a degree is a"
,,small amount of rotation. And there's a special math symbol for degrees that we can use instead of writing
,,the word 'degrees' over an over again. It's this little circle that you put after the number
,,"and up near the top. To see how we use degrees to measure angles, let's get two rays that point in exactly the"
,,"same direction. Then, let's put one ray"
,,"directly on top of the other one, so it looks like there is only one ray there,"
,,"even though there's really two. Now, let's take the ray on top and rotate it"
,,just a tiny amount counter-clockwise. This point on the ray will be our axis
,,(or center) of rotation. It is like the point at the center
,,of a clock that stays stationary
,,"while the hands rotate around it. Our rays now form an angle that measures 1 degree, and as you can see, 1 degree is a really small angle. We need to zoom in on     "
,,"it to see that it really is an angle. In fact, you might wonder if there could be any angle"
,,"smaller than 1 degree. Yep, there sure are. And we saw one just a"
,,"second ago. Before we rotated our top ray,"
,,"when our rays were exactly on top of each other, that is a zero degree angle. And there's a whole range of tiny fraction"
,,"angles between 0 and 1 degree, but we aren't going to learn about them in this video. Instead, we are going to keep on rotating"
,,our top ray and watch the angle get bigger and bigger. This special readout here will
,,"tell us how many degrees our angle measures. Now let's start out slow. 1 degree, 2, 3, 4, 5,"
,,"6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, now let's hold it there for a second. So this is what 10 degrees looks like. 10 degrees?! That's f-f-freezing! Huh. Guess you're not as smart as "
,,I thought
,,after all. So we can see that a 10 degree angle is still
,,"a very small angle. So let's keep going, but a little bit faster this time. That's 15 degrees, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 and 45. Now 45 degrees is a special angle because it's exactly half of a right angle. If we draw a right angle in the same spot, you can see that our ray cuts it into two equal parts. So, if 45 is half of a right angle, can you"
,,"guess how many degrees a right angle is?  Let's keep on rotating to see if you're right. 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90. Yep, a right angle is exactly 90 degrees,  and that "
,,is super important to memorize because
,,"right angles are used all the time in geometry. Okay, do you remember from our last video that all angles less than a right angle are called"
,,acute angles? So that means that all
,,"the angles we've seen so far that are between 0 and 90 degrees (like 10, 30, 45, 60 and"
,,"so on) are acute angles. But, if we keep on rotating our ray past"
,,"90 degrees, we'll start forming obtuse angles,"
,,"because they are greater than a right angle. Ready? Here we go. 100 degrees, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170 and 180. Ah ha, does this look familiar? Yep. It's a straight angle, like we learned about in the last video. The rays point in exactly"
,,opposite directions and the angle they form is 180 degrees.  And that's also a really important
,,"angle measurement to memorize. Now before we go on, let's quickly review"
,,the important angles and regions we've looked so far. Our angle measurement is zero degrees when
,,"the rays point in the same direction. It's 90 degrees when they are perpendicular,"
,,and form a right angle. And it's 180 degrees when they point in
,,"opposite directions, and form a straight angle. In this region (between 90 and 180)"
,,we find obtuse angles. And in this region (between 0 and 90)
,,we find acute angles. One important acute angle is 45 degrees since
,,"it's half of a right angle. Alright then, let's continue rotating past"
,,"180 degrees. Our angle readout keeps getting higher, and the next important angle we come to is this one, 270 degrees. It also forms a right angle,"
,,but it points down instead of up. Let's keep on going because another really
,,important angle is just around the corner. And it's coming up right about now! We've rotated our ray all the way around the axis
,,"and now it's back to where we started. Now you might be wondering, ""If we're back"
,,"where we started, then why is our counter reading 360 degrees instead of 0 degrees like before?"" The answer is that, even though our rays are back to the same place,  we had to rotate our top ray 360 degree to get it there. And you can see that our angle arc"
,,now forms a complete circle. So 360 degrees is the angle that represents
,,a full circle! Rotating 360 degrees brings you all the way around the circle to the point
,,"where you started from. Okay, now that you know what degrees are and"
,,"have seen how they relate to the size of an angle, we need to learn how to actually measure"
,,an angle without this fancy readout that we have here. Just like a ruler can be used to measure the
,,"length of a line, a special tool called a protractor"
,,"can be used to measure angles. A protractor is similar to a ruler, but it's"
,,curved into a half-circle so that it can measure rotation around an axis point. A protractor
,,"also has a straight edge with a hole or dot in the middle that represents the axis, or"
,,"center of rotation. So, if you are given a mystery angle"
,,"(like this one) and you want to measure how many degrees it is, you just put your protractor"
,,"on top of it so that the axis point lines up with the intersection of your rays, like this. Then you make sure that one of the rays lines"
,,"up with the straight line on the protractor. And last of all, you look to see where the other"
,,"ray crosses the curved part and read off what angle measurement it lines up with. As you can see, this angle is 50 degrees. Alright, there's one more thing I want to"
,,teach you in this video because you will probably see this kind of geometry problem on your
,,"homework or tests. Do you remember what complementary and supplementary angles are from the last video? Complementary angles combine to form a right angle,  and supplementary angles combine to form"
,,"a straight angle. Well, now that we know a right angle is 90"
,,"degrees, and a straight angle is 180 degrees, we can use that information to solve problems"
,,"that have unknown angles, like this one. It shows two angles (A & B)"
,,"that combine to form a right angle. The problem tells us that angle A is 30 degrees,"
,,"and it wants us to figure out what angle B is. Fortunately, it's easy to figure that out now because we know that a right angle is 90 degrees, so we know what the total of both angles must be. That means that to find angle B, all we do is take"
,,the total (which is 90 degrees) and subtract angle A (Which is 30 degrees)
,,"and whatever is left over will be angle B.  So, 90 - 30 = 60. Angle B is 60 degrees. Now let's try this problem. It uses the same"
,,"idea, but with a straight angle this time. The straight angle is divided into two smaller"
,,"angles. (again, angle A & angle B) And again, the problem tells us that angle A is 70 degrees, and it wants us to figure out what angle B is. Well, we know that the "
,,total of both angles
,,must be 180 degrees because we just learned
,,"that's how big a straight angle is. So if we take that total (180 degrees) and subtract angle A (which is 70 degrees), whatever is"
,,"left after subtracting must be angle B. So 180 - 70 = 110. Pretty cool, huh? And now you can see why"
,,it's important to know how degrees work in geometry. They can tell us how big angles
,,"are or how much something is rotated. Well, that's all I've got for you in this video.  But don't worry, there's a lot more geometry"
,,"where that came from.  So I'll get going on my next video, and you get going on practicing what you've learned. Thanks for watching Math Antics,"

angles,k5etrWdIY6o,  Hi there! Today on Math Antics we're starting a new subject where we're going to learn the basics of a special kind of math called Geometry. Geometry is the study 
,,"of things like lines, shapes, angles, distances and things like that. In this video, we're going to focus on"
,,"three of the most basic elements (or parts) of Geometry. They are points, lines and planes. Alright, we're gonna start with points because they're about the simplest thing you can imagine in Geometry.  What's a point? Let me draw some for you.  So these are points. They're just little tiny dots in space. But they do a really important job in Geometry... They help us describe specific locations in space, like the end of the line, or the corner of a square, or the center of a circle. But they won't really help that much"
,,"unless we name them because if I say, ""Hey look at that point"
,,"over there!"" It's kind of hard to tell which one I'm talking about. I mean, they all look the same. So what names should we give these points? Well let's see… hmm… How about Archimedes, and... uh… Beauregard, that'd be good. Umm… maybe Charlemagne? How about Daphne and Einstein… let's see... Fred… and… Gwynevere, Hiawatha and… Icarus! Perfect! You know, on second thought, those names are kind of long and complicated. Why don't we just use the first letters"
,,"a each name instead? There, now if I say...  ""Look at point A"" or ""Look at point B"", you"
,,"know exactly what I'm talking about. In fact, let's do that.  Let's just talk"
,,"about 'point A' and 'point B' for a minute. If you start at point A and go to point B, taking the shortest distance possible, you'd have gone in a straight line. A line is the next most basic element of Geometry. We name a line by the points that it goes"
,,"through. For example, we would call this 'line AB', because its end-points (where it starts and stops) are points A and B But, technically, this isn't really a 'line'…"
,,"it's a 'line-segment'. ""What's the difference?"" you ask. That's a good question. A line-segment has a beginning and an end.  It starts at one point in space, and it "
,,"ends at another. A line, on the other hand, just keeps on going... ...in either direction forever.  just like the number-line keeps on going forever. Well, at least "
,,we imagine that it goes on forever. We can actually draw a line that goes on
,,"forever, so here's what we do instead. To draw a line instead of a line-segment, you just go past the end points a little bit,  and you put an arrow on both ends of "
,,the line to show that keeps on going. So this is line-segment AB  and this is line CD. Now there's one more special type of
,,"line that we need to talk about, and it's basically a combination of a"
,,"line-segment and a line. We call it a 'ray'. Rays have beginning points, but no ending points. They just keep on going forever... but only in one direction."
,,"So we only put an arrow on the end that keeps going. There, we call this one, ray EF In Geometry, each of these three types of lines has a shorthand way of writing it. Instead of writing ""line-segment AB""  you can just write ""AB"" with a line over the top. And instead of writing ""line CD"",  you can write ""CD"" with a double arrow "
,,"line over them,"
,,"like this. And finally, instead of writing ""ray EF"", you can just write ""EF"","
,,"with a single arrow line over them, like so. Okay, so now you know about points. And you know that you can"
,,form a line between any two points. The next thing we're
,,gonna learn about is planes. No!  Not the kind of planes that you fly in. Now to help you understand
,,"how planes in Geometry work, Let's go back and look at all those points we had at the beginning of the video. It looks like all the points are the"
,,"same depth on your computer screen, right? and if they were,"
,,"we'd say that they're all in the same 'plane'. That's because your computer screen is a plane. It's a flat surface like a window,"
,,"or sheet of paper, or a tabletop. A plane (or flat surface) is what we call a"
,,two-dimensional object because there's two dimensions that you
,,"can move in. You can go up and down, or you can go left and right. A line, on the other hand, is a one-dimensional object. If you're on a line, like 'line AB', there's only"
,,"one dimension that you can travel in.  Sure, you can go forwards or backwards along that line, but it still has only one dimension.  You can't get to point C without going off of line AB But if you're on a plane (a two-dimensional object),  then you can get to point C, because point C is on the same plane  as points A and B. All three of them are on that flat two-dimensional surface which is your computer screen. Cool! So that means that if I want to get to point D, I can do that too because it's on the"
,,"same plane as A, B and C. Right? Alright, I have a confession to make. I tricked you. Point D really isn't in the same plane"
,,as a computer screen. It just looks like it from the position
,,you're viewing it from. Watch what happens if I start rotating the screen space a little bit. Ah ha! Now you can see that the points
,,are actually scattered all over the place in space. Point D is actually in front of the plane
,,"that A, B and C were in. along with some of the other points.  and the rest of the points are actually behind the plane that A, B and C are in. What we have here is "
,,"a three-dimensional space or ""3D"" space for short.  In a three-dimensional space,"
,,"there's three dimensions you can move in. left to right, up and down, and in and out If we're on the plane that contains points A, B and C, we can't get to point D unless we leave that plane by traveling in that third dimension. A three-dimensional space like this is"
,,"often called a 'volume', but we'll talk all about 3D volumes in another video. For now, let's get back to talking about planes. Earlier in the video, we learned that you can make a line by connecting any two points, right? Well, in order to make a plane, it turns"
,,"out that you need to have three points. Like our three points A,B and C. If you just connect A and B, you get a line. But if you connect A, B and C, you get a…. a…. "
,,"...a triangle?! Now you're probably thinking, ""Wait! I thought we were supposed to get a plane, not a triangle."" Well, because it is a flat surface,"
,,"a triangle is a lot like a plane, but it has three edges. It stops and doesn't keep on going forever. When we were talking about lines, do you remember how a line segment had end points, but a true line kept on going forever? Well, it's kind of the same way with triangles and planes. You can't think of a triangle as"
,,"a smaller part (or a segment) of a plane. but the plane itself keeps on going forever.  So, three points is all it takes to define a plane. and in a space we've been looking at, we"
,,already have plane ABC. So let's try making some other planes
,,with the rest of the points. We can choose any three point that we want to.

angles,6RMN5Pf1fHU,"Consider line 'p' and line 'q' which are on a plane. The lines are also parallel to each other, which would mean that they do not intersect or ever meet. And this is transversal 'R' , which cuts the lines 'p' and 'q' at two distinct points. In this video we will try to understand the different types of angles formed by the transversal with two parallel lines. The transversal forms four angles with line 'p', angles 1, 2, 3 & 4. And four angles with line 'q', angles 5, 6, 7 & 8. Let's move on to the first type of angles. If lines p and q are parallel, then angle 1 will always equal angle 5. This angle here will be equal to this one. They are called corresponding angles. It doesn't matter how the transversal is placed. These angles will always be equal. On a new page let us try moving the transversal around. Assume line 'a', and line 'b' are parallel to each other. And here is a transversal 'c'. You can see that these two angles look equal. Now let's rotate the transversal towards the right. These two angles again seem to be equal. Now let's rotate the transversal towards the left . The angles become obtuse and are still equal. This tells us that the corresponding angles are always equal. Now let's go back to the previous page. Now let me ask you an interesting question. Look at the figure closely. Is "
,,"this the only pair of corresponding angles? No! It isn't. We have three more pairs of corresponding angles. When a transversal intersects a pair of Parallel lines. Four pairs of corresponding angles are formed. Two and six form a corresponding angles pair. So angle two will always equal angle six. You can even look at the figure and observe that they are equal. Similarly, angle three will equal angle seven, and angle four will equal angle eight. These are the four pairs of corresponding angles that are formed. 1 & 5, 2 & 6, 3 & 7, 4 & 8. Angles 3, 4, 5 & 6 are interior angles, because they are between the two parallel lines. And they are classified into two types. Let's understand the first type. Angle 3 and Angle 5 form a pair of alternate interior angles. We know why they are called interior, but why exactly are they called alternate? If we have a round table with numbers 3, 4, 5 & 6 around it, then 5 is alternate to 3. That's because after 3 you skip 1 position and take the next. Similarly, 6 will be alternate to 4. In this diagram as well to find alternate of 3 we skip 1 position and take the next which is 5 . And similarly, angle 4 "
,,"and angle 6 are also called alternate interior angles. This was the first type of interior angles. The second type is a pair in which the angles are next to each other on the same side of the transversal. Like angle 3 and angle 6. They are called consecutive interior angles. Look at the figure now. Do you see any other pair of consecutive interior angles? Yes! With the same logic even angles 4 & 5 are consecutive interior Angles. Remember, there are two types of interior angles. Alternate and Consecutive. For alternate we skip one and move to the next. For consecutive, we take the one that's immediately next to it. And the last types of angles that are formed are vertically opposite angles. Angles 1 & 3 are called vertically opposite angles. In all there are 4 pairs of vertically opposite angles, Apart from angles 1 & 3, we have angles 2 & 4, angles 5 & 7 and angles 6 & 8 as the other 3 pairs. And vertically opposite angles are always equal. These were the different types of "
,,"angles that were formed when a transversal meets two parallel lines. On a new page let's look at the beauty of these angles. Assume we have lines 'a' and 'b' which are parallel. And transversal 'c' which intersects them at two distinct points. As we already know the transversal forms eight angles. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven and eight. Let us quickly analyze the relation between various angles formed. It's pretty simple actually. Angle two will be equal to angle six as their corresponding angles. An angle eight equals angle six as it is vertically opposite to it . And angle four equals angle eight because they are corresponding angles. Similarly, angle one equals angle five as their corresponding angles. Angle seven equals angle five because they are vertically opposite. And angle three equals angle seven because they are corresponding angles. So if lines 'a' and 'b' are parallel, we can see that angles one, three, five and seven are equal. And angles two, four, six and eight are equal."

angles,4p-MeDD9Lhc,for today's lesson we are going to discuss about mathematical system particularly defined terms at the end of this video lesson you are expected to illustrate the need of an axiomatic structure of a mathematical system in general and particularly the defined terms in geometry but before we start our lesson let us have our pretest first answer the following questions please pause the video and play it after you are done answering your time starts now let us check your answers number one letter g number two letter d number three letter b number four letter b number five letter a i'm going to discuss to you these terms in the previous video i discussed about the mathematical system which are undefined terms define terms actions or postulates and theorems but we focused on the undefined terms of geometry the undefined terms of geometry are point line and plane if you want to watch this video click here the undefined terms such as line point and plane were established in this video these terms will be used to define all other terms and figures in the study of geometry a definition is an exact statement or description of the meaning of a term 
,,or word so that anyone using it will understand it in the same way the reasons that we need defined terms are we need to be precise and concise in what we say or right also we need to understand each other and make sure that we mean the same thing when we say or write a particular word example we have here a definition of calling your points and coplanar points calling your points are points that lie on the same line coplanar points are points that lie on the same plane example points x y z are calling your points because they lie on the same line and points a x y z are coplanar points because they lie on the same plane these are the following defined 
,,terms in geometry as you can see in this figure the lines never meet or crosses at each other these are what we call parallel lines parallel lines are lines in a plane that do not intersect a parallel line is represented by a two short vertical line these arrow heads indicates that these lines are parallel now what if the two lines intersect and form a right angle this is what we call a perpendicular lines perpendicular lines are lines that intersect and form a right angle the symbol for perpendicular to is like an inverted t in this example lines why is perpendicular to line x z because they form a right angle as you can see in this figure points a b 
,,and c are collinear points and b is at the center of line segment ac we're in point b divides the line segment into two equal parts a midpoint is a point on a line segment that divides it into two equal parts the halfway point of a line segment if b is the midpoint of ac then ba is equal to bc or line segment ba is congruent to 
,,line segment bc an angle is the figure formed by two rays with common point for example we have here array ba and ray bc they form an angle which is angle abc it means that this figure is an angle as you can see in this figure this is also an angle because it has two rays with common point a but what kind of angle is this this is what we call a right angle a right angle is an angle whose measure is 90 degrees the square corner is used to mark a right angle here angle kap is a right angle or angle a definition of vertical angles vertical angles are two angles in which the sides of one angle are opposite trace to the sides of the other angles here angle 
,,hge and angle fgd are vertical angles and also angle hjd and angle egf are vertical angles how about this figure is this an angle yes but as you can see there are two angles angle a and angle b this is what we call adjacent angles if two angles like a and b have a common vertex and common side then they are called adjacent angles angle a and angle b are adjacent angles now let us define what is a linear pair if two adjacent angles like a and b have their non-common sides forming a straight 
,,angle or opposite race then they are called linear pair we have also angle a and angle b and forming a 180 degrees and they have their non-common sides and forming a straight angles or opposite rays this is what we call linear pair definition of supplementary angles if the sum of the measures of two angles is 180 degrees then they are said to be supplementary angles for example we have here angle 1 measures 80 degrees and angle 2 measures 100 degrees if you are going to add angle 1 and angle 2 80 degrees plus 100 is equal to 180 then we can say that angle 1 and angle 2 are supplementary angles definition of complementary angles if the sum of the measures of two angles is 90 degrees then they are said to be complementary angles as you can see in this figure angle a is 20 degrees and angle b measures 70 degrees if we are going to add 20 degrees and 70 degrees it is equal to 90 degrees then we can say that angle a and angle b are complementary angles another example we have here angle c with 75 degrees and angle d with 15 degrees if we are going to add 75 degrees and 15 degrees their total measures 90 degrees then we can say that angle c and angle d are complementary angles take note that supplementary and complementary angles may not be adjacent like this figure next definition of angle bisector an angle bisector is array that divides an angle into two congruent angles if ray ob is an angle bisector then measurement of angle aob equals measurement angle boc because ray ob divides the angle into two congruent angles next definition of segment bisector segment bisector is a point a line or a segment that divides the segment into two congruent parts as you can see here in this figure if ray km bisect line ln then we can say that lm is congruent to mn because segment bisector divides the segment into two congruent parts this mark means that lm is equal to mn now let us try these following examples write the conclusion to complete the if then statement 
,,justify your answer by using the definitions we have here at three collinear points j a and m given if a is a midpoint of j m then by using the definition of a midpoint a is the midpoint of this given so we can say that j a is equal to am another example given if angle tsu and angle tsv form a linear pair then since angle tsu and angle tsb form a linear pair then by definition of linear pair angle tsu and angle tsb are adjacent angles another example if ray om is perpendicular to line ln then since ray om is perpendicular to line ln therefore angle m-o-n is a right angle by definition of perpendicular lines another example we have here angle c and angle d are complementary angles and measurement of angle c is 53 degrees then the measure of angle d is since complementary angles measures 90 degrees then we can say that measurement of angle d is equal to 37 degrees how because 90 minus 53 is equal to 37 to better understand this lesson let us try these activities write through if the statement is correct and false if not you

,,by angles like the ones this clock handles or an ice cream cone makes the unit of measure of angles is the degree and the most important angle of all is this one it's called a right angle and it measures 90 degrees the tiny zero you can see on the bright upper part of the number 90 is a symbol that represents all angles we say that the right angle is the most important one because it is the one that is used to compare all of the other angles the angles are smaller than of right angle a called acute angles and they measure less than 90 degrees like all of these and angles that are bigger than a right angle are called obtuse angles and measure more than 
,,90 degrees like all of these to neighbor degrees at an angle measures we need to use this instruments which is called app attractor so we need to place the straight 
,,part of the Picatta over one of the sides of the angle making the vertex and the central point of the Petrak to meet after this we need to look at the trap to line on the other side of the angle and look at what number it says these are the degrees that an angle measures easy peasy huh let's practice we said that a right angle is 90 degrees let's see we'll get the protractor and indeed a right angle is 90 degrees we haven't fooled you huh now let's measure this angle let's see how much it measures 45 degrees it's an acute angle because it is smaller than a right angle and now we're going to check out how much this other angle measures a hundred and twenty degrees of course it's an obtuse angle because it measures more than 90 degrees imagine that instead of being 120 it measures a hundred and eighty do you know what this angle is called we call it a straight angle hey and what about if it messes 360 degrees well that's a complete all full angle it's complete as can be the conference meshes 360 degrees what's a discovery measuring angles is easy-peasy and fun don't you think get by friends and don't forget to subscribe to happy learning TV

angles,MEFlB5zSgdM,today our lesson in eighth grade is going to be on angles and some special angle pairs let's start off by just reviewing what we know about basic angles acute obtuse and right are the three main types of angles and we also will add what straight angles are acute angles are angles that have a degree measure of less than 90 degrees obtuse are greater than 90 degrees and right angles are 90 degrees oftentimes you see a little box in the corner to show that they are 90 degrees or a right angle 
,,how you can check if you don't have a protractor to measure and see if they are acute or obtuse is to do what we call the paper test place the corner of your paper in to the vertex and this is the vertex or the where the two rays connect on your angle and if you cannot see one of the other rays then it's going to be an acute angle if you can see one of the rays of your angle then it's going to be obtuse we use protractors in order to measure angles here is an acute angle you always line up 
,,your protractor with one of the Rays along the zero since I've lined it up here on the zero that I'm counting using the bottom numbers 10 20 30 40 50 60 and then you can't help me little Mark's pass the 60 one two three four so this looks like it is 64 degrees and it is an acute angle okay now let's talk about some special angle pairs part of this is review I know we had this last year complementary angles complementary angles are two angles that have a sum of 90 degrees then they can be what we call adjacent where they share a ray or a side this one's a 40 degree angle then this one's a 50 degree angle if they're complementary because together they add up to be 90 degrees they can also be just two separate angles let's say this is angle a and this is angle B we can say that angle a and angle B or complementary because they're two measurements together add up to be 90 degrees supplementary angles supplementary angles are two angles that have a sum of 180 degrees again they can share a sine 140 and 40 equals 180 degrees or if they can be totally separate angles the right way I remember is complementary C comes first in the alphabet therefore it's a smaller measurement of 90 degrees supplementary think of straight supplementary angles make a straight angle or 180 degrees okay then what is the supplement of a 75 degree angle well supplementary angles add up to be how much okay 180 so I'm thinking to myself 180 minus 75 and what do you get 105 degrees okay so 105 degrees plus 75 degrees is that out to be 180 it sure does what is the complement of a night at 75 degree angle excuse me I'll take 90 minus 75 and what do you come up with good 15 degrees because together 15 and 75 add up to be 90 degrees okay term that you need to be familiar with is adjacent adjacent angles are two angles that share a common side I can say that angle a and angle B are adjacent they share a common side and this is the little angle symbol angle a and angle B are adjacent because they share a common side and the next type of very special angle pairs are called vertical angles vertical angles are formed from two intersecting lines any lines that cross or intersect just like an intersection in the street opposite angles are congruent or they have the same measure and this is your congruence symbol so that we can say that angle a and angle C are congruent they're exactly the same we can say that the measure of angle B and angle D are congruent okay so vertical angles are opposite and congruent angles formed by two intersecting lines so for instance let's say that said that that measure of angle a was 120 degrees can you tell me then the measure of angle C okay it's going to be the same it's also 120 degrees what's going to be the measure of angle B well C and B or what kind of angles who they form a straight angle so they're called supplementary so that if C is 120 degrees what will be okay measure of angle B will be 60 degrees because together they add up to be 180 okay if I know B is 60 degrees what then is the measure of angle D it is 60 degrees any questions on vertical angles okay now this is a set of we're talking about corresponding angles angles formed from two parallel lines parallel lines or lines that will never touch but they are cut by another line we call that the transversal parallel lines cut by a transversal they give us some really special characteristics of angles now if you look at it very carefully if I looked at those two lines they just look like what we just looked at vertical angles two and three are opposite so they're going to be the same one in four are opposite so they're going to be the same and I can say the same for these two lines they look like two intersecting lines therefore opposite angles are congruent in the same six and seven are the same five and eight are the same or pairs okay when we talk about corresponding we're going to look at some other angle pairs as well we're going to say that angle one corresponds with angle five angle three corresponds with angle seven angle two corresponds with angle six and angle 4 corresponds with angle eight and they're the same now from a parallel lines cut by transversal we have some other special angle pairs the first one is going to be the alternate interior angles can we think of interior think of inside the parallel lines alternate means kind of opposites opposite sides so the alternate interior angles would be 3 & 6 and we 
,,know that those two look like they're both up two so they're going to have the same measure and we call them congruent and measures 4 & 5 okay those both are two alternate interior pairs angles 3 & 6 are going to be the same and 4 & 5 are going to be the same okay then the next term is alternate exterior angles which those low lie on the outside of the parallel lines so which one's going to be the alternate exterior angle to angle 1 do you think yes good it's going to be 8 see how they're both acute they're going to be the same measure and which one matches or corresponds and B karu at angle 2 you got it angle 7 and we already talked about the corresponding angles 1 & 5 3 & 7 2 & 6 4 & 8 and you can write those down okay now here comes the fun part I can give you the measure of just one of those angles and you can find the measurement of all the rest all the seven remaining angles let's give it a try let's say the measure of angle 2 is 110 degrees okay I want you and your partner to think what are the remaining measures of angles 1 3 4 5 6 7 & 8 when you think you have them raise your hand I'll come around and check you and then we'll go over okay some of you chose to go with the vertical angle in other words 2 & 3 are the same so you knew that 3 had to be 110 degrees some of you chose to do supplementary angles 1 & 2 or supplementary so if I know that 2 is 110 degrees what degree measure would add it to be 180 and it would be a 70 degree angle I know that 1 in 4 are vertical angles so they are the same so 4 is a 70 degree angle we know that 5 is going to be also 70 degrees we know it two different ways because 4 & 5 are congruent because of alternate interior angles and one in five are congruent because their corresponding angles ok what's the measure of angle 6 it's going to be 110 
,,we know that a couple different ways 3 & 6 are alternate into your angles and we know that 2 & 6 will be the same because they are corresponding angles are melinda was 7 is 110 degrees and then 8 is 70 degrees again you can choose by vertical angles you know that or by corresponding angles 3 & 7 4 & 8 or by alternate exterior angles 2 & 7 1 & 8 alright then that concludes our lesson on special angle pairs okay we have one more little note one other set of special angles are formed from perpendicular lines perpendicular lines I'm assuming you kind of already remember this but just in case you haven't had this this is really an important term that perpendicular lines are formed from intersecting lines and they form writing angles or 90-degree angles perpendicular lines intersect to form 90-degree angles

,,PS D:\111111\EDUKID-main\quiz-generator> python main.py
,,"Hi, I’m Rob.  Welcome to Math Antics! In this lesson, we’re going to learn about another important geometry quantity called Volume. Specifically, we’re going to learn what volume is, and what kind of units we use to measure volume, and how we can calculate the volumes of a few simple geometric shapes. The first thing you need to know is that Volume is a quantity that all 3-Dimensional objects have, but to understand what it means, it will help if we back up just a little and start out with "
,,a 1-Dimensional object like this line segment. To measure a 1-Dimensional object we need a 1-Dimensional quantity which we usually call “length”. The length of this 
,,"line happens to be exactly one centimeter (which is a common unit for measuring length). And in the Math Antics video about area, we saw that if we move (or extend) "
,,"this 1-Dimensional line in a direction perpendicular to it by a distance of one centimeter, it forms a 2-Dimensional object called a square. 2-Dimensional objects are measured by the 2-Dimensional quantity that we call area. Because the original line was one centimeter long and we extended it a distance of one centimeter, the amount of area that this square occupies is one “square centimeter” (which is a common unit for measuring area.) Okay now, imagine that we take that 2-Dimensional square and move (or extend) it in a direction perpendicular to its surface by a distance of 1 centimeter. It forms a 3-Dimensional object that’s called a cube. And to measure a 3-Dimensional object like this, we use the 3-Dimensional quantity called volume. Volume tells us how much 3-Dimensional space (or 3D space) an object occupies. Alright, but how much volume does this cube have? Well, since it was made by extending 1 square centimeter a distance of one centimeter in the 3rd dimension, we say that its volume is exactly one “cubic centimeter” (which is a common unit for measuring volume.) So “square units” are used to measure area, and “cubic units” are used to measure volume. Since square units are made by multiplying TWO 1-Dimensional units together, like centimeter times centimeter, we can abbreviate them using "
,,"the exponent notation “centimeters to the 2nd power” or “centimeters squared”. And since cubic units are made by multiplying THREE 1-Dimensional units together, like centimeter times centimeter times centimeter, we can abbreviate them using exponent notation: “centimeters to the 3rd power” or “centimeters cubed”. And, just like "
,,"there were different sizes of square units like square inches, square meters or square miles, there are also different sized cubic units like cubic inches, cubic meters or cubic miles. See how area and square units are related to volume and cubic units? And there’s another similarity too. Do you remember how you can use square units to measure the area of ANY 2D shape, not just squares? Well, you can use cubic units to measure the volume of ANY 3D shape, not just cubes. To see how that works, take a look at this 2D circle and this 3D object called a sphere (which is like a ball). Just like you can uses a bunch of small squares to approximate the area of the circle, you can use a bunch of small cubes to approximate the volume of the sphere. And here’s the really cool part…The smaller the squares you use, the closer their combined area will match the area of the circle. And the smaller the cubes you use, the closer their combined volume will match the volume of the sphere. Okay,  so volume is a 3D quantity for measuring 3D objects, but since we’ve also talked a lot about area in this video, I want to point out that 3D objects also have a type of area that you don’t want to confuse with volume. You might remember from our previous videos, that 2D shapes have BOTH a 2D quantity called area and a 1D quantity called perimeter. Well, in a similar way, 3D objects have BOTH a 3D quantity called volume and a 2D quantity called called “surface area”. Surface area is a lot like it sounds… it’s the area of the object’s outer surface or shell. Perimeter and surface area are both outer boundaries of geometric shapes. Perimeter is the 1-Dimensional outer boundary of a 2-Dimensional shape, and surface area is the 2-Dimensional outer boundary of a 3-Dimensional shape. And to help you see the difference between surface area and volume, imagine that you have a perfectly thin box filled with ice. If you unfold the box, you can see the 2D area that surrounds the volume, while the volume itself if the amount of 3D space occupied by the ice inside the box. Alright, so now that you understand what volume is, and you won’t confuse it with surface area, we’re going to spend the rest of the video learning how to calculate the volumes of some basic geometric shapes. But before we do that, I want to quickly mention something important about terminology (or the words we use to describe things in math). Most of the time, people agree on what to call things in math, but not aways. And that’s especially true when it comes to the words that we use to describe the dimensions of geometric objects. Take the words, “length”, “width” and “height” for example. If I have a rectangle, I could name its two dimensions “length” and “width” like we did in the Area video. But I could also name them “width” and “height” if I wanted to. The actual names of the dimensions really aren’t important, so different teachers might use different names. The important thing is to be flexible and realize that the math concepts are the same, even if different words are used to explain them. For example, the area of a rectangle is always found by multiplying its two side dimensions together, no matter what they’re called. Okay… back to calculating volumes… A lot of 3D shapes can be formed by taking a 2D shape and then extending it along the third dimension. For example, if you start with a rectangle, and then extend it along the third dimension, you get a 3D shape "
,,"called a “rectangular prism”. If you start with a triangle, and then extend it along the third dimension, you get a 3D shape called a “triangular prism”. And if you "
,,"start with a circle, and extend it along the third dimension, you get a 3D shape called a “cylinder”. From the others, you might have thought it should be called a “circular prism” but technically prisms are shapes that are formed by extending a polygon, and since a circle is not a polygon, the resulting shape is not called a prism. Okay, so the good news is that there’s a general formula for calculating the volume of these types of 3D shape. All you have to do is find the area of the original 2D shape that got extended, and then multiply that by the length (or distance) that it was extended. Usually, that original shape is called the “base” of the object. So let’s start with this rectangular prism and calculate its volume. The base is the original rectangle, and its dimensions are 4 centimeters by 3 centimeters. "
,,"So to find the area of that base, we need to remember how to calculate the area of a rectangle. To do that, we just multiply the two side dimensions together. 4 centimeters times 3 centimeters gives us 12 centimeters squared as the area. Now… to find the volume, we just need to multiply that area by the length that the base was "
,,"extended. Our diagram tells us that distance is 10 centimeters, so if we multiply 12 centimeters squared by 10 centimeters, we get 120 centimeters cubed. So this rectangular prism has a volume of 120 cubic centimeters. Okay, let’s try to find the volume of the triangular prism now. Again, the first step is to calculate the area "
,,"of the base of the prism which is this triangle. The formula for finding the area of a triangle is one-half of the triangle’s base times its height. Be careful not to confuse the base of the triangle with the base of the prism which IS the triangle itself. Our diagram tells us that the base of the triangle is 10 inches and its height is 8 inches, so one-half the base times the height would be one-half of 10 times 8. 10 times 8 is 80, and one-half of 80 is 40, so the area of the triangle is "
,,"40 inches squared. Now all we have to do to find the volume is multiply that area by the length that it was extended. We’re told that the length is 50 inches, so we "
,,"multiple 40 inches squared by 50 inches and we get 2,000 inches cubed. That’s the volume of this prism. Alright, are you ready to try finding the volume of the cylinder now? The cylinder is made by extending a circle, so first we need to calculate the area of that circle. As we learned in a previous video, the area of a circle is found by multiplying pi times its radius squared. The radius of this circle is 2 meters, so if we square that, we get 4 meters squared. Then we multiply by pi (which is approximately 3.14) and we get 12.56 meters squared. Now that we know the area of the circle, to find the volume of the cylinder, we just multiply that area by the length that the circle was extended (which happens to be 10 meters). 10 meters times 12.56 meters squared gives us 125.6 meters cubed. So the volume of this cylinder is 125.6 cubic meters. So, do you see how to find the volume of 3D shapes like these? …shapes that are made by taking a 2D shape an then extending it along a third axis? You just find the area of that shape and then you multiply it by the length that it was extended, and that gives you the volume. And it works for ANY 2D shape… it works for trapezoids, or pentagons, or diamonds, or stars, or hearts… “Man… now that I know how to accurately calculate volumes, playtime is WAY more fun!” "
,,"Of course, not all 3D shapes are made by extending a 2D shape along a third dimension. Some are made by rotating a shape around an axis …like that sphere we saw earlier in the video for instance. One way to form a sphere is to rotate a 2D circle around one of its diameter lines. And another common 3D shape that can be formed by "
,,"rotating a 2D shape around an axis is a cone. A cone can be formed by rotating a right triangle around one of its two perpendicular edges. Since the formulas for finding the volumes of spheres and cones are more complicated to explain, we don’t have time to learn how we arrive at them in this video. So for now, it’s best if you "
,,"just memorize the formulas so you can use them on tests if you need to. To find the volume of a sphere, you use the formula: Volume equals four-thirds times pi times radius cubed. And to find the volume of a cone, you use the formula: Volume equals one-third times height times pi times radius squared. Let’s try one example of each before we wrap up. Here’s a sphere with a radius of 2 centimeters. Fortunately, that’s the only dimension we need to find its volume. Our formula says that the volume of a sphere is equal to: 4/3 x pi x r^3 Cubing the radius mean multiplying it by itself 3 times. So we take 2 cm x 2 cm x 2 cm which equals 8 cm cubed. Next we’ll multiply that by our approximation for pi:  3.14 times 8 is 25.12. And last, we multiply that by four-thirds, which is the same as multiplying by 4 then dividing "
,,"by 3, which gives us a volume of 33.49 centimeters cubed. Now let’s try a cone. To use our formula to find the volume of a cone, we need to know two things: the radius of the circle that forms the base of the cone, and the heigh of the cone (which is similar to the height of a triangle. It’s the distance from the point at the tip of the cone, straight down to the center of the circular base.) The radius of the base of this cone is 3 feet, and its height is 9 feet. So first let’s plug that radius into our equation and square it: 3 feet x 3 feet is 9 feet squared. Next we multiply that by pi (again using 3.14) and we get 28.26 feet squared. You may notice that that’s just the area of the base circle. But now we need to multiply that base area by the one-third times the height of the cone. One-third times 9 feet is 3 feet, and 3 feet times 28.26 square feet gives us 84.78 cubic feet, which is the volume of the cone. Alright…. so now you know a lot about volume. You know that it’s a 3D quantity of geometric objects, and you know that we measure volume with cubic units. You also learned how to calculate the volume of some basic 3D shapes. Of "
,,"course, there’s a lot of other 3D shapes that we didn’t have time to cover in this video, but now you know about some of the most common ones. The key is to put what you’ve learned into practice by trying some exercise problems on your own. As always, thanks for watching Math Antics and I’ll see ya next time.

angles,LGqBQrUYua4,"Hi! Welcome to Math Antics.  In this lesson, we are gonna learn about long division. If you haven’t already watched our video about basic division, then be sure to go back and watch that first. It will make learning long division a lot easier. Long division is just a way of breaking up a bigger division problem into a series of "
,,"short division steps like the ones that we did in the basic division video. The nice thing about long division is that once you know the procedure, you can divide up all kinds of numbers, even if they are REALLY big. The key to long division is to think about our division problem digit-by-digit. If our dividend (the number we’re dividing up) has a lot of digits, then that means that there will be a lot of division steps to do. When we learned basic one-step division, all of the dividends were small enough that we could just use the multiplication table to help us find the answer. But what if we have a division problem like this?  936 divided by 4 936 is definitely NOT on our multiplication table! In fact, there’s not anything even close to 936, so what do we do? Well, instead of trying to divide the entire 936 by "
,,"4 all at once, let’s break this problem up into smaller steps by just trying to divide each digit by 4, one digit at a time …digit-by-digit. Do you remember how with multi-digit multiplication and addition, we always start with the smallest digit (the ones place digit) and we work from right to left? Well division is backwards! "
,," We still go digit by digit, but the other way. We start by trying to divide up the digit in the biggest number place first and we work our way from left to right. So the first step in this problem is to divide the FIRST digit of our dividend by 4. We’ll just ignore the other digits for now, and that makes it look like we have the division problem 9 divided by 4. Great!  That’s easy!  It’s just a basic division problem like in the last video. So we ask, “How many ‘4’s will it take to make 9 or almost 9?” Well, two ‘4’s would be 8, and that’s almost 9. So just like before, we put the 2 in our answer spot on top of the line. But wait a minute… there’s a "
,,"lot of room up there. Where exactly do we put it? Well, the answer digit should always go directly above the digit we’re dividing. Since we’re dividing the digit 9, "
,,"our 2 should go right above the 9. Okay, now we multiply… 2 times 4 is 8, and the 8 goes below the 9 so that we can subtract to get our remainder. 9 minus 8 is 1, so our remainder is 1. Now at this point in our basic one-step division problems, we would re-write our remainder up in our answer with a little ‘r’ next to it. But we aren’t going to do that yet because this is long division and we still have more digits to divide (the ones we’ve been ignoring). Since we’re going digit-by-digit, "
,,"let’s stop ignoring the next digit in our dividend (the 3). Now you might think that our next division step is to divide that 3 by the 4.  But it’s not quite that simple. We had a remainder from our last division step, and we can’t just forget about that. We need to combine that remainder with our next digit and divide them both together. We do that by bringing down a COPY of the next digit (the 3) and put it right beside the remainder (which is 1). When we do that, it looks like our remainder is 13.  It’s kind of like our remainder is teaming up with the next digit over. And if you think about it, that makes sense because the digits that we were ignoring during our first division step really are part of the remainder, because we still need to divide them. Okay, so bringing down that next digit makes our remainder bigger. And that’s good because before, the remainder was so small that 4 couldn’t divide into it. But now it’s 13, and 4 will divide into 13. So we ask, “How many "
,,"‘4’s will it take to make 13?” Well, three ‘4’s would be 12, and that’s really close without being too big.  So let’s put 3 in our answer line. Yep - it goes right over the 3 because that is the next digit we were dividing in this digit-by-digit process. And then 3 times 4 is 12 which we put right below the 13 so that we can subtract to get the next remainder which will also be 1. See how we’re just repeating the basic division procedure?  But we’re going further down the screen as we do. Alright, now that we have a new remainder, it’s time for our next division step. Let’s stop ignoring the last digit in the dividend (the 6) and bring down a copy of it to team up with our new remainder. Together, they form a remainder of 16. Ah ha!  That’s good because it’s gonna be easy to divide 4 into 16 because 16 is a multiple of 4. It takes exactly fours ‘4’s to make 16.  So we put a 4 in the last place of our answer line, and then we write the 16 below our new remainder. Now if we subtract 16 from 16, we see that our last remainder will be zero, which means there’s no remainder left. That’s great!  We solved the whole division problem digit-by-digit by breaking it up into three basic division steps. And now we know that 936 divided by 4 equals 234. And we also know why they call it long division!! In fact, that was so long, I think I need a coffee break… Oh man… that was some looooooooooooong division! Wheew… let’s see… Okay, so that problem had a three-digit dividend and it also had three division steps. But the number of steps isn’t always the same as the number of digits we have. And that’s because the number of steps also depends on how big our divisor is. To see what I mean, let’s work two division problems side by side. These both look like the basic one-step division problems that you did in the last video, don’t they? But as you‘ll see, one of them is actually a two-step problem. Let’s start with the first problem: 72 divided by 8. We just ask, “How many ‘8’s does it take to make 72 (or almost 72)?” Well that’s easy!  On our multiplication table you can see that 72 is a multiple of 8. 8 × 9 = 72  So we put 9 "
,,"in our answer line, and we write 72 below, and we see that we have no remainder. Now let’s try the next problem: 72 divided by 3. If we ask, “How many ‘3’s will it take to make 72 (or almost 72)?”, we can see that the answer is not on our multiplication chart. The biggest multiple of three listed there is 30 which isn’t even close. The reason is that this should really be a two-step problem. Let’s try using the new digit-by-digit method we just learned. Instead of asking, “How many ‘3’s make 72?”, let’s just focus on the first digit and ask, “How many ‘3’s does it take to make 7?” Ah - that’s easy.  Two ‘3’s would give us 6, which is very close. So let’s put a 2 in the answer line right above the 7. Then we multiply 2 times 3, and that makes 6. And we subtract 6 from 7 to get a remainder of 1. Now for the second step… We bring down a copy of the next digit (the 2) and we combine it with the 1 to get a new remainder of 12. Then we ask, “How many ‘3’s does it take to make 12?” "
,,"and the answer to that is exactly 4. So we write a 4 in the answer line, and 3 × 4 = 12. 12 ? 12 = 0  So we have no remainder! We’re done!  72 divided by 3 is 24. Now here’s the interesting thing about these examples. The first problem could have been a two-step problem also. If we had taken it digit-by-digit, we would have first asked, “How many ‘8’s does it take to make 7 (or almost 7)?” But the answer would have been zero since 8 is too big to divide into 7. We would have put zero in our answer line and the remainder would have just been 7. So basically, we just skipped that step.  And that’ll happen with digit-by-digit division sometimes. If the number is too small to divide into, you just put a zero in the answer line and you move on to the next digit. Okay, now that you know the procedure for long division, "
,,"are you ready to see a really long problem? Good - I thought so! Let’s divide 315,270 by 5. Now don’t worry… it’s really not that hard if you just go digit-by-digit. I’m gonna work the problem pretty fast, so don’t worry if you don’t follow all the math. Just focus on the repeating division process as we go along.  Are you ready? The first digit is 3.  How many times will 5 divide into 3?  Zero. 5 is too big. So let’s just skip that step and combine our first digit with our next digit. So how many times does 5 divide into 31?  Six. 6 times 5 is 30.  And 31 minus 30 gives us a remainder of 1. Now on to the third digit…  We bring a copy of it down to join with the remainder. And we ask how many times will 5 divide into 15?  Three. 3 times 5 is 15. And 15 minus 15 is zero. On to the next digit… Now even though our previous remainder was zero, we still bring down a copy of the next digit. Now we ask how many times will 5 divide into 2?  Zero. 5 is too big, so we need to move on to the next digit and bring a copy of it down also. There, that’s better. Now we ask, how many times will 5 divide into 27?  Five. 5 times 5 is 25.  And 27 minus 25 gives a remainder of 2. …now for that last digit, which is a zero. And you might wonder, “Why do we even have to bring a copy of a zero down?  Isn’t that nothing?” But the zero is an important place holder… and when we bring a copy of it down, it changes our remainder of 2 into a remainder of 20.  Now that’s a big difference! Now we ask, how many times will 5 divide into 20?  Four. 4 times 5 is 20. And 20 minus 20 is zero. Yes!  We’re done!  There’s no more digits to divide. And you can see "
,,"that our final answer is:  63,054. Alright… that’s the procedure for long division. As you can see, it’s kinda complicated, so don’t get discouraged if you’re confused at first. Like almost everything, it just takes practice. So, as you get ready to practice some long division problems on your own, here’s a few tips that will help you out. First: If you haven’t already done it, memorizing your multiplication table will really help with division. Second: When you’re working problems, it’s really important to write neatly and stay organized. If your writing is messy, it might be hard to keep your columns lined up and that could lead to mistakes. And if that’s the case, try using graph paper to help keep things lined up. Third: Start with some smaller two or three-digit dividends so you only have a few division steps to do. Then work up to the longer problems. And last of all: After each practice problem you do, check your answer with a calculator. That will let you know right away if you’ve made any mistakes so you can correct them, and most importantly, learn from them. And it will give you practice with a calculator, which is also important. Alright, that’s all for this lesson. Thanks for watching Math Antics, and I’ll see ya next time. Learn more at www.mathantics.com"

angles,xCdxURXMdFY,"Hi, welcome to Math Antics. In our last geometry video, we learned that "
,,"all 2-dimensional shapes have a 1-dimensional quantity called Perimeter which is basically the outline of the shape. In this video, we're going to learn that these shapes also have a 2-dimensional quantity called Area. To help you understand what Area is, let's start by imagining a line that's 1 cm long. Now, let's imagine moving that line in a perpendicular direction a distance of 1 cm. But while we move it, it leaves a trail… almost like the end of a paint brush. By moving the 1-dimensional line that way, we formed a 2-dimensional shape, and all of the space (or surface) that we covered along the way is the Area of that shape. …which as you can see here is just a square. Ok, but how much area does this square have? Well, our original line was 1 cm long, and we moved it a distance of 1 cm, so we could say that this shape is a square centimeter. Just like a centimeter is a basic unit for measuring length, a square centimeter is a basic unit for measurement for area. But there are other units for area too. For example, instead of a centimeter, what if our line had been a meter long, and then we moved it 1 meter? The area we'd have gotten "
,,"would be 1 square meter! Or, what if it was a mile long, and we moved it a mile!?  We'd have a square mile of area. So, just like with perimeter, the units of measurement are very important when we're talking about area! Alright, so that gives you a good idea of what area is, but how do we calculate area mathematically? Well, there's some special math formulas (or equations) that we can use to find the area of different shapes. In this video, we're going to learn the formula for squares and rectangles and the formula for triangles. To find the area of any square or rectangle, all we have to do is multiply its two side dimensions together. They're usually called the length and the width, so the formula looks like this: Area equals length times width. But it's often written with just the first letters of each word as abbreviations: ‘A’ for Area, ‘L’ for Length and ‘W’ for Width. So let's see if that formula works for our original square centimeter. If we multiply the length (1 "
,,"cm) times the width (1 cm), what do we get? Well, 1 x 1 is just 1, but what about cm x cm? Cm x cm just gives us square centimeters, which we can write like this using a '2' as an exponent. We read this as ""centimeters squared""  and it's just a shorter way of writing cm x cm. So whenever you see units like centimeters squared, or inches squared, or meters squared, or miles squared, you know it's a measurement of the 2-dimensional quantity area. Ok, our formula (area equals length times width) worked for our square. Now let's see if it works for a rectangle. Here's a rectangle that's 4 cm wide"
,,"and 2 cm long (or tall) First, we plug the length and width into our formula (2 cm and 4 cm) Then we just multiply… 2 x 4 equals 8 and cm x cm is cm squared. So, according to our formula, the area of this rectangle is 8 centimeters squared. And we can see that's correct if we bring back our original square centimeter. If we make copies of it, you can see that exactly 8 of those square centimeters would be the same area as this rectangle. Great, let's try our formula on one more rectangle. This rectangle is 2 cm long but only half a centimeter wide. And our formula (area equals length times width) tells us that we just need to multiply those two sides together to get our area. Two times one-half equals one. So this rectangle is also 1 square centimeter. How can it be a square centimeter?"
,,"It's not even a square! Ah - but just because a shape takes up 1 square centimeter of area, that doesn’t mean it has to be a square shape. It just means that the total area would be equal (or the same) as a square centimeter. You can see that if we break the rectangle in half and rearrange it, then it would form a square. In fact, we can use square units (like square centimeters) to measure ANY area, no matter what the shape is. It could be a rectangle, a triangle, a circle"
,,"or ANY other 2-dimensional shape. Okay, now that you know how to find the area of any square or rectangle using our formula, we're going to learn the formula for finding the area of any triangle. But to do that, we're going to start with a rectangle again. The dimensions of this rectangle are 3 m by 4 m. So… what's it's area? Well, using our formula,  we know that the area would be 3 m x 4 m which is 12 meters squared. But now, what if we were to cut this rectangle exactly in half along a diagonal line from opposite corners? It forms two triangles! And because each of these triangles is exactly half of the rectangle, that means that the area of either "
,,"triangle must be exactly half of the area of the rectangle. We already calculated that the area of the entire rectangle is 12 meters squared, so the area of this triangle must be 6 meters squared, and the area of this triangle must be 6 meters squared, since 6 is half of 12. Ah ha!  So the formula for the area of a triangle should just be half of the rectangle. So does that mean that instead of, ""Area equals length times width"" , it should be, ""Area equals one-half of length times width"" ? "
,,"Yep!  That's basically it, but with one important difference. Instead of 'L' for Length and 'W' for Width, we're going to use two different names for our triangle's "
,,"dimensions. We're going to call them ""Base"" and ""Height"""
,,"and here's why. The names ""Length"" and ""Width"" worked okay for this right triangle because a right triangle is exactly half of a rectangle. But those names don't really work for other kinds of triangles like acute triangles or obtuse triangles. Because how do you tell which side should be which? So for triangles, we do something different. First we choose one of the three sides to be the ""Base"". It doesn't really matter which side you choose, and in a lot of math problems, the base will already be chosen for you. Once we decide which side the base is, we imagine setting the triangle down on the ground so that its base is flat on the ground, like this… "
,,"Next, we find the highest point of the triangle, which is the vertex that's not touching the ground. From that point, we draw a line straight down to the ground. The line we draw must be perpendicular with the ground. The length of that line (from the tip of the triangle to the ground) is called the ""height"" of the triangle. Oh, and some people call the height of a triangle the ""altitude"" which makes a lot of sense if you pretend that your triangle is a tiny little mountain. Sometimes the height line is inside the triangle, like with an acute triangle. And sometimes it's outside the triangle, like with a obtuse triangle. And sometimes,"
,,"it lines up exactly with one of the triangle's sides, like with right triangles. But no matter where it is, the formula for finding the area of ANY triangle is the same: Area equals one-half base times height. So, if we know those two measurements (base and height), we can just plug them into the formula to calculate the area. At first, you might not see how the same formula could work for all three types of triangles, but watch this… Here's an acute triangle and this box is one-half its base times its height. If we cut our triangle up, you can see that it fits perfectly inside that area. But wait, there's more! Here's an obtuse triangle with a box that's one-half its base times its height. Again, if we cut up the triangle, . it fits perfectly inside the box Now you can see how the formula, area equals one-half base times height, works for ANY kind of triangle. Okay, we already figured out that the area of this right triangle was 6 square meters, so let's practice using our new formula to calculate the area of these last two triangles. Our diagram shows that the base of this acute triangle is 5 m and it's height is 8 m. So we plug those "
,,"values into our formula for area and we get area equals one-half of 5 times 8. 5 times 8 is forty and one-half of 40 is 20, so the area of this triangle is 20 meters squared. Don't forget that the units of measurement for area will always be square units! Okay, that was pretty simple.  Let's try our last example. The diagram of "
,,"this obtuse triangle tells us that the base is 4 inches, and the height is 7 inches, so let's plug those values into our formula. We end up with the equation: area equals one-half of 4 times 7. 4 times 7 would be 28, and then we can calculate what one-half of 28 would be by dividing by 2. 28 divided by 2 is 14, so the area of this obtuse triangle must be 14 square inches. Okay, now you know all the basics of area. You know that area is a 2-dimensional quantity that we measure in square units. You've learned the formula for calculating the area of any square or rectangle: ""Area equals length times width"". And, you've learned the formula for calculating "
,,"the area of any triangle: ""Area equals one-half of the base times height"". But… don't forget to practice what you've learned by working some problems on your own. That's how you really get good at math! As always, thanks for watching Math Antics,"

angles,uyS1cXrsgIg,"Hey, this is Presh Talwalkar. Here's a math problem that's stumping the Internet right now. This question was asked to 5th graders in China: ''If a ship had 26 sheep and 10 goats aboard, how old is the ship's captain?'' This problem has gotten a lot of media coverage, and I even covered it in a previous video, But we all missed "
,,"the real story. This problem was actually devised by French researchers nearly 40 years ago! And it does teach a valuable lesson about math class. So in this video, "
,,"I'm gonna go over the REAL story, that no media outlet has covered so far. Before I get to that, I want to quickly go over the media coverage, and what some possible answers have been proposed. So this problem really got coverage around the world. From the South China Morning Post, from RT, from the BBC, from the Washington Post and even in Newsweek. The media coverage focused on solving the problem. The most sensible answer I saw, that was quoted in the BBC, comes from one Weiho commenter "
,,"who writes: ''The total weight of 26 sheep and 10 goat is 7,700 kilograms, based on the average weight of each animal.'' Now I did a little bit of fact-checking; you would actually get 7,700 POUNDS, if you did this search in Wolfram Alpha, but, let's just forget this little nitpick and go with 7,700 kilograms, so continuing that response: ''In China, if you're driving a ship that has more than 5,000 kilograms of cargo, you need to have possessed a boat license for at least five years. The minimum age for getting a boat's license is 23, so [the captain is] at least 28.'' That's a remarkable leap in logic. But if it sounds too crazy for you, keep in mind that these kinds of deductions are very common in Sherlock Holmes stories. Take an example from ''The Hound of the Baskervilles''. From examining a walking stick of a man he has NEVER met, Sherlock Holmes deduces the man is under 30 years old, is a family doctor and that he owns a dog. So, the official response in China, is that the question was not a mistake. It was actually meant to be open ended and encourage critical thinking, which is usually not present in Math class. That would be the end of the story, except this problem did NOT have its source in China. The real story is the problem was originally asked by French researchers in 1979. This problem is nearly 40 years old! I learned about the problem's origin from Benjamin Dickman, who has a PhD in Mathematics Education from Columbia University. Benjamin heard about the problem, because he believes that many people in math education have heard about this problem in similar problems, and he tweeted about it. You could check out his Twitter profile twitter.com/benjamindickman So from the sources that he tweeted and sent, we can actually find, in 1979, French researchers asked first "
,,"and second graders the following problem: ""On the boat, there are 26 sheep and 10 goats. What is the age of the captain?"" I couldn't believe it when I was seeing this! This problem has been asked nearly 40 YEARS AGO in ALMOST EXACTLY the same wording! So what was the point of this exercise? Well, from reading some of these sources, the researchers had expected that most students would think the question is absurd. The correct answer would have to be ""there is not enough information"", But what they found was shocking. More than 3/4 of students actually tried to solve the problem by manipulating the numbers. They said something like ''Okay, the age must "
,,"be 26 plus 10, which equals 36."" Very few students questioned if the problem was even solvable. In fact, this was not just a fluke result. The study was replicated on a larger scale in countries including France, Germany and Switzerland, even by researchers, who thought this was not even possible. They were antagonistic to this "
,,"hypothesis that students would just manipulate numbers, and they found the same thing. Gene Wirchenko emailed me about this related problem. His blog has math and logic problems, usually simpler than mine, and it has other posts. You can visit his blog at genew.ca So, the related question is the following: ""There are 125 sheep and five dogs in a flock. How old is the shepherd?"" Well once again, you would expect the ''correct'' answer, that ""there is not enough information"" to solve the problem. But, researchers found shocking results again! Many students produced answers by manipulating the numbers in the question. One student reasoned along the following lines: ""Well, 125 plus 5 equals 130. That's too old of an age and 125 minus 5 equals 120, that's also too old of an age. But 125 divided by 5 equals 25 sounds about right.'' So, the student concluded the shepherd is 25 years old. So, what's the lesson in all of this? The so-called ''Chinese'' test question, that went viral was REALLY a French research question from nearly 40 years ago. For such an absurd question, the correct answer is that ''there is not enough information'' I give credit to the school in China for asking this question. We still need to improve the critical thinking skills of students in math class. We still keep thinking that every problem we get is solvable, and it should be solvable just by manipulating the numbers we get We should always think ''Does the question actually make sense?'' and '' Is there enough information to solve it?'' So that's the real story to this viral math question from China. Thanks for watching this video. Please subscribe to "

angles,WqhlG3Vakw8,"Hi, I’m Rob.  Welcome to Math Antics! In this lesson, we’re gonna learn about The Pythagorean Theorem or Pythagoras’ Theorem as it’s sometimes called. And you may be wondering, “What’s a Theorem?” and “Who in the world is Pythagoras?” Well, in math, a theorem is simply a statement that has been proven to be true from other things that are either known or accepted to be true. And Pythagoras… well, he was this really smart dude who lived a long time ago in ancient Greece and he proved the theorem.  [Applause] Well… historians aren’t completely sure it was actually Pythagoras that proved it. It could have been one of his students or followers, but he usually gets credit for it. Anyway, the main thing that you need to know is that the Pythagorean Theorem describes an important geometric relationship between the three "
,,"sides of a right triangle. We’re gonna learn what that relationship is in just a minute, but first there's several things that you’ll need to know before you can truly understand the Pythagorean Theorem or use it to solve problems. First of all, to understand the Pythagorean Theorem you need to know about angles and triangles, and you also need to know a little bit about exponents and square roots. So if those topics are new to you, be sure to watch our videos about them first. And second, "
,,"even though the Pythagorean Theorem is about geometry, you’ll need to know some basic algebra to actually use it. Specifically, you’ll need to know about variables and how to solve basic algebraic equations that involve exponents. We cover a lot of those topics in the first five videos of our Algebra Basics series. Okay, now that you’ve got all that background info covered, let’s see what the Pythagorean Theorem actually says. The theorem can be stated in several different ways, but the one we like best goes like this: For a right triangle with legs ‘a’ and ‘b’ and hypotenuse ‘c’, ‘a squared’ plus ‘b squared’ equals ‘c squared’. As you can see from this definition, the Pythagorean Theorem doesn’t apply to ALL triangles. It ONLY applies to RIGHT triangles. As you know, right triangles always include one right angle that’s usually marked with the square ‘right-angle-symbol’ to help you identify it. And you need to know which angle is the right angle because it helps you identify an important side of the triangle called the hypotenuse. The hypotenuse is the longest side of a right triangle and it’s always the side that’s ‘opposite’ of the right angle. In other words, it’s the side that doesn't touch (or help form) the right angle itself. In order to use the Pythagorean Theorem, you need to be able to identify the hypotenuse because that’s what the variable ‘c’ stands for in theorem. ’c’ is the length of the hypotenuse side. The other two sides of the triangle (the ones that DO touch or form the right angle) are called its “legs”. Our Pythagorean Theorem definition uses the variable names ‘a’ and ‘b’ to represent their lengths. Oh… and it does’t matter which leg is called ‘a’ and which leg is called ‘b’ as long as you keep track of which is which after you make your initial choice. Okay, "
,,"now that we know the various parts of the Pythagorean Theorem, let’s think about what the relationship or equation ('a squared' plus 'b squared' equals 'c squared') "
,,"is really telling us. It’s telling us that if we take the lengths of the two legs (sides ‘a’ and ‘b’) and ‘square’ them, which means multiplying them by themselves, "
,,"(‘a squared’ is ‘a’ times ‘a’ and ‘b squared’ is ‘b’ times ‘b’) …and then if we add those two ‘squared amounts’ together, they will EQUAL the amount you’d get if you ‘square’ the hypotenuse side (which would be ‘c squared’ or c times c) That may sound a little confusing at first. So let’s take a look at a special example of a right triangle that will help the Pythagorean Theorem make a little more sense. This right triangle is called a “3, 4, 5 triangle” because its sides have relative lengths of 3, 4, and 5. And by “relative lengths”, I mean that the units of length don’t really matter. The sides could be expressed in ANY units (inches, meters, miles, whatever…) So the triangle could be of any size as long as its lengths would have the proportions 3, 4, and 5 relative to each other. Starting with the side that’s "
,,"3 units long, which we’ll call “side a” what do we get if we square that side? Well in arithmetic, squaring 3 mean multiplying 3 times 3 which equals 9. And the geometric equivalent of squaring something actually results in a square shape. As you can see, this square contain 9 unit squares. So this red area represents the value "
,,"‘a’ squared in the Pythagorean Theorem. Next let’s look at the side that’s 4 units long, which we’ll call “side b”. Squaring 4 means multiplying 4 times 4 which is 16. Again, the geometric equivalent of that is a literal square that is 4 units on each side and covers a total area of 16 units. So this blue area represent ‘b squared' in the Pythagorean Theorem. And finally, let’s deal with the hypotenuse, or “side c”, which is the longest side. It’s 5 units long.  Squaring 5 means multiplying 5 times 5 which is 25, and the geometric equivalent is a 5 by 5 square that has an area of 25 units. So this green area represents ‘c squared’ in the Pythagorean Theorem. Now that you can see how the arithmetic parts of the Pythagorean Theorem are related to the geometric parts of this right triangle, let’s check to see if the "
,,"Pythagorean Theorem is really true (at least in this special case). On the arithmetic side, if you add up the amounts ‘a squared’ and ‘b squared’, they really DO equal ‘c squared’ because 9 + 16 = 25. And… with a little rearranging of our unit squares, you can see that the area of the squares formed by the two legs really does equal the area of the square formed by the hypotenuse. Wow, those ancient greek dudes really were smart! Okay, but I know what some of you are thinking… “That’s cool "
,,"’n all, but… why should I even care about the Pythagorean Theorem? What’s it good for?” Well, as always, that’s a good question. And the answer is, like many things "
,,"in math, the Pythagorean Theorem is a useful tool that can help you use what you DO know to figure out what you DON’T know. Specifically, if you have a right triangle but you only know how long two of its sides are, the Pythagorean Theorem tells you how to figure out the length of the third unknown side. For example, imagine that you have a right triangle that’s 2 cm long on this side and 3 cm long on this side, but we don’t know how long the hypotenuse is. No problemo! The Pythagorean Theorem tells us the relationship between all three sides of ANY right triangle, so we can figure it out. We know that 'a squared' plus 'b squared' equals 'c squared' so let’s plug what we DO know into that equation and then solve it for what we DON’T know. Again, it doesn’t matter which of the two legs is called ‘a’ or ‘b’ so let’s just label them like this and then substitute ‘2’ for ‘a’ and ‘3’ for ‘b’ in the Pythagorean Theorem equation. That gives us an algebraic equation that has just one unknown, ‘c’. If we solve this equation for ‘c’… in other words, if we re-arrange the equation so that ‘c’ is all by itself on one side of the equal sign, then we’ll know exactly what ‘c’ is. We’ll know the length of that side of the triangle. First, we need to simplify the left side of the equation since it contains the known "
,,"numbers. And according to the order of operations, we need to simplify the exponents first. ‘2 squared’ is 4 and ‘3 squared’ is 9. Then, we add those results (4 + 9 "
,,"= 13) and we have the equation 13 = ‘c squared’ which is the same as ‘c squared’ = 13. Then, to get ‘c’ all by itself, we need to do the inverse of what’s being done to it. Since it’s being squared, the inverse operation is the square root, so we need to take the square root of both sides. Taking the square root of 'c squared' just gives us ‘c’ which is what we want on this side of the equation, but it gives us a little problem on the other side because it’s not easy to figure out what the "
,,"square root of 13 is. It’s not a perfect square so it’s going to be a decimal, and probably an irrational number. But that’s okay because it’s fine to just leave our answer as the ‘square root of 13’ Sure, you could use a calculator to get the decimal value if you really need one, but in math it’s very common to just leave square roots alone unless they're easy to simplify. So the sides of this right triangle are, 2 cm, 3 cm and the ‘square root of 13’ cm. Let’s try another example. For this right triangle, we know the length of the hypotenuse (6 m), and one of the legs (4 m), but the length of the other leg is unknown. So let’s use the Pythagorean Theorem to find that unknown length. As usual, we call the hypotenuse “side c”. And let’s call the leg we know “side a” and the leg we don’t know “side b”. Then we can "
,,"substitute the known values into the Pythagorean Theorem and solve for the unknown value. Replacing the ‘c’ with 6 and the ‘a’ with 4 gives us the equation, ‘4 squared’ plus ‘b squared’ equals ‘6 squared’, which we need to simplify and solve for ‘b’. First let’s simplify the exponents. ‘4 squared’ is 16, and ‘6 squared’ is 36. Now we need to isolate the ‘b squared’ and we can do that by subtracting 16 from both sides of the equation. On this side, the (+16) and the (-16) leave us with just "
,,"‘b squared’. And on the other side we have 36 minus 16 which is 20. We can now solve this simplified equation for ‘b’ by taking the square root of both sides which gives us ‘b’ equals the ‘square root of 20’. Again, it’s fine to leave your answer as a square root like this. And some of you may know that the ‘square root of 20’ can be simplified to ‘2 times the square root of 5’. We’re not going to worry about simplifying roots in this video, but if you know how to do it, awesome! If you don’t know, just leave the answer as the ‘square root of 20’ meters. Here’s another interesting one. What if you have a ‘unit square’ that's cut in half along a diagonal. Each side of the square is 1 unit long, but how far is it from one corner of the square to the other along the diagonal? Well, since the diagonal divides the square into two right triangles, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to tell us that unknown distance. We label the legs of the right triangle ‘a’ and ‘b’ and the hypotenuse ‘c’. And since we know that ‘a’ and ‘b’ are both 1, we can plug those values into the Pythagorean Theorem equation which gives us us ‘1 squared’ plus ‘1 squared’ equals ‘c squared’. Now we solve for ‘c’. ‘1 squared’ is just 1 so this left side of this equation simplifies to 1 plus 1 which is just 2. That means ‘c squared’ equals 2 and if we take the square root of both sides, we get ‘c’ equals the ‘square root of 2’. So that’s how far it is across the diagonal of the unit square. Okay, "
,,"so that’s how you use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of an unknown side of a right triangle, which is its most common use. But there’s another way that you can use the Pythagorean Theorem that I want to mention. You can also use the Pythagorean Theorem to TEST a triangle to see if it truly is a RIGHT triangle Ya know… in case you’re not already sure. For example, what if someone shows you this triangle and asks, “Is this a right triangle?”. Well, it looks a lot like a right triangle but it does’t have a right angle symbol, and it would be kinda hard to tell if this angle is exactly 90 degrees just by looking at it. Maybe it’s really close to 90, like 89.5 degrees. No worries, the Pythagorean Theorem can tell us for sure, if we know the lengths of all three sides of the triangle. If we know those lengths (a, b and c), then we can just plug them into the Pythagorean Theorem equation to see if it holds true. In this particular case, since the two shorter sides are each 3 cm and the longest side is 4 cm, we can plug those values in for ‘a’, ‘b’ and ‘c’ and simplify to see what we get. ‘3 squared’ is 9, so on this side of the equation we get 9 plus 9 which is 18. And on the other side we have ‘4 squared’, which is 16. Uh oh… that doesn’t look right! Our equation simplified to 18 equals 16, which is definitely NOT a true statement. That means that the three sides of this triangle do not work in the Pythagorean Theorem… they don’t fit the relationship 'a squared' plus 'b squared' equals 'c squared' And since the Pythagorean Theorem tells us that ALL right triangle fit that relationship, this triangle must not be a RIGHT triangle. Alright…. so now you know what the Pythagorean Theorem is and you know how to use it. You can use it to find a missing side of any right triangle, and you can also use it to test a triangle to see if it qualifies as a right triangle. But as you can see, it takes a lot of other math skills to be able to use the Pythagorean Theorem effectively, so you may need to brush up on some of those skills before you’re ready to try using it on your own. And remember, you can’t get good at "
,,"math just by watching videos about it. You actually need to practice solving real math problems. As always, thanks for watching Math Antics and I’ll see ya next time. Learn more at www.mathantics.com"

angles,NybHckSEQBI,"Hi! This is Rob. Welcome to Math Antics. In this lesson, we're going to learn some really important things about a whole branch of math called Algebra. The first thing you need to know is that Algebra is a lot like arithmetic. It follows all the rules of arithmetic and it uses the same four main operations that arithmetic is built on: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. But Algebra introduces a new element... the element of the unknown. When you were learning arithmetic, the only thing that was ever unknown was the answer to the problem. For example, you might have the problem 1 + 2 = what? The answer isn't known until you go ahead and "
,,"do the arithmetic. Now the important thing about Algebra is that when we don't know what a number is yet, we use a symbol in its place. that symbol is usually just any letter of the alphabet. A really popular letter to choose is the letter 'x'. So in arithmetic, we would just leave the problem like this: 1 + 2 = ""blank"" and we'd write in the answer when we did the addition. But in Algebra, we'd write it like this:  1 + 2 = x The 'x' is a place holder that stands for the number that we don't know yet. What we have here is a very basic algebraic equation. An equation is just a mathematical statement that two things are equal. An equation says, ""the things on this side of the equal sign have the same value as the things on the other side of the equal sign."" In this case, our equation is telling us that the known values on this side (1+2) are equal to what's on the other side, which happens to be the unknown value that we are calling 'x'. One of the main goals in Algebra is to figure out what the unknown values in equations are. And when you do that, it's called ""solving the equations"". In this equation, it's pretty easy to see that the unknown value is just 3. All you have to do is actually add the 1 and 2 together on this side of the equation and it turns into 3 = x, which is the same as x = 3. So now we know what 'x' is!  It's just 3. That almost seems too easy, doesn’t it? And that's why in Algebra, you are usually given an equation in a more complicated form like this: x - 2 = 1. This is exactly the same equation as 1 + 2 = x, but it has been rearranged so that it's not quite as easy to tell what 'x' is. So in Algebra, solving equations is a lot like a game where you are given mixed-up, complicated equations, and it's your job to simplify them and rearrange them until it is a nice simple equation (like x = 3) where it's easy to tell what the unknown values are. We're going to learn a lot more about how you actually do that (how you solve equations) in the next several videos, but for now, let's learn some important rules about how symbols can and can't be used in algebraic equations. The first rule you need to know is that the same symbol (or letter) can be used in different algebra problems to stand for different unknown values. For example, in the problem we just solved, the letter 'x' was used to stand for the number 3, right? But 'x' could stand for a different number in a different problem. Like, if someone asks us to solve the equation, 5 + x = 10. In order for the two sides of this equation to be equal, 'x' must have the value '5' in this problem, because 5 + 5 = 10. So 'x' (or any other symbol) can stand for different values in different problems. That's okay, but what's NOT okay is for a symbol to stand for different values in the same problem at the same time! For example, what if you had the equation: x + x = 10? This equation says that if we add 'x' to 'x' we will get 10. And there are a lot of different numbers we could add together to get 10, like 6 and 4. But, if we had the first 'x' stand for 6 and the second 'x' stand for 4, then 'x' would stand for two different value at the same time and things could get really confusing! If you wanted symbols to stand for two different numbers at the same time, you would need to use two different symbols, like 'x' and 'y'. So in Algebra, whenever you see the same symbol repeated more than once in an equation, it's representing the same unknown value. Like if you see a really complicated Algebraic equation (like this), where 'x' is repeated a lot of different times, all of those 'x's stand for the same value, and it will be your job to figure out what that value is. Okay, so for any particular equation, we can't use the same letter to represent two different numbers at the same time, but what about the other way around? Could we use two different letters to represent the same number? Yes! - Here's an example of that. Let's say you have the equation: a + b = 2 What could 'a' and 'b' stand for so that the equation is true? Well, If 'a' was 0 and 'b' was 2, then the equation would be true. Or, we could switch them around. If 'a' was 2 and 'b' was 0, the equation would also be true. But there's another possibility: If 'a' was 1 and 'b' was also 1, that would make the equation true, right? So, even though 'a' and 'b' are different symbols, and would usually be used to represent different numbers, there are times when they might happen to represent the same number. Oh, and this problem can help us understand something very important about how symbols are used in Algebra. Did you notice that there were different possible solution for this equation? In other words, 'b' could have the value 0, 1, or 2 depending on what the value of 'a' was. If 'a' is 0 then 'b' must be 2 If 'a' is 1 then 'b' must be 1 If 'a' is 2 then 'b' must be 0 'b' can't have two different values at the same time, but it's value can change over time if the value of 'a' changes. In Algebra, 'b' is what's called a ""variable"" because it's value can 'vary' or change. In fact, in this equation, both 'a' and 'b' are variables because their values will change depending on the value of each other. Actually, it's really common in Algebra to refer to any letter as a variable, "
,,"since letters can stand for different values in different problems. But at Math Antics, we'll usually just use the word ""variable"" when we're talking about values that can change or vary in the same problem. Alright, so far we've learned that Algebra is a lot like arithmetic, but that in includes unknown values and variables that we can solve for in equations. There's one other really important thing that I want to teach you that will help you understand what's going on in a lot of Algebra "
,,"problems, and it has to do with multiplication. Here are the four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Although in Algebra, you'll usually see division written in fraction form, like this. In Arithmetic, all four operations have the same status, but in Algebra, multiplication get's some special treatment. In Algebra, multiplication is the 'default' operation. That means, if no other arithmetic operation is shown between two symbols, then you can just assume they're being multiplied. The multiplication is 'implied'. For example, instead of writing 'a' times 'b', you can leave out the times symbol and just write 'ab'. Since no operation is shown between these two symbols, you know that you're supposed to multiply 'a' and 'b'. Of course, you can't actually multiply 'a' and "
,,"'b' until you figure out what numbers they stand for. The advantage of this rule about multiplication is that it makes many algebraic equations less cluttered and easier to write down. For example, instead of this: a * b + c * d = 10 You could just write: ab + cd = 10. You can also use this shorthand when you are multiplying a variable and a known number... like 2x, which means the same thing as 2 times 'x' or 3y which means the same thing as 3 times 'y' Since the symbol and the number are "
,,"right next to each other, the multiplication is implied. You don't have to write it down. Finally some good news! Now I never have to write down that pesky multiplication symbol again! Oh yeah!! Ah, not so fast... there are some cases in Algebra where still need to use a multiplication symbol. For example, what if you want to show 2 x 5? If you just get rid of the times symbol and put the '2' right next to the '5', it's going to look like the two-digit number twenty-five, which is NOT the same as 2 x 5. So, whenever you need to show multiplication between two known numbers, you still have to use the times symbol, unless... you use parentheses instead. "
,,"But aren't parentheses used to show grouping in math? How can you use that to show multiplication? Ah, that's a good question. Parentheses are used to group things, "
,,"but whenever you put two groups right next to each other, with no operation between them, guess what operation is implied. Yep!  Multiplication! For example, if you "
,,"see the this, it means that the group (a+b) is being multiplied by the group (x+y). We could put a times symbol between the groups, but we don't have to because it's the default operation in Algebra. The multiplication is just implied. So, going back to our problem: 2 x 5 If you wanted to, you could put each of the numbers inside parentheses like this, and then you could get rid of the multiplication sign. Now this can't be confused with the number twenty-five, and since the groups are right next to each other, you know that you need to multiply them. Of course, it might seem strange to have just one thing inside 'group' symbols like this, but it's okay to do that in math. An alternate way that you could do the same thing would be to put just one of the numbers in parentheses, like this. Again, you won't confuse this with a two-digit number and you know that multiplication is implied. Okay, so we've learned that Algebra is a lot like arithmetic, but it involves unknown values or variables that we need to solve for. And we learned that in Algebra, the multiplication sign is usually not shown, because it's the default operation. You can just assume that two things right next to each other are being multiplied. But why do we even care about Algebra? Is it good for anything in the 'real world'? or is it just a bunch of tricky problems that keep students busy in school? Actually, Algebra is very useful for describing or ""modeling""  things in the real world. It's a little hard to see that when you are just looking at all these numbers and symbols on the page of a math book. But, it's a lot easier to see when you start taking algebraic equations and graphing their solutions. Graphing an equation is like using its different solutions to draw simple lines and curves that can be used to describe and predict things in real life. For example, there's a whole class of equations in Algebra called ""linear"" equations because they form straight lines when you graph them. Those sorts of equations could help you describe the slope of a roof or tell you how long it will take to get somewhere. Another class of algebraic equations, called ""quadratic"" equations can be used to design telescope lenses, or describe how a ball flies through the air, or predict the growth of a population. So Algebra is used all the time in fields like science, engineering, economics and computer programming. And even though you might not need Algebra to get by in your day to "
,,"day life,... ...so divide both sides by 3. That means x = 42. So... in three... two... one... YES!! Alright... now to see how much butter I need. It's still a very useful part of math. Thanks for watching Math Antics,"

angles,L-jh5fVhKuQ,to understand the types of angles we need to understand just one simple diagram consider array or a we know that if this ray is rotated completely once it covers 360 degrees all the different angles which lie in between 0 and 360 degrees are classified into types there are two kinds of important angles we come across very often 
,,in mathematics the first kind is an angle like this and it covers one fourth of the 360 degrees rotation let's call this ray o see this angle formed here is called a right angle and since it covers one fourth of the 360 degrees it measures 90 degrees this angle is special in many ways it is the only angle which is not marked with a curve normally angles a mark like this with a curve between its two arms but a right angle is marked like this with this mark we don't even need to write the measure next to it since these two lines are enough to tell you that it's a right angle and when the angle between two rays or lines is 90 degrees we say they are perpendicular to each other the next important kind of angle you will see often is called the straight angle the name says it all the arm is rotated in such a way that a 
,,straight line is formed like this let this arm be called or e this angle formed here between o ay and o e will equal 180 degrees it is called a straight angle and this straight angle covers half the complete rotation which is 180 degrees so remember one fourth of a complete rotation is a right angle and half a complete rotation 
,,is called a straight angle which is actually a straight line these two were the special angles and if you look at the figure closely these two angles divide the plane into three regions let me color them for you this blue region which is between 0 and 90 degrees this yellow region which is between 90 degrees and 180 degrees and 
,,this entire red Ridge under the line which is between 180 degrees and 360 degrees we classify the angles purely based on these three regions to classify the angles in this figure we will consider rate or a as the initial arm for all angles any angle in the blue region is called an acute angle let's have another ray or B in the blue region this angle formed here will be an acute angle any angle with its terminal arm between 0 and 90 degrees can be called acute any angle formed with its terminal arm in the yellow region will be an obtuse angle let this be another ray or D in the yellow region this angle formed here is called an obtuse angle that means any angle which has its measure between 90 and 180 degrees is called an obtuse angle and any angle with its terminal arm in this red region is called a reflex angle so if you have Ray Oh F like this then this entire angle starting from Ray Oh a will be a reflex angle so a reflex angle will always be greater than 180 degrees but less than 360 degrees and if we have Ray or G like this then this big angle to would be a reflex angle it's very simple any angle between 0 and 90 degrees will be acute if it's between 90 and 180 degrees it will be obtuse and if it's between 180 degrees and 360 degrees it will be reflex one way in which you can remember this is by knowing that the letters a or and are are in alphabetical order this recording from math open-roof calm will help us understand better if the terminal arm lies anywhere between 0 and 90 degrees it will be an acute angle you can move the terminal arm anywhere in between 0 and 90 the angle will still be acute at 90 degrees it becomes a right angle these two rays are said to be perpendicular to each other anywhere between 90 and 180 degrees it will be called an obtuse angle you can see that the wide range of angles are covered between 90 and 180 degrees and the angle is still Optus and at 180 degrees we get a straight line or a straight angle anywhere between 180 degrees and 360 degrees it will be a reflex angle any terminal arm in this entire region will result in a reflex angle and 360 degrees complete one full rotation and it will be called a full angle you you

angles,QU-XUmujbuM,hi i'm rob welcome to math antics in this lesson it's finally time for us to learn about time like distance time is something you can measure and represent as a number but we use different units to measure time and also different devices to make the measurements there are lots of different units of time from really small ones like nanoseconds to really big ones like centuries but in this video we're only going to learn about four of the most common units of time seconds minutes hours and days you should be really familiar with a day you know because you encounter one every day a day is the amount of time it takes the earth to rotate on its axis one time so it's pretty much the fundamental unit of time for our planet but as important as a day is we need smaller units of time for planning daily activities so people 
,,decided to divide up each day into 24 equal chunks of time called hours even though an hour is only 1 24th of a day it's still a pretty long time so we divide hours 
,,up into even smaller units called minutes specifically each hour is divided up into 60 minutes so a minute is 1 60 of an hour and to get even smaller units of time we divide up each minute into 60 equal parts called seconds so a second is 1 60 of a minute going from the smallest to the biggest you should memorize that 60 seconds equals 1 minute 60 minutes equals 1 hour and 24 hours equals one full day there are some common abbreviations for these units that you should know too d for days h 
,,for hours min for minutes and s for seconds one of the earliest devices for measuring time was called a sundial it was basically a flat disc with a triangular pointer in the middle as the earth rotated the shadow of the pointer would slowly change position and point to different markings on the edge of the circle which represented different times of the day are you tired of the man telling you what time it is now you can get the time directly from the source with the sonomatic 3000 just put it in your yard and let the sun do the rest for daytime use only not for use in cloudy conditions times may not be accurate depending on latitude some calibration required the sundial was a really cool invention but it had a lot of limitations fortunately there are much better modern devices for keeping track of time in fact you probably have one hanging on your wall at home or in your classroom that looks something like this this traditional clock is designed to keep track of three different units of time seconds minutes and hours that's why it has three different pointers or hands this thin red pointer is called the second hand because it helps us keep track of seconds this thicker black pointer is called the minute hand because it helps us keep track of minutes and this shorter black pointer is called the hour hand because it helps us keep track of hours oh and the circle itself is often referred to as the clock face a clock is actually kind of complicated so to see how it works let's start with the version that has everything removed except for the second hand and the 60 marks around the edge of the clock face why are there 60 marks around the edge you'll see in just a minute starting with the second hand pointing straight up at the top of the clock face if the hand rotates to the right so that it's pointing at the next mark that means that one second of time is passed so we'll label that mark one the next mark will be two the next three and so on until we get all the way around and the hand is pointing straight up again that means exactly 60 seconds have passed so we'll label that mark with a 60. but we could have labeled that top mark as a zero since that's where the sequence of numbers starts that's one of the cool things about a clock being a circle the starting point is also the ending point so as soon as you hit the end 60 seconds you're also back at the beginning zero seconds the reason that there's exactly 60 marks around the edge of a clock is that 60 seconds equals one minute that means when the second hand makes one full rotation around the clock face exactly one minute of time is passed and 
,,if it makes two full rotations two minutes have passed and if it makes three rotations three minutes have passed and so on so even though the second hand is counting seconds it also helps us know how many minutes have passed but how are we going to keep track of those minutes well that's where the minute hand comes in handy so let's add it back to our simple clock the minute hand works a lot like the second hand the main difference is that it travels slower 60 times slower to be exact since a minute is 60 times longer than a second while the second hand travels all the way around the clock the minute hand only moves from one mark to the next for example if both hands start straight up at the top of the clock while the second hand travels all the way around the clock counting out 60 seconds as it goes the minute hand will only travel from zero to one because only one minute has passed then while the second hand travels around the clock a second time the minute hand will travel from one to two because two minutes have passed notice that we use the exact same set of 60 marks to measure both seconds and minutes but the different hands tell you how to interpret those marks if the second hand is pointing at the fifth mark it means five seconds but if the minute hand is pointing at the fifth mark it means 
,,five minutes of course being able to quickly tell which mark a hand is pointing at is tricky since clocks don't usually number every mark so to make it easier the inventors of the clock decided to make every fifth mark bigger or bolder so you could skip count by fives which helps you quickly tell where the hands are pointing for example if the second hand is pointing right here you can tell right away that it's just two marks past the 15th mark so it's pointing at 17 seconds since 15 plus 2 equals 17. and if the minute hand is pointing here you'll quickly see that it's just two marks before the 40th mark so it's pointing to 38 minutes since 40 minus 2 
,,equals 38. these bigger marks are so helpful for reading a clock that you should memorize the values they represent when the minute or second hands are pointing at them especially the ones that break the clock face up into quarters okay so now you know how the second and minute hands work when the second hand goes all the way around the minute hand increases by one but what happens when the minute hand eventually goes all the way around and is counted out 60 minutes if you paid close attention at the beginning of the video you probably know the answer 60 minutes equals one hour so when the minute hand goes all the way around it means one hour of time is passed that means we're going to need to add the hour hand back to our clock to keep track of hours but the hour hand doesn't use the 60 marks on the edge of the clock in the same way that the other hands do why not because there aren't 60 hours in a day there's only 24. if the hour hand just moved one mark for each hour it wouldn't make it all the way around the clock face in a single day ideally it would be nice if we could have the hour hand go around the clock once per day but unfortunately the 60 marks on the clock don't divide evenly by 24 that means you can't find a nice whole number to skip count to 24 by for example if you had the hour hand 
,,move two marks for each hour it still wouldn't go far enough to make it all the way around the clock in a day and if you had it move three marks for each hour it would go too far fortunately the inventors of the clock came up with a clever compromise they realized that even though 24 hours doesn't divide evenly into 60 half of a day which is 12 hours does 60 divided by 12 equals 5 and 5 is a nice whole number to skip count by in fact we already have bigger marks on our clock face every 5 marks which makes this idea really convenient if the hour and minute hands start pointing straight up as the minute hand goes all the way around the clock counting out 60 minutes the hour hand will slowly move past the first 5 marks which means one hour has passed then as the minute hand goes all the way around again the hour hand will move past the next five marks which means that two hours will have passed this continues on until the hour hand makes it all the way around the clock and gets 
,,to the 12 hour mark back at the top just like with minutes and seconds the top position on the clock represents both the beginning and the end of the counting sequence for minutes and seconds that means the top position represents both 60 and zero but for the hour hand that top spot represents both twelve and zero of course twelve hours is only half a day that means in order for this clock to keep track of one whole day the hour hand needs to make two full trips around the clock face it counts out 12 hours the first half and then 12 more for the second half that means that each hour mark is passed twice during the day so we need a way to distinguish them and that's where am and pm can help us out am stands for anti-meridian which just means before noon and pm stands for post meridian which just means afternoon to 
,,see how the am and pm labels work with the 12 hours on our clock face to keep track of a full day let's compare them to a simpler modern time keeping system called the 24 hour clock in that system the 24 hours of the day are just labeled 0 through 23 in other words at the beginning of the day which happens to be midnight the time is 0 hours and 0 minutes as the hours pass by you eventually get to the time 23 hours and 0 minutes which means you're starting the 24th hour of the day after that last hour passes it starts back over at zero for the next day on the traditional clock face at midnight the hour hand is pointing straight up at 12 so instead of calling it zero o'clock we call it 12 midnight or 12 am then the first 12 hours of the day pass one by one using the am label 1 am 2 am 3 am on up to 11 am when the hour hand gets to 11 am you're beginning the 12th hour of the day and as soon as the 60 minutes of that hour pass by the hour hand will be back up at the top of the clock pointing at 12 again but this time we're gonna call that position 12 noon or 12 pm then the clock continues on counting out the last 12 hours of the day using the pm label 1 pm 2 pm 3 pm on up to 11 pm when the hour hand gets to 11 pm it means you're starting the last or 24th hour of the day after that last hour passes the hour hand points straight up at 12 again which is now 12 midnight or 12 am and the cycle starts all over for the next day let's briefly summarize what we've learned about the clock so far before moving on to a few examples of telling time each time the second hand rotates all the way around the clock one minute has passed and the minute hand advances one mark each time the minute hand goes all the way around the clock one hour has passed and the hour hand advances five marks each time the hour hand goes around the clock 12 hours have passed which is half a day the first 12 hours are called the am hours and the second 12 hours are called the pm hours if 
,,this is your first time learning how a clock works it might seem kind of confusing but don't worry the more you practice looking at a clock and noticing which hands 
,,are pointing to which marks the faster you'll be able to tell what time it is in fact let's practice that a few times now so you can get the hang of it before doing 
,,more practice on your own let's start with this clock face what time of day is it displaying the hour hand is past the seven but not to eight yet so the hour is seven the minute hand is pointing directly at the three but remember that's the third group of five marks for counting minutes or seconds so it's pointing at the 15 minute mark and the second hand is pointing straight up which is the zero second mark so the time is seven hours 15 minutes and 0 seconds oh and that's how you write time using numbers you write the hours first then minutes and then seconds if necessary all separated by colons but is this 7 15 am or pm to tell that you need to know 
,,if it's before noon or afternoon the halfway point of the day books or tests sometimes give you a clue about whether the time is before noon or afternoon so you can 
,,figure it out or they may just tell you if it's am or pm in this case we're given the clue soon the sun will set so we know it's afternoon or 7 15 pm how about this 
,,example what time is this clock displaying the hour hand is past the 10 but not to 11 yet so the hour is 10. the minute hand is just past the 4 which is the 20 minute mark but it's not to 21 yet so the minute is 20 and the second hand is pointing at the 9 which is the 45 second mark so the time is 10 hours 20 minutes and 45 seconds and this time you're given the clue it's a beautiful morning so you know that it's 10 20 am since morning comes before noon and finally what time of day is this 
,,clock display the hour hand is past the 12 but not yet to the one so it's 12 something the minute hand is pointing just a hair past the 6 which is the 30 minute mark so the minute is 30. and there's no second hand on this clock not all clocks have them so we're only concerned about the time to the nearest minute in this example 
,,lastly this clock face is actually labeled am so we know that the time of day is 12 30 am which is 30 minutes past midnight all right so now you know how seconds minutes hours and days all relate to each other you also know how a traditional clock works to help you keep track of these units of time as they pass by and importantly you've learned how to read the hands of the clock face so that you can tell what time of day it is remember that the way to get good at anything in math is to practice so be sure to practice telling time on your own as always thanks for watching math antics and i'll see you next time learn more at mathantics.com

angles,RQ2nYUBVvqI,"Hi!  Welcome to Math Antics. In this lesson, we’re gonna learn about ratios.  Well…what in the world is a ratio? Well, let’s look it up in a math book to find out. It says here that a ratio is a “comparison of two numbers by division”. Well that’s true, but it’s also a little confusing. It’s confusing because most of us think of comparing numbers as trying to decide if a number is greater that, less than, or equal to another number. But with ratios, we’re not trying to compare numbers like "
,,"that. Instead, we’re really trying to see how two numbers relate to each other, and so at Math Antics, we like to think of ratios as a “relationship between two numbers by division”. Okay, but how do you compare (or show how two numbers are related) by division? Well, To see what the “by division” part really means, let’s look at an example of a ratio. Uh, excuse me… That’s not a ratio.  That’s a fraction. Oh, it’s a ratio alright. Mathematically, ratios and fractions are basically the same thing. It’s just that when we use a fraction in a particular way, we call it a ratio. Well sure, everybody knows that! Well like I was saying… Ratios are basically "
,,"just like fractions. The difference is how we use them to describe things in the real world. To see what I mean, let’s look at examples of how we could use the fraction 1 over 2 and the ratio 1 over 2. Mathematically, these are both the same thing. They’re just the division problem: 1 divided by 2. But in the case of the fraction, we usually treat it as if it’s just a single number. For example, at lunch time, you might eat 1 sandwich. Or if you’re really hungry, you might eat 2 sandwiches. But, if your not very hungry, you might just have 1/2 sandwich. We can use the fraction 1/2 just like we use 1 or 2 to show how many sandwiches you eat. It’s just that in the case of 1/2 we know that it’s only part of a sandwich; just a fraction of one. Now let’s see how we can use the ratio 1 over 2. With a ratio, we don’t treat it as if it’s just a single number. Instead, we pay close attention to the top and bottom numbers because we use them to refer to different things. For example, let’s say we’re planning to go on a picnic. And for every two people that are going on the picnic, we’re only bringing 1 sandwich. In that case, we'd say that the ratio of sandwiches to people is 1 to 2, or 1 sandwich per 2 people. Do you see the difference between our fraction and our ratio? The math part of each of them is the "
,,"same. But, with the fraction, both the top and bottom numbers are referring to the same thing; the sandwich. However, with the ratio, the top and bottom numbers are "
,,"referring to different things: sandwiches and people. The fraction shows a part of something, but the ratio shows a relationship (or a comparison) between two different things. And you can see that they’re the same mathematically because if you did have the ratio of 1 sandwich per every 2 people on a picnic, guess how much of a "
,,"sandwich each person would get? Yep… half a sandwich. Alright, so now you know that fractions and ratios are basically the same thing. But, since they’re used differently in math, sometimes they're also shown differently. Once in a while, instead of seeing the standard division form, a ratio might be represented with this symbol. ( : ) When you see a ratio written this way, it just means “1 to 2” or “1 per 2”. For example, in this picture, you could say the ratio of dogs to cats is 3 to 2, "
,,"(3 dogs to 2 cats). And you could also write it in the standard division form: 3 dogs over 2 cats. They’re just different ways to write the same ratio. Ratios are used all the time to represent all sorts of things in real-world situations, so let’s see a few more examples to help you really understand what ratios are. Have you ever wanted to compare apples to oranges, but someone told you you couldn’t? Well you can with a ratio!  Let’s say a fruit stand sells 5 apples for ever 3 oranges they sell. The ratio of apples to oranges would be 5 to 3. Or, have you ever helped someone bake cookies? The recipe might tell you that for every 2 cups of flour, you "
,,"need 1 cup of sugar. That means that the ratio of flour to sugar is 2 to 1. Or, what about your TV screen or your computer monitor. Have you ever hear someone say that the size (or aspect ratio) is 16 to 9? 16 to 9 is the ratio of the screen’s width to its height. So if the screen is 16 inches wide, then its height would be 9 inches tall. Ah, here’s another good ratio that you might use in your car:  40 miles per hour. Ah ha!  Didn’t you said that a ratio was a relationship between TWO numbers? But 40 miles per hour is just one number! …looks like someone’s got some explainin’ to do. Actually, there ARE two numbers. Do you remember how any number can be written like a fraction just by writing ‘1’ as the bottom number? Well, 40 miles per hour is the ratio, 40 miles per ONE hour. Well I guess you have an answer for "
,,"everything, don’t you? 40 miles per 1 hour is a type of ratio that we call a rate. A rate is just a ratio that usually involves a period of time. Here are some common examples of rates: 10 meters per second $12 per hour 3 meals per day 50 games per year Notice that the bottom numbers in each of these ratios relate to a period of time. …seconds, hours, days, years.  And that’s why we call them a rate. Alright, so that’s simple enough. But you might be wondering, why are the bottom numbers of all these rates 1? Couldn’t you have a rate like, 90 meters per 9 seconds, or $60 per 5 hours? We sure could, but most of the time when we have rates like that, we "
,,"want to convert them into an equivalent rate that has 1 as the bottom number. That’s because whenever the bottom number represents only one unit of time (like one hour or one day) it makes comparing different rates much easier. For example, imagine two cars driving at two different rates. The first car’s rate is 120 miles per 3 "
,,"hours and the second car’s rate is 150 miles per 5 hours. Which car is going faster? Well, it’s not all that easy to tell when the rates have different bottom numbers. Fortunately, it’s really easy to change a rate so that it has 1 as the bottom number. All you have to do is divide the top number by the bottom number. The answer you get is the top number of the new (equivalent) rate, and the bottom number is just 1. Rates like this are called “unit rate” because “unit” means “one”. Alright, let’s convert the rates of speed for our two cars into unit rates so that we can compare them easily. The first car’s rate was 120 miles per 3 hours. So if we take "
,,"120 and divide it by 3, we get 40. That means that the unit rate for the first car is 40 miles per hour. The second car’s rate was 150 miles per 5 hours. So if we divide 150 by 5, we get 30. So the unit rate for the second car is 30 miles per hour. And now, you can easily tell that the first car is going faster. And you can tell why unit rates are so helpful. Okay, so that’s it for this lesson. We’ve learned that a ratio is basically just like a fraction. But instead of showing what part of something you have, it shows the relationship between two different things. We also learned that when one of those two things is time, we call the ratio a rate. And last of all, we learned how to convert a rate into a unit rate for easy comparison. As always, thanks for watching Math Antics and I’ll see ya next time. Learn more at www.mathantics.com"

angles,2JSk0DC5q4g,"You're watching FreeSchool! Hi everyone! Today we're going to talk about angles. An angle is the amount of turn, or space,"
,,"between two lines that meet each other. When two lines meet at a point, or vertex,"
,,"an angle is formed. The two lines are called the arms of the angle. Angles are measured in degrees, which is shown"
,,"by this symbol. A complete turn, also known as a full rotation,"
,,"all the way back to the place it started, is 360 degrees. One half of a turn, which forms a straight"
,,"line, is 180 degrees. One quarter of a turn is 90 degrees. This is called a right angle. There are three other types of angles: acute,"
,,"obtuse, and reflex angles. An acute angle is one that is less than 90"
,,degrees. An obtuse angle is one that is more than 90
,,"degrees, but less than 180 degrees. A reflex angle is one that is greater than"
,,180 degrees. Some angles may be added together to get one
,,of the important angles we talked about earlier. Complementary angles are two angles that add
,,up to a 90 degree angle. Supplementary angles are two angles that add
,,up to a 180 degree angle. Two angles that add up to make a full circle
,,or 360 degree angle can be called either explementary or conjugate angles. Some other fun facts about how angles add
,,"up include that all the angles inside a triangle will always add up to 180 degrees, and all"
,,"the angles around the point where lines intersect will always add up to 360 degrees. Angles are usually measured using protractors. Protractors have markings on them, similar"
,,"to rulers, but instead of inches or centimeters it measures in degrees. If you don't have a protractor to measure"
,,"with, you can estimate how big it is as long as you remember what a 90 degree angle, 180"
,,"degree angle, and 360 degree angle look like. I hope this helped you understand all about"
,,angles today. Good-bye till next time!

angles,1_DSMABQZbk,math if Math super difficult for you if math comes in your nightmare then
,,you are on a right place because this video is going to change your whole student life
,,after watching this video you will be solving that super easily like Albert
,,Einstein in the next couple of minute I am going to share with you that mindset
,,of every successful mathematician who created history in mathematics that
,,mindset is the key ingredient to solve math like a piece of cake I got 97 out
,,of hundreds in my 12th math exam and now you will also score obove 90 just by
,,learning that mindset which is required to solve any math problem first you have to
,,commit something to your self this is very important without this the video
,,will be a waste for you now allows you to yourself that math is easy for me yes
,,say it again I want to hear you louder more louder no matter who is near to you
,,don't feel shy if you didn't do this you will go back to your old life where math
,,is like a demon so do not care about anybody nobody is going to come and
,,change your life only you can change your life so say this loudly to yourself
,,that math is easy for me I can solve math easily Math is a piece of cake for
,,me why this is important I will give you answer this is
,,important to take off the wrong mindset wrong programming in your mind and
,,filling it with positiveness like Math is easy for you once you really believe
,,in this then you are on a right track it's not pause this video and go in
,,front of a mirror and say this to yourself
,,till you believe this from your within from your deepest heart that math is easy for me then play this video I will be
,,always here so if you are ready completely ready let's begin first I
,,will talk about the most toxic mindset to solve math whenever a math
,,problem comes to the most of the people first they get frightened and say oh my
,,god this question is so big this question is
,,super difficult for me I can never solve this question huh where is the formula
,,how I will solve this what will happen blah blah but you now you won't say this
,,because you just change your mindset and then suddenly they will open a help
,,book in which the solution of that question is already given and they will try to
,,copy the solution from there after that they will cram the solution from there
,,and cramming math is the most worst thing you can do about your math so
,,never cram Math or if they do not find a help book what will they do they will
,,find a similar question in which the solution is given and they will try to
,,do the same in that question and it doesn't matter that done is right or not
,,if the answer is right what you have learnt from that question nothing just cramming
,,copying etc so never do this this will only make your math
,,difficult for you and the more you do this the more you will get stuffed in
,,this because this is like a spider dance so never do this because the question
,,will only increase and cramming will not solve this now the time has come in
,,which I will talk about that mindset I call it the learning + solution
,,oriented mindset in which you focus on learning trying to learn something from
,,the question and you focus on finding the solution of that question by
,,focusing on the problem you have given first let me give you a tip for solving
,,every math problem in your math book first make a list of all the formulas
,,which are going to be used in that particular chapter you are going to
,,solve this is a proven method to solve math problems if you have a list of
,,formulas which can be used in that problem
,,this makes math super easy for you so always before starting a chapter make a
,,list of all the formulas which are going to be used in that chapter for example
,,if you are going to solve trigonometry then make a list of all the formulas
,,which are going to be used in it now you will say that I hardly remember any math
,,formula it is so hard to remember them and I know but no problem with this
,,mindset you will automatically start memorizing all the formulas in your math
,,book without doing any effort if you practice what I say now you have a math
,,problem and a number of formulas to solve that problem now how will you know
,,which formula is right for the problem the answer is to read the problem
,,carefully this is the first and the most important step to solve math problem
,,most people never do this they never read the problem carefully they do this
,,this question is of this chapter they solve it like this I will solve it like
,,this I will copy this oh I didn't got the right answer oh no math is so difficult
,, for me ask yourself do you ever read a math question carefully ever
,,without starting to solve the problem if so first read the question and then
,,you will know that formula automatically which is going to be used in that
,,problem because you have a list of particular formulas which are going to
,,be used in that chapter then do not suddenly start solving the problem first
,,think in your mind how will I get from these value in the question to the one
,,value of the answer I have to use the formulas which I have what to do think
,,use your mind this will make math super interesting it is
,,like solving the puzzle game you have given a puzzle and you have some patterns
,,and some formulas to solve the problem and you have to get to the answer to the
,,goal so how will you solve the problem think in your mind but I have to do what
,,I have to change the values I have to change these numbers to this and then
,,apply this formula make it super interesting in your mind and then start
,,solving the problem lets say you got a wrong answer you try tried again you again got the wrong answer no problem you have to try again
,,always remember Einstein said I am not intelligent I just stay with the problem
,,longer than other people so the longer you will be with  the problem the more
,,chances that you will solve the problem correctly and at last you will get
,,the right answer yess you just solved a math problem on
,,your own without any help book Congrats now you have to open a helpbook and see if
,,your solution is right and learn from your mistake you did in the  previous
,,question basically this is learning learning from your mistakes this will
,,make your brain more sharper now you just solved a math problem on your own
,,what do you think you did ?you made billions of connections in your mind you
,,are using a trial and error method and constantly learning from your tries and
,,by this you will start memorizing formulas easily because you will take up
,,a formula and apply that in your question and this automatically memorizes
,,formulas I tried this and all the math formulas just stamps in my mind if you
,,practice this that you can solve any question in that chapter remember
,,Einstein said imagination is more powerful than knowledge
,,if you don't memorize formulas no matter but you should have a mind which is
,,required to solve that problem a mind which has full of imagination that how
,,you can get to the answer so next time when your teacher give you a homework of
,,a question and try to use this method in this method will math super
,,interesting for you and it will be like playing a videogame and please do not
,,go back to what you were when you open this video because there is no other way
,,to solve math more easy than this there are lots of other videos which tell how
,,to solve math easily how to become a genius etc etc but there is no other way
,,they will give you tips routines etc like I also gave you a routine but
,,you have to stick with something something in this video or in any other
,,video ok so take a simple thing and stick with it like if you say I do not want
,,to do all this from tomorrow just do a simple thing like making a list of all
,,the formulas in your chapter this will change something and you just ask
,,growing so slow and steady wins the race now you know the way the single key to
,,success in mathematics if you follow this getting above 90 is a piece of
,,cake for you now let's get something practical we will take a universal math
,,problem of seven standards so that everybody can understand it and will
,,apply this method to solve that problem if you are a high standard student than
,,see how I will solve that problem and apply the same method in your math problems
,,this will clear this concept to you more so let begin take a look at this simple
,,math question this is the seventh standard math question i took this
,,question so that everybody can understand the mindset better in this
,,question you are asked to find the volume of the cylinder of height five
,,centimeters and radius two cm this this is a cylinder of height 5
,,centimeters and radius 2 centimeters for high standard student just assume this
,,as a demonstration of that mindset I will apply that mindset in this question
,,to find the answer let's say we have a chapter in which we can find two types
,,of questions first is the volume of the cylinder and second is the surface area
,,of cylinders and we have new to all this and we don't know which formula of
,,volume and this formula of surface area so assume that this is happening and now
,,we will apply the method to solve that problem so first step is to read the
,,problem carefully in this problem we have to find the volume of cylinder of
,,height 5 centimeter and radius 2 centimeter for high standard students
,,they will say that all this question is super easy this is of volume formula we have to chunk in these values and finds answer but no this is just a
,,demonstration take it as a demonstration and use the
,,same method in your difficult question so we have these two values first is
,,height and second is radius of cylinder now let us write  first what is the
,,radius of cylinder radius or cylinder equal to 2 cm and height of cylinder is equal to five centimeters so we have
,,these two values and we have to get from these two values to the one value of the
,,volume how do we get there we have to use one formula one formula of the
,,volume we do what we have to do so first we have to know which formulas is of
,,volume at which formula is of surface area so how do we know that see
,,what is the area of circle that means all this what is the area of circle that
,,is PI R square right so we have the area of circle this and if we
,,multiply it by the height which is this then we will have a circle stacked on
,,each other to five centimeter height and then we will have the volume so we know
,,that this formula is of volume and for surface area tell me the parameter of
,,circle that is 2 PI R right and if we have hollow circle stacked on each other
,,to 5 centimeters then we will have the surface area of cylinder so we know that
,,volume of cylinder is this and we will apply this in our question so volume of cylinder so the volume of
,,cylinder which is this formula and we will apply that in our question that is
,,PI R squared H so we first have chunk in the value okay so let's chunk in the
,,value Phi is three point one four multiplied by r square which is 2 and 2 square
,,equal to 4 multiply by h which is height which is 5 centimeter and now this is equal to 62.8 centimeter cube never forget to add the unit after the value in math    
,,this is also very important tip for math so we just read the question carefully

angles,IaoZhhx_I9s,"Hi there, welcome to Math Antics! So far, in our series on geometry,"
,,"we've learned about points, lines, planes and angles. In this lesson, we're going to learn about another"
,,important element of geometry. We're going to learn about polygons. You probably already know a lot about polygons
,,because you see them all the time. Here's some common examples
,,that you might recognize. These shapes are all polygons. That's because
,,"a polygon just means a multi-sided shape, and these shapes all have multiple sides. Okay, so that's a basic definition of a polygon,  but to really understand what is a polygon"
,,"and what is NOT a polygon, we need to learn about the specific properties"
,,that all polygons have in common. First we need to know the three parts that
,,"make up all polygons. And these parts are: sides, vertices, and angles. The sides are just the straight line segments"
,,"that make up a polygon. And the vertices are points where the sides intersect. And the angles are formed by the intersecting lines. In fact, in Greek,"
,,"the word polygon literally means ""many-angles."" So all polygons have sides, vertices and angles. This polygon here has 5 sides,"
,,5 vertices and it forms 5 angles. The next thing we need to know about polygons
,,is that they're 'closed' shapes. Now what does it mean for a shape to be closed
,,"you ask? Well, it means that the sides are connected"
,,so that there are no gaps. The area inside the shape is separated
,,"from the area outside the shape,  and there's no way to get from the inside to the outside"
,,without crossing a line. It might help to think of a closed shape
,,"like a cage. If you put an ant inside the cage, there's no way for it to get out without crossing a line. But if the shape is open, then there is a way out. So these are all examples of closed shapes,"
,,and these are all examples of open shapes. And the important thing to remember is that
,,a polygon must be closed. And the last thing we need to know about polygons
,,"is that they're 2 dimensional, or flat shapes. And that means that all the vertices"
,,must lie on the same plane. If any one of the vertices were to move
,,"forwards or backwards, so that it wasn't in the same plane as all the other vertices, then it wouldn't be a flat shape anymore. Flat shapes are also called planar shapes"
,,"because all of their points are on the same plane. And even though polygons themselves can't be 3D shapes, you can use polygons to make 3D shapes. Like a box, for example.  The box is not a polygon. But each of it's flat sides is a polygon. Alright then."
,,We now have a specific definition of a polygon. A polygon is a multi-sided shape that has
,,"sides, vertices and angles. A polygon is a closed shape,"
,,"and a polygon is a 2 dimensional, or flat shape. And now that you know that,"
,,"it's time to play ""Polygon or NOT a Polygon!"" Now here's your host: me! Thank you, thank you! Alright."
,,"Now the rules of the game are simple. I'm gonna show you a shape, and you tell me if it's a shape, and you tell me if it's a polygon or not a polygon. Are you ready "
,,to play? Our first shape is a square!
,,Is a square a polygon? Yes! A square has 4 sides and 4 vertices
,,"and it's a closed, 2D shape. So it is a polygon. And next we have, hmmm. I'm not exactly sure"
,,"what to call this, but, is it a polygon? Nope! It's close, but because it's an open shape,"
,,"it can't be a polygon. Alright, what about this one?"
,,Polygon or not a polygon? Yep! It is a polygon.
,,"Even though the sides are not all the same length, it is a closed, 2D, multi-sided shape."
,,"In fact, if you count, you'll see it has 7 sides. Ah, how about this one? Is a circle a polygon? Well, it is a closed, 2D shape,"
,,"but how many sides does it have? Now that's the problem. A circle doesn't have any straight sides,"
,,"vertices or angles. It's a curved shape, so it's not a polygon. Next we have a star shape, just like me!"
,,"Is this a polygon? Yup! It has straight sides and vertices,"
,,"and it's a closed, 2D shape. That means it's a polygon! And what about this one? Right you are,"
,,"this is not a polygon! It's a dog! Ahh, here's an interesting one.  It's a closed, 2D shape that does have straight sides andvertices, but, it also has this curved part here.  Can it still be a polygon with that curve there?  No! The curved part disqualifies it as a polygon. A polygon has to have only straight sides,"
,,so this is not a polygon. And what about this guy here? Is this a polygon?
,,"Well, it is just straight lines,  but two of those lines cross, and if any lines cross"
,,"it can't be a polygon.  Plus, he has this big open end here."
,,"So this guy is definitely not a polygon. And last of all, what about this one? Right you are,"
,,"this is not a polygon because it's a 3D shape.  It's made from polygons,"
,,"but the whole shape is not a polygon itself. Well, that's all the time we have for this week. Join us next week as we decide:"
,,"Is it Bigger than One? Okay, so after playing that game,"
,,"you have a really good idea of what a polygon is,"
,,and what it is not. The last thing I want to mention
,,is that some polygons have special names depending on how many sides they have. Here's a list of the most important
,,"ones to know: 3-sided polygons are called triangles.  Triangle are so important in geometry,"
,,"that they'll get a whole video of their own. 4-sided polygons are called quadrilaterals. Wow! Now that's a fancy math word! But it helps if you just remember that the first part, ""quad,"" means ""4."" Quadrilaterals are shapes like squares,"
,,"rectangles, and parallelograms. They'll also get a video of their own. 5-sided polygons are called pentagons. 6-sided polygons are called hexagons. And 8-sided polygons are called octagons. By the way, polygons that have"
,,"5, 6, 8, or however many sides like this, are called regular polygons"
,,"if all of their angles are equal, and irregular polygons if their angles are not equal. Of course, there are a lot more polygons than that,"
,,"but you probably won't need to know their names. As long as you know what polygons are, and how to identify them, then you're ready to move on. The exercises for this section are pretty easy,"
,,"so no excuses!  Good luck!  Thanks for watching Math Antics,"

angles,9RTM418qfdI,hello friends welcome to new happy learning video look at these images do you know what we're looking at exactly they are bangles and today we are going to learn many things about them an angle is space between two intersecting lines all surfaces that emerge from the same point called vertex if you look around we are surrounded 
,,by angles like the ones this clock handles or an ice cream cone makes the unit of measure of angles is the degree and the most important angle of all is this one it's called a right angle and it measures 90 degrees the tiny zero you can see on the bright upper part of the number 90 is a symbol that represents all angles we say that the right angle is the most important one because it is the one that is used to compare all of the other angles the angles are smaller than of right angle a called acute angles and they measure less than 90 degrees like all of these and angles that are bigger than a right angle are called obtuse angles and measure more than 
,,90 degrees like all of these to neighbor degrees at an angle measures we need to use this instruments which is called app attractor so we need to place the straight 
,,part of the Picatta over one of the sides of the angle making the vertex and the central point of the Petrak to meet after this we need to look at the trap to line on the other side of the angle and look at what number it says these are the degrees that an angle measures easy peasy huh let's practice we said that a right angle is 90 degrees let's see we'll get the protractor and indeed a right angle is 90 degrees we haven't fooled you huh now let's measure this angle let's see how much it measures 45 degrees it's an acute angle because it is smaller than a right angle and now we're going to check out how much this other angle measures a hundred and twenty degrees of course it's an obtuse angle because it measures more than 90 degrees imagine that instead of being 120 it measures a hundred and eighty do you know what this angle is called we call it a straight angle hey and what about if it messes 360 degrees well that's a complete all full angle it's complete as can be the conference meshes 360 degrees what's a discovery measuring angles is easy-peasy and fun don't you think get by friends and don't forget to subscribe to happy learning TV

angles,KO_p_MkXMJM,hangers good morning kids today let's revise what we already know about angles some basic points about angles are and anger is formed by two rays that have a common 
,,endpoint so here Q is the common endpoint of Rea QP and 3qr here the common endpoint cue is called the vertex of the angle the to raise Q P and Q R are called the arms of the angle when naming the angle the vertex is always written in the middle for example angle PQR and angle rqp denote the same angle q we measure and draw an angle with the help of a protractor we express the measurement of an angle in degrees let's revise how to measure an angle measure the angle LMN step one place the central point of the protractor on the vertex M such that the zero degrees line coincides with 3mn step two note that the protractor has two sets of readings we read from whichever side the array of the angle is pointing towards here we read the scale from the zero on the right as Ray MN points to the right step 3 read the degree 
,,measure that coincides with three ml ray ml coincides with 75 degrees step four right the measure of angle which is equal to 75 degrees now let's measure one more angle look at the figure you on measuring we get the measure of the angle P IV as 135 degrees now construct an angle construct an angle ABC of 110 degrees step one rape PC step two place the central point of the protractor on be such that the zero degrees line coincides with Ray BC mark point a at 110 degrees counting from zero degrees step 3 remove the protractor and join BA to get angle a PC now let's construct one more angle construct an angle m NP of 85 degrees you thus angle MNP of 85 degrees has been constructed wasn't it on revising angles

angles,DGKwdHMiqCg," Hi! Welcome to Math Antics. We're continuing our series on Geometry   and today we're going to learn about angles. In our last video, we learned about points and lines, and that's good because"
,,we are going to need lines to make angles. So let's start with a couple of lines
,,that are in the same plane. We're only going to be dealing with
,, two-dimensional geometry in this video.  These lines are conveniently called
,," Line AB and Line CD. Now the important thing to notice about these two lines is that they're pointing in exactly the same direction.  So, even if we extended  them "
,,"forever, they would never cross or even get closer together. When two lines are arranged like this,"
,,we call them 'parallel'. You've probably heard the term 'parallel' before…
,,"like parallel parking, or a parallel universe, or parallel bars. Okay, so parallel lines are lines that will"
,,"never cross, even if they go on forever... but what if I take one of our lines and"
,,give it a little nudge? Now the lines aren't parallel anymore.
,,"In fact, they cross at this point right here. Let's name it Point P.  When lines cross at a point like this,"
,,"we say that they intersect, and we call the point an 'intersection'. And when lines intersect, they form 'angles'. You can think of the angles as the spaces, or shapes, that are formed between the intersecting lines.  These intersecting lines form four angles: 1, 2, 3, 4. But instead of calling them angle 1, 2, 3 and 4,  in Geometry,"
,,"we name them by the points used to make them. For example, this angle here can be called Angle DPB  because if you trace along those points"
,,"(like connect the dots) they outline that angle. And this angle here... we can call that Angle APD, because connecting those dots forms angle. Now when naming angles,"
,,"there's a nice shorthand we can use.  Instead of writing the word 'angle' over and over again, we can just use the angle symbol instead,"
,,"which looks like this. But there's an even simpler way to name angles. To learn that way,"
,,let's erase all the points and letters on our lines except for the intersection point and this one point here. Now let's imagine that the line-segment between these 
,,"two points can rotate around the point of intersection, just like a clock hand rotates"
,,"around the center of a clock.  Let's also imagine that as we rotate the line segment, the point out at the end leaves a trail,"
,,"like if a pencil was attached to it. The trail (or path) that is left when we rotate the line-segment all the way around forms a circle. But if we only go part way around,"
,,then it forms part of a circle that we call an 'arc'. This arc can represent the angle
,,"that is formed when we rotate the segment from one position to another,"
,,"like from this line to that line. And now, if we shrink down that arc so that"
,,"it's close to the intersection point, and then put a letter by it, like the letter 'A',"
,,"we have another way of showing an angle... Angle A. And we can do this with any angle,"
,,"so the angle up here... we can also draw an arc and call it Angle B. So whenever you see a letter next to a little arc like this, it means that it's the name of the "
,,angle
,,"formed by that arc. Alright then, so now we have a diagram that shows Angle A and Angle B, and you might notice that those angles"
,,aren't the same size.  B seems to be bigger than A. But what if we rotate one of our lines until
,,the angles do look like they're the same size? Now our angles look kind of like a plus sign.
,,Lines arranged like this are called 'perpendicular'. Perpendicular lines are lines that form square corners when they intersect. And these square corner angles have 
,,"a special name in Geometry because they are really important. We call them 'right angles'. There is even a special symbol that we use to show when an angle is a right angle.  Because they form square corners,  we use a little square instead of"
,,"the arc that we use for the other angles. So whenever you see this symbol,"
,,"you know the angle you are looking at is a right angle, and that the lines that form it are perpendicular. Okay, now that you know what a right angle is, let's look "
,,"at a simple one that's made from just two rays. What will happen if we take the ray pointing up and rotate it like the hand of a clock a little to the right… a little bit clockwise? Well, we don't have a right angle any more"
,,"because the rays are no longer perpendicular. Instead, we have an angle that is smaller"
,,(or less) than a right angle. Angles that are less than right angles
,,"are called 'acute angles'. On the other hand, if we rotated our ray to"
,,"the left instead of the right, we would get an angle that's bigger"
,,or greater than a right angle.  Angles that are greater than right angles
,,"are called 'obtuse angles'. So, there are three main kinds of angles"
,,"that you need to know about.  Right Angles, acute angles and obtuse angles. Well actually, there's one more type of"
,,"angle that's pretty important, but it's kind of a strange one."
,,"It's called a 'straight angle'. A straight angle is just what we get when we rotate our rays so that they point in exactly opposite directions. The result looks just like a straight line,"
,,"which is why it's called a straight angle. Alright then, there's just a few more important geometry terms that we need to learn in this video.  Let's look at our simple right angle"
,,"again that's made from two rays. But this time, let's draw a third ray that"
,,"cuts that right angle into two smaller parts. Now, because the angle that we divided up"
,,"was a right angle,  we know that the two new smaller angles"
,,"combine to form a right angle. And in geometry, any two angles that to form a right angle are called 'complementary angles'. And we can do the same thing with a straight angle.  If we take a straight angle (made from two rays)  and divide it with a third ray,"
,,two new smaller angles are formed. And those two angles combine to form a straight angle.
,,"We call these angles 'supplementary angles'. So, complementary angles"
,,"combine to form a right angle,  and supplementary angles"
,,"combine to form a straight angle. Alright, that's all were going to learn about angles"
,,"in this video. And if you are new to Geometry,"
,,"it might seem like a lot, so let's do a quick review of"
,,"all the new geometry words we've learned. Lines that point in exactly the same direction will never cross and are called 'parallel' lines. When lines do cross, they "
,,cross at a point
,,called an 'intersection'. Lines that intersect form 'angles'. You can
,,think of angles as the spaces between the lines. Angles can be named by the points that
,,"form them... just like connect the dots. An 'arc' is a part of a circle. Arcs can be used to represent an angle between two intersecting lines. When intersecting lines form all exactly equal angles, the lines are 'perpendicular'. Perpendicular lines form 'right angles'."
,,"Right angles are square corners,  and we use a special square symbol"
,,"to show that an angle is a right angle. An angle that's smaller, or less than a right"
,,"angle is called an 'acute angle'. An angle that's bigger, or greater than a"
,,right angle is called an 'obtuse angle'. A 'straight angle' is formed by two rays pointing
,,in exactly opposite directions.  A straight angle is really just a straight line. Two angles that combine to form a right angle
,,are called 'complementary angles'. Two angles that combine to form a straight
,,"angle are called 'supplementary angles'. In our next geometry video, we're going to"
,,"learn more about angles and how to measure them. Thanks for watching Math Antics, and I'll"

angles,il22YcHDfeE,measuring angles today let's learn how to measure an angle let us begin by learning about the geometric instrument protractor one a protractor is used to measure angles two angles are measured in degrees three each tiny mark on the protractor toes one degree it has markings from zero degree to 180 degrees we can read 0 to 180 degrees from left to right and also from right to left for while measuring an angle the central point is placed on the vertex of the angle let's see how to measure an

angles,6RMN5Pf1fHU,"Consider line 'p' and line 'q' which are on a plane. The lines are also parallel to each other, which would mean that they do not intersect or ever meet. And this is transversal 'R' , which cuts the lines 'p' and 'q' at two distinct points. In this video we will try to understand the different types of angles formed by the transversal with two parallel lines. The transversal forms four angles with line 'p', angles 1, 2, 3 & 4. And four angles with line 'q', angles 5, 6, 7 & 8. Let's move on to the first type of angles. If lines p and q are parallel, then angle 1 will always equal angle 5. This angle here will be equal to this one. They are called corresponding angles. It doesn't matter how the transversal is placed. These angles will always be equal. On a new page let us try moving the transversal around. Assume line 'a', and line 'b' are parallel to each other. And here is a transversal 'c'. You can see that these two angles look equal. Now let's rotate the transversal towards the right. These two angles again seem to be equal. Now let's rotate the transversal towards the left . The angles become obtuse and are still equal. This tells us that the corresponding angles are always equal. Now let's go back to the previous page. Now let me ask you an interesting question. Look at the figure closely. Is "
,,"this the only pair of corresponding angles? No! It isn't. We have three more pairs of corresponding angles. When a transversal intersects a pair of Parallel lines. Four pairs of corresponding angles are formed. Two and six form a corresponding angles pair. So angle two will always equal angle six. You can even look at the figure and observe that they are equal. Similarly, angle three will equal angle seven, and angle four will equal angle eight. These are the four pairs of corresponding angles that are formed. 1 & 5, 2 & 6, 3 & 7, 4 & 8. Angles 3, 4, 5 & 6 are interior angles, because they are between the two parallel lines. And they are classified into two types. Let's understand the first type. Angle 3 and Angle 5 form a pair of alternate interior angles. We know why they are called interior, but why exactly are they called alternate? If we have a round table with numbers 3, 4, 5 & 6 around it, then 5 is alternate to 3. That's because after 3 you skip 1 position and take the next. Similarly, 6 will be alternate to 4. In this diagram as well to find alternate of 3 we skip 1 position and take the next which is 5 . And similarly, angle 4 "
,,"and angle 6 are also called alternate interior angles. This was the first type of interior angles. The second type is a pair in which the angles are next to each other on the same side of the transversal. Like angle 3 and angle 6. They are called consecutive interior angles. Look at the figure now. Do you see any other pair of consecutive interior angles? Yes! With the same logic even angles 4 & 5 are consecutive interior Angles. Remember, there are two types of interior angles. Alternate and Consecutive. For alternate we skip one and move to the next. For consecutive, we take the one that's immediately next to it. And the last types of angles that are formed are vertically opposite angles. Angles 1 & 3 are called vertically opposite angles. In all there are 4 pairs of vertically opposite angles, Apart from angles 1 & 3, we have angles 2 & 4, angles 5 & 7 and angles 6 & 8 as the other 3 pairs. And vertically opposite angles are always equal. These were the different types of "
,,"angles that were formed when a transversal meets two parallel lines. On a new page let's look at the beauty of these angles. Assume we have lines 'a' and 'b' which are parallel. And transversal 'c' which intersects them at two distinct points. As we already know the transversal forms eight angles. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven and eight. Let us quickly analyze the relation between various angles formed. It's pretty simple actually. Angle two will be equal to angle six as their corresponding angles. An angle eight equals angle six as it is vertically opposite to it . And angle four equals angle eight because they are corresponding angles. Similarly, angle one equals angle five as their corresponding angles. Angle seven equals angle five because they are vertically opposite. And angle three equals angle seven because they are corresponding angles. So if lines 'a' and 'b' are parallel, we can see that angles one, three, five and seven are equal. And angles two, four, six and eight are equal."

angles,5vwvfAjFLdw,angers kids you already know what an angle is today let's learn something more about it as you know an angle is formed by two rays that have a common point here rate QP and Ray QR are called the two arms of the angle the common point Q is the vertex of the angle B right this angle using letters and symbols as when naming an angle the vertex is always the middle letter of the three letters or only the vertex is used the other two letters in the name of an angle may be interchanged we read it as angle P Q R or anger R Q P or angle cue now let's solve a few examples read each angle name the two rays vertex and angle look at the figure on the board the two rays are racy B and racy D here Point C is the vertex of the angle here the angle is angle B C D or angle D C B now let's look at another example the two rays are ray MS and Ray MC here point M is the vertex of the angle here the angle is angle s MC o anger see M s kids now try solving a few examples on your own

angles,JK4OjUAqqGg,types of angles according to positions hello kids in the previous class we studied about the types of angles according to their measures today let's look at the types of angles according to their positions there are four types of angles under this category they are adjacent angles vertically opposite angles complementary angles 
,,and supplementary angles let us learn more on each of them adjacent angles two angles are said to be adjacent when they have a common vertex a common arm and lie on 
,,either sides of the common arm here angle X Y you and angles set y-you are adjacent angles as they have a common vertex why a common armory why you and lie on either sides of the common armory by you kids remember angle XY said and angle XY you are not adjacent angles as they do not lie on either sides of the common arm XY now let's solve an example find the adjacent angles in the given bigger the answer is angle a PC and angle b pc are the adjacent angles in the given bigger next is vertically opposite angles when two straight lines meet at a point they form four angles the pairs of angles opposite to each other are called vertically opposite angles a pair of vertically opposite angles is always equal in measure line L m and line n Oh meet at point B here the two pairs of vertically opposite angles are angle LPN

angles,86xuTrYOdV8,speed distant time hello friends today let us learn about speed distance and time let's begin what is speed speed is the distance traveled by an object in a certain 
,,"time for example the car can move at about 90 km/h here 90 km/h expresses the speed of the car we express speed in kilometer per our or meter per second the distance is measured in centimeters meters or kilometers time is measured in seconds minutes or hours time as one second one minute or one are is called as unit time now let us study some formulae to calculate speed speed is equal to distance upon time there will be instances when the speed needs to be converted either from kilometer per hour to meter per second or vice-versa we know that one kilometer is equal to 1,000 meters and one R is equal to 60 minutes which is equal to 60 into 60 seconds thus to convert speed in kilometer per r2 meter per second multiplied the speed by 1000 and divide by 60 into 60 directly x 5 upon 18 to convert speed in meter per second to kilometer per R multiply the speed by 60 into 60 and divide by 1000 or directly x 18 upon five let us solve an example to understand it in a better way a truck covers 210 kilometers in three hours find its speed in kilometer per our and meter per second it is given that distance is equal to 210 kilometers time is equal to 3 hours firstly let us find the speed in kilometers per our speed is equal to distance upon time which is equal to 210 kilometers upon 3 hours which is equal to 70 "
,,kilometers per hour thus the speed of the truck is 70 kilometers per hour let us find the speed in metre per second here we shall use the formula speed into 5 upon 18 thus 70 kilometers into pi upon 18 is equal to 19 meters per second thus the speed of the truck is 19 meters per second remember these formally speed is equal to distance upon time similarly we can find distance and time using the following formulae distance is equal to speed into time time is equal to distance upon speed kids now try solving a few sums of speed distance and time on your own you

angles,dFPwrBVocpY,good morning children today let's learn some geometry geometry is part of mathematics which deals with figures like point line line segment ray angle etc let's learn more about these figures point what is a point point is an exact location or a particular place a point has no size it has only position we denote the position of a point with a dot here P is a point we read it as point-p the tip of a needle is an example for a point next is line a line is a long thin mark on a surface a line has no endpoints it extends indefinitely on both sides look at this line we read it as line a B or line B a we write it as line a B or line B a or with the symbol of 
,,the line above the letters like this look at this line we read it as line L now look at this line three points P Q and R are named on it this line can be read using 
,,any two points that is line P Q line Q R line PR and line R P coming to line-segment a line segment is a part of a line it has two end points look at this segment it has two end points D and E we read it as line segment de or line segment Edie it is written as s e-g de all s e-g Edie or with the symbol of the line segment over the letters like this next is Ray Ari has one endpoint it can be extended only in one direction it can be read only as Ray XY and not Ray YX as we start from the endpoint we write it as ray XY or with the symbol of the Ray above the letters like this lastly let's look at an angle when to raise share a common endpoint an angle is 
,,formed we read it as angle are PQ or angle QP R we write it as angle our PQ or angle QP R we can also write using symbols there are two symbols for an angle using these symbols we can write an angle as now I will show you some figures and you name them what is this yes it is line PQ or line QP what is this correct it is re s T what is this right again it is angle ABC or angle CBA next is this simplest of all yes it is point Z and the last one is yes line segment CD or line segment DC hey kids wasn't it fun learning a few geometrical figures we will learn more figures in the next chapter

,,point a point indicates a position in space it has no length red or thickness B and this are all points in space we read them as point B point R and point s line a line contains an infinite number of points the arrows at the ends of a given line indicate that it has no beginning or n that is a line extends in both directions look at this line we represent it with letters and the symbol of the line about them like this we read it as line PQ or line QP look at this line two points on a line can be used to name it such as line a B line BC line AC line C B line c a.o line ba now look at this line we can also name and read the line by a single small letter 
,,for example line L line segment a line segment contains a finite number of points it is a fixed distance between two points on a line it has two endpoints here de is a line segment it is written as de or Edie now let us see how to measure a line segment the distance between two points is called the length of the segment to measure a line segment we use a ruler a ruler is marked with centimeters each centimeter is divided into ten parts each part is one millimeter now let's solve an example 
,,measure the line segment XY thus we say the length of line segment XY is equal to five point three centimeters next is REE arrey contains an infinite number of points arrey has one endpoint the other end of the Ray is extended indefinitely XY is a ray it can be read only as Ray XY as we always start from the end point do not read it as real YX it is written as shown this ray can be read as ray a be Ray AC now let us learn about intersecting lines when two lines meet at one point they are called intersecting lines here line a B and C D meet at point P hence line a B and line C D are called intersecting lines coming two parallel lines two lines that are 
,,at the same distance and do not meet are called parallel lines here line a B and line CD are parallel lines we read it as line a B is parallel to line C D we write it as shown kids look here two lines drawn on either side of a ruler are parallel lines lastly perpendicular lines two intersecting lines make a right angle at the point of intersection then they are called perpendicular lines here line a B and line C D intersect at Point P here angle a PC is equal to 90 degrees hence these two lines are perpendicular lines it is read as a B is perpendicular to CD it is written as shown look here all four angles at the point of intersection P ah right angles kids remember a point as only position and no dimension a line extends indefinitely in both directions a segment is a part of a line with two end points arrey has one endpoint two lines intersect only at one point many lines can pass through a single point perpendicular lines intersect at a point making a 90 degrees angle battlin lines never meet you

,,sleeping I know that I shouldn't be sleeping the
,,middle of the day I got this awesome new clock but I don't
,,know how to tell time yet so I do not know when to go to sleep hey
,,I've got an idea maybe you guys can help me. Will you help
,,me learn how to tell time so I know when to go to bed Thanks guys  I appreciate it let's zoom over
,,here to the clocks learn how to tell time this first clock we see is an analog clock this is the new clock
,,I got to learn time let's start off with an
,,easier version of this clock okay the little pointer that spins is
,,called hand this clock is a training clock and only
,,has one small hand on it the small hand is called the our hand around the edge of the clock we have
,,numbers that go from one all the way to 12 this small hand tells
,,us what the hour is right now our hand is pointing to the
,,three so it must be 3 o'clock now what hour is
,,it? 6 o'clock right let's look at another what hours is this? I heard some of you
,,say it is still six o'clock and you're correct that our does not change until it is
,,pointing right at the next number as long as the hand points between the
,,six in the seven it is still six o'clock let's try one
,,more right now the hour hand is between the
,,11 and the 12 so is this eleven o'clock or twelve
,,o'clock? it is still eleven o'clock it will not be twelve o'clock until the
,,our hand points right at the 12 good job guys. Now this training clock
,,works great to tell us what our readers but what if
,,"you have to be home by a certain time in the middle hour, it would be"
,,"difficult to know exactly when to leave with just using the our hand, that is why"
,,we have what we call the minute hand let's bring in one of our big kid clocks
,,this clock has a big hand and a small hand we already know the
,,small hand tells us the hour but do you know what this hand does?
,,This long is the minute hand the minute hand
,,"tells us how much time has passed after the hour. When telling time we always look at the hour hand first, on"
,,this clock the hour hand is pointing to the 12 and the
,,minute hand is pointing to the one so would we say the time is 12 and one
,,minute? I know you might be tempted to say yes
,,but that is not correct each one of these increments are counted
,,by 5's there are five minutes between each of
,,these big numbers so when the minute hand is that the one
,,five minutes have passed so this is five minutes 10 minutes 15 minutes 20 minutes 25 minutes 30 minutes 35 minutes forty minutes 45 minutes 50 minutes 55
,,minutes and at the 12 the minute stock back over
,,zero so right now the time is 12 05 the hour hand is at the 12 and the minute hand is pointing at the
,,one which is five minutes let's look at another one remember we first look at the small hand
,,for the hour. It is halfway between the three and
,,the four so it's just a our hand we know it is 3
,,o'clock now we look at the minute hand it is
,,pointing to the six does that mean it is three and six
,,minutes? No you are right we have to count by fives
,,"to get the minutes let's count 5 10 15 20 25 30 30 minutes, so the time is 3:30 because the hour is three and after"
,,counting by 5's we see that the minute hand is pointing to 30 minutes let's do one last one can you help me
,,out on this one great okay you caught me sleeping
,,earlier because my bedtime is 8 o'clock at night when I saw the big hand pointing to the
,,eight I thought it was my bedtime to get the correct time we need to look
,,at that our hand first what number is the small our hand
,,pointing to? it is that the 2 still so that hour is 2 great job now how many
,,minutes have passed remember to count by increments of five
,,can you tell me what the minutes are? The minutes are 40 so the time is 2:40 great job everyone now that I know how to tell time I will
,,not try to sleep at 2:40 in the afternoon thank you so much for your help guys
,,remember to keep practicing and you will get better at this we'll see you next time goodbye

angles,dhpvSGLBEPE,leave the food machines all our food finally comes from plants either directly or indirectly plants are special because they do not have to look for food as they make their own food they take up nutrients from the soil through their roots and the stems carry them up to the leaves which ultimately prepares the food leave most leaves a green thin and slack the green color of the leaf is due to the presence of a substance called chlorophyll please come in different sizes shapes and arrangements some leaves are made up of many smaller leaves called leaflets sometimes the leaflets grow in pairs they are all joined to a central stop this talk is further attached to the stem of the plant structure of a leaf even though leaves look very different they all have the same part and perform the same functions the leaf has two 
,,parts one the stalk which joins the leaf to the stem it is through this talk that water and mineral reach the leaf from the stem and the food prepared by the leaf pass on to the other part of the plants to the blade comprises of the green expanded or sometimes reddish part of the leaf called the lamina that houses the midrib and the net like arrangement of veins and smaller and thinner vein let's wings perform the function of distribution of food water and minerals to and from the leaves rains of belief act like a boon they keep the leaf blade stiff and flat so that it can absorb maximum sunlight edge of the blade of the leaf is called its margin leaves differ in size shape of leaf margin they may be smooth sharp or wavy the upper side and the underside of each leaf is different the upper side has a vac fire thicker surface than the underside the upper side of the leaves always faces the Sun the Sun ste evaporates the water inside the leaf so the waxy coat reduces the amount 
,,of water that the leaf loses on the underside of the leaf there are lots of tiny holes called stomata these help the plant to breathe Lance can open and close these 
,,to matter when it is very hot they close them to stop too much water from evaporating types of pls leaves which have a single blade attached to the stem of the plant are four simple leaves a lead stalk that has more than one leaf blades on it is called a compound leaf photosynthesis photo is derived from a Greek word force meaning light synthesis means putting together the leaves trap the energy in sunlight using chlorophyll this energy is used to make sugar from carbon dioxide which they get through their stomata and water which is absorbed by the roots the process is called photosynthesis plants use some of the sugar prepared during photosynthesis to grow the extra sugar is converted into starch and is stored in the different parts of the plant of future use this is what makes plants a healthy food for us as the plants prepare their food they produce oxygen gas this gas is released into the air this way the green plants purify the air leaves are not only important to the plants but also to us we should not sense the sleep block leaves or break the branches of any tree

angles,JxkWSDpfOFY,good morning students today we shall revise how to find the area of square and rectangle let's begin what does the term AVR mean easier measures the surface of a simple closed region the units of area are the square of the units of length thus area can be expressed in square units such as square centimeters square meters or square kilometers there are two methods to find the area one is by dividing a region into unit squares and thereafter counting the unit squares and the other is by using formula let's learn about each of these in a bit detail first let's see how to find the area of a simple closed region my counting unit squares when the region is divided into unit squares look at the square a-b-c-d it is divided into 25 equal squares or side 1 centimeter each thus we say that the area of square a b c d is equal to 25 square centimeters square centimeters can also be written as s you see em in short now let's find the area of the hidden figure look at the bigger yeah each 
,,square equals one square centimeter and each half square equals to half square centimeter thus on counting we get that the given figure has 14 squares and 2 half squares therefore the area of this given figure is equal to 14 plus ha plus 1/2 which is 15 square centimeters when finding the area of a plane figure by counting the unit squares remember one we ignore or do not count the squares that are less than half - if a square is more than half we count the area as one square unit now let's see how to find the area using formulas the area of a rectangle can be found by using the formula e is equal to L into B where E is the area L is the length and B is the breadth of the rectangle let's use this formula to find the area of a rectangle p q r s having length 7 units and Brett 5 units rectangle PQRS has length of 7 
,,units and bread or five units therefore by using formula area is equal to length into breadth we get the easier as 35 square units now let's all one more example to 
,,understand it in a better way find the area of a rectangle having length 33 meters and read 10 meters area is equal to Len into red which is equal to 33 into 10 which is equal to 330 square meters the formula to find the area of a square is different it is a is equal to s into s where s is equal to the length of the side of the 
,,square let's find the area of the square W X Y Z having side 13 units using this formula as the length of the side of the square W X Y Z is of 13 units using the formula area is equal to site into site we get to the answer as 169 square units now let's solve one more example to understand it in a better way find the area of a square having side of plan nine centimeters area is equal to side into side which is equal to 9 into 9 which is equal to 81 square centimeters remember the formulas one area of a rectangle is equal to length into red to area of a square is equal to site into side kids if you remember the formulas then finding the area will not be

angles,4DxWQqJ-Pas,fractions lowest terms today let us learn about fractions in the lowest terms a fraction is in its lowest terms or simplest form when its numerator and denominator have no common factor other than one look at a few examples example 1 4 upon 7 is in its lowest terms let us see how first let us find the factors of 4 and 7 factors 
,,of 4 are 1 2 & 4 factors of 7 are 1 & 7 here the common factor of 4 & 7 is 1 thus we see that 4 upon 7 is in its lowest terms example 2 8 upon 12 is not in its lowest terms let us see how factors of 8 are 1 2 4 and 8 factors of 12 are 1 2 3 4 6 and 12 here the common factors of 8 and 12 are 1 2 & 4 thus we see that 8 upon 12 is 
,,not in its lowest terms kids now let us see how to reduce a fraction to its lowest terms or its simplest form to do this we divide the numerator and the denominator 
,,by their highest common factor let us understand it in a better way by solving a few examples example 1 write 5 upon 15 in its lowest terms or simplest form first we find the factors of 5 and 15 factors of 5 are 1 and 5 factors of 15 are 1 3 5 and 15 here the 8 CF of 5 and 15 is 5 as stated earlier we will divide both the numerator that is 5 and the denominator that is 15 by 5 thus 5/5 upon 15 divided by 5 is equal to 1 upon 3 therefore the lowest terms or simplest form of 5 upon 15 is 1 upon 3 as 1 & 3 have only 1 as their common factor example to write 10 upon 25 in its lowest terms to do this first let us find out the factors of 10 and 25 here the 8 CF of 10 and 25 is 5 thus 10 divided by 5 upon 25 divided by 5 is equal to 2 upon 5 kids we can also use the repeated division method to find the lowest terms here 
,,the final quotients obtained while finding the 8 CF will be the numerator and the denominator of the simplest form of the given fraction here 2 and 5 are the quotients obtained while finding the 8 CF thus 2 will be the numerator and 5 will be the denominator therefore 10 upon 25 reduced to its lowest terms gives 2 upon 5 now let us look at one last example right 32 upon 64 in its simplest form let us use the repeated division method again so here we get 1 & 2 as the final quotients hence 1

angles,XF-geNjYU68,polygons hello kids today let us learn more about polygons let's start we know that a polygon is a closed geometrical figure founded by three or more line segments now let us look at some of the polygons a triangle is a three-sided polygon a quadrilateral is a four-sided polygon a pentagon has five sites a hexagon has six sites 
,,a seven sided polygon is called a septagon and eight sided polygons is called an octagon a nine sided polygon is called an onigen and the 10 sided polygon is called 
,,a deck again now if we have to find out the sum of the angles of a polygon what do we do this is the formula to find that sum of the angles of a polygon is equal to 
,,number of triangles into which the figure is divided multiplied by 180 degrees now to get the number of triangles the figure can be divided in two we subtract two from the number of sites of the given picker let us take an example of a quadrilateral to understand it in a better way a quadrilateral is a four-sided polygon keppo for sites minus two is equal to two triangles therefore the sum of the angles of a quadrilateral is equal to 2 into 180 degrees that is equal to 360 degrees let us find out the sum of the angles of a few polygons to find out the sum of the angles of polygons we need to find out the number of triangles it can be divided into and then use the formula to find the sum of the angles of polygons if the given figure is a hexagon the number of triangles it can be divided into is six sides minus two 
,,is equal to four therefore the sum of its angles is four into 180 degrees is equal to 720 degrees next let us look at an onigen number of triangles it can be divided into is equal to seven therefore the sum of its angles is 1260 degrees wasn't it fun learning about the polygons similarly you can find the sum of angles of the other polygons to you

angles,x_cItHt_T0A,you volume of a cube today we will learn how to find the volume of a cube let's begin the volume of a solid is the amount of space it occupies we know that a cube is a solid geometrical object with six faces each face of a cube is a square in the figure the length breadth and height are marked but as it is a cube all its edges measure the same therefore let us call each of its edges aside we get the volume of a cube by multiplying its length red and height thus volume of a cube is equal to 
,,side into side into side which is equal to s into s into s is equal to s cubed the unit of volume is cubic centimetre or cubic meter we write it as soon let us solve an example find the volume of a cube having side as six centimeters volume of a cube is equal to side cubed which is equal to six cubed which is equal to 6 into 6 into 6 which is equal to 216 cubic centimeters therefore the volume of the given cube is 216 cubic centimeters now let us solve a story problem if length breadth and 
,,height of each block is equal to four meters then find the volume or 60 such blocks it is given that side is equal to four meters number of blocks is equal to 60 firstly let us find the volume of one block which is equal to sight cubed which is equal to 4 into 4 into 4 which is equal to 64 cubic meters volume of 60 such blocks is equal to volume of one block into number of blocks which is equal to 64 into 60 is equal to 3840 cubic meters thus the volume of 60 such blocks is 3840 cubic meters was added fun learning about Q and its volume now you try solving a few more examples on your own

angles,H-de6Tkxej8,Let's say we have one ray over
,,here that starts at point A and then goes through
,,point B. And so we could call this
,,ray-- let me draw that a little bit straighter--
,,"we could call this ray AB. Ray AB starts at A,"
,,or has a vertex at A. And let's say that
,,there's also a ray AC. So let's say that C is
,,sitting right over there. And then I can draw another
,,ray that goes through C. So this is ray AC. And what's interesting
,,about these two rays is that they have the
,,exact same vertex. They have the exact
,,"same vertex at A. And in general,"
,,what we have when we have two rays that have
,,"the exact same vertex, you have an angle. And you're probably"
,,already reasonably familiar with the concept
,,"of an angle, which I believe comes from the Latin"
,,"for corner, which makes sense. This looks like a"
,,little bit of a corner right over here that
,,we see at point A. But the geometric
,,"definition, or the one that you're most"
,,"likely to see, is when two rays share"
,,a common vertex. And that common
,,vertex is actually called the vertex of the angle. So A is the vertex. Not only is it the vertex of
,,"each of these rays, ray AB and ray AC, it is also"
,,the vertex of the angle. So the next thing I
,,want to think about is how do we label an angle. You might be tempted to
,,just label it angle A. But I'll show you in a
,,second why that's not going to be so clear
,,"to someone, based on where our angle"
,,is actually sitting. So the way that you
,,specify an angle-- and hopefully this will
,,make sense in a second-- is that you say angle-- this
,,"is the symbol for angle, and it actually looks"
,,strangely similar to this angle right over here. But this little
,,"pointy thing, or it almost looks like"
,,a less-than sign. But it's not quite. It's flat on the
,,"bottom right over here. This is the symbol for angle. You'd say angle BAC. Or you could say angle CAB. In either case, they're kind"
,,of specifying this corner. Or sometimes you could
,,view it as this opening right over here. And the important
,,thing to realize is that you have the vertex
,,in the middle of the letters. Now you might be
,,"saying, wait, why go through the trouble"
,,of listing all three of these letters. Why can't I just
,,"call this angle A? And to see that, let me"
,,show you another diagram. And although the geometric
,,definition of an angle involves two rays that have
,,"the same vertex, in practice, you're going to see"
,,many angles that are made up of lines
,,and line segments. And you could imagine that
,,you could continue those line segments on and on
,,"in one direction. And then they would become rays. So in that way,"
,,they're consistent with this definition. But let's say I have one line
,,segment that looks like that. Let me label some points here. So we've already used ABC. So I'm going to
,,"call this D and E, points D and E. So this"
,,is line segment DE. And let's say I also
,,have a line segment FG. And let's say this point
,,"where these two line segments intersect, let's"
,,call that point point H. Now how could we specify this
,,"angle right over here? Can we just call that angle H? Well, no. Because if we just said angle H,"
,,"the angle that has a vertex H, it could be this"
,,angle right over here. Or it could be this
,,angle right over here. Let me draw it this way. You could view it that way. Or it could be that
,,angle over there. It could be this
,,angle over here. It could be this
,,angle over here. Or it could be that
,,angle over there. And so the only way
,,to really specify which angle you're talking about
,,"well, is to give three letters. So if you really did want"
,,"to talk about that angle right over there, you"
,,would call that angle EHG. So that is angle EHG. Or you could actually
,,call that angle GHE. If you wanted to specify
,,"this angle right over here, the one made up of, if you"
,,"imagine that ray and that ray, if you were to keep on"
,,"going past those points, then you could call that"
,,"angle DHG, or angle GHD. I think you get the point. This angle up here"
,,could be FHD or EHF. And this one could
,,be FHD or DHF. And when you do
,,"it this way, it's very clear what angle"
,,you are referring to. So now that we have a general
,,"idea of what an angle is, and kind of how do we"
,,"denote it with symbols, the next thing you"
,,"might be curious about is, it doesn't look like all"
,,angles are kind of the same. It seems like some
,,angles open up or are more open than others. And some are a little bit
,,"more closed in than others. And that actually is the case. So for example, let's"
,,take two angles here. So let's say I have one
,,"angle that looks like that. So I'll started reusing letters. So let's say that this is A, B"
,,and C. I could make these rays. I could keep on going and
,,make them rays if I like. Or I could just keep
,,"them as line segments. So right over here,"
,,I have angle BAC. And let's say over
,,"here, I have angle-- so let me draw another one-- and"
,,"let's say this is angle XYZ. And once again, I"
,,"could draw them as rays if I like, to go"
,,on and on and on. So it's angle XY and Z. And so when you
,,"just look at these, you just eyeball"
,,"these two angles, it looks like this"
,,one is more open. So this one looks more open. While this one over here looks
,,"more closed, at least relative to this one. So maybe when we"
,,"measure angles, we should measure it based on"
,,how open or closed they are. And that actually is the case. And so without even telling
,,"you how we measure an angle, you could say that the measure"
,,"of angle XYZ, the measure of this angle, is greater"
,,than the measure of this angle right over here. And any convention we use for
,,measuring angles is essentially going to be a measure
,,of how open or how closed an angle actually is. And I'll take that
,,up in the next video where we'll see how to
,,actually measure an angle.
,,
angles,hmj3_zbz2eg,What I want to do
,,now is just a series of problems that really make
,,sure that we know what we're doing with parallel lines and
,,triangles and all the rest. And what we have right here
,,is a fairly classic problem. And what I want to do is I
,,"want to figure out, just given the information"
,,here-- so obviously I have a triangle here. I have another
,,triangle over here. We were given some of the angles
,,inside of these triangles. Given the information
,,"over here, I want to figure out what"
,,the measure of this angle is right over there. I need to figure out what
,,that question mark is. And so you might want
,,to give a go at it just knowing what you know about
,,the sums of the measures of the angles inside of
,,"a triangle, and maybe a little bit of what you know"
,,about supplementary angles. So you might want to pause
,,it and give it a try yourself because I'm about to
,,give you the solution. So the first thing
,,you might say-- and this is a
,,general way to think about a lot of these problems
,,where they give you some angles and you have to figure out
,,some other angles based on the sum of angles and
,,"a triangle equaling 180, or this one doesn't have"
,,parallel lines on it. But you might see some
,,with parallel lines and supplementary lines
,,and complementary lines-- is to just fill in everything
,,"that you can figure out, and one way or"
,,"another, you probably would be able to figure out"
,,what this question mark is. So the first thing that
,,kind of pops out to me is we have one triangle
,,right over here. We have this
,,triangle on the left. And on this triangle
,,"on the left, we're given 2 of the angles. And if you have 2 of the"
,,"angles in a triangle, you can always figure"
,,out the third angle because they're going to
,,"add up to 180 degrees. So if you call that x, we"
,,know that x plus 50 plus 64 is going to be equal
,,"to 180 degrees. Or we could say, x"
,,"plus, what is this, 114. X plus 114 is equal"
,,to 180 degrees. We could subtract 114 from
,,"both sides of this equation, and we get x is equal"
,,"to 180 minus 114. So 80 minus 14. 80 minus 10 would be 70,"
,,"minus another 4 is 66. So x is 66 degrees. Now, if x is 66"
,,"degrees, I think you might find that there's"
,,another angle that's not too hard to figure out. So let me write it like this. Let me write x is
,,equal to 66 degrees. Well if we know this
,,"angle right over here, if we know the measure of"
,,"this angle is 66 degrees, we know that that"
,,angle is supplementary with this angle right over here. Their outer sides
,,"form a straight angle, and they are adjacent. So if we call this"
,,"angle right over here, y, we know that"
,,y plus x is going to be equal to 180 degrees. And we know x is
,,equal to 66 degrees. So this is 66. And so we can subtract
,,"66 from both sides, and we get y is equal to--"
,,these cancel out-- 180 minus 66 is 114. And that number might look
,,"a little familiar to you. Notice, this 114 was"
,,the exact same sum of these 2 angles over here. And that's actually
,,"a general idea, and I'll do it on the side"
,,"here just to prove it to you. If I have, let's say that"
,,these 2 angles-- let's say that the measure
,,"of that angle is a, the measure"
,,"of that angle is b, the measure of"
,,this angle we know is going to be 180
,,minus a minus b. That's this angle
,,"right over here. And then this angle,"
,,"which is considered to be an exterior angle. So in this example, y"
,,"is an exterior angle. In this example, that"
,,is our exterior angle. That is going to be
,,supplementary to 180 minus a minus b. So this angle plus
,,180 minus a minus b is going to be equal to 180. So if you call this
,,"angle y, you would have y plus 180 minus a"
,,minus b is equal to 180. You could subtract
,,180 from both sides. You could add a plus
,,b to both sides. So plus a plus b. Running out of space
,,on the right hand side. And then you're left
,,"with-- these cancel out. On the left hand side,"
,,you're left with y. On the right hand side
,,is equal to a plus b. So this is just a
,,general property. You can just reason
,,it through yourself just with the sum of the
,,measures of the angles inside of a triangle add
,,"up to 180 degrees, and then you have a"
,,"supplementary angles right over here. Or you could just say, look,"
,,"if I have the exterior angles right over here,"
,,it's equal to the sum of the remote interior angles. That's just a little
,,"terminology you could see there. So y is equal to a plus b. 114 degrees, we've already"
,,"shown to ourselves, is equal to 64 plus 50 degrees. But anyway, regardless"
,,"of how we do it, if we just reason"
,,it out step by step or if we just knew this
,,"property from the get go, if we know that y is"
,,equal to 114 degrees-- and I like to reason it out
,,"every time just to make sure I'm not jumping to conclusions. So if y is 114 degrees,"
,,now we know this angle. We were given this
,,angle in the beginning. Now we just have to figure
,,"out this third angle in this triangle. So if we call this z, if we"
,,"call this question mark is equal to z, we know"
,,that z plus 114 plus 31 is equal to 180 degrees. The sums of the measures of
,,the angle inside of a triangle add up to 180 degrees. That's the only property
,,"we're using in this step. So we get z plus, what is"
,,"this, 145 is equal to 180. Did I do that right? We have a 15, then a 30. Yep, 145 is equal to 180. Subtract 145 from both"
,,"sides of this equation, and we are left with z is equal"
,,to 80 minus 45 is equal to 35. So z is equal to 35
,,"degrees, and we are done."
,,
angles,92aLiyeQj0w,Now that we know
,,"what an angle is, let's think about how"
,,we can measure them. And we already hinted
,,at one way to think about the measure of angle in
,,"the last video where we said, look, this angle XYZ seems"
,,more open than angle BAC. So maybe the
,,measure of angle XYZ should be larger than
,,"the angle of the BAC, and that is exactly"
,,the way we think about the measures of angles. But what I want to
,,do in this video is come up with an exact
,,way to measure an angle. So what I've drawn over here is
,,"a little bit of a half-circle, and it looks very"
,,similar to a tool that you can buy at your
,,local school supplies store to measure angles. So this is actually a little bit
,,of a drawing of a protractor. And what we do in something
,,like a protractor-- you could even construct
,,one with a piece of paper-- is we've taken a
,,"half-circle right here, and we've divided it"
,,"into a 180 sections, and each of these marks"
,,marks 10 of those sections. And what you do
,,for any given angle is you put one of the
,,sides of the angle. So each of the rays
,,of an angle are considered one of its sides. So you put the
,,vertex of the angle at the center of
,,this half-circle-- or if you're dealing with
,,"an actual protractor, at the center of"
,,that protractor-- and then you put one
,,side along the 0 mark. So I'm going redraw this
,,angle right over here at the center of
,,"this protractor. So if we said this is Y, then"
,,"the Z goes right over here. And then the other ray, ray"
,,"YX in this circumstance, will go roughly"
,,in that direction. And so it is pointing on the
,,protractor to the-- let's see. This looks like this
,,"is the 70th of section. This is the 80th section. So maybe this is, I would"
,,"guess, the 77th section. So this is pointing"
,,to 77 right over here. Assuming that I drew it the
,,"right way right over here, we could say the measure of"
,,angle XYZ-- sometimes they'll just say angle XYZ is equal
,,"to, but this is a little bit more formal-- the measure"
,,"of angle XYZ is equal to 77. Each of these little sections,"
,,"we call them ""degrees."" So it's equal to"
,,"77-- sometimes it's written like that, the same"
,,"way you would write ""degrees"" for the temperature outside. So you could write ""77 degrees"""
,,like that or you could actually write out the word
,,right over there. So each of these
,,"sections are degrees, so we're measuring in degrees. And I want to be clear,"
,,"degrees aren't the only way to measure angles. Really, anything that"
,,measures the openness. So when you go
,,"into trigonometry, you'll learn that you"
,,"can measure angles, not only in degrees,"
,,"but also using something called ""radians."" But I'll leave that"
,,to another day. So let's measure this
,,"other angle, angle BAC. So once again, I'll"
,,"put A at the center, and then AC I'll put along the 0"
,,degree edge of this half-circle or of this protractor. And then I'll point
,,"AB in the-- well, assuming that I'm drawing"
,,"it exactly the way that it's over there. Normally, instead"
,,"of moving the angle, you could actually move the"
,,protractor to the angle. So it looks something
,,"like that, and you could see that it's pointing to"
,,right about the 30 degree mark. So we could say that
,,the measure of angle BAC is equal to 30 degrees. And so you can look
,,just straight up from evaluating these
,,numbers that 77 degrees is clearly larger than 30
,,"degrees, and so it is a larger angle, which makes sense"
,,"because it is a more open angle. And in general, there's a"
,,couple of interesting angles to think about. If you have a 0 degree
,,"angle, you actually have something that's"
,,just a closed angled. It really is just a
,,ray at that point. As you get larger and larger or
,,"as you get more and more open, you eventually get to a"
,,point where one of the rays is completely
,,straight up and down while the other one
,,is left to right. So you could imagine
,,an angle that looks like this where one ray
,,goes straight up down like that and the other ray goes
,,straight right and left. Or you could imagine
,,"something like an angle that looks like this where, at least,"
,,"the way you're looking at it, one doesn't look"
,,straight up down or one does it look
,,"straight right left. But if you rotate it, it would"
,,look just like this thing right over here where one is
,,going straight up and down and one is going
,,straight right and left. And you can see from our
,,measure right over here that that gives us
,,"a 90 degree angle. It's a very interesting angle. It shows up many, many times"
,,"in geometry and trigonometry, and there's a special word"
,,"for a 90 degree angle. It is called a ""right angle."" So this right over"
,,"here, assuming if you rotate it around,"
,,would look just like this. We would call this
,,"a ""right angle."" And there is a notation to"
,,show that it's a right angle. You draw a little part of
,,"a box right over there, and that tells us that this"
,,"is, if you were to rotate it, exactly up and down while"
,,"this is going exactly right and left, if"
,,"you were to rotate it properly, or vice versa. And then, as you"
,,"go even wider, you get wider and wider"
,,and wider and wider until you get all the way to
,,an angle that looks like this. So you could imagine
,,an angle where the two rays in that
,,angle form a line. So let's say this is
,,"point X. This is point Y, and this is point Z. You"
,,"could call this angle ZXY, but it's really"
,,"so open that it's formed an actual line here. Z, X, and Y are collinear. This is a 180 degree angle where"
,,we see the measure of angle ZXY is 180 degrees. And you can actually
,,go beyond that. So if you were to go all
,,the way around the circle so that you would get back
,,to 360 degrees and then you could keep going around
,,"and around and around, and you'll start to"
,,see a lot more of that when you enter a
,,"trigonometry class. Now, there's two"
,,last things that I want to introduce in this video. There are special
,,"words, and I'll talk about more types of"
,,angles in the next video. But if an angle is
,,"less than 90 degrees, so, for example, both of"
,,these angles that we started our discussion with are
,,"less than 90 degrees, we call them ""acute angles."" So this is acute. So that is an acute"
,,"angle, and that is an acute angle"
,,right over here. They are less than 90 degrees. What does a non-acute
,,angle look like? And there's a word for
,,"it other than non-acute. Well, it would be"
,,"more than 90 degrees. So, for example-- let"
,,me do this in a color I haven't used-- an angle
,,"that looks like this, and let me draw it a little"
,,bit better than that. An angle it looks like this. So that's one side of the
,,angle or one of the rays and then I'll put the other
,,"one on the baseline right over here. Clearly, this is"
,,larger than 90 degrees. If I were to
,,"approximate, let's see, that's 100, 110,"
,,"120, almost 130. So let's call that maybe"
,,"a 128-degree angle. We call this an ""obtuse angle."" The way I remember it as acute,"
,,"it's kind of ""a cute"" angle. It's nice and small. I believe acute in either Latin"
,,"or Greek or maybe both means something like ""pin"" or ""sharp."" So that's one way"
,,to think about it. An acute angle
,,"seems much sharper. Obtuse, I kind of"
,,imagine something that's kind of
,,lumbering and large. Or you could think
,,it's not acute. It's not nice and
,,small and pointy. So that's one way
,,"to think about it, but this is just"
,,"general terminology for different types of angles. Less than 90 degrees,"
,,"you have an acute angle. At 90 degrees, you"
,,"have a right angle. Larger than 90 degrees,"
,,"you have an obtuse angle. And then, if you get all"
,,"the way to 180 degrees, your angle actually"
,,forms a line.
,,
angles,DGKwdHMiqCg," Hi! Welcome to Math Antics. We're continuing our series on Geometry   and today we're going to learn about angles. In our last video, we learned about points and lines, and that's good because"
,,we are going to need lines to make angles. So let's start with a couple of lines
,,that are in the same plane. We're only going to be dealing with
,, two-dimensional geometry in this video.  These lines are conveniently called
,," Line AB and Line CD. Now the important thing to notice about these two lines is that they're pointing in exactly the same direction.  So, even if we extended  them "
,,"forever, they would never cross or even get closer together. When two lines are arranged like this,"
,,we call them 'parallel'. You've probably heard the term 'parallel' before…
,,"like parallel parking, or a parallel universe, or parallel bars. Okay, so parallel lines are lines that will"
,,"never cross, even if they go on forever... but what if I take one of our lines and"
,,give it a little nudge? Now the lines aren't parallel anymore.
,,"In fact, they cross at this point right here. Let's name it Point P.  When lines cross at a point like this,"
,,"we say that they intersect, and we call the point an 'intersection'. And when lines intersect, they form 'angles'. You can think of the angles as the spaces, or shapes, that are formed between the intersecting lines.  These intersecting lines form four angles: 1, 2, 3, 4. But instead of calling them angle 1, 2, 3 and 4,  in Geometry,"
,,"we name them by the points used to make them. For example, this angle here can be called Angle DPB  because if you trace along those points"
,,"(like connect the dots) they outline that angle. And this angle here... we can call that Angle APD, because connecting those dots forms angle. Now when naming angles,"
,,"there's a nice shorthand we can use.  Instead of writing the word 'angle' over and over again, we can just use the angle symbol instead,"
,,"which looks like this. But there's an even simpler way to name angles. To learn that way,"
,,let's erase all the points and letters on our lines except for the intersection point and this one point here. Now let's imagine that the line-segment between these 
,,"two points can rotate around the point of intersection, just like a clock hand rotates"
,,"around the center of a clock.  Let's also imagine that as we rotate the line segment, the point out at the end leaves a trail,"
,,"like if a pencil was attached to it. The trail (or path) that is left when we rotate the line-segment all the way around forms a circle. But if we only go part way around,"
,,then it forms part of a circle that we call an 'arc'. This arc can represent the angle
,,"that is formed when we rotate the segment from one position to another,"
,,"like from this line to that line. And now, if we shrink down that arc so that"
,,"it's close to the intersection point, and then put a letter by it, like the letter 'A',"
,,"we have another way of showing an angle... Angle A. And we can do this with any angle,"
,,"so the angle up here... we can also draw an arc and call it Angle B. So whenever you see a letter next to a little arc like this, it means that it's the name of the "
,,angle
,,"formed by that arc. Alright then, so now we have a diagram that shows Angle A and Angle B, and you might notice that those angles"
,,aren't the same size.  B seems to be bigger than A. But what if we rotate one of our lines until
,,the angles do look like they're the same size? Now our angles look kind of like a plus sign.
,,Lines arranged like this are called 'perpendicular'. Perpendicular lines are lines that form square corners when they intersect. And these square corner angles have 
,,"a special name in Geometry because they are really important. We call them 'right angles'. There is even a special symbol that we use to show when an angle is a right angle.  Because they form square corners,  we use a little square instead of"
,,"the arc that we use for the other angles. So whenever you see this symbol,"
,,"you know the angle you are looking at is a right angle, and that the lines that form it are perpendicular. Okay, now that you know what a right angle is, let's look "
,,"at a simple one that's made from just two rays. What will happen if we take the ray pointing up and rotate it like the hand of a clock a little to the right… a little bit clockwise? Well, we don't have a right angle any more"
,,"because the rays are no longer perpendicular. Instead, we have an angle that is smaller"
,,(or less) than a right angle. Angles that are less than right angles
,,"are called 'acute angles'. On the other hand, if we rotated our ray to"
,,"the left instead of the right, we would get an angle that's bigger"
,,or greater than a right angle.  Angles that are greater than right angles
,,"are called 'obtuse angles'. So, there are three main kinds of angles"
,,"that you need to know about.  Right Angles, acute angles and obtuse angles. Well actually, there's one more type of"
,,"angle that's pretty important, but it's kind of a strange one."
,,"It's called a 'straight angle'. A straight angle is just what we get when we rotate our rays so that they point in exactly opposite directions. The result looks just like a straight line,"
,,"which is why it's called a straight angle. Alright then, there's just a few more important geometry terms that we need to learn in this video.  Let's look at our simple right angle"
,,"again that's made from two rays. But this time, let's draw a third ray that"
,,"cuts that right angle into two smaller parts. Now, because the angle that we divided up"
,,"was a right angle,  we know that the two new smaller angles"
,,"combine to form a right angle. And in geometry, any two angles that to form a right angle are called 'complementary angles'. And we can do the same thing with a straight angle.  If we take a straight angle (made from two rays)  and divide it with a third ray,"
,,two new smaller angles are formed. And those two angles combine to form a straight angle.
,,"We call these angles 'supplementary angles'. So, complementary angles"
,,"combine to form a right angle,  and supplementary angles"
,,"combine to form a straight angle. Alright, that's all were going to learn about angles"
,,"in this video. And if you are new to Geometry,"
,,"it might seem like a lot, so let's do a quick review of"
,,"all the new geometry words we've learned. Lines that point in exactly the same direction will never cross and are called 'parallel' lines. When lines do cross, they "
,,cross at a point
,,called an 'intersection'. Lines that intersect form 'angles'. You can
,,think of angles as the spaces between the lines. Angles can be named by the points that
,,"form them... just like connect the dots. An 'arc' is a part of a circle. Arcs can be used to represent an angle between two intersecting lines. When intersecting lines form all exactly equal angles, the lines are 'perpendicular'. Perpendicular lines form 'right angles'."
,,"Right angles are square corners,  and we use a special square symbol"
,,"to show that an angle is a right angle. An angle that's smaller, or less than a right"
,,"angle is called an 'acute angle'. An angle that's bigger, or greater than a"
,,right angle is called an 'obtuse angle'. A 'straight angle' is formed by two rays pointing
,,in exactly opposite directions.  A straight angle is really just a straight line. Two angles that combine to form a right angle
,,are called 'complementary angles'. Two angles that combine to form a straight
,,"angle are called 'supplementary angles'. In our next geometry video, we're going to"
,,"learn more about angles and how to measure them. Thanks for watching Math Antics, and I'll"

angles,iqeGTtyzQ1I,"So in this diagram over here,"
,,I have this big triangle. And then I have all these
,,other little triangles inside of this big triangle. And what I want to do is
,,see if I can figure out the measure of this
,,angle right here. And we'll call
,,that measure theta. And they tell us a
,,few other things. You might have seen
,,this symbol before. That means that these
,,are right angles or that they have a
,,"measure of 90 degrees. So that's a 90-degree angle,"
,,"that is a 90-degree angle, and that is a 90-degree"
,,angle over there. And they also tell us that this
,,angle over here is 32 degrees. So let's see what we can do. And maybe we can solve this
,,in multiple different ways. That's what's really
,,fun about these is there's multiple ways
,,to solve these problems. So if this angle
,,"is theta, we have theta is adjacent"
,,to this green angle. And if you add them
,,"together, you're going to get this right angle. So this pink angle, theta,"
,,"plus this green angle must be equal to 90 degrees. When you combine them,"
,,you get a right angle. So you could call this
,,one-- its measure is going to be 90 minus beta. And now we have three
,,"angles in the triangle, and we just have"
,,to solve for theta. Because we know this angle
,,plus this angle plus this angle are going to be
,,equal to 180 degrees. So you have 90 minus theta plus
,,90 degrees plus 32 degrees-- so I'm going to do that
,,in a different color-- is going to be equal
,,to 180 degrees. The sum of the measures of
,,the angle inside of a triangle add up to 180 degrees. That's all we're
,,doing over here. And so let's see if we can
,,simplify this a little bit. So these two guys--
,,"90 plus 90's going to be 180, so you get"
,,180 minus theta plus 32 is equal to 180 degrees. And then what else do we have? We have 180 on both sides. We can subtract that
,,from both sides. So that cancels out. That goes to 0. And then you have negative theta
,,plus 32 degrees is equal to 0. You can add theta to both sides. And you get 32 degrees
,,"is equal to theta, or theta is equal to 32 degrees. So it's going to actually be"
,,the same measure as this angle right over here. That's one way to
,,do the problem. There's other ways that we
,,"could have done the problem. Actually, there's a ton of"
,,ways we could have done this. We could have looked at
,,"this big triangle over here. And we could've said, look. If this is 90 degrees over here,"
,,"this is 32 degrees over here, this angle up here"
,,is going to be 180 minus 90 degrees
,,minus 32 degrees. Because they all have to
,,add up to 180 degrees. And I just kind of
,,"skipped a step there. Actually, let me"
,,not skip a step. Let me call this x. If we call the measure
,,"of that angle x, we would have x plus 90. I'm looking at the biggest"
,,triangle in this diagram right here. x plus 90 plus 32 is going
,,to be equal to 180 degrees. And so if you subtract 90
,,and 32 from both sides. So if you subtract 90 from
,,"both sides, you get x plus 32 is equal to 90. And then if you subtract"
,,"32 from both sides, you get x is equal to--"
,,"what is this-- 58 degrees. Fair enough. Now, what else"
,,"can we figure out? Well, if this angle over here"
,,is a right angle-- and I'm just redoing the problem
,,over again just to show you that there's multiple
,,ways to get the answer. We were given that
,,"this is a right angle. If that is 90 degrees,"
,,"then this angle over here is supplementary to it, and"
,,it also has to be 90 degrees. So then we have this angle
,,plus 90 degrees plus this angle have to equal 180. Maybe we could call that y. So y plus 58 plus
,,90 is equal to 180. You can subtract
,,"90 from both sides. Subtract 90 from both sides. This will become 90. Subtract 58 from both sides, you"
,,"get y is equal to 32 degrees. Well, if y is 32 degrees,"
,,it is complementary. It is complementary to
,,this angle right over here. It is complementary-- let
,,"me do that in a new color, not supplementary. It is complementary. It adds up to 90 degrees. It is complementary to"
,,this angle over here. We could call it z. So these two combined are
,,"going to add up to 90 degrees, or z is going to be"
,,equal to 58 degrees. And now we're
,,inside the triangle that we care about
,,"to figure out theta, theta that we've already figured"
,,"out earlier in this video. Well, this z is 58 degrees. If this angle over here is"
,,"90, then this one over here is also going to be 90,"
,,because they're supplementary. So you have 58 degrees. I wanted to do that
,,in that orange color. So if you have 58
,,"degrees, so you have 58 plus this 90,"
,,"plus 90, plus theta now is going to be"
,,equal to 180 degrees. You can subtract
,,"90 from both sides. That becomes 90,"
,,and then you have 58 plus theta is equal to 90. Subtract 58 from both sides. You get theta is equal
,,to 32 degrees again. And so we've got
,,the same answer. I just wanted to
,,"do that, show you that there are multiple"
,,ways to do these problems. And as long as you're doing
,,"things that are logically consistent, you're making"
,,assumptions that you can make and then logically
,,"deducing step by step, there's multiple ways to"
,,get that right answer.
,,
angles,qG3HnRccrQU,We already know that the
,,sum of the interior angles of a triangle add
,,up to 180 degrees. So if the measure
,,"of this angle is a, the measure of this"
,,"angle over here is b, and the measure of"
,,"this angle is c, we know that a plus b plus"
,,c is equal to 180 degrees. But what happens
,,when we have polygons with more than three sides? So let's try the
,,case where we have a four-sided polygon--
,,a quadrilateral. And I am going to
,,make it irregular just to show that whatever we
,,do here it probably applies to any quadrilateral
,,with four sides. Not just things that have right
,,"angles, and parallel lines, and all the rest. Actually, that"
,,looks a little bit too close to being parallel. So let me draw it like this. So the way you can think
,,"about it with a four sided quadrilateral,"
,,is well we already know about this-- the measures
,,of the interior angles of a triangle add up to 180. So maybe we can divide
,,this into two triangles. So from this point
,,"right over here, if we draw a line"
,,"like this, we've divided it into two triangles. And so if the measure this"
,,"angle is a, measure of this is b, measure of"
,,"that is c, we know that a plus b plus c is"
,,equal to 180 degrees. And then if we call this over
,,"here x, this over here y, and that z, those are the"
,,measures of those angles. We know that x plus y plus
,,z is equal to 180 degrees. And so if we want the
,,"measure of the sum of all of the interior angles,"
,,all of the interior angles are going to be
,,b plus z-- that's two of the interior
,,"angles of this polygon-- plus this angle, which is"
,,just going to be a plus x. a plus x is that whole angle. The whole angle for
,,"the quadrilateral. Plus this whole angle, which"
,,is going to be c plus y. And we already know a plus
,,b plus c is 180 degrees. And we know that z plus x plus
,,"y is equal to 180 degrees. So plus 180 degrees, which"
,,is equal to 360 degrees. So I think you see
,,the general idea here. We just have to figure out how
,,"many triangles we can divide something into, and then we"
,,just multiply by 180 degrees since each of those triangles
,,will have 180 degrees. Let's do one more
,,particular example. And then we'll try to do a
,,general version where we're just trying to figure out
,,how many triangles can we fit into that thing. So let me draw an
,,"irregular pentagon. So one, two, three, four, five. So it looks like a little bit"
,,"of a sideways house there. Once again, we can draw"
,,our triangles inside of this pentagon. So that would be
,,one triangle there. That would be another triangle. So I'm able to draw three
,,"non-overlapping triangles that perfectly cover this pentagon. This is one triangle, the other"
,,"triangle, and the other one. And we know each of those"
,,will have 180 degrees if we take the sum
,,of their angles. And we also know that the sum
,,of all of those interior angles are equal to the sum
,,"of the interior angles of the polygon as a whole. And to see that, clearly,"
,,this interior angle is one of the angles
,,of the polygon. This is as well. But when you take the sum
,,"of this one and this one, then you're going to get"
,,that whole interior angle of the polygon. And when you take the sum
,,"of that one and that one, you get that entire one. And then when you take"
,,"the sum of that one plus that one plus that one, you"
,,get that entire interior angle. So if you take the sum of all
,,"of the interior angles of all of these triangles, you're"
,,actually just finding the sum of all of the interior
,,"angles of the polygon. So in this case, you have"
,,"one, two, three triangles. So three times 180"
,,degrees is equal to what? 300 plus 240 is
,,equal to 540 degrees. Now let's generalize it. And to generalize
,,"it, let's realize that just to get our"
,,"first two triangles, we have to use up four sides. We have to use up all the four"
,,sides in this quadrilateral. We had to use up four
,,"of the five sides-- right here-- in this pentagon. One, two, and then three, four. So four sides give"
,,"you two triangles. And it seems like, maybe,"
,,"every incremental side you have after that, you can"
,,get another triangle out of it. Let's experiment with a hexagon. And I'm just going to try to
,,"see how many triangles I get out of it. So one, two, three,"
,,"four, five, six sides. I get one triangle out"
,,"of these two sides. One, two sides of"
,,the actual hexagon. I can get another
,,triangle out of these two sides of the actual hexagon. And it looks like I can
,,get another triangle out of each of the remaining sides. So one out of that one. And then one out of that
,,"one, right over there. So in general, it"
,,seems like-- let's say. So let's say that
,,I have s sides. s-sided polygon. And I'll just
,,"assume-- we already saw the case for four sides,"
,,"five sides, or six sides. So we can assume that s"
,,is greater than 4 sides. Let's say I have
,,"an s-sided polygon, and I want to figure out how"
,,many non-overlapping triangles will perfectly
,,cover that polygon. How many can I fit inside of it? And then I just have to
,,multiply the number of triangles times 180 degrees
,,to figure out what are the sum of the interior
,,angles of that polygon. So let's figure out
,,the number of triangles as a function of
,,"the number of sides. So once again, four"
,,of the sides are going to be used to
,,make two triangles. So those two sides
,,right over there. And then we have two
,,sides right over there. I can draw one triangle
,,over-- and I'm not even going to talk about
,,what happens on the rest of the sides of the polygon. You could imagine putting a
,,big black piece of construction paper. There might be other sides here. I'm not going to even
,,worry about them right now. So out of these two
,,"sides I can draw one triangle, just like that. Out of these two sides, I can"
,,draw another triangle right over there. So four sides used
,,"for two triangles. And then, no matter how many"
,,sides I have left over-- so I've already used four of
,,"the sides, but after that, if I have all sorts"
,,of craziness here. I could have all sorts
,,of craziness here. Let me draw it a little
,,bit neater than that. So I could have all sorts of
,,craziness right over here. It looks like every
,,other incremental side I can get another
,,triangle out of it. So that's one triangle out
,,"of there, one triangle out of that side, one"
,,"triangle out of that side, one triangle out of that side,"
,,"and then one triangle out of this side. So for example, this"
,,"figure that I've drawn is a very irregular-- one, two,"
,,"three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. Is that right? One, two, three, four, five,"
,,"six, seven, eight, nine, 10. It is a decagon. And in this decagon,"
,,four of the sides were used for two triangles. So I got two triangles
,,out of four of the sides. And out of the other
,,"six sides I was able to get a triangle each. These are six. This is one, two,"
,,"three, four, five. Actually, let me make sure I'm"
,,"counting the number of sides right. So I have one, two, three, four,"
,,"five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. So let me make sure. Did I count-- am I just"
,,"not seeing something? Oh, I see. I actually didn't-- I have to"
,,draw another line right over here. These are two different
,,"sides, and so I have to draw another"
,,line right over here. I can get another triangle
,,out of that right over there. And so there you have it. I have these two triangles
,,out of four sides. And out of the other
,,six remaining sides I get a triangle each. So plus six triangles. I got a total of
,,eight triangles. And so we can generally
,,"think about it. The first four, sides we're"
,,going to get two triangles. So let me write this down. So our number of triangles
,,"is going to be equal to 2. And then, I've already"
,,used four sides. So the remaining sides
,,I get a triangle each. So the remaining sides
,,are going to be s minus 4. So the number of triangles are
,,going to be 2 plus s minus 4. 2 plus s minus 4
,,is just s minus 2. So if I have an
,,"s-sided polygon, I can get s minus 2 triangles that"
,,perfectly cover that polygon and that don't overlap with
,,"each other, which tells us that an s-sided polygon, if"
,,"it has s minus 2 triangles, that the interior angles"
,,in it are going to be s minus 2 times 180 degrees. Which is a pretty cool result. So if someone told you that they
,,"had a 102-sided polygon-- so s is equal to 102 sides. You can say, OK, the"
,,number of interior angles are going to be 102 minus 2. So it's going to be 100
,,"times 180 degrees, which is equal to 180 with two"
,,"more zeroes behind it. So it'd be 18,000 degrees"
,,for the interior angles of a 102-sided polygon.
,,
angles,2CZrkdtgeNU,Let's say we have two
,,intersecting lines. So that's one of the
,,lines right over there. And then I have another
,,line right over here. So those are my two
,,intersecting lines. And let's say we know that
,,the measure of this angle right over here is
,,equal to 7x plus 182. And this is being
,,"given in degrees, so it's 7x plus 182 degrees. And we know that the measure"
,,of this angle right over here is 9x plus 194 degrees. So my question to
,,"you is, what is the measure of each"
,,of these angles? And I encourage you to pause
,,"the video and to think about it. Well, the thing that"
,,might jump out at you is that these two things
,,are vertical angles. They're the opposite angles
,,when we have these intersecting lines right over here. And vertical angles are
,,"equal to each other. So we know, because these"
,,"are vertical angles, that 9x plus 194 degrees must"
,,be equal to 7x plus 182 degrees. And now we just
,,have to solve for x. So if we want all the x-terms
,,"on the left-hand side, we could subtract 7x from here. We've got to do it to"
,,"both sides, of course, in order to maintain"
,,the equality. And then we could put
,,all of our constant terms on the right-hand side. So we can subtract
,,194 from the left. We have to subtract
,,194 from the right in order to maintain
,,"the inequality. And on the left, what"
,,"we're left with is just 2x. And on the right, what"
,,"we're left with-- let's see. 182 minus 194. So if it was 194 minus 182,"
,,it would be positive 12. But now it's going
,,to be negative 12. We're subtracting the
,,"larger from the smaller, so it's equal to negative 12. And then divide both sides by 2. And we get x is"
,,equal to negative 6. And now we can use
,,that information to find out the measure of
,,"either one of these angles, which is the same"
,,as the other one. So we can see here that if we
,,"take 7 times negative 6 plus 182, so 7 times negative"
,,"6 is negative 42, plus 182 is going to be"
,,equal to 140 degrees. And you'll see the
,,"same thing over here. If we say 9 times negative 6,"
,,"which is negative 54, plus 194, this also equals 140 degrees."
,,
angles,BTnAlNSgNsY,Let's say I have an
,,"angle ABC, and it looks something like this. So its vertex is going"
,,"to be at B. Maybe A sits right over here, and"
,,C sits right over there. And then also let's say that we
,,have another angle called DBA. I want to have the vertex
,,once again at B. So let's say it looks like this. So this right over here is our
,,point D. That is our point D. And let's say that we know
,,that the measure of angle DBA is equal to 40 degrees. So this angle right
,,"over here, its measure is equal to 40 degrees. And let's say that we know"
,,that the measure of angle ABC is equal to 50 degrees. So there's a bunch of
,,interesting things happening here. The first interesting thing
,,that you might realize is that both of these
,,angles share a side. If you view these as rays-- they
,,"could be lines, line segments, or rays-- but if you"
,,"view them as rays, they both share this ray BA. And when you have"
,,"two angles like this that share the same side, these"
,,"are called adjacent angles. Because the word ""adjacent"""
,,literally means next to. These are adjacent. They are adjacent angles. Now there's something
,,else that you might notice that's
,,interesting here. We know that the measure
,,of angle DBA is 40 degrees and the measure of
,,angle ABC is 50 degrees. And you might be able to guess
,,what the measure of angle DBC is. If we drew a
,,protractor over here-- I'm not going to draw it. It will make my
,,"drawing all messy. Well, maybe I'll"
,,draw it really fast. So if you had a protractor
,,"right over here, clearly this is opening"
,,up to 50 degrees. And this is going
,,another 40 degrees. So if you wanted to say what
,,"the measure of angle DBC is, it would essentially be the sum"
,,of 40 degrees and 50 degrees. And let me delete
,,all of this stuff right here to keep things clean. So the measure of angle DBC
,,would be equal to 90 degrees. And we already know that 90
,,degrees is a special angle. This is a right angle. There's also a word for
,,"two angles whose sum add up to 90 degrees, and"
,,that is complementary. So we can also say that
,,angles DBA and angles ABC are complementary. And that is because their
,,measures add up to 90 degrees. So the measure of angle DBA
,,plus the measure of angle ABC is equal to 90 degrees. They form a right angle
,,when you add them up. And just as another
,,point of terminology that's kind of related
,,"to right angles, when a right angle is"
,,"formed, the two rays that form the right angle"
,,or the two lines that form that right angle or
,,the two line segments that form that right angle
,,are called perpendicular. So because we know that measure
,,of angle DBC is 90 degrees or that angle DBC is a
,,"right angle, this tells us, we know that the"
,,line segment DB is perpendicular to
,,line segment BC. Or we could even say ray BD
,,"is-- instead of using the word perpendicular, there's"
,,"sometimes this symbol right here, which really"
,,just shows two perpendicular lines-- perpendicular to BC. So all of these are
,,true statements here. And these come out of
,,"the fact that the angle formed between DB and BC,"
,,"that is a 90-degree angle. Now, we have other words"
,,"when our two angles add up to other things. So let's say, for example,"
,,I have one angle over here. Let me put some letters
,,here so we can specify it. So let's say this
,,"is X, Y, and Z. And let's say that the"
,,measure of angle XYZ is equal to 60 degrees. And let's say that you
,,"have another angle that looks like this. And I'll call this,"
,,"let's say, maybe MNO. And let's say that the measure"
,,of angle MNO is 120 degrees. So if you were to add the two
,,measures of these-- so let me write this down. The measure of angle MNO plus
,,"the measure of angle XYZ, this is going to be equal to 120"
,,"degrees plus 60 degrees, which is equal to 180 degrees. So if you add these"
,,"two things up, you essentially are able to go"
,,all halfway around the circle. Or you could go throughout
,,the entire half circle or semicircle for a protractor. And when you have two angles
,,"that add up to 180 degrees, we call them supplementary. I know it's a little hard"
,,to remember sometimes. 90 degrees is complementary. They're just
,,complementing each other. And then if you add
,,"up to 180 degrees, you have supplementary. You have supplementary angles. And if you have two"
,,supplementary angles that are adjacent so that they
,,share a common side-- so let me draw that over here. So let's say you have one
,,angle that looks like this. And that you have another angle. So let me put some
,,letters here again. And I'll start reusing letters. So let's say that this is ABC. And you have another angle
,,"that looks like this. I already used C. Once again, let's say"
,,that this is 50 degrees. And let's say that this right
,,"over here is 130 degrees. Clearly, angle DBA plus angle"
,,"ABC, if you add them together, you get 130 degrees plus 50"
,,"degrees, which is 180 degrees. So they are supplementary. So let me write that down. Angle DBA and angle"
,,ABC are supplementary. They add up to 180 degrees. But they are also
,,adjacent angles. And because they're
,,"supplementary and they're adjacent, if you"
,,"look at the broader angle, the angle used from the sides"
,,that they don't have in common. If you look at
,,"angle DBC, this is going to be essentially"
,,"a straight line, which we can call a straight angle. So I introduced you to"
,,a bunch of words here. And now I think we have
,,all of the tools we need to start doing
,,"some interesting proofs. And just to review here,"
,,we talked about any angles that add up to 90 degrees are
,,"considered to be complementary. This is adding up to 90 degrees. If they happen to be adjacent,"
,,"then the two outside sides will form a right angle. When you have a right angle,"
,,the two sides of a right angle are considered to
,,be perpendicular. And then if you have two angles
,,"that add up to 180 degrees, they're considered"
,,supplementary. And then if they
,,"happen to be adjacent, they will form a straight angle. Or another way, if you said,"
,,if you have a straight angle and you have one of the
,,"angles, the other angle is going to be"
,,supplementary to it. They're going to add
,,up to 180 degrees. So I'll leave you there
,,
angles,2439OIVBgPg,Hello. In this series of presentations
,,I'm going to try to teach you everything you need to know
,,about triangles and angles and parallel lines. And this is probably the
,,"highest yield information that you could ever learn, and"
,,especially in terms of standardized tests. And then when we've learned all
,,"the rules we'll play something that I call the angle game,"
,,which is essentially what the SAT makes you do over
,,and over again. So let's start
,,"with some basics. Well, you know"
,,"what an angle is. Well actually, maybe you"
,,don't know what an angle is. And I'll tell you
,,what an angle is. If I have two lines-- I'm
,,going to draw a thicker line than that. If I have two lines and they
,,"intersect at some point, the angle is a measure of exactly"
,,kind of how wide the intersection is between
,,those two lines. Let me use a better tool. So this is the angle. An angle is how wide those
,,two lines kind of open up. And they're measured either in
,,"degrees or radians, and for the sake of most of a geometry"
,,class we'll use degrees. And when we start doing
,,trigonometry you'll learn radians. Or maybe you could
,,learn it now. And you're probably
,,familiar with this. 0 degrees would be these two
,,"lines on top of each other. This, if I were to just eyeball"
,,"it, looks like 45 degrees. If I had the lines even"
,,"wider apart like that, that's 90 degrees. And 90 degree lines are also"
,,"called perpendicular, because they are-- I feel like saying,"
,,because they are perpendicular-- but because one
,,is going completely vertical while the other is
,,going horizontal. It's actually amazingly
,,"difficult to find the exact right wording. But I think you get the idea. By definition, perpendicular"
,,"lines have a 90 degree apart from each other. And, you know, you've seen this"
,,all the time in things like squares and rectangles. If I were to draw a
,,rectangle like that. Right? A rectangle is made up of a
,,"bunch of perpendicular lines, or lines at 90 degree angles. So example. These two lines are at"
,,a 90 degree angle. The way you draw a 90
,,degree angle is you draw a little box like that. That's the same thing as
,,doing this-- as doing a 90 degree angle. And you could even
,,get wider angles. So if you go above 90 degrees. So let's say I had
,,lines like this. So this would be-- I don't
,,"know, I'm just eyeballing it-- 135 degrees or"
,,something like that. If you ever want to really
,,"measure the angles, you can use something called a protractor. That's a tool maybe your"
,,teachers can help you use that. So that'd be 135 degrees. And then if you had it so wide
,,"that the two lines are actually almost forming a line, then"
,,this becomes 180 degrees. It's almost like one line. Right? This is 180 degrees. And then you can keep going. So if this angle here is 135
,,"degrees, you can actually also measure this angle right here. Let me do it in a different"
,,color just to add some variety. So then this angle right here. So the angles in a circle
,,"are there are 360 degrees in a circle. So if this is 135, this magenta"
,,"angle would be 360 degrees minus 135 degrees. And that's equal to what? That's 225 degrees, is"
,,this magenta angle. And then we could do
,,"other things like that. So one, you know that the"
,,degrees in the circle are 360 degrees. This is important to know. Degrees in a circle
,,are 360 degrees. It's also important to know
,,"that if you just go kind of halfway around a circle,"
,,"like we did here, that's 180 degrees. Like if you viewed the"
,,"pivot point as like, let's say, right here. I mean it looks like just"
,,one line and it really is. But that's 180 degrees. And then if you go quarter
,,"way around the circle, that's 90 degrees. All right? Hopefully you're getting"
,,a bit of an intuition for what an angle is. So now I will teach you
,,"a bunch of very useful rules for angles. Clear this. So let me redraw. So if I had a line like this. I like using the colors, just"
,,so I think it keeps you from getting completely bored. And it might not be completely
,,"intuitive what I'm doing, but let's add an angle like that. And so, let's just say-- you"
,,"know, I'm not measuring these exactly-- let's say that"
,,this is 30 degrees. We know that if we go all the
,,"way around the circle, we know that that's 360 degrees. Right? And that's a very ugly"
,,looking around the circle angle that I drew. So then we also know
,,that this angle right here is 330 degrees. Right? Because this angle plus this
,,magenta angle is going to equal the whole circle. So this is equal
,,to 330 degrees. So remember that. The angles in a circle--
,,or there are 360 degrees in a circle. I don't know if you remember. You probably don't. This was probably
,,before you were born. But there used to be a game
,,"called 720, and it was a skateboarding game--"
,,it was a video game. And the 720 was essentially
,,you were trying to jump your skateboard and
,,spin around twice. And that's 720 degrees. If you go around a circle
,,twice that's 720 degrees. If you just jump and
,,"spin around once, you went 360 degrees. So you've probably heard this"
,,in just popular culture. But anyway. So 360 degrees in a circle. And you could imagine half
,,a circle is 180 degrees. So the other important thing to
,,"realize is, like we said, if we go halfway around the"
,,circle it's 180 degrees. But if we have two angles that
,,add up to that-- so let's say. I don't know if these lines are
,,"thick enough for you to see. Let me draw something thicker. It doesn't look ideal,"
,,but you get the idea. So if we have this
,,"angle, let's call it x. And then this angle is y. What do we know about the"
,,"relationship between x and y? Well, we know that the entire"
,,"angle is half of a circle. Right? So that's 180 degrees. That's 180 degrees,"
,,this entire angle. So what are angles x and
,,y going to add up to? I'm trying to stay
,,color consistent. x plus y are going to
,,"equal-- I'm color blind, I think-- 180 degrees. Or you could write y is"
,,equal to 180 minus x. Or x is equal to 180 minus y. But if x plus y are equal to
,,180 degrees-- and you can see that it makes sense that they
,,do-- if you add the two angles you go halfway around a circle. Then that tells us that x and y
,,"are-- and this is a fancy word, and it's just good to commit"
,,this to memory-- they are supplementary angles. That's when you add
,,to 180 degrees. Now what if we had
,,"this situation. Oh my God, that was horrible. Undo. Let's say I had this situation. Let's see. I draw two perpendicular lines. Right? So this is going a quarter     "
,,way around the circle. All right. Let's say this entire angle
,,here-- I'm drawing it really big-- that's 90 degrees. Right? They're perpendicular. And now if I had two
,,angles within that. So now if I have two angles
,,here-- so let's say that this is x and this is y-- what
,,"do x and y add up to? Well, x plus y is 90. And we can say that x and"
,,y are complementary. And it's important to not get
,,confused between the two. Just remember complementary
,,"means two angles add up to 90 degrees, supplementary means"
,,"that two angles add up to 180 degrees. I'm running out of time, so I"
,,will see you in the next video.
,,
angles,2SOK_IrpHeQ,We have an interesting looking
,,diagram here. Let's see if we know a few things
,,"about this diagram. Let's say we know that line MK is parallel to line NJ. So this line is parallel to this line. This is line MK, this is line NJ. Now, given that  "
,,"and all the other information on this diagram, I'm hoping to prove that the measure"
,,of this angle LMK is equal to the measure
,,of this angle over here and this angle is LNJ. Another way of writing this is; the measure of LMK is b
,,and the measure of LNK is a. So we want to prove that b is equal to a using all this information
,,that we know. Like always I encourage you
,,"to try this on your own before I walk through it. Alright, let's walk through it. The first thing you might see is"
,,"I have a triangle formed up here, triangle MLK. What do we know about the measurement"
,,of the interior angles of a triangle? The measures of the interior angles
,,"of a triangle are going to add up to 180 degrees. We know that b,"
,,"which is the measure of this angle plus the measure of this angle, c plus the measure of this right angle,"
,,which is plus 90 degrees is going to be equal to 180 degrees. And so if we subtract 90 degrees
,,from both sides we're going to get b plus c
,,is equal to 180 degrees minus 90 degrees. It's going to be 90 degrees. Or if we wanted to solve
,,"explicitly for b we could subtract c from both sides, and we could write b is equal to"
,,"90 degrees minus c. So that's interesting,"
,,"that's one way of expressing b. Can we express a in a similar way? Once again, if at any point"
,,you get inspired I encourage you to do that. If we look carefully we see that
,,"we have triangle NLJ, this really big triangle,"
,,it's really most of the diagram. What's interesting about NLJ
,,"is that J is another right triangle, c is one of the measures"
,,"of one of the interior angles, and a is a measure of"
,,"the other interior angle. We can write something very similar, we can write a plus c"
,,plus 90 degrees is going to be equal
,,to 180 degrees. So what can we do here? We can do the exact same process
,,to solve for a. If we subtract 90 from both sides
,,and we subtract c from both sides what do we get? We get a is equal to 90 degrees
,,"and if you subtract c from both sides you're going to get 90 degrees minus c. Now this is interesting, b is equal to 90 degrees minus c"
,,"and a is equal to 90 degrees minus c. So 90 degrees minus c is equal to a,"
,,"it's also equal to b. Or, we can now say that"
,,"a must be equal to b, that the measure of angle LMK"
,,which is b is equal to the measure of angle LNJ
,,which is equal to a.
,,
angles,D-EIh7NJvtQ,We already know that
,,an angle is formed when two rays share
,,"a common endpoint. So, for example, let's say"
,,"that this is one ray right over here, and then this is one"
,,"another ray right over here, and then they would"
,,form an angle. And at this point
,,"right over here, their common endpoint is called"
,,"the vertex of that angle. Now, we also know that not"
,,"all angles seem the same. For example, this"
,,"is one angle here, and then we could"
,,"have another angle that looks something like this. And viewed this way,"
,,it looks like this one is much more open. So I'll say more open. And this one right over
,,"here seems less open. So to avoid having to just say,"
,,"oh, more open and less open and actually becoming a little"
,,"bit more exact about it, we'd actually want to"
,,"measure how open an angle is, or we'd want to have a"
,,"measure of the angle. Now, the most typical way"
,,"that angles are measured, there's actually two major"
,,ways of that they're measured. The most typical
,,"unit is in degrees, but later on in"
,,"high school, you'll also see the unit of radians"
,,"being used, especially when you learn trigonometry. But the degrees convention"
,,really comes from a circle. So let's draw ourselves
,,"a circle right over here, so that's a circle. And the convention is that--"
,,"when I say convention, it's just kind of what"
,,everyone has been doing. The convention is that you
,,have 360 degrees in a circle. So let me explain that. So if that's the
,,"center of the circle, and if we make this ray our"
,,"starting point or one side of our angle, if you go all"
,,"the way around the circle, that represents 360 degrees. And the notation is 360, and"
,,then this little superscript circle represents degrees. This could be read
,,"as 360 degrees. Now, you might be saying, where"
,,"did this 360 number come from? And no one knows for sure,"
,,"but there's hints in history, and there's hints in just the"
,,"way that the universe works, or at least the Earth's"
,,rotation around the sun. You might recognize
,,or you might already realize that there are 365
,,"days in a non-leap year, 366 in a leap year. And so you can imagine ancient"
,,"astronomers might have said, well, you know, that's"
,,"pretty close to 360. And in fact, several"
,,"ancient calendars, including the Persians"
,,"and the Mayans, had 360 days in their year. And 360 is also a much"
,,"neater number than 365. It has many, many more factors. It's another way of saying it's"
,,"divisible by a bunch of things. But anyway, this has just been"
,,"the convention, once again, what history has handed"
,,"us, that a circle is viewed to have 360 degrees. And so one way we"
,,could measure an angle is you could put one of the
,,"rays of an angle right over here at this part of the circle, and"
,,then the other ray of the angle will look something like this. And then the fraction of
,,the circle circumference that is intersected by these two
,,"rays, the measure of this angle would be that"
,,"fraction of degrees. So, for example, let's say that"
,,this length right over here is 1/6 of the circle's
,,circumference. So it's 1/6 of the
,,way around the circle. Then this angle
,,"right over here is going to be 1/6 of 360 degrees. So in this case, this"
,,would be 60 degrees. I could do another example. So let's say I had a circle like
,,"this, and I'll draw an angle. I'll put the vertex at"
,,the center of the angle. I'll put one of the
,,rays right over here. You could consider
,,that to be 0 degrees. Or if the other ray was also
,,"here, it would be 0 degrees. And then I'll make the"
,,"other ray of this angle, let's say it went straight up. Let's say it went"
,,"straight up like this. Well, in this"
,,"situation, the arc that connects these two"
,,"endpoints just like this, this represents 1/4 of the"
,,"circumference of the circle. This is, right over here,"
,,1/4 of the circumference. So this angle right over here is
,,going to be 1/4 of 360 degrees. 360 degrees divided by 4
,,"is going to be 90 degrees. At an angle like this, one where"
,,one ray is straight up and down and the other one goes to
,,"the right/left direction, we would say these two"
,,"rays are perpendicular, or we would call"
,,this a right angle. And the way that we
,,oftentimes will denote that is by a symbol like this. But this literally
,,means a 90-degree angle. Let's do one more example. Let's do one more
,,"example of this, just to make sure that we"
,,"understand what's going on. Actually, at least"
,,one more example. Maybe one more if we have time. So let's say that we have an
,,"angle that looks like this. Once more, I'm going"
,,to put its vertex at the center of the circle. That's one ray of the angle. And let's say that
,,this is the other ray. This right over here is
,,the other ray of the angle. I encourage you to
,,pause this video and try to figure out what
,,"the measure of this angle right over here is. Well, let's think about where"
,,the rays intersect the circle. They intersect there and there. The arc that connects
,,them on the circle is that arc right over there. That is literally half of the
,,circumference of the circle. That is half of the
,,"circumference, half of the way around of the circle,"
,,circumference of the circle. So this angle is going to
,,be half of 360 degrees. And half of 360 is 180 degrees. And when you view it
,,"this way, these two rays share a common endpoint. And together, they're"
,,really forming a line here. And let's just do
,,"one more example, because I said I would. Let me paste another circle. Let me draw another angle. Let me draw another angle. So let's say that's"
,,"one ray of the angle, and this is the other ray. This is the other ray of"
,,the angle right over here. And we care. There's actually two
,,angles that are formed. There's actually two angles
,,formed in all of these. There's one angle that's
,,"formed right over here, and you might recognize that"
,,to be a 90-degree angle. But what we really care
,,"about in this example is this angle right over here. So once again, where does"
,,it intersect the circle? We care about this
,,"arc right over here, because that's the"
,,arc that corresponds to this angle right over here. And it looks like we've
,,gone 3/4 around the circle. So this angle is going
,,to be 3/4 of 360 degrees. 1/4 of 360 degrees is
,,"90, so three of those is going to be 270 degrees."

angles,9RTM418qfdI,hello friends welcome to new happy learning video look at these images do you know what we're looking at exactly they are bangles and today we are going to learn many things about them an angle is space between two intersecting lines all surfaces that emerge from the same point called vertex if you look around we are surrounded 
,,by angles like the ones this clock handles or an ice cream cone makes the unit of measure of angles is the degree and the most important angle of all is this one it's called a right angle and it measures 90 degrees the tiny zero you can see on the bright upper part of the number 90 is a symbol that represents all angles we say that the right angle is the most important one because it is the one that is used to compare all of the other angles the angles are smaller than of right angle a called acute angles and they measure less than 90 degrees like all of these and angles that are bigger than a right angle are called obtuse angles and measure more than 
,,90 degrees like all of these to neighbor degrees at an angle measures we need to use this instruments which is called app attractor so we need to place the straight 
,,part of the Picatta over one of the sides of the angle making the vertex and the central point of the Petrak to meet after this we need to look at the trap to line on the other side of the angle and look at what number it says these are the degrees that an angle measures easy peasy huh let's practice we said that a right angle is 90 degrees let's see we'll get the protractor and indeed a right angle is 90 degrees we haven't fooled you huh now let's measure this angle let's see how much it measures 45 degrees it's an acute angle because it is smaller than a right angle and now we're going to check out how much this other angle measures a hundred and twenty degrees of course it's an obtuse angle because it measures more than 90 degrees imagine that instead of being 120 it measures a hundred and eighty do you know what this angle is called we call it a straight angle hey and what about if it messes 360 degrees well that's a complete all full angle it's complete as can be the conference meshes 360 degrees what's a discovery measuring angles is easy-peasy and fun don't you think get by friends and don't forget to subscribe to happy learning TV

angles,302eJ3TzJQU,in this lesson I'm gonna go over some basic concepts in geometry that you want to be familiar with so the first thing we're gonna talk about is a line what is alive 
,,now many of you may think of a line as just something that looks like that but in geometry a line would have two arrows and so it extends in opposite directions forever now let's put some points on this line so we can call this line line a B we could also call it line BC and we could also call it line AC so there's many ways in 
,,which we can name this particular line now what about a ray how would you describe array array has a point and it extends forever in the other direction so it has a 
,,point and an arrow so let's put some other points on this ray let's call this a B C so we can name this array a C or we can name it ray not BC but a C I mean a B the reason why we can't name it ray BC is because the first point has to start at the initial point or the standpoint of the rate so we need to use point a as our starting point now the next one you need to be familiar with is something called a segment a segment has a beginning and it has an end so let's say this is point a and point B so we can describe it as segment a B with no arrows on it or we could say this is segment B a so that's a segment now let's move on to angles there's four different angles that you need to be familiar with so the first one is an acute angle acute angles have an angle measure of anywhere between 0 and 90 but it's less than 
,,90 that's what you want to take from this and so we can call this angle ABC and if you notice an angle is formed by the the union of two rays so here we have ray ba 
,,and Ray BC and so this forms at the vertex creating an angle the next angle is the right angle and a right angle has an angle measure of 90 degrees the next one he needs to be familiar with is something called an obtuse angle so the obtuse angle has an angle that's greater than 90 but less than 180 and finally you need to be familiar with the straight angle the straight angle has a measure of 180 degrees so that's a straight angle it looks basically like a line now let's move on to the midpoint what is a midpoint well if you look at the word it sounds like the point in the middle and you wouldn't be incorrect by saying that so let's say if we have a segment we'll call it segment AC and let's say is the midpoint so what does that mean that means that B is right in the middle of segment AC it also means that segment a B and BC are congruent so if you put these marks it shows that this segment is equal to that segment and the way you would write that is as follows so you would say segment a B is congruent to segment BC and so if that's true that means that B is the midpoint of segment AC thus B bisects segment AC into two equal parts now another term you need to be familiar with is something called what just happened here something called a segment bisector so let's say if we have a ray that passes through the midpoint let's say this is our so ray RB is considered a segment bisector because it bisects the segment into two congruent parts so we can see that a b and b c are congruent to each other next up in our list of things to discuss is the angle bisector so what is an angle bisector an angle bisector is a ray that bisects 
,,an angle into two equal parts so let's say we have let's call this angle ABC and we have a ray that emanates from point B and let's call this ray BD so ray BD is an 
,,angle bisector if it bisects angle ABC into two equal parts so let's say that angle ABC is sixty degrees by the way when you name an angle the vertex of the angle has to be in the middle so you can call it angle ABC or you can call it angle CBA so B has to be in the middle so if Ray BD is an angle bisector that means that angle 
,,abd has to be thirty and angle DBC has to be thirty now let's move on to parallel lines so what do you know about parallel lines what are some properties of parallel lines parallel lines never intersect so let's call this line a and line B parallel lines also have the same slope so let's say the slope of line a is a half the slope of line B will also be a half and the way you can describe that these two lines are parallel the geometry symbol for it looks like this so you say a is parallel to B so you would use two lines to indicate that a is parallel to B now let's talk about perpendicular lines what are perpendicular lines and how are they different from parallel lines as we said before parallel lines do not intersect each other but perpendicular lines they do intersect each other in fact they do so at right angles so let's call this line a and line B so they're gonna meet at a 90 degree angle now let's say that the slope of line B is positive 2 over 5 what is the slope of line a given that it's perpendicular to line B to find the slope of a perpendicular line first you need to flip the fraction and changed a sign from positive to negative so the slopes are negative reciprocals of each other and a symbol for it goes as follows so we could say line a is perpendicular to line B so that's the geometric symbol that correlates two perpendicular lines the next term that you need to know in geometry is complementary angles so what are complementary angles complementary angles are angles that add up to 90 degrees so let's say if we have a right triangle now let's call this triangle ABC so the symbol for that is as follows so this is triangle ABC and let's say that angle a is 40 degrees and angle C has a measure of 50 degrees in this case we could say that angle a and angle C are complementary because their angle measures add up to 90 degrees and so that's the basic idea behind complementary angles so the measure of angle A plus the measure of angle C is equal to 90 next we have supplementary angles now based on the last topic you can probably guess what this is about supplementary angles are angles that add up to 180 now if you remember a straight angle has an angle measure of 180 so we need to be dealing with a line so let's put some points let's say this is point a b c and d let's say angle abd has a measure of 110 and angle DBC has what measure what would you say it should be now remember a straight angle is one-eighty so 110 plus what number is 180 this has to be 70 so because the measure of angle abd and the measure of angle let's call this CBD or you could say DBC because they add up to 180 we 
,,could say that those two angles are supplementary angles the next geometric term that you need to be familiar with is something called the transitive property so what is the transitive property the definition is as follows if two angles are congruent to the same angle then they are congruent to each other okay so what does that 
,,mean let's say if angle one is congruent to angle two and if angle three is congruent to angle two then we can come up with this conclusion we could say that angle one is congruent to angle three and now it seems obvious but you need to know that this property is it matches this situation because if you're doing let's say a problem with two column proofs you need to know that the transitive property corresponds to this particular situation now another way in which you could describe the transitive property is used in variables so you can say that if a is equal to B and if C is equal to B then that means that a has to equal C so we can write then a is equal to C and that's the basic idea behind and the transitive property so that's something else that you want to add to your notes next you need to be familiar with 
,,vertical angles if you're working on two column proofs and problems similar to that so what are vertical angles well we can form vertical angles by drawing two lines that intersect each other let's call this angle one two three and four so the opposite angles are congruent angle one is congruent to angle three so thus you can describe them as vertical angles angle 2 and angle 4 there are also vertical angles they are congruent to each other so let me give you an example problem let's say if this angle is 50 what are the other three angles this angle has to be 50 because their vertical angles now these two angles let's call this angle X and 50 they form a linear pair so therefore they have to add up to 180 180 minus 50 is 130 so the angle opposite to 130 is a vertical angle to it so this must also be 130 and so that's how you can use vertical angles to find missing angles in the typical geometry course now for those of you who haven't done so already feel free to subscribe to 
,,this channel and check out the description section of this video when you get a chance I'm gonna post some links to it because in this video I don't have many practice problems and for those of you who want it I'm gonna have another video with plenty of practice problems I'm also going to include my geometry video playlists for 
,,those of you who need help on specific topics in geometry so I'm gonna get a chance to check out the description section of this video and don't forget to subscribe 
,,and if you decide to do that make sure to click on that notification bell so you can receive new videos that I'm gonna post in the future now let's talk about medians what is a median to understand this concept let's begin by drawing a triangle and so let's call this triangle ABC and we're gonna draw a line segment from B to some point which we'll call D now in this example segment BD is a median a median is a line segment drawn from the vertex of a triangle to the midpoint on the other side of the triangle so that means that D is the midpoint so if D is the midpoint of segment AC that means ad and DC are congruent to each other and so that's what a median does the meeting is just a line segment it touches the midpoint of the other side and it splits one side of the triangle into two equal parts now let's talk about altitudes what is an altitude and how does it relate to a median so let's use another triangle as our example now we're going to call a triangle ABC again with point D so this time BD is going to represent an altitude so like a median and altitude is a line segment but the difference is d is not a midpoint the altitude forms 
,,a right triangles with in this case segment AC so angle ADB which is congruent to angle c DB both angles are equal to 90 degrees so the altitude forms right angles inside the triangle and that's what you need to know now we can also say that segment BD is perpendicular to segment AC because perpendicular lines and perpendicular 
,,segments they intersect at right angles so if you have an altitude you can also make the statement now the next thing we're going to talk about is a perpendicular bisector so looking at the words perpendicular and bisector what do you think this represents so let's say if we have a line segment which we'll call segment a B now we're going to draw a line that's perpendicular to it and let's call this line out so line L is perpendicular to segment a B which means that it's going to form a right angle with segment a B now it's also a bisector so if we draw another point we'll call it point M M is the midpoint of segment a B so a perpendicular bisector forms right angles with this segment that it intersects and at the same time it also bisects the segment into two congruent parts so when dealing with perpendicular bisectors you can say things like segments am is congruent to segment B M you can also say that M is a midpoint and you could also say that angle let's add some points 
,,here so let's call this point P and point Q so we could say that angle am p and angle BMP these are right angles so perpendicular bisectors they are lines that bisect a segment into two equal parts and they form right angles with that segment personally I like to think of perpendicular bisectors as a hybrid of a median and an altitude so like a median it touches the segment at the midpoint and it bisects it into two equal parts and like an altitude it forms right angles so it has features of both now there's something else that you need to know about perpendicular bisectors now let's focus on point P so notice that a.m. and BM they're congruent to each other and these two triangles they share a common side side pm therefore because these two sides are the same and this side is a common side which is associated with the reflexive property it turns out that AP is congruent to be P and so that's another feature of perpendicular bisectors is that any point on the perpendicular bisector is equidistant to the endpoints of the segment that it bisects so P is equidistant two points a and B so we can say that AP is congruent to B P now we get to 
,,see we could also say the same of point Q so aq and BQ they're congruent to each other so those are some things that you want to keep in mind when dealing with perpendicular bisectors a common problem that you're going to encounter in geometry is proven that two triangles are congruent and so let's say if these are the two triangles we're dealing with we have triangle ABC and triangle d EF now there's four postulates that you need to be familiar with there's some other ones too but we're gonna cover for them so let's say that a B and D e are congruent to each other and BC is congruent to EF and AC is congruent to DF then we could say that triangle ABC 
,,is congruent to triangle d EF according to the SSS postulate because all three sides are congruent to each other and so that's the first postulate you need to be familiar with now when you write this expression you need to write it in such a way that the letters of each triangle correspond to each other so angle a corresponds to angle D because they're opposite two congruent sides likewise angle B corresponds to angle E they're opposite two congruent sides and so we need to make sure that they match when right in the dis statement and angle C corresponds to angle F now let's look at another example but let's use different letters so let's call this triangle XYZ and let's call this triangle rst and let's say that segment XY is congruent to RS and segment XZ is congruent to RT and angle X is congruent to angle are.what partially can we use to prove that these two triangles are congruent so we have a side and angle and aside so we could use the SAS postulate to make the statement that triangle X Y Z is congruent to triangle r s T and so that's the second postulate that you need to be familiar with in order to prove that two triangles are congruent now once you prove that two triangles are congruent you can also make another statement for instance now that we know that these two triangles are congruent 
,,I can say that angle Y is congruent to angle s and the reason why I can say that is something called cpctc corresponding parts of congruent triangles are congruent so once you prove that two triangles are congruent then you can make a statement that other portions of that triangle are congruent as well using this as a reason now let's try another example so let's call this triangle m and O and this one we're gonna call it G H I now let's say that angle n is congruent to angle H segment MN is congruent to segment gh and angle M is congruent to angle G so what postulate can we use to prove that these two triangles are congruent so we have an angle a side and an angle so we could use the AAS a postulate angle-side-angle to say that triangle m n o is congruent to triangle G H I so now that we've proven that the two triangles are congruent I can make a statement and say that another portion of these triangles are congruent I could say that M o is congruent to segment GI and a reason is cpctc corresponding parts of congruent triangles are congruent now there's one more postulate that I want to go over so let's say this is triangle ABC and this is triangle rst let's say that angle a is congruent to angle art angle C is congruent to angle T and let's say that BC is congruent to St so what postulate can we use to prove that these two triangles are congruent so here we have an angle and angle and aside so we could use the AAS postulate to make the statement that triangle ABC is congruent to triangle R st and so that's the fourth postulate you want to know there's another one called the hypotenuse leg postulate which I'm not going to post in this video but you could find it if you check out my new geometry video playlist or if you type in HL a postulate organic chemistry tutor in your YouTube search box it should come up now let's work on some problems so let's say that this is a D C and we're gonna have a composite triangle so let's say that we're given that segment ad is congruent to segment DC and segment a B is congruent to segment BC how can we prove that these two triangles are congruent that is triangle abd and 
,,CBD what can we do right now we see that two sides are congruent but notice that both triangles share a congruent side if we were to split this triangle into two parts such that we have triangle a B D and triangle C BD so we can see that ad and DC are congruent because that's given to us a B is congruent to BC and also DB is congruent to itself based on the reflexive property so that's we could say that triangle abd is congruent to triangle C B D according to the SS as partially now using cpctc we can make a statement that let's say angle a is congruent to angle c based on cpctc here is another example so let's say this is a B C D and E and let's say we're given that angle a is congruent to angle E and AC is congruent to CE prove that angles B and D are congruent now you could set this up as a two column proof but I'm not gonna do that here I'm just going to discuss it the process of proving that these two triangles are congruent but if you want actual two column proof problems check out the links in the description of this video I'm gonna post some videos where you can find more practice on this topic this video is just a quick review of topics that you need to know in geometry so right now we can't use any postulates here because all we have is an angle and a side we don't have this yet this is what we trying to prove so we can't use that right now so what else do we know about triangles ACB and ECD notice that angles ACB and e CB are congruent to each other 
,,because they form vertical angles vertical angles are congruent so based on the a s a angle-side-angle postulate we can make the statement that triangle a CB is congruent to triangle e C D now once we prove that the two triangles are congruent now we can make the statement that angle B is congruent to angle D using cpctc and we 
,,don't have to stop there if we want to we can show that segment a B is congruent to segment II D also using cpctc as a reason now let's consider one more example so 
,,let's say this is triangle ABC and let's say that we're given that BD is an altitude in addition let's say we're given that angle a is congruent to angle C so let me just write given your task is to verbally prove that angle abd is congruent to angle C BD so feel free to pause the video and come up with a process that will prove that this statement is true so first let's mark down what we know angle a is congruent to angle C and so that's given now BD is an altitude what do we know about altitudes altitudes they form the right angles so angle ADB is congruent to angle C DB now in addition triangle ADB share a same side with triangle C BD so if we split it into two triangles triangle ADB and CDB we can say that these two sides are congruent based on the reflexive property and we have that angle D is congruent to each other and angle a is congruent so thus we have angle angle side and so we can prove that the two triangles are congruent so we can make the statement that triangle a DB is congruent to triangle c DB now that we've proven that the two triangles are congruent we can make the statement that angle abd is congruent to angle CBD according to cpctc corresponding parts of congruent triangles are congruent and so that would complete this problem but you could set it up as a two column proof if you want to and using cpctc we can also say that segment a-b is congruent to segment BC or we could say that segment ad is congruent to segment CD and so using cpctc you can also prove that any other parts of the two triangles are congruent so that's my two cents for today that's all I got and before you leave don't forget to subscribe to this channel and check out the links in a description for those of you who want more practice problems thanks again for watching

angles,mLeNaZcy-hE,"Hi! Welcome to Math Antics. In this Geometry lesson, "
,,we’re gonna learn all about triangles. You may remember from the lesson about polygons
,," that triangles are special polygons that always have 3 sides and 3 angles. And that’s what the word ‘triangle’ means. “tri"" means 3 and “angles” means... angles. Okay, that’s easy enough... 3 sides... 3 angles... but what else is there to know about triangles? Well for starters, we’re gonna"
,,"learn how to classify triangles. Oooo… such a classy triangle! [laughter] But seriously, there’s two different way"
,,to classify (or organize) triangles. They can be classified by their sides
,,and they can be classified by their angles. Let’s start by classifying triangles by their angles since we’ve already learned a lot about angles
,, in the previous videos. You may remember from our first video about angles
,," that there’s 3 types of angles: there’s right angles, acute angles, and obtuse angles. Well... watch what happens if we use a third line in each of these angles to "
,,form closed shapes. Ah ha!… triangles! And can you guess what these three different kinds of triangles are called? Yep - The one made from the right angle is called 
,,"a Right Triangle. The one made from the acute angle is called an Acute Triangle, and the one made from the obtuse angle is called an Obtuse Triangle. So that’s simple enough."
,,"But notice that for each of our three triangles, the new angles that were formed"
,,when we closed the shapes are all acute angles. So triangles always have at least 2 acute angles... and it’s the other angle that determines what type it is. That’s 
,,"important to know so you don’t get tricked. For any given triangle,"
,," just because you see one acute angle, that doesn't mean it’s an acute triangle. You have to look at ALL the angles to tell if"
,,it’s an acute triangle. The situation is easier with right and obtuse
,,"triangles because you can only have ONE right or obtuse angle per triangle. So as soon as you spot one of those kinds of angles, you know what type of triangle you have. Alright then… classifying triangles by angles"
,,is pretty simple. But we can also classify triangles by their sides. If we pay close attention
,,"to the length of each side of a triangle, we can see that there are three possibilities. First of all, if all three sides of a triangle"
,,"are exactly the same length, then we call it an Equilateral Triangle."
,,"It’s kind of  a long word, but it’s easy to remember because it sounds like it has the word “equal” in it. To see the second possibility, let’s take"
,,the top vertex of our equilateral triangle and move it up like this. See what happened?
,,"Two of the triangle’s sides got stretched by the same amount,"
,,but the bottom side remained the same. Now we have a triangle that has only 2 equal
,,"sides, and that’s called an Isosceles Triangle. That’s a long word too. The best way to"
,,"remember that is to look at an isosceles triangle and say it’s name 20 times as fast as you can! Is osceles, Isosceles, Isosceles, Isosceles,"
,,"Isosceles, Isosceles, Isosceles, Isosceles,... And finally, to see the third possibility,"
,,let’s move that same top vertex again... but this time to the left.
,,"Now, all the sides are different lengths. This type of triangle is called a Scalene Triangle. So those are the three possibilities when"
,,classifying triangles by their sides. Equilateral Triangles have 3 equal sides. Isosceles triangles have only 2 equal sides. And scalene triangles have NO equal sides. That way was pretty easy too.
,,"The hardest part is just remembering the names. And now that you know both ways to classify triangles,"
,,"let’s see how you can use them together. Yep, you can use them both at the same time. If you classify triangles both by their angles"
,,"and by their sides, it turns out that there's several possible combinations. To see what I mean, let’s list the three classifications by sides:"
,,"(scalene, isosceles, and equilateral) …and the three classifications by angle:"
,,"(right, acute and obtuse) A scalene triangle can also be a right triangle,"
,,like this one. And a scalene triangle can also be
,,"either an obtuse or an acute triangle. In the same way, an isosceles triangle can"
,,"also be acute, like this one, or obtuse, like this one. And in one special case, an isosceles"
,,"triangle can also be a right triangle, like so. But things are different when it comes to"
,,"an equilateral triangle. An equilateral triangle is always an acute triangle. Because all three sides are exactly the same,"
,,all three angles must also be exactly the same. And since we can’t have more than one right
,,"angle in a triangle, or more than one obtuse angle, ALL the angles in an equilateral triangle must be acute. Okay, now that you know all about how"
,,"triangles are classified, let’s learn one more really important thing"
,,"about triangles. In our video about angles and degrees, we"
,,learned that we can measure angles and say how big or how small they are using special
,,"units called degrees. Well, since triangles are always made up of 3 angles, each of those angles has its own"
,,measurement in degrees. And the important thing
,,"is that those three angle measurements, if you combine them, they will always"
,,"add up to 180 degrees. For example, have a look at this triangle."
,,"If we were to take a saw and cut it up into three separate angles, ...and then if we were"
,,"to take those three angles and rearrange them so that they’re right next to each other like this, you can see that the total would be the same as a straight angle... that’s 180 degrees! And this will work no matter what type of"
,,triangle it is. Knowing that a triangle’s angles will
,,always add up to 180 degrees can really help you out when solving geometry problems. There’s a whole lot of situations where
,,"you’ll know what two of the angles are, but you need to figure out what the third"
,,"angle is. Like in this problem. With this triangle, we’re told that one"
,,"of the angles is 35 degrees, and the other is 45 degrees. But the third angle is unknown. We need to figure out what it is. Since we know that the total must be 180 "
,,"degrees, we can just add up the angles that we DO know, and then subtract that from 180 degrees to"
,,see what’s left over. The leftover amount MUST be
,,"the measurement of the unknown angle. So, 35 + 45 = 80 degrees. And when we take that 80 and subtract it"
,,"from 180 we get 100 degrees left over. That means that our unknown angle is 100 degrees! And, you can always check your answer by adding"
,,up all the angles to make sure you get 180. So you can see why it’s so important to
,,"know that a triangle’s angles add up to 180 degrees! Well, that’s all we’re going"
,,"to learn about triangle is this video. Remember, the key to really learning math"
,,"is to do it. So, be sure to practice by doing the"
,,"exercises for this section. As always, thanks for watching Math Antics! and I’ll see you next time! Learn more at www.mathantic.com"

angles,OPG-9IFnJnI,so let's start with three points point a point B point B and Point C and if we connect these three points these three different points with and there they are not collinear they are not on the same line if I connect them with line segments I will get ours I will get a triangle and I think you're familiar with the idea of a triangle and what I want to do in this video is prove that the angles inside a triangle sum up to 180 degrees so if this is if the measure of this angle is a measure of this angle is B measure of this angle is C and I use lowercase a B and C actually let me not use those since I've already used a B and C if this was x y&z I'm going to prove that X plus y plus Z is going to be equal to 180 degrees now let me get those out of the way so that we clear up some space for the actual proof so what I'm 
,,gonna do is I'm going to start off by constructing a line that is parallel to line segment BC but it goes through point a so that line might look something like this that line might look something like that and I could call that line L and let me continue this this line segment BC let me just turn it into a line just so it looks like a nice just so it looks like a nice line so that we see that they really are parallel lines parallel lines and let me show you that they are parallel and so and so I could write here I could say line L I'm going to assume I've constructed line L in a way that it is parallel to line to line BC it is parallel to line BC and 
,,the reason why I do that is then all of a sudden the two other sides of the triangle become transversals for these two parallel lines they intersect those two parallel lines and in case you're wondering hey Hatzalah how did you how did you just assume that you can construct a parallel line here you can always given one line and 
,,you find a point that's off of that line there's always a unique parallel line that goes through that point that's not on the original line and I think you could see that just by kind of reasoning it out or kind just visually looking at things so what I want to do is start to think of line segment a-b and line segment AC as transversals of those two parallel lines so let me just continue them on so they look like real lines and not just line segments so that's that is line a B that is one transversal and then I have line AC that just keeps going so I'm continuing this side right over here that is another transversal so line AC is another transversal it intersects the two parallel lines so now let's think about some of the angles inside the triangle so let's say that the measure of this angle right over here let's 
,,say the measure of that angle is X well we know from what we've learned about parallel lines that there this is this is one angle between the transversal and one of 
,,the parallel lines and there's a corresponding angle between that same transversal and the other parallel line and it is sitting right over here we know that the corresponding angles are equal if this has measure X then that is measure X if this is 30 degrees and that is 30 degrees if this is 70 degrees then that up there is also 70 degrees well we also know we also know that if that is X then the vertical angle is also going to be X so this is also going to be X fair enough now let's think about another angle in the Triangle let's say that the measure let's say the measure of this angle right over here is going to be Y so if this angle right over here is going to be Y what is this entire angle what is this entire angle going to be well it's going to be X plus y this entire angle is X plus y well if this entire angle that I've kind of this arc in green I've shown you if that's X plus y let me write it over here that is X plus y I'm talking about this whole thing this whole thing is going to be X plus y cos x and y or adjacent right there they shared this side then does this whole X plus y have any corresponding angles if we look at this 
,,transversal if we look at transversal AC well sure it has a corresponding angle right over here if this angle is X plus y and I maybe I'll draw that as a little bit 
,,neater if this angle right over here is X plus y then this angle right over there is X plus y now if this angle is X plus y what is let me do this in a new color what is this angle right over here well this angle this angle that's that's at this intersection this angle X plus y this green arc right over here is supplementary to 
,,this magenta angle right over here so we have X plus y let me do it in that same green color you can follow along so we'd have X plus y plus question mark plus question mark is going to be equal to 180 degrees their outer sides form a straight angle they are supplementary they're adjacent angles whose outer sides form a straight angle they're going to add up to 180 degrees and so the question mark angle if we subtract X plus y from both sides question mark is going to be equal to 180 minus 
,,X minus X minus y so this is going to be equal to 180 minus X minus y so now given how we've set up these the three angles or the measures of the three angles in the triangle what are they add up to well let's add them up we have X here that's one of the that's one of the angles or I guess we can see the interior angles in our triangle we have X there then you have Y there X plus y and then you have this character right over here this character we figured out is going to be 180 minus X minus y so what are they going to add up to well this X is going to cancel with this X and then you have this Y is going to cancel with this Y and you're going to see that they add up exactly to 180 degrees so we just proved ourselves just using what we know about parallel lines that the angles the interior angles of a triangle of any triangle add up to 180 degrees

angles,uyKvSe6Ltgs,in this video we're going to focus on solving word problems typically angle of elevation and depression word problems let's start with this one a man measures the angle of elevation between the ground and a building 800 feet away to be 30 degrees how tall is the building so let's say that the height of the man is irrelevant to the height of the building so here's the ground and let's say this is the building with these problems typically you need to draw by triangle so let's draw the line of sight from the ground to the building the angle of elevation is the angle above the horizontal so let's say this is the horizontal line this is the angle of elevation the angle of depression is the angle below the horizontal line so 40 would represent the angle of depression 30 would represent the angle of elevation now the building is 800 feet away let's say the man is somewhere over here so this is 800 feet and our goal is to solve for the height of the building what equation can we use now you need to be familiar with the terms sohcahtoa let's focus on the sole part of sohcahtoa what it means is that sine theta is equal to the opposite side divided by the hypotenuse now the car part means cosine theta is equal to the adjacent side divided by the hypotenuse and Toa tangent theta is equal to the opposite side divided by the adjacent side so we have three trigonometric functions applicable to the situation we have the sine ratio the cosine and the tangent ratio now which one is most suitable to this specific problem should we use sine cosine or tangent so the angle that we have is 30 degrees opposite to the angle is the height of the building which we're looking for adjacent to the angle is 800 feet and hypotenuse is across the 90 degree angle since we're looking for the height of the building which is the opposite side and we have the adjacent side we have to use the tangent ratio we don't know anything about the hypotenuse of the triangle so we can't use sine or cosine we must use tangent so tangent theta as you mentioned before is equal to the opposite side divided by the adjacent side and the angle is starting so tangent 30 is equal to the opposite side which is H the height of the building divided by the adjacent side which is 800 so let's multiply both sides by 800 so these two will cancel therefore the height of the building is 800 times tangent of 30 degrees now tangent 30 is radical 3 radical 3 divided by 3 so the height of the building the exact answer is 800 root 3 divided by 3 if you want the decimal value oh by the way make sure your calculator is in degree mode 800 root 3 over 3 is about 460 
,,1.88 so that's how tall the building is by the way for those of you who are wondering why the exact value of tangent 30 is root 3 over 3 you can find this out using 
,,the 30-60-90 a reference angle or reference triangle across the 30 is 1 across the 60 is root 3 across the 90 is 2 perhaps you learned that in geometry so tangent 30 is equal to the opposite side which is 1 divided by the adjacent side relative to 30 which is root 3 now 1 over root 3 is the same as root 3 over 3 you need to rationalize the denominator so this becomes root 3 over 3 let's try this one calculate the angle of elevation measured from a point on the ground to a 50 foot tree that 
,,is 20 feet away from the tree now for all these problems typically you're going to draw some sort of right triangle so let's say this is the point at which we're going to measure the angle of elevation so let's call it theta so this is going to be the tree which the height of the tree we know it to be 50 feet and it's 20 feet away from the tree that's the point of interest so if we're given the height and the distance how can we calculate the angle of elevation what would you do to figure this out so again we need to use the tanjur a co tangent theta is 50 divided by 20 office --it divided by the adjacent side 50 over 20 is the same as 5 over 2 you can cancel the zeros and 5 divided by 2 is 2.5 so tangent theta is 2.5 but how can we find theta to find the angle theta you need to take the inverse tangent of 2.5 so 
,,if you type in inverse tan 2.5 you should get an answer of 68 point two degrees so that's what you need to do whenever you're looking for an angle you can use the inverse tan function inverse sine inverse cosine depending on what two sides of the triangle that you have here's another one for you a man on a 100 foot observation tower measures the angle of depression of a boat to be 10 degrees how far is the boat from the tower so let's say this is the tower I'm just going to draw just any type of shape and let's say this is the water and here's the boat so this is the horizontal line and here is the line of sight between the person in the tower and the 
,,boat so here's the triangle that we want to draw so the angle of depression is the angle that's below the horizontal line which is 10 degrees so that's the angle of 
,,depression the height of the observation tower is 100 feet now we're going to assume that the height of the boat is negligible our goal is to find out how far is the boat from the tower which is basically X so this side of the triangle is also X notice that we need to use the tangent ratio again tangent of 10 degrees is equal to the opposite side which is opposite to 10 is 100 divided by the adjacent side or the side next to 10 which is X so if we multiply both sides by X X 10 10 degrees is equal to 100 and if we divide both sides by 10 10 degrees X is 100 divided by tangent of 10 degrees so let's tangent of 10 degrees tangent of 10 degrees is about 0.1 seven six three three so 100 divided by that number is about five hundred sixty seven point one so that's how far away the boat is from the shoreline or from the observation tower it's five hundred sixty-seven feet away from them so to review whenever you're dealing with angle of elevation problems just remember the angle is above the horizontal line and for angle depression or I'm at st. angle of depression for those type of problems the angle is below the horizontal line so make sure you remember that whenever you solving these types of war problems so that is it for this video thanks for watching and have a great day

angles,gL3HxBQyeg0,et's find the volume of
,,a few more solid figures and then if we
,,"have time, we might be able to do some"
,,surface area problems. So let me draw a
,,cylinder over here. So that is the top
,,of my cylinder. And then this is the
,,height of my cylinder. This is the bottom
,,right over here. If this was
,,"transparent, maybe you could see the back"
,,side of the cylinder. So you could imagine this
,,kind of looks like a soda can. And let's say that the height of
,,"my cylinder, h, is equal to 8. I'll give it some units. 8 centimeters,"
,,that is my height. And then let's say
,,that the radius of one of the top of my
,,"cylinder of my soda can, let's say that this radius over"
,,here is equal to 4 centimeters. So what is the volume here? What is the volume going to be? And the idea here is
,,really the exact same thing that we saw in some of
,,the previous problems. If you can find the
,,surface area of one side and then figure out
,,"how deep it goes, you'll be able to"
,,figure out the volume. So what we're going to
,,do here is figure out the surface area of the
,,"top of this cylinder, or the top of the soda can. And then we're going to"
,,multiply it by its height. And that'll give us a volume. This will tell us
,,"essentially, how many square centimeters"
,,fit in this top. And then if we multiply
,,"that by how many centimeters we go down, then that'll"
,,give us the number of cubic centimeters in
,,this cylinder or soda can. So how do we figure
,,out this area up here? Well the area at the
,,"top, this is just finding the area of a circle. You could imagine"
,,drawing it like this. If we were to just
,,"look at it straight on, that's a circle with a"
,,radius of 4 centimeters. The area of a circle with a
,,"radius 4 centimeters, area is equal to pi r squared. So it's going to be pi"
,,"times the radius squared, times 4 centimeters squared,"
,,"which is equal to 4 squared, is 16, times pi. And our units now are going"
,,to be centimeters squared. Or another way to think of
,,these are square centimeters. So that's the area. The volume is going to be
,,this area times the height. So the volume is going
,,"to be equal to 16 pi centimeters squared, times the"
,,"height, times 8 centimeters. And so, when you"
,,"do multiplication, the associative"
,,"property, you can kind of rearrange these things, and"
,,the commutative property. It doesn't matter
,,what order you do it if it's all multiplication. So this is the same
,,thing as 16 times 8. Let's see. 8 times 8 is 64. 16 times 8 is twice that. So it's going to be 128 pi. Now you have centimeter
,,squared times centimeters. So that gives us
,,"centimeters cubed. Or 128 pi cubic centimeters. Remember, pi is just a number. We write it as pi,"
,,"because it's kind of a crazy, irrational number,"
,,"that if you were to write it, you could never"
,,completely write pi. 3.14159 keeps going
,,"on, never a repeat. So we just leave it as pi. But if you wanted to figure it"
,,"out, you can get a calculator. And this would be 3.14"
,,"roughly, times 128. So it would be close to"
,,"400 cubic centimeters. Now, how would we"
,,find the surface area? How would we find the surface
,,"area of this figure over here? Well, part of the surface area"
,,"of the two surfaces, the top and the bottom. So that would be part"
,,of the surface area. And then the bottom
,,over here would also be part of the surface area. So if we're trying to
,,"find the surface area, it's definitely going to have"
,,both of these areas here. So it's going to have the 16
,,pi centimeters squared twice. This is 16 pi. This is 16 pi
,,square centimeters. So it's going to have 2 times
,,16 pi centimeters squared. I'll keep the units still. So that covers the top and
,,the bottom of our soda can. And now we have to
,,figure out the surface area of this thing
,,that goes around. And the way I imagine
,,"it is, imagine if you're trying to wrap this"
,,thing with wrapping paper. So let me just draw a
,,little dotted line here. So imagine if you were
,,to cut it just like that. Cut the side of the soda can. And if you were to
,,"unwind this thing that goes around it,"
,,"what would you have. Well, you would have something. You would end up"
,,with a sheet of paper where this length
,,right over here is the same thing as
,,this length over here. And then it would be
,,completely unwound. And then these two
,,ends-- let me do it in magenta-- these two ends
,,used to touch each other. And-- I'm going to do it in a
,,"color that I haven't used yet, I'll do it in pink--"
,,these two ends used to touch each other when
,,it was all rolled together. And they used to touch each
,,other right over there. So the length of this
,,side and that side is going to be the same thing
,,as the height of my cylinder. So this is going to
,,be 8 centimeters. And then this over here is
,,also going to be 8 centimeters. And so the question
,,"we need to ask ourselves is, what is"
,,"going to be this dimension right over here. And remember, that"
,,"dimension is essentially, how far did we go"
,,"around the cylinder. Well, if you think"
,,"about it, that's going to be the exact same"
,,thing as the circumference of either the top or the
,,bottom of the cylinder. So what is the circumference? The circumference
,,"of this circle right over here, which is the same"
,,"thing as the circumference of that circle over there, it"
,,"is 2 times the radius times pi. Or 2 pi times the radius. 2 pi times 4 centimeters, which"
,,is equal to 8 pi centimeters. So this distance right over
,,here is the circumference of either the top or the
,,bottom of the cylinder. It's going to be
,,8 pi centimeters. So if you want to
,,"find the surface area of just the wrapping,"
,,"just the part that goes around the cylinder,"
,,"not the top or the bottom, when you unwind it, it's going"
,,"to look like this rectangle. And so its area, the"
,,"area of just that part, is going to be equal to"
,,8 centimeters times 8 pi centimeters. So let me do it this way. It's going to be 8 centimeters
,,times 8 pi centimeters. And that's equal to 64 pi. 8 times 8 is 64. You have your pi
,,centimeters squared. So when you want the surface
,,"area of the whole thing, you have the top,"
,,"you have the bottom, we already threw those there. And then you want to find"
,,the area of the thing around. We just figured that out. So it's going to be plus
,,64 pi centimeters squared. And now we just have
,,to calculate it. So this gives us 2 times 16
,,"pi, is going to be equal to 32. That is 32 pi centimeters"
,,"squared, plus 64 pi. Let me scroll over to"
,,the right a little bit. Plus 64 pi centimeters squared. And then 32 plus 64 is 96
,,pi centimeters squared. So it's equal to 96 pi
,,"square centimeters, which is going to be a little bit"
,,"over 300 square centimeters. And notice, when we"
,,"did surface area, we got our answer in terms"
,,"of square centimeters. That makes sense,"
,,"because surface area, it's a two-dimensional"
,,measurement. Think about how many
,,square centimeters can we fit on the surface
,,"of the cylinder. When we did the volume,"
,,"we got centimeters cubed, or cubic centimeters. And that's because we're"
,,trying to calculate how many one by one
,,by one centimeter cubes can we fit inside
,,of this structure. And so that's why it's
,,"cubic centimeters. Anyway, hopefully that clarifies"
,,things up a little bit.
,,
angles,AA6RfgP-AHU,In this video we're going
,,"to get introduced to the Pythagorean theorem,"
,,which is fun on its own. But you'll see as you learn
,,more and more mathematics it's one of those cornerstone
,,"theorems of really all of math. It's useful in geometry,"
,,it's kind of the backbone of trigonometry. You're also going to use
,,it to calculate distances between points. So it's a good thing to really
,,make sure we know well. So enough talk on my end. Let me tell you what the
,,"Pythagorean theorem is. So if we have a triangle, and"
,,"the triangle has to be a right triangle, which means that one"
,,of the three angles in the triangle have to be 90 degrees. And you specify that it's
,,90 degrees by drawing that little box right there. So that right there is-- let
,,"me do this in a different color-- a 90 degree angle. Or, we could call"
,,it a right angle. And a triangle that has
,,a right angle in it is called a right triangle. So this is called
,,"a right triangle. Now, with the Pythagorean"
,,"theorem, if we know two sides of a right triangle we can"
,,always figure out the third side. And before I show you how to
,,"do that, let me give you one more piece of terminology. The longest side of a right"
,,triangle is the side opposite the 90 degree angle-- or
,,opposite the right angle. So in this case it is
,,this side right here. This is the longest side. And the way to figure out where
,,"that right triangle is, and kind of it opens into"
,,that longest side. That longest side is
,,"called the hypotenuse. And it's good to know, because"
,,we'll keep referring to it. And just so we always are good
,,"at identifying the hypotenuse, let me draw a couple of"
,,more right triangles. So let's say I have a triangle
,,that looks like that. Let me draw it a
,,little bit nicer. So let's say I have a triangle
,,that looks like that. And I were to tell you
,,that this angle right here is 90 degrees. In this situation this is the
,,"hypotenuse, because it is opposite the 90 degree angle. It is the longest side. Let me do one more, just"
,,so that we're good at recognizing the hypotenuse. So let's say that that is my
,,"triangle, and this is the 90 degree angle right there. And I think you know how"
,,to do this already. You go right what
,,it opens into. That is the hypotenuse. That is the longest side. So once you have identified the
,,hypotenuse-- and let's say that that has length C. And now we're going to
,,learn what the Pythagorean theorem tells us. So let's say that C is equal to
,,the length of the hypotenuse. So let's call this
,,C-- that side is C. Let's call this side
,,right over here A. And let's call this
,,side over here B. So the Pythagorean theorem
,,tells us that A squared-- so the length of one of the
,,shorter sides squared-- plus the length of the other shorter
,,side squared is going to be equal to the length of
,,the hypotenuse squared. Now let's do that with an
,,"actual problem, and you'll see that it's actually not so bad. So let's say that I have a"
,,triangle that looks like this. Let me draw it. Let's say this is my triangle. It looks something like this. And let's say that they tell us
,,that this is the right angle. That this length right here--
,,let me do this in different colors-- this length right
,,"here is 3, and that this length right here is 4. And they want us to figure"
,,out that length right there. Now the first thing you want to
,,"do, before you even apply the Pythagorean theorem, is to"
,,make sure you have your hypotenuse straight. You make sure you know
,,what you're solving for. And in this circumstance we're
,,solving for the hypotenuse. And we know that because this
,,"side over here, it is the side opposite the right angle. If we look at the Pythagorean"
,,"theorem, this is C. This is the longest side. So now we're ready to apply"
,,the Pythagorean theorem. It tells us that 4 squared--
,,one of the shorter sides-- plus 3 squared-- the square of
,,another of the shorter sides-- is going to be equal to this
,,longer side squared-- the hypotenuse squared-- is going
,,to be equal to C squared. And then you just solve for C. So 4 squared is the same
,,thing as 4 times 4. That is 16. And 3 squared is the same
,,thing as 3 times 3. So that is 9. And that is going to be
,,equal to C squared. Now what is 16 plus 9? It's 25. So 25 is equal to C squared. And we could take the positive
,,"square root of both sides. I guess, just if you look at"
,,"it mathematically, it could be negative 5 as well. But we're dealing with"
,,"distances, so we only care about the positive roots. So you take the principal"
,,"root of both sides and you get 5 is equal to C. Or, the length of the"
,,"longest side is equal to 5. Now, you can use the"
,,"Pythagorean theorem, if we give you two of the sides, to figure"
,,out the third side no matter what the third side is. So let's do another
,,one right over here. Let's say that our
,,triangle looks like this. And that is our right angle. Let's say this side over here
,,"has length 12, and let's say that this side over"
,,here has length 6. And we want to figure out this
,,"length right over there. Now, like I said, the first"
,,thing you want to do is identify the hypotenuse. And that's going to be the side
,,opposite the right angle. We have the right angle here. You go opposite
,,"the right angle. The longest side, the"
,,"hypotenuse, is right there. So if we think about the"
,,Pythagorean theorem-- that A squared plus B squared is
,,equal to C squared-- 12 you could view as C. This is the hypotenuse. The C squared is the
,,hypotenuse squared. So you could say
,,12 is equal to C. And then we could say that
,,"these sides, it doesn't matter whether you call one of"
,,them A or one of them B. So let's just call
,,this side right here. Let's say A is equal to 6. And then we say B-- this
,,colored B-- is equal to question mark. And now we can apply the
,,"Pythagorean theorem. A squared, which is 6 squared,"
,,plus the unknown B squared is equal to the hypotenuse
,,squared-- is equal to C squared. Is equal to 12 squared. And now we can solve for B. And notice the difference here. Now we're not solving
,,for the hypotenuse. We're solving for one
,,of the shorter sides. In the last example we
,,solved for the hypotenuse. We solved for C. So that's why it's always
,,important to recognize that A squared plus B squared plus C
,,"squared, C is the length of the hypotenuse. So let's just solve for B here. So we get 6 squared is 36,"
,,"plus B squared, is equal to 12 squared-- this"
,,12 times 12-- is 144. Now we can subtract 36 from
,,both sides of this equation. Those cancel out. On the left-hand side we're
,,left with just a B squared is equal to-- now 144
,,minus 36 is what? 144 minus 30 is 114. And then you
,,"subtract 6, is 108. So this is going to be 108. So that's what B squared is,"
,,"and now we want to take the principal root, or the"
,,"positive root, of both sides. And you get B is equal"
,,"to the square root, the principal root, of 108. Now let's see if we can"
,,simplify this a little bit. The square root of 108. And what we could do is
,,we could take the prime factorization of 108
,,and see how we can simplify this radical. So 108 is the same thing as 2
,,"times 54, which is the same thing as 2 times 27, which is"
,,the same thing as 3 times 9. So we have the square root of
,,108 is the same thing as the square root of 2 times 2
,,"times-- well actually, I'm not done. 9 can be factorized"
,,into 3 times 3. So it's 2 times 2 times
,,"3 times 3 times 3. And so, we have a couple of"
,,perfect squares in here. Let me rewrite it a
,,little bit neater. And this is all an exercise in
,,simplifying radicals that you will bump into a lot while
,,"doing the Pythagorean theorem, so it doesn't hurt to"
,,do it right here. So this is the same thing as
,,the square root of 2 times 2 times 3 times 3 times the
,,"square root of that last 3 right over there. And this is the same thing. And, you know, you wouldn't"
,,"have to do all of this on paper. You could do it in your head. What is this? 2 times 2 is 4. 4 times 9, this is 36. So this is the square root of"
,,36 times the square root of 3. The principal root of 36 is 6. So this simplifies to
,,"6 square roots of 3. So the length of B, you could"
,,"write it as the square root of 108, or you could say it's"
,,"equal to 6 times the square root of 3. This is 12, this is 6. And the square root of 3,"
,,well this is going to be a 1 point something something. So it's going to be a
,,little bit larger than 6.
,,
angles,0gzSreH8nUI,Thought I would do some
,,"more example problems involving triangles. And so this first one, it says"
,,the measure of the largest angle in a triangle
,,is 4 times the measure of the second largest angle. The smallest angle
,,is 10 degrees. What are the measures
,,"of all the angles? Well, we know one of them. We know it's 10 degrees. Let's draw an arbitrary"
,,triangle right over here. So let's say that
,,is our triangle. We know that the smallest angle
,,"is going to be 10 degrees. And I'll just say,"
,,let's just assume that this right over here is the
,,measure of the smallest angle. It's 10 degrees. Now let's call the
,,second largest angle-- let's call that x. So the second largest
,,"angle, let's call that x. So this is going to be x. And then the first"
,,"sentence, they say the measure of the"
,,largest angle in a triangle is 4 times the measure of
,,the second largest angle. So the second
,,largest angle is x. 4 times that measure
,,is going to be 4x. So the largest angle
,,is going to be 4x. And so the one thing we
,,know about the measures of the angles
,,inside of a triangle is that they add
,,up to 180 degrees. So we know that 4x
,,plus x plus 10 degrees is going to be equal
,,"to 180 degrees. It's going to be equal to 180. And 4x plus x, that"
,,just gives us 5x. And then we have 5x plus
,,"10 is equal to 180 degrees. Subtract 10 from both sides. You get 5x is equal to 170. And so x is equal to 170/5. And let's see, it'll go into"
,,"it-- what is that, 34 times? Let me verify this. So 5 goes into-- yeah,"
,,it should be 34 times because it's going to go into
,,it twice as many times as 10 would go into it. 10 would go into 170 17 times. 5 would go into 170 34 times. So we could verify it. Go into 170. 5 goes into 17 three 
,,"times. 3 times 5 is 15. Subtract, you get 2. Bring down the 0. 5 goes into 20 four"
,,"times, and then you're not going to have a remainder. 4 times 5 is 20. No remainder. So it's 34 times. So x is equal to 34. So the second largest angle"
,,has a measure of 34 degrees. This angle up here is
,,going to be 4 times that. So 4 times 34--
,,"let's see, that's going to be 120 degrees"
,,"plus 16 degrees. This is going to be 136 degrees. Is that right? 4 times 4 is 16, 4 times"
,,"3 is 120, 16 plus 120 is 136 degrees. So we're done. The three measures, or the"
,,"sizes of the three angles, are 10 degrees, 34"
,,"degrees, and 136 degrees. Let's do another one. So let's see. We have a little bit"
,,of a drawing here. And what I want
,,to do is-- and we could think about
,,"different things. We could say, let's solve for x. I'm assuming that 4x is"
,,the measure of this angle. 2x is the measure of that
,,angle right over there. We can solve for x. And then if we know
,,"x, we can figure out what the actual measures"
,,"of these angles are, assuming that we"
,,can figure out x. And the other thing
,,that they tell us is that this line
,,"over here is parallel to this line over here. And it was very craftily drawn. Because it's parallel,"
,,"but one stops here, and then one starts up there. So the first thing"
,,I want to do-- if they're telling us that
,,"these two lines are parallel, there's probably going"
,,to be something involving transversals or something. It might be something
,,involving-- the other option is something
,,"involving triangles. And at first, you might"
,,"say, wait, is this angle and that angle vertical angles? But you have to be very careful. They are not. This is not the same line. This line is parallel"
,,"to that line. This line, it's bending"
,,"right over there, so we can't make any type"
,,of assumption like that. So the interesting
,,thing-- and I'm not sure if this will lead in
,,the right direction-- is to just make it
,,clear that these two are part of parallel lines. So I could continue this
,,line down like this. And then I can continue
,,this line up like that. And then that starts to look
,,a little bit more like we're used to when we're dealing
,,with parallel lines. And then this line
,,"segment, BC-- or we could even say line BC, if"
,,we were to continue it on. If we were to continue it
,,"on and on, even pass D, then this is clearly"
,,a transversal of those two parallel lines. This is clearly a transversal. And so if this angle
,,"right over here is 4x, it has a corresponding angle. Half of the-- or maybe most"
,,of the work on all of these is to try to see the parallel
,,lines and see the transversal and see the things that
,,might be useful for you. So that right there
,,is the transversal. These are the parallel lines. That's one parallel line. That is the other parallel line. You can almost try
,,to zone out all of the other stuff
,,in the diagram. And so if this angle
,,"right over here is 4x, it has a corresponding"
,,angle where the transversal intersects the
,,other parallel line. This right here is its
,,corresponding angle. So let me draw it
,,in that same yellow. This right over here is
,,a corresponding angle. So this will also be 4x. And we see that this angle--
,,"this angle and this angle, this angle that has measure"
,,4x and this angle that measures 2x-- we see that
,,they're supplementary. They're adjacent to each other. Their outer sides
,,"form a straight angle. So they're supplementary,"
,,which means that their measures
,,add up to 180 degrees. They kind of form-- they
,,go all the way around like that if you add the two
,,adjacent angles together. So we know that 4x plus 2x needs
,,"to be equal to 180 degrees, or we get 6x is"
,,"equal to 180 degrees. Divide both sides by 6. You get x is equal to 30,"
,,"or x is equal to-- well, I shouldn't say--"
,,"well, x could be 30. And then this angle right"
,,over here is 2 times x. So it's going to be 60 degrees. So this angle right over here
,,is going to be 60 degrees. And this angle right
,,"over here is 4 times x. So it is 120 degrees,"
,,and we're done.
,,
angles,NLg6hfoKKlE,Welcome back. We're almost done learning all
,,the rules or laws of angles that we need to start
,,playing the angle game. So let's just teach
,,you a couple of more. So let's say I have two
,,"parallel lines, and you may not know what a parallel line is"
,,and I will explain it to you now. So I have one line like this --
,,you probably have an intuition what a parallel line means. That's one of my parallel
,,"lines, and let me make the green one the other"
,,"parallel line. So parallel lines, and I'm"
,,just drawing part of them. We assume that they keep on
,,going forever because these are abstract notions -- this light
,,blue line keeps going and going on and on and on off the screen
,,and same for this green line. And parallel lines are two
,,lines in the same plane. And a plane is just kind of
,,you can kind of use like a flat surface is a plane. We won't go into
,,three-dimensional space in geometry class. But they're on the same plane
,,and you can view this plane as the screen of your computer
,,right now or the piece of paper you're working on that never
,,intersect each other and they're two separate lines. Obviously if they were drawn
,,on top of each other then they intersect each
,,other everywhere. So it's really just two
,,lines on a plane that never intersect each other. That's a parallel line. If you've already learned your
,,"algebra and you're familiar with slope, parallel lines are"
,,"two lines that have the same slope, right? They kind of increase or"
,,decrease at the same rate. But they have different
,,y intercepts. If you don't know what
,,"I'm talking about, don't worry about it. I think you know what a"
,,parallel line means. You've seen this -- parallel
,,"parking, what's parallel parking is when you park a car"
,,right next to another car without having the two cars
,,"intersect, because if the cars did intersect you would have to"
,,"call your insurance company. But anyway, so those"
,,are parallel lines. The blue and the green
,,lines are parallel. And I will introduce you to
,,a new complicated geometry term called a transversal. All a transversal is is
,,another line that actually intersects those two lines. That's a transversal. Fancy word for something
,,"very simple, transversal. Let me write it down just"
,,to write something down. Transversal. It crosses the other two lines. I was thinking of mnemonics
,,"for transversals, but I probably was thinking of"
,,things inappropriate. But anyway going on with the geometry. So we have a transversal
,,that intersects the two parallel lines. What we're going to do is think
,,of a bunch of -- and actually if it intersects one
,,of them it's going to intersect the other. I'll let you think about that. There's no way that I can draw
,,something that intersects one parallel line that doesn't
,,"intersect the other, as long as this line keeps going forever. I think that that might be"
,,pretty obvious to you. But what I want to do
,,is explore the angles of a transversal. So the first thing I'm
,,going to do is explore the corresponding angles. So let's say corresponding
,,angles are kind of the same angle at each of
,,"the parallel lines. That's how I think of them. So this angle, this angle,"
,,and this angle are corresponding angles. They kind of play the same
,,"role where the transversal intersects each of the lines. As you can imagine, and as it"
,,looks from my amazingly neat drawing -- I'm normally not
,,this good -- that these are going to be equal
,,"to each other. So if this is x, this"
,,is also going to be x. If we know that then we could
,,"use, actually the rules that we just learned to figure out"
,,everything else about all of these lines. Because if this is x then what
,,is this going to be right here? What is this angle going
,,"to be in magenta? Well, these are opposite"
,,"angles, right? They're on opposite"
,,side of crossing lines so this is also x. And similar we can do
,,the same thing here. This is the opposite angle of
,,"this angle, so this is also x. Let me pick a good color. What is yellow? What is this angle going to be? Well, just like we"
,,"were doing before. Look, we have this huge"
,,"angle here, right? This angle, this whole"
,,angle is 180 degrees. So x and this yellow angle are
,,"supplementary, so we could call this angle y, and this is"
,,"equal to 180 minus x, right? And we're just using"
,,"supplementary angles here. Well, if this angle is y, then"
,,"this angle is opposite to y. So this angle is also y. Fascinating. And similarly, if we have x up"
,,"here and x is supplementary to this angle as well, right? So this is equal to 180 minus"
,,"x where it also equals y. And then opposite angles,"
,,this is also equal to y. So there's all sorts of
,,"geometry words and rules that fall out of this, and I'll"
,,review them real fast but it's really nothing fancy. All I did is I started
,,"off with the notion of corresponding angles. I said well, this x"
,,"is equal to this x. I said, oh well, if those are"
,,"equal to each other, well not even if -- I mean if this is x"
,,"and this is also x because they're opposite, and the"
,,"same thing for this. Then, well, if this is x and"
,,"this is x and those equal each other, as they should"
,,because those are also corresponding angles. These two magenta angles
,,are playing the same role. They're both kind of
,,"the bottom left angle. That's how I think about it. We went around, we used"
,,"supplementary angles to kind of derive well, these y"
,,angles are also the same. This y angle is equal to
,,this y angle because they're corresponding. This y angle is equal to
,,this y angle because it's corresponding. So corresponding angles
,,"are equal to each other. It makes sense, they're kind"
,,"of playing the same role. The bottom right, if you look"
,,at the bottom right angle. So corresponding
,,angles are equal. That's my shorthand notation. And we've really just
,,derived everything already. That's all you really
,,have to know. But if you wanted to kind of
,,"skip a step, you also know the alternate interior"
,,angles are equal. So what do I mean by
,,"alternate interior angles? Well, the interior angles are"
,,kind of the angles that are closer to each other in the two
,,"parallel lines, but they're on opposite side of"
,,the transversal. That's a very complicated way
,,of saying this orange angle and this magenta angle right here. These are alternate interior
,,"angles, and we've already proved if this is"
,,x then that is x. So these are alternate
,,interior angles. This x and then that x
,,are alternate interior. And actually this y and this y
,,"are also alternate interior, and we already proved that"
,,they equal each other. Then the last term that you'll
,,see in geometry is alternate -- I'm not going to write the
,,whole thing -- alternate exterior angle. Alternate exterior
,,angles are also equal. That's the angles on the kind
,,"of further away from each other on the parallel lines, but"
,,they're still alternate. So an example of that is this x
,,"up here and this x down here, right, because they're on the"
,,"outsides of the two parallel lines, right -- one's on"
,,"top, one's on bottom. Then they're on opposite"
,,"sides, on alternate sides, of the transversal. These are just fancy words,"
,,but I think hopefully you have the intuition. Corresponding a angles make
,,the most sense to me. Then everything else proves out
,,just through opposite angles and supplementary angles. But alternate exterior is
,,that angle and that angle. Then the other alternate
,,"exterior is this y and this y. Those are also equal. So if you know these, you know"
,,pretty much everything you need to know about parallel lines. The last thing I'm going to
,,teach you in order to play the geometry game with full force
,,is just that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. So let me just draw a
,,"triangle, a kind of random looking triangle. That's my random"
,,"looking triangle. And if this is x, this"
,,"is y, and this is z. We know that the angles of a"
,,triangle -- x degrees plus y degrees plus z degrees are
,,equal to 180 degrees. So if I said that this is
,,"equal to, I don't know, 30 degrees, this is equal to,"
,,"I don't know, 70 degrees. Then what does z equal? Well, we would say 30 plus 70"
,,"plus z is equal to 180, or 100 plus z is equal to 180. Subtract 100 from both sides. z would be equal to 80 degrees. We'll see variations of this"
,,where you get two of the angles and you can use this property
,,to figure out the third. With everything we've now
,,"learned, I think we're ready to kind of ease"
,,into the angle game. I'll see you in the next video.
,,
angles,XiAoUDfrar0,- [Voiceover] What I hope to
,,introduce you to in this video is the notion of a
,,"transformation in mathematics, and you're probably used to"
,,the word in everyday language. Transformation means
,,"something is changing, it's transforming from"
,,one thing to another. What would transformation mean
,,"in a mathematical context? Well, it could mean that"
,,"you're taking something mathematical and you're changing it into something else mathematical,"
,,"that's exactly what it is. It's talking about taking a set of coordinates or a set of points, and then changing them"
,,into a different set of coordinates or a
,,"different set of points. For example, this right over here, this is a quadrilateral we've plotted it on the coordinate plane. This is a set of points,"
,,not just the four points that represent the vertices
,,"of the quadrilateral, but all the points along the sides too. There's a bunch of points along this. You could argue there's an infinite, or there are an infinite number of points along this quadrilateral. This right over here, the point X equals 0, y equals negative four, this is a point on the quadrilateral. Now, we can apply a"
,,"transformation to this, and the first one I'm going"
,,"to show you is a translation, which just means moving all the points in the same direction, and the same amount in"
,,"that same direction, and I'm using the Khan Academy"
,,"translation widget to do it. Let's translate, let's translate this, and I can do it by grabbing"
,,"onto one of the vertices, and notice I've now shifted"
,,"it to the right by two. Every point here, not"
,,"just the orange points has shifted to the right by two. This one has shifted to the right by two, this point right over here has"
,,"shifted to the right by two, every point has shifted"
,,"in the same direction by the same amount, that's"
,,"what a translation is. Now, I've shifted, let's see"
,,"if I put it here every point has shifted to the right one and up one, they've all shifted by the same amount in the same directions. That is a translation,"
,,but you could imagine a translation is not the
,,"only kind of transformation. In fact, there is an unlimited variation, there's an unlimited number"
,,"different transformations. So, for example, I could do a rotation. I have another set of points here that's represented by quadrilateral, I guess we could call it CD or"
,,"BCDE, and I could rotate it, and I rotate it I would"
,,"rotate it around the point. So for example, I could"
,,"rotate it around the point D, so this is what I started with, if I, let me see if I can do this, I could rotate it like,"
,,actually let me see. So if I start like this I
,,"could rotate it 90 degrees, I could rotate 90 degrees,"
,,"so I could rotate it, I could rotate it like, that looks pretty close to a 90-degree rotation. So, every point that was on the original or in the original set of    "
,,points I've now shifted it relative to that point
,,"that I'm rotating around. I've now rotated it 90 degrees, so this point has now mapped"
,,to this point over here. This point has now mapped
,,"to this point over here, and I'm just picking the"
,,"vertices because those are a little bit easier to think about. This point has mapped to this point. The point of rotation, actually, since D is actually the point of rotation that one actually has not shifted, and just 'til you get some terminology, the set of points after you"
,,apply the transformation this is called the image
,,"of the transformation. So, I had quadrilateral BCDE, I applied a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation around the point D, and so this new set of"
,,points this is the image of our original quadrilateral
,,"after the transformation. I don't have to just, let me undo this, I don't have to rotate"
,,around just one of the points that are on the original set
,,"that are on our quadrilateral, I could rotate around, I could"
,,"rotate around the origin. I could do something like that. Notice it's a different rotation now. It's a different rotation. I could rotate around any point. Now let's look at another transformation, and that would be the"
,,"notion of a reflection, and you know what reflection"
,,"means in everyday life. You imagine the reflection of an image in a mirror or on the water, and that's exactly what"
,,"we're going to do over here. If we reflect, we reflect across"
,,"a line, so let me do that. This, what is this one,"
,,"two, three, four, five, this not-irregular"
,,"pentagon, let's reflect it. To reflect it, let me actually, let me actually make a line like this. I could reflect it across"
,,"a whole series of lines. Woops, let me see if I can, so"
,,"let's reflect it across this. Now, what does it mean to"
,,"reflect across something? One way I imagine is if this was, we're going to get its mirror image, and you imagine this"
,,as the line of symmetry that the image and the
,,original shape they should be mirror images across
,,"this line we could see that. Let's do the reflection. There you go, and you see"
,,"we have a mirror image. This is this far away from the line. This, its corresponding point in the image is on the other side of the"
,,line but the same distance. This point over here is
,,"this distance from the line, and this point over here"
,,"is the same distance but on the other side. Now, all of the transformations"
,,"that I've just showed you, the translation, the"
,,"reflection, the rotation, these are called rigid transformations. Once again you could just think about what does rigid mean in everyday life? It means something that's not flexible. It means something that you can't stretch or scale up or scale down it"
,,"kind of maintains its shape, and that's what rigid transformations are fundamentally about. If you want to think a little"
,,"bit more mathematically, a rigid transformation is one in which lengths and angles are preserved. You can see in this"
,,transformation right over here the distance between this
,,"point and this point, between points T and R, and the difference between"
,,"their corresponding image points, that distance is the same. The angle here, angle R, T, Y, the measure of this angle over here, if you look at the"
,,corresponding angle in the image it's going to be the same angle. The same thing is true if
,,you're doing a translation. You could imagine these are
,,"acting like rigid objects. You can't stretch them,"
,,they're not flexible they're maintaining their shape. Now what would be examples
,,of transformations that are not rigid transformations? Well you could imagine
,,"scaling things up and down. If I were to scale this out where it has maybe the angles are preserved, but the lengths aren't preserved that would not be a rigid transformation. If I were to just stretch one side of it, or if I were to just pull"
,,this point while the other points stayed where they
,,are I'd be distorting it or stretching it that would
,,"not be a rigid transformation. So hopefully this gets you, it's actually very, very interesting. When you use an art program, or actually you use a"
,,"lot of computer graphics, or you play a video game, most of what the video game is doing is"
,,"actually doing transformations. Sometimes in two dimensions,"
,,"sometimes in three dimensions, and once you get into more advanced math, especially things like linear"
,,"algebra, there's a whole field that's really focused"
,,"around transformations. In fact, some of the computers with really good graphics processors, a graphics processor is"
,,"just a piece of hardware that is really good at performing mathematical transformations, so that you can immerse yourself in a 3D reality or whatever else. This is really really interesting stuff."

angles,il0EJrY64qE,hat I wanna
,,do in this video is give an introduction to the language
,,or some of the characters that we use when we talk about geometry. And I guess the best place to start is to even think about
,,"what geometry means, 'cause you might recognize"
,,the first part of geometry. Right over here you
,,"have the root word geo, the same word that you see in things like geography and geology, and this refers to the earth. This refers, my E look"
,,"like a C right over there, this refers to the earth. And then you see this metry part. And you see metry in things"
,,"like trigonometry as well. And metry, or the metric system, and this comes from measurement. This comes from measurement,"
,,"or measure, measurement. So when someone's talking about geometry, the word itself comes"
,,"from earth measurement and that's kind of not so bad of a name, because it is such a general subject. Geometry really is the study"
,,and trying to understand how shapes and space and things that we see
,,"relate to each other. So, you know, when you start"
,,"learning about geometry, you learn about lines"
,,and triangles and circles and you learn about angles and we'll define all of these
,,"things more and more precisely as we go further and further on, but it also encapsulate"
,,"things like patterns and three-dimensional shapes,"
,,"so it's almost everything that we see, all of the"
,,"visually mathematical things that we understand can in some way be categorized in geometry. Now, with that out of the way, let's just start from the basics, a basic "
,,"starting point from geometry, and then we can just grow from there. So if we just start at a dot. That dot right over there is just a point, it's just that little point on"
,,that screen right over there. We literally call that a point. And I'll call that a definition. And the fun thing about mathematics is that you can make definitions. 
,,"We could have called this an armadillo, but we decided to call this a point, which I think makes sense because"
,,"it's what we would call it in just everyday language as well. That is a point. Now, what's interesting about a point is that it is just a position that you can't move on a point. If you were on this point and you moved in any direction at all,"
,,"you would no longer be at that point, so you"
,,"cannot move on a point. Now, there are differences between points, for example, that's one point there. Maybe I have another point over here and then I have another "
,,point over here and then another point over there. And you want to be able to
,,"refer to the different points, and not everyone has the luxury of a nice, colored pen like I do, otherwise they could"
,,"refer to the green point or the blue point or the pink point, and so in geometry, to refer to points, we tend to give them labels, and the labels tend to have letters. So, for example, this could be point A, this could be point B,"
,,"this would be point C, and this right over here could be point D. So if someone says, ""Hey, circle point C,"" you know which one to circle. You know that you would have to circle that point right over there. Well, that so far, it's"
,,"kind of interesting. You have these things called points. You really can't move around on a point, all they do is specify a position. What if we wanna move"
,,around a little bit more? What if we wanna get from
,,one point to another? So what if we started at one point and we wanted all of the
,,"points, including that point that connect that point and another point? So all of these points right over here. So what would we call this thing, all of the points that connect"
,,"A and B along a straight, and I'll use everyday language here, along kind of a straight line like this? Well, we'll call this a line segment. In everyday language,  "
,,"you might call it a line, but we'll call it a line segment, 'cause we'll see when we"
,,"talk in mathematical terms, a line means something slightly different. So this is a line segment. And if we were to connect D and C, this would also be another      "
,,"line segment, a line segment. And once again, because"
,,"we always don't have the luxury of colors, this one is clearly the"
,,orange line segment. This is clearly the yellow line segment. We want to have labels
,,for these line segments. And the best way to
,,"label the line segments are with its endpoints, and"
,,"that's another word here. So a point is just literally A or B, but A and B are also the"
,,"endpoints of these line segments, 'cause it starts and ends at A and B. So let me write this A and B. A and B are endpoints, another"
,,"definition right over here. Once again, we could have"
,,"called them aardvarks or end armadillos, but"
,,"we, as mathematicians, decided to call them endpoints, because that seems to"
,,"be a good name for it. And once again, we need a way"
,,"to label these line segments that have the endpoints, and what's a better way"
,,to label a line segment than with its actual endpoints? So we would refer to this
,,"line segment, over here, we would put its endpoints there. And to show that it's a line segment, we would draw a line"
,,"over it, just like that. This line segment down here,"
,,we would write it like this. And we could have just as
,,"easily written it like this, CD with a line over it would have referred to that same line segment. BA, BA with a line over it would refer to that same line segment. "
,,"And now you might be saying, ""Well, I'm not satisfied just"
,,"traveling in between A and B."" And this is actually"
,,"another interesting idea. When you were just on A,"
,,"when you were just on a point and you couldn't travel at all, you couldn't travel at"
,,"all in any direction while staying on that point, that means you have zero"
,,"options to travel in. You can't go up or down, left or right, in or out of the page and"
,,still be on that point. And so that's why we say a
,,"point has zero dimensions, zero dimensions. Now all of the sudden we have this thing, this line segment here,"
,,"and this line segment, we can at least go to the left and the right along this line segment. We can go towards A or towards B. So we can go back or"
,,"forward in one dimension. So the line segment is a one-dimensional, it is a one-dimensional idea almost, or a one-dimensional object, although these are more        "
,,kind of abstract ideas. There is no such thing as
,,"a perfect line segment, because a line segment,"
,,"you can't move up or down on this line segment while being on it, while in reality, anything that"
,,"we think is a line segment, even you know, a stick of some type, a very straight stick,"
,,"or a string that is taut, that still will have some width, but the geometrical pure"
,,"line segment has no width, it only has a length here. So you can only move along the line, and that's why we it's one-dimensional. A point, you can't move at all. A "
,,"line segment, you can only"
,,"move in that back and forth along that same direction. Now, I just hinted that it"
,,"can actually have a length. How do you refer to that? Well, you refer to that by"
,,not writing that line on it. So if I write AB with a
,,"line on top of it like that, that means I'm referring"
,,"to the actual line segment. If I say that, let me"
,,"do this in a new color, if I say that AB is equal to five units, it might be centimeters,"
,,"or meters, or whatever, just the abstract units five, that means that the distance"
,,"between A and B is five, that the length of line"
,,"segment AB is actually five. Now, let's keep on extending it. Let's say we wanna just"
,,"keep going in one direction. So let's say that I start at A, let me do this in a new color, let's say I start at"
,,"A and I wanna go to D, but I want the option of keep"
,,"on, I wanna keep on going, so I can't go further"
,,"in A's direction than A, but I can go further in D's direction. So this little, this"
,,"idea that I just showed, essentially, it's like a like segment, but I can keep on going"
,,"past this endpoint, we call this a ray. And the starting point for"
,,"a ray is called the vertex, not a term that you'll see too often. You'll see vertex later"
,,"on in other contexts, but it's good to know, this"
,,"is the vertex of the ray. It's not the vertex of this line segment, so maybe I shouldn't"
,,"label it just like that. And what's interesting about a ray, it's once again a one-dimensional figure, but you could keep on going"
,,"in one of the (murmurs), you can keep on going to or"
,,past one of the endpoints. And the way that we would
,,"specify a ray is we would say, we would call it AD and we"
,,"would put this little arrow over on top of it to show that is a ray. And in this case, it matters the order that we put the letters in. If I put DA as a ray, this   "
,,"would mean a different ray. That would mean that we're stating at D and then we're going past A, so this is not ray DA, this is ray AD. Now, the last idea that I'm  "
,,"sure you're thinking about is, well, what if I could keep"
,,"on going in both directions? So let's say I can keep going in, let me, my diagram is getting messy. So let me introduce some more points. So let's say I have point E and then I have point F right over here. And let's say that I have this object that goes through both E and F, but just keeps on going"
,,"in both directions. This is, when we talk in geometry terms, this is what we call a line. Now, notice, a line never ends. You can keep going in either direction. A line segment does end, it"
,,"has endpoints, a line does not. And actually, a line segment"
,,"can sometimes be called just a segment. And so you would specify line EF, you would specify line EF with these arrows just like that. Now, the thing that you're     "
,,gonna see most typically when we're studying geometry
,,"are these right over here, because we're gonna be"
,,"concerned with sides of shapes, distances between points. And when you're talking"
,,"about any of those things, things that have finite length, things that have an actual length, things that don't go off forever"
,,"in one or two directions, then you are talking about"
,,"a segment or a line segment. Now, if we go back to a line segment, just to kind of keep"
,,"talking about new words that you might confront in geometry. If we go back talking about a line, that time I was drawing a ray, so let's say I have point X and point Y. And so this is line segment XY, so I could denote it just like that. If I have another point,"
,,"let's say I have another point right over here, let's call that point Z, and I'll introduce another word, X, Y, and Z are on the same, they all lie on the same line "
,,if you would imagine that
,,"a line could keep going on and on forever and ever. So we can say that X,"
,,"Y, and Z are colinear. So those three points are"
,,"co, they are colinear. They all sit on the same line and they also all sit on line segment XY. Now, let's say we know, we're told that XZ is equal to ZY and they are all colinear. So that means this is"
,,telling us that the distance between X and Z is the same as
,,the distance between Z and Y. So sometimes we can mark it like that. This distance is the same
,,as that distance over there. So that tells us that Z is
,,exactly halfway between X and Y. So in this situation we
,,"would call Z the midpoint, the midpoint of line segment XY, 'cause it's exactly halfway between. Now, to finish up, we've"
,,"talked about things that have zero dimensions, points. We've talked about things that"
,,"have one dimension, a line, a line segment, or a ray. You might say, well,"
,,"what has two dimensions? Well, in order to have two dimensions, that means I can go backwards and forwards in two different directions. So this page right here, or this video, or this screen that you're looking at is a two-dimensional object. I can go right, left,"
,,"that is one dimension, or I can go up, down. And so this surface of the"
,,monitor you're looking at is actually two
,,"dimensions, two dimensions. You can go backwards or"
,,forwards in two directions. And things that are two
,,"dimensions, we call them planar, or we call them planes. So if you took a piece of"
,,"paper that extended forever, it just extended in"
,,"every direction forever, that in a geometrical sense was a plane. The piece of paper itself,"
,,"the thing that's finite, and you'll never see this talked about in a typical geometry class, but I guess if we were"
,,"to draw the analogy, you could call a piece of"
,,"paper maybe a plane segment, because it's a segment of an entire plane. If you had a third dimension,"
,,"then you're talking about kind of our three-dimensional space. In three-dimensional space, not only could you move left"
,,"or right along the screen, or up and down, you could also move in and our of the screen. You could also have this"
,,dimension that I'll try to draw. You could go into the screen or you could go out of
,,the screen like that. And as we go into higher
,,"and higher mathematics, although it becomes"
,,"very hard to visualize, you'll see that we can"
,,even start to study things that have more than three dimensions
,,
angles,ndqxxAUDF5Y,in this lesson we're going to talk about the exterior angle theorem that is the exterior angle of a triangle is the sum of the two remote interior angles so let's use an example to illustrate this so here's a triangle let's do that again and let's say this angle is 40 and this angle is 60 what is the value of this angle now before we find the answer let's call this angle one two three and four angle 4 is outside of the triangle so it's the exterior angle exterior means it's on the outside angles one two and three are the interior angles because they're inside of the triangle however one and two are known as the remote interior angles and three is just 
,,an interior angle so the exterior angle number four is the sum of the remote interior angles that's the sum of angle one and two so in this case we could say that Y 
,,the exterior angle is the sum of these two remote interior angles forty plus 60 and so Y is a hundred degrees now we know that the three angles in a triangle must add up to 180 so if we call this X we can say that X plus 40 plus 60 has to add up to 180 forty plus 60 is a hundred and 180 minus 100 is eighty so X is eighty now notice that these two they form a linear pair so X plus y adds up to 180 80 plus 100 180 anytime you have a linear pair it always adds up to 180 degrees so let's work on some other example problems so let's say if this is 40 this is X and let's say this is 110 and this is y calculate the value of x and y feel free to pause the video so we know that Y the exterior angle is the sum of the remote interior angles so we could say that Y is 40 plus X and also notice that 110 and why they form a linear pair so they add up to 180 so we could easily find the value of y so if we subtract both sides by 110 we can see that Y is 180 minus 110 or 70 degrees now with that we could calculate the value of x so 70 minus 40 is 30 so X is equal to 30 degrees let's try another example so let's say this is 10x plus 40 let's say that here 
,,we have 6x Plus 8 and it says 9x minus 3 now let's call this angle 1 angle to angle 3 and angle 4 so what I want you to do in this problem is that I want you to first calculate the value of X and then use that to find the value of each angle so go ahead and pause the video and try this problem now according to the exterior angle theorem the exterior angle is the sum of the remote interior angles so the exterior angle 10x plus 40 is the sum of 9 X minus 3 and 6 X plus 8 so now let's solve first let's combine like terms on the right side so 9x plus 6x that's 15 X and then negative 3 plus 8 that's positive 5 and on the left we have 10 X plus 40 now let's 
,,subtract both sides by 10x and at the same time unless subtract both sides by 5 so we could cancel these 40 minus 5 is 35 and 15 X minus 10 X is 5x so now let's divide both sides by 5 35 divided by 5 is 7 and so that is the x value to this problem so now that we have the value of x we can calculate the value of each angle so angle 1 is 6 X plus 8 so let's replace X with 7 now let's calculate the value 6 times 7 is 42 and 42 plus 8 is 50 degrees so that's the value of angle 1 now let's move 
,,on to angle 2 so that's 9 X minus 3 so 9 times 7 minus 3 9 times 7 is 63 63 minus 3 is 60 now angle 3 notice that angle 1 plus angle 2 plus angle 3 has to add up to 
,,180 those are the three angles of the triangle so angle 3 is going to be 180 minus the other two angles - angle 1 and - angle 2 so that's 180 - 50 - 60 so 180 minus 
,,50 is 130 and 130 minus 60 is 70 so that's the value of angle 3 now angle 4 is 10x plus 40 so that's 10 times 7 plus 40 and 10 times 7 is 70 70 plus 40 is 110 and so we can see that angle 4 is the sum of angle 1 and 250 plus 60 is 110 let's work on one more problem so let's say let's call this angle a B let's say this is C and this is D so angle a we're gonna say it's 8x plus 10 and B let's say it's x squared plus 5 let's say BCD is 16x what is the measure of angle C go ahead and work on its problem so before we can find the measure of angle C we need to calculate the value of x so using the exterior angle theorem the exterior angle 16x is the sum of the remote interior angles x squared plus 5 and 8 X plus 10 so let's combine like terms on the right side we have x squared plus 8x and we can combine 5 and 10 which 
,,is 15 now all we need to do at this point is subtract both sides by 16 or 16 X rather and we could have a quadratic equation in standard form so 8x minus 16x is a negative 8x so how can we solve this quadratic equation in order to solve it we need to factor it what two numbers multiplied to the constant term 15 but adds the middle coefficient negative 8 so there's two numbers that we need to worry about 3 and 5 3 times 5 is 15 the 3 plus 5 is positive 8 but we can make them both negative because they still multiply to positive 15 so if the factor it's gonna be X minus 3 times X minus 5 now at this point you need to set each factor equal to 0 so X minus 3 equals 0 and X minus 5 is equal to 0 so if we add 3 to both sides one possible answer that we can have is X is equal to 3 and if we add 5 to both sides it's the other possible answer is X can equal 5 so I'm just gonna write that over here so let's start with the first possible answer if X is equal to 3 so Anglesey it's gonna 
,,be 16 times 3 which is 48 and angle B is gonna be 3 squared plus 5 3 squared is 9 plus 5 that's 14 angle a it's gonna be 8 times 3 plus 10 8 times 3 is 24 24 plus 10 is 34 and so and then angle C is basically well angle C and angle the 16x angle they have to add up to 180 so we can say that angle C is 180 minus 16 X or minus minus 48 I need to distinguish these two angles so let me adjust their names because they can't both be angle C so this is gonna be angle D CB and this is the angle that we're looking for and that is angle a CB so ACB this angle that's 180 minus 48 which is 132 and so one possible answer for the value of C which I specify which C this is mean in B CA or ACB is 132 degrees now let's calculate the other possible angle so if X is equal to 5 so DC be this angle that's gonna be 16 times 5 which is 
,,80 and then we have angle B which is x squared plus five so that's gonna be five squared plus five 5 squared is 25 plus five that's 30 degrees and then angle a 8x plus 10 or 8 times 5 plus 10 so that's gonna be 40 plus 10 so 50 degrees and then finally ACB that's 180 minus DC B so minus 80 which will give us a hundred so we have two possible answers it could be 132 or it could be a hundred and so we're gonna stop here so that's it for the exterior angle theorem so now you know what it is and now you know how to use it to solve missing angles and calculating the value of x thanks for watching
